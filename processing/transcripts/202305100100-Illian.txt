Right. So as I said, lots of reflection, thinking about what we've been doing, what have been doing, and what we kind of might want to be doing as a community. So those of you who have seen some of the work, I'm aware of some of my work, I've done a lot of applied work and I've talked a lot about realistically complex models, so models that are actually complex enough that they become relevant in practice. And I've looked at a lot of examples. And I've looked at a lot of examples. I've seen work on cancer cells, work on plants, raincross trees, and animals. This is an example of the Block Nest monster that some of you will have seen as well and talk about. Earthquakes, terrorist attacks, so lots of very different applications. You will have spotted. I've done quite a lot of compact statistics here, and you will have spotted that most of this is on spatial point sources, and I've not entirely focused on this, but you've got. Entirely focused on this, but you probably as known for my work on coin processes. So a lot of the work that I've been doing has to do with important issues of today's society, biodiversity loss, hazards, climate change in the widest sense, and as I said, maybe based on station point processes. Not so much on extremes, but there might be something coming in the future, and I'll allude to this in one of the slides, I think. In one of the slides, I think. But I've also been kind of thinking about has this been enough? And I think this talk is about has this been enough in various senses, of course, you can always work. And a little bit of motivation for this will come in the next few slides. So, but I talk a little bit. I mean, I know that I think the majority in the room are not experts on point processes. I'm not going to talk about the technical background, but more like a bit. Background, but more like a bit of the history, and again, not naming numbers in terms of years and whatever, but of the kind of background point process. So, point processes have come and developed a lot out of stochastic geometry with an interest in understanding interesting geometric structures, which is very mathematical and very interesting to do. But of course, when you're looking at point processes as realizations of natural phenomena, there's more an interest in kind of looking at. There's more an interest in kind of looking at scientific questions. So, the statistical modeling of point processes that are available in practice actually looks at data that are relevant for scientific questions and not interesting in terms of their geometric structure. They might have a geometric structure, but it's not that the beauty of that geometric structure or whatever that is of interest. And of course, that is, these are very different aims. So, over the years, my focus has been to kind of My kind of focus has been to kind of look more at the right-hand side of this slide and kind of thinking about what methodology do we need or should we develop so that we can actually ask and answer scientific questions. So in the past, when the point process methodology developed initially, a lot of the patterns people looked at were kind of small, and I have the small and merky commas here, which is small in many ways, and viewpoints on small areas, kind of homogeneous, but nothing kind of big, very exciting. With nothing very exciting going on, and it's still mathematically extremely complex. I'm playing this down a little bit here. All the math is in the background, it's actually very theoretical when you look at the math. And often the observation windows were rectangular, square, so kind of all neat. And of course, this is different, as we will see in a few minutes. There were no issues with detection, people always assumed they've seen all the points. That wasn't really questioned in the context. And very often, people mainly looked at. Very often point in people mainly look at spatial point patterns, small ones. In practice, when I talk about my realistically complex data, the point patterns are not really not small, and again, I mean being small in various ways, homogeneous. And so, what I've been working on is kind of taking methodology away from this or moving it on from there, saying, not saying, we should stay with this. We should stay with this. Initially, I published a book in 2008, but some of the points as kind of gurus of the past who were interested actually in the applications as well, very much, I don't have a citation here. But also, following that, we've started developing our methodology in the context of INLA, in particular, where we could develop computationally efficient methodologies. Computationally efficient methodologies. The other problem with point-process models was that they are very computation-complying in a way. So we developed computationally efficient models that could actually look at complex models, bigger ones in many senses look at marked point processes. We could look at point processes that have been observed and large and complex domains here, taking into account a lot of the Ross Finn's SPV approach work. Um, SPDE approach work and extensions of this, and we've applied this in a number of contexts. Again, these are not an exhaustive list of citations, sure. Many of you will see potential other citations that could be brought in here. We have been looking and spending a lot of time on complex observation processes, or observation processes where you don't necessarily see all the points where some of, say, the animals are not being detected because they're currently underwater or they're small. Underwater, or they're small and just been missing. So, and now, context of preferential sampling as well. This isn't always moving. So, we've developed methodology that accounts for observation processes. I will be talking about InlaVloux very briefly, and one who yesterday mentioned that as well. So, Inla Vlu has a large part in that element. It also applies, please. Good. And yeah, please came out to live into nature time. So, this is just going through the points I made earlier. Time, so this is just going through the points I made earlier and kind of extending and generalizing this. But a few minutes ago, I said, Okay, like you know, this is quite a lot actually. So, I always kind of felt, oh, yeah, I've moved the field quite far. But then, something, well, oh, sorry, these were very strongly interdisciplinary projects that I should have added. That's most of this was motivated by applications and has been very applied. So, then something happened. The first thing that happened is something. The first thing that happened is something that happened to all of us. You probably guessed what it was, but this thing doesn't move. COVID happened, and I'm sure you've all talked about lots of talks about COVID, so I'm not really saying much about COVID. We all know what happened in a sense. What I'm actually going to talk about very briefly is what happened locally when I worked in Glasgow. The Scottish COVID Response Consortium came up where people just put together all their Where people just put together all they had in terms of knowledge and teamed up. And there's nothing significant about the end of June. It's just one of the days we met at this consortium, we had lots of discussions, we met quite frequently. And if one of you thinks we spent time coming up with this picture, although this was also reused from the previous grant application, it wasn't successful. So everything that, you know, people just took all their hats and put it together to actually do something and practice at very kind of then there and then without kind of competing. And then, without kind of competing, and whatever. I could go on about this forever, given talks about that specific topic, actually. But that was just like one of the kind of important things I took from this crisis. Good, that all doesn't really fit into spatial controls this morning very much. We actually looked at, we have a, but I don't want to go into detail here. Anyway, good, another thing happened. And some of you might wonder, why is she showing you a picture of a little person in what looks like Person in what looks like a British school uniform wearing a yellow thing with a point pattern on it. If you wonder about the algorithm that simulates this point pattern, it was an ABC algorithm, a famous potato technique, just if you wonder. And you might wonder why I have an ABC algorithm. I'm guessing there are at least two people in the room who have an answer to this. There are at least two people in the room who have an answer to this. What's the yellow thing? No? No. No divers in the room who know what the yellow thing is. The thing you get in your school? Yeah, it's a stay at school. Anyway, so in general, every child gets a thing here. It's got a full treatise with a bag with lots of sweets and stuff in it. Again, you might wonder why everyone. Again, you might wonder why we might show you a picture of my son, that's my son, on his first day of school. Yeah, there's usually slightly more in the picture than meets the guy when you first look at it. The first thing you'll probably notice there are trees in this picture. And if I took a photo of him in the same place, maybe without the bag now, one of the trees would be missing. There was a severe storm just one and a half years after this. The tree came down. And the tree came down. You can't see this right in the picture. Probably also see that the ground there is a little bit more muddy than you would expect on a day in August. It's very difficult to spot, but there was a very severe weather event on this day. So slightly coming into the extremes here. And so the other thing, apart from my son's first day of school, that is probably not very exciting to most of you, that happened on that day was this. So there was a train disaster. Train disaster in Scotland. I guess hardly anyone probably has heard about this train disaster. It looks not really good. It was caused by a landslide, another extreme event caused by this extreme rain. My son's school started an hour later. Again, not very relevant because there was so much rain that he could get to work. And as you can see, it was a severe disaster. It's probably not very well known. Probably not very well known because not many people actually lost their lives in it. Only half the people on the train, three. So there were only six people on the train because this was in 2020 and people didn't travel by train. Otherwise, it probably would have become more well-known. And yeah, unfortunately, it probably would have caused more. But the other thing where I'm talking about is that actually happened very close to where I live. So I live in, I don't know. So I live in. I don't know where that kind of thing is. I live in this place called Inverbervi, and the train disaster happened roughly here. The train line isn't visible in this map. I should have actually been on that train. So it's a train route I've taken hundreds of times. So somehow, when you know a landslide, we don't really talk much about landslides. I've not really had any experience, but I could have easily met my deaths and it wouldn't be surprising. Easily met my desk, and they wouldn't be supposed to see Hannah V on this train. It's a very common route for us to take. Anyway, why am I talking about train disasters? It's a bit more the topic of kind of hitting close to home or hitting home in a more general sense. So ignore these kind of things, the severe weather events in terms of the storm and the landslide are caused by rain or landslides are caused by rain. Final weather that's less abstract than the kind of applied things. Than the kind of applied things I've been working on. I mean, of course, rainforests are not really abstract, but they are not very much in my kind of experience. I've been in one actually twice. But still, they are still a little bit abstract. And a lot of the times when we talk about applications, we kind of use them as buzzwords. Oh, nowadays we need to work on whatever means. That's where funding comes from. But these are kind of. And but these are kind of events that impact everyone, more or less, and everyone locally in some sense. And I kind of feel, and that's been what I've been thinking about, particularly since the COVID pandemic, that we have a responsibility here as scientists, as mathematicians, statisticians, whoever planet scientists we are. But we also have an opportunity here. I don't want to just make this assumption, like we should all be doing this, but also looking at this, what can we do? What can we do? So, we can, on one hand, make other academic users aware of what we are using and kind of what we are developing in particular of the methods. And that's not always easy. I've tried hard over the years, but we also kind of can get the public involved, especially of course, if it's topics that they feel that are actually relevant. I guess a lot of the public would often think, yeah, these scientists that work often about these kind of weird things that we don't understand. Kind of weird things that we don't understand. And of course, if you say, you know, work on severe storms, they will probably think, oh, yeah, that tree in my garden was affected by it. So it's relevant. And maybe we can also help people getting more trust in science, which of course is another complicated topic. A lot of this boils down to communication. So the topic of communication will kind of be present in these slides repeatedly. Because of course, if we don't communicate, Because, of course, if we don't communicate well, we might as well not think about starting here. Of course, again, I will now look at a few examples. And again, these will be a lot in the context of point processes. Of course, not saying that any of this is limited to point processes. That's just my expertise in a sense. And my thoughts about how to address some of what I've just pointed out. Pointed out a little bit talking about communicating methodology and software. So, how do we, and these are just reflections, communicate what we've been doing, what we've been developing to users, not necessarily the general public. I don't expect everybody in the industry to want to model point patterns, but still there are lots of people who would collect data. But interacting with the general public, I will come up and discuss an example here. Come up and discuss an example here: citizen science, which has that as one of its aims in particular. And I will also talk a little bit about landslides because I know a PhD student who works on this, coincidentally, so not caused by the training last. That's just incidentally. So again, talking about communicating with other scientists, interacting on policy slightly, and the difficulties of that. So I'll very, very, very briefly have just one slide about Inlabru, so like in the background all of this is software. In that room, that I said Mampo also talked about yesterday, no technical issues being discussed here. It's a wraparound around Arilla with a lot of extra functionality. And this is a very, very, very short summary of what it can do, just so that you have sitting in your brain. It makes fitting spatial models in particular point process. Models in particular point process relevant to this talk, but it's not just point patterns, a point process is less fiddly, but also it's just meant to be user-friendly in general, takes observation processes into account that I've talked about previously. It looks, allows for non-linear predictors and has a lot of flexibility in general. A lot of this is the brainchild of Finn, so I'm not claiming a lot of ownership, but it's been more. A lot of ownership, I've been more involved in kind of discussing what is relevant in practice of these approaches. We've developed it out of a very specific application distance answering but it's now become a very general piece of software that is getting better and better and that's doing lots of interesting things. In essence, it's providing integrated fitting of observation processes and processes of interest. So, what is actually we would like to know about and scientifically. About scientifically, but increased our flexibility in many ways. Not to look at multiple likelihoods, for example, very in a very straightforward and flexible way. Good. So this is just so that you kind of, when I say in La Roo, that those of you who know nothing about in La Room have an idea what it actually does. Good. So, but what I really wanted to talk about is kind of communicating methodology and software to users. As I said, I've been working on the flights. Been working on the flight methods, point processes for a long time. When we first started looking at INLA and applying this, we very quickly started running courses with very numerous, but non-many ecologists, but who are not statisticians, not specialists in spatial statistics. And we understood very quickly that people kind of understood roughly what we were doing, but even though there were the most numerous people who didn't have a stats background. We didn't have a stats background, um, kind of struggled and not. And you know, we've been discussing for kind of here: what are the issues, what are the stumbling blocks. Of course, sometimes one of the stumbling blocks is people go to a three-day course and then they don't work on this anymore, then they forget that's something we can't do anything about. But other things have kind of come up that have helped us kind of think about this a little bit more thoroughly. So, what we want in general. So, what we want in general is we want to have some software and methodology that is transparent, accessible, and understandable, so that people will not use the software if they don't know what it's doing. Unless you just give them a recipe on a very, very special case, then they just show them and then get the output. But most people do not want that, at least not the people I'm directing with. So, they want to understand what's going on. And so, what do you do? You can't really explain everything because then they would have to do a degree in math and stats, and it would take. In math and stats, and it would take several years. They just, you know, they can't go harm. So, if you try to explain everything, it doesn't really help. You know, if they just give them lots and lots of, say this, sorry, I don't, you just give them lots and lots of definitions and mathematical details, then you're right. But they're probably not taking in what you're trying to tell them because it doesn't help to be able to cite by heart the definition of a mathematical concept if you don't actually know what it means and what it means. Concept if you don't actually know what it means and what it does. So, people don't, and on the other hand, of course, people don't want a black box in most cases, unless they are very keen on just one specific answer. They don't want just like, you know, this is right, just do this and you get the answer. That's not what they want, especially if they are numerous people with the potential of really understanding all of this, just not backlong. So, the initial approach that we used to take a lot when we were teaching these courses was not really explaining everything. It's not really explaining everything, but focus on how useful the method is. So, you know, give your answers to this, it is going to be fast, et cetera. And then, of course, tell them how to use it in terms of the syntax. But it turned out that people didn't really always take this in very well. And now, as a mouthful, what we've been trying to do is look at it as a summary of what the method does in terms of the roles of the different ingredients. Roles of the different ingredients in the model. So, what do the bits that the models are composed of actually do? Why do we have them in the model? And what do they mean to the model? And we try to kind of reflect that as well as possible in the syntax. This is, of course, yeah, so I said a mouthful. I'll just look at a very brief example here that has actually, again, this could be a whole talk in a sense. So, for example, if you talk to people about the Lock Boss and Cox process. Talk to people about the Lock Morse and Cox process. Of course, initially, they have no idea what this actually means. It's already quite a chunky name in a sense. And of course, the linear predictor in this contains a Gaussian random field. And I've spent years thinking about how I best explain a Gaussian random field to people. Even mathematically minded people find this a relatively complicated concept. So, and of course, we also, you know, when we talk about inland rule, this is then approximated by the solution to. Is then approximated by the solution to a stochastic partial differential equation. But if you say that to people who know nothing about spatial statistics, Stokesky partial differential equations in the in that group, they will say, okay, I don't understand anything. Obviously, you know, most of us wouldn't have 20 years or more or something. So it's, but then you can't go into the detail and explain all the details of the solution to an SVVE. If that doesn't help, it will take you years. Anyway, so um this is how to communicate. You can't solve the mathematical complexity. Because of the mathematical complexity. So, the idea is that you can think about what is important to the user, not the definition necessarily, but the role of the Gauss plot of the model. Why is it in that specific model that we're looking at? How is it represented in the software? So, people need to know the syntax in a way, otherwise they can fit the model, but that's kind of often not really difficult if we tell them this is how to do it. Yeah, they don't struggle to that much of a degree. To that much of a degree, and but also when they do this in practice, what choices do they need to make? What kind of in terms of the parameters or the properties of what you use, for example, priors as well, of course, if you're working in the visual context. So the kind of how to do things. And this is kind of where we've been working on. Briefly talk about components. I mentioned the kind of bits or the elements in the model, explicitly not using the word component, but then You're not using the work component, but in Labrou, you have to your model consists entirely of components that you have defined, and they the important thing here, and I don't go into detail here again, but at the user end, they all have the same structure. Inside, they are different, but they have different roles. So, you kind of build your model based on components, each of which has a different role. This, it's again, slightly more complex than this, because of course, not always that's the same mathematics. Of course, not always left the same mathematically. You have a mathematical object of the same role in different models, but that's kind of the thinking behind this. So, um, cut. Um, so yeah, I'm already said this. This is moving very slowly, I don't know why. Anyway, um, good. So to finish off this part, um, we are currently, and particularly Sara Martino and I, are maybe discussing this with others, PhD students and postdocs. Um, this is a book project. It's a book project where we kind of want to teach people in a level spatial modeling, not only point process modeling, actually. Again, we want to be transparent, accessible, understandable. Initially, we are kind of working on just a very small, open, hopefully open access resource that provides fundamentals of Inlaprew, many kind of syntax, and what kind of models you can fit. That's not all we want to achieve. That's kind of the What we want to achieve, that's kind of the core, what we failed. This is the most hanging fruit. But what we mainly want to do is, and we've been working on as well, is kind of the entire idea is to also look at a detailed how-to guide. So one of the elements that we found when talking to users is that they kind of understood the syntax. It's not like that complicated. They understood the motivation behind the model, but they didn't struggle with all the different decisions you have to make. All the different decisions you have to make. You know, how do you fit your mesh? How do you choose the parameters for all the different things? How does you justify how to do things? And so we spent a lot of time going through a lot of these kind of how-to elements. So I'm saying here the syntax isn't that difficult. It's more the complexity of the decision process that makes the model fitting difficult for people. So we have been have spent a lot of time on discussing the decision process with a really wide group of users. And the idea Users. And the idea is to then include kind of realistic case studies. Initially, of course, I have some simple examples, but I'll include in the end some realistic case studies where people that are written by or with actual users that actually bring up the questions that they ask in general. So again, coming back to the kind of responsibility, we have kind of sharing methodology with users, but also listening to them what they need, what their issues are. What they need, what their issues are, because we don't know what their issues are if we don't listen to them. Briefly, I'll be talking about the other two points I was making. One of them, kind of citizen science, done a lot of work in the context of biodiversity. Again, a tough topic. I can talk a lot about even measuring what biodiversity or defining what that is. That's another point here. Citizen science is, of course, relevant outside biodiversity research, it's just a motivation here. Biodiversity research is just a motivation here, because that's a big topic, also in the context of climate change and changing environments. So people collect data who are not specialists in lots of different ways, sometimes with their mobile phones, sometimes just pretending they're scientists but with less knowledge. And of course, you get data that are not really as necessarily of as high quality as the data that scientists collect. You have different types of biases. Collect, you have different types of biases coming in, you have preferential sampling coming in, you have detection issues common in ecology. You often have different types of data structures even within the same study or the same phenomenon that you want to look at. So, you have different observation processes, you have different kind of backgrounds to the data sets you want to probably join them, probably also want to scientifically collect the data. So, you have got to joint modeling data fusion problems. The benefits. Problems. The benefits are: you get more data, cheaper data, with spatial and temporal coverage that would otherwise not achieve necessary. And there's the nice element of potentially involving the general public and data collection and giving them some responsibility in there. This is, of course, difficult if the majority of the data are very, very kind of rubbish. You can't do much with it. And of course, there's a future discussion in science students to hear what kind of data can you use, etc. Project we've been working on. Working on engagement with science, I think, trust in science behind the thing. Is working a lot on species distribution modeling in the context of biodiversity research. Butterfly species, there are different sampling schemes, details I can't go into. Lotter works directly with the Center for Hydro Energy and Ecology, UK. You can see examples. This is just one: the intensity. This is just one the intensity estimated separately for two collection schemes for one specific type of butterfly. In one of them, on the right-hand side, people were told to collect the data more or less. On the left-hand side, they could choose where they go. You can see that they are kind of going to the areas that they prefer to go to. And we kind of combine the data to account for that very specifically. Just coming back to the responsibility, we are kind of trying to provide a general framework. Provides a general framework for spatial temporal modeling of citizen science data. Because, in the literature so far, every or most of the studies have said, okay, we have this specific problem, and then they've developed software for that specific combination of data sets, etc. And of course, that involves reinventing the wheel repeatedly. So, there's kind of a reduced need for bespoke software development. But, okay, there's also facilities. But okay, that's also facilitating the communication with other scientists, and so you can't see a potential for improved data collection. Of course, there's also communication into with the data collectors. How can you do this better so that we get better data in the end? Just to finish off landslides, I mentioned we are also working on land slides. I have a PhD student, Daniela, and I have a PhD student student, Daniela Castro Camillo, who some of you know. Who's some of you know, who's working on landslides in the UK as well in Japan on the project at the moment? Japan is complex for the data structure in terms of the islands. That's why I'm mentioning it here. In terms of the kind of responsibility point, well, you know, we mark a commodity as a point pattern. We might look at the marks or the size of the landslides, whatever the size is. It's a marked point pattern. These might be extreme events. We haven't got there yet, but a lot of the work at the moment was also done. A lot of the work at the moment is also directly linked with the British Geological Society. And yeah, I know Erin, the PhD student, has spent some time with them discussing what they've been doing. They often develop maps of risk maps by almost non-quantitatively but qualitatively assessing areas and saying, oh yeah, I guess the risk is high here, then there are areas where they have no idea because they are difficult to assess to access, which of course also then doesn't cause a big danger to the population. Cause a big danger to the population. So there are lots of kind of practical accessibility issues here. Good. So again, there's kind of communication, and there's a big problem doing this, or it's an issue doing this properly, Morgan's done. So in summary, so we do a lot of methodology and develop a lot of methodology that is clearly kind of time critical in terms of the context that we are working on. And I feel that we should all, at least for me, think. And at least for me, think about: are we doing enough? Are we doing kind of communicating with this? So, in terms of giving users access and thinking about reflections about facilitating this, collaborating in a kind of mutual respect and careful communication context, and also engaging with the public, exciting people about our work. Good. And I have a funny thing to say at the end. So, for the eagle-eyed amongst The eagle eye, amongst you, will probably have seen on this wonderful map that I showed you earlier. This thing placed up here that I heard before. This is Banff. And this is not Banff in Canada, but that's the original Banff. He's the person who founded the Banff in Canada, came from Doftown and named Banff after that Banff. And people don't really know that, it's quite nice. That people don't really know that, it's quite nice to know. And if you're wondering what's going on in life these days, not much researchers are fairly small plays still, but they're celebrating 40 years of the film, Local Hero, which is set in a tiny village that was just next to it, Pennin, but it's so tiny that they couldn't have a celebration in there. You can have a drive in that village. This village actually exists, it has a different name in the film, then they have to really have one. They have to really have a one-month celebration of this film at the moment. Pause, you're not surprised if you don't know that we've actually been there. The telephone box still exists, the background looks slightly different than in the film. It's actually quite nice. And if you don't know anything about Local Hero, I wanted to get a little bit of AI into this talk. So I asked Chat CBT what Local Hero is about. And this is what it says. So if you're It says. So, if you're both by my talk, just read about local hero just in case you don't know. Anyway, that's my hope.
