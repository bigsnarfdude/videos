And today my topic is a collapsed method for simulating phrase surface flows. It's a new method for simulating incompressible fluids. And actually, I didn't know all the I didn't know all the details of this method and I just finished a very incremental work for the simulating free service flows. And first, let me introduce the background. Our focus is on the vertices. Vortices is fascinating. Fascinating vortices are fascinating for laminar and that can be observed in many places, such as look at this vertices on the river surfaces and bubble rings. And if you ever watch the dolphins' performance, you will notice that they like to make such kind of vertices. And here is a tornado vertical attacks. Vortices also play a crucial role in various applications because they can influence the design of dynamic structures, as a vortex shading can impact stability, propulsion, and drag. Here, Here we show wing tip vertices from a spiral around the tip of a wing creating training vertices. And here is a very interesting phenomenon. A water strider can create horseshoe vertices as they move and forming vertex loops. This vortex can assist their proportion. So the question is how to solve this kind of problems, how to simulate this kind of problems. I think we're all familiar with the Navier-Stokes equations, the behavior of the fluid velocity. Of the fluid velocity that can be described by the Levier-Stocks equations. These equations can be used to describe the movement of fluid substances and their interactions. We can solve this equation by using two kinds of methods. The first one is direct numerical simulation. This method, I think I'm I think it's a kind of method that can capture all the scales of turbulent flows and providing detailed insights into flow interactions. But it's typically limited to simplified geometries and low Reynolds numbers because we need high computational demands. And we can also. And we can also use turbulence models, especially in engineering applications. The turbulence models can provide average characteristics for vertex structures and can be used to capture the overall behavior of turbulence. However, this method may struggle to accurately represent fine Represent fine-scale features due to their reliance on average quantities. So all these traditional methods is hard to use to simulate the complex vortex phenomenon. So we want to develop a vortex-based method for simulating. Based method for simulating this kind of phenomena. So let me introduce some basic of the vertex structures. The main character of the vertex structures, I think we can describe as two features. The first one is a multi-scale, and the second one is helicopter features. Is a helicopter features. So these two features make them highly complex phenomena to study, and these characteristics can lead to significant challenges in fluid simulations. As accurately capturing their behavior often requires high-resolution data. Here I show some pictures of vortex structures for isotropic turbulence. So for isotropic turbulence. This picture is represented by the vortex surface, and this picture is represented by the magnitude of vorticity. And they both show multi-scale and helical structures. So I already talked lots of things about the. Lots of things about vortex, but vortices don't have a strict mathematical definition, just like a turbulence. But still, we can describe the shape of a vertex using vertex lines and vertex surfaces, like these two pictures. The vertex lines are the integral lines of verticity vector, and the vertex. and the vertex surface is a surface consisting of vertex lines. So why we talk about the vertex lines and the vertex surfaces? Because these two things have have the Have the dynamic implications. There is a famous theory, Hammerhorse theory. It said in ideal inviscid fluid, vortex lines and surfaces can move with the fluid particles behaving like material lines and surfaces. Material lines and the surfaces. So we can track the vertex lines and the surfaces in the idea of inviscid fluid. Although in viscous flows, the continuous evolution of vertex surface remains unclear, but in the high relative number turbulence, the viscous is very small. And also, if we track So if we track vertex surface in viscous flows, that shape must be or can be adjusted to satisfy the constraints of vortex dynamics. Here I show evolution of vortex surface in a transitional channel flow. Actually, this transitional channel flow has viscous. So viscers and so we adjust the adjust the vertex surface to make sure it satisfies the constraints of vertex dynamics and although the vortex surface is a two-dimensional manifold and the vertex line And what next line is a one-dimensional manifold. We can still use a field variable to represent these two objects. Vortex surfaces can be represented as isosurfaces of a scalar field. And we can call this field as a vortex surface field. So basically, we can simulate this. Simulate this field to reconstruct the fluid velocity. And the vortex lines can be represented at the intersection surface surfaces from two independent vortex surface fields, like this picture. And here is a vertex surface, and here the blue one. And here, the blue one is also a vertex surface, and their intersection is a vertex line. So our research objective is to develop a numerical algorithm using scalar fields for the characterization of vertex lines and vertex surfaces. So our method. So over method is different from the direction numerical method, direction numerical simulation for solving the Navier-Stokes equations or turbulence model. Our method is based on the vortex surface field. And another objective is to address the computational intensity problem in direction numerical simulation. Direction numerical simulation. And we also want to improve the accuracy of turbulence models in representing small-scale vertex structures. Because the turbulence models always use the average field, so it's hard to represent in small-scale vertex structures. And we also want to implement the proposal method. Implement the proposal method for the numerical simulation of complex flow scenarios, especially in free surface flows and bubble rings. I think these two kinds of phenomena is hard to simulate by traditional method. Okay, let me introduce our main. Our main method, the collapse representation. So the collapse representation is a kind of velocity representation, is an extension for potential flow. I think we're all familiar with the potential flow. We use a scalar field. A scalar field to represent the velocity. But this representation has an obvious limitation. It can't represent flow with vorticity. So in flow regions where vorticity is very important, such as the boundary layers and the turbulence. And the turbulence, the potential flow theory is not able to provide reasonable predictions of the flow. You can see the picture for this potential flow around an Mark F foil. And the flow structure is very simple. Structure is very simple and has no vorticity. That is a actually a mathematician, Alfred Klapsch, has made an extension for the potential flow. He represents the velocity as this expression. So this expression can. So this expression can allow for the zero vorticity. And it also has a nice feature is that the isosurface of a vorticity collapse map here I refer the vorticity collapse map is the scalar function number and The scalar function lambda and g. And these two scalar functions can be viewed as the vertex surface surface field. It means the isosurface of lambda is a vertex surface and the isosurface of this variable is also a vertex surface. And they subject to the following constraints, which means the gradient of a number or Of number or gradient of this variable is perpendicular to the vorticity. I think you all remember the vorticity is the curve of the velocity. But this representation still has some drawbacks. The main drawback is this collapse representation is unable to express flow fields. Express flow fields with non-zero holistic. So this limits its application in real-world flows. So you can use this representation to represent the flow field like this one. But you can't use this representation to represent flow like this one. Because this one has a virus. This one has a spiral vertex in the flow field. So, let me talk more about helicity. It's a tricky feature for the velocity. So, what is a holistic? Holistic is a measure of the twist or linkage of a velocity field. Velocity field. It tells us the vortex mice, how many links of the vortex mice in the flow field. So and this quantity also has wonderful conserved properties. In ideal flows, helicity is often conserved, which makes it an important It's an important quantity in understanding the dynamics of the turbulent flows. And here I show understand holistic from different perspective. So if you make the vertex lines to coye. coil to coil coil to to bend like this this this shape and it can cause a very large holistic or if you can make the vertex lines to twist twist like this this kind of shape and it can also make a lot very large holistic and here i showed uh what excellence and of Vortex lines and often knotted vertex tubes at various temporal instances. So the knotted vertex tubes can also cause a very large holistic. So I already introduced the potential flow. It represents the velocity as this representation. And this representation has no vorticity. Has no vorticity and has no helicity. And Klapsch made the extension for the potential flow. And he represents the velocity by this expression. And he solved the problem about the vorticity. So this representation has non-zero vorticity, but still has no helicity. So the So the vortex lines still needs to nearly parallel with no spiral in the flow field. So we still have to expand the idea of the original collapse representation to make sure it can represent a velocity field with non-zero vorticity and non-zero holisticity. And non-zero holistic. To extend the original collapse representation, we express the collapse representation in the language of differential forms to further generalize this representation. So, we express the velocity and the vorticity fields using differential forms. We really represent. forms we really represent the velocity as one form and so the curve of velocity can be represented naturally by using the this differential operator. So the vorticity is represented by two differential two form and in this representation the collapse The collapse representation can be expressed in the following form. So the velocity can be reviewed as a poor bank of one form in three dimensional Euclidean space. And what TC can be viewed as pro bank of Probably of two form in the two-dimensional Euclidean space. So, what's this for? Actually, this form can be naturally extended to non-trivial fibrillation because this one is a trivial fibrillation for the fiber can be reviewed. For the fiber can be reviewed as a one-dimensional Euclidean space, and the base manifold is a two-dimensional manifold. The whole space is a three-dimensional manifold. So actually this extension is first mentioned in a physics paper. Yeah uh Puzz Kuzo Puzozov and um Mikolov uh they both are uh uh physicists and they they they made this extension but I only use a calculus language. The idea is this the original collapse representation expresses a fluid of loss. Expresses a fluid velocity field as a superposition for gradients of scalar potentials, as I introduced before. So this kind of expressions can be extended to a long trivial form. So we lament it as a geometric collapse representation. This idea extends. This idea extends the concept by incorporating a more flexible framework, allowing for the inclusion of complex topological structures, such as knotted cubes. It can loss for non-zero holistic. Basically, this idea represented the loss. represented the velocity one form as a poor bank of poor bank of one form in a three-dimensional sphere and view the vorticity two form as a pro bank of error of error form of in the two-dimensional sphere and this the the vibration between the unit Between the unit three sphere and the unit two sphere is a powerful vibration. So, in a more sophisticated language, the story can be told by the geometric collapse representation, interprets the velocity one form and the vorticity two form as poor banks of the Erasmus collection and association. Collection and associate curvature within the framework of the hopeful vibration. And so the expression, so the idea is, I think it's relatively complex, but the expression is very easy. And it represents the velocity as this expression. So it represents the velocity by using the Using the two components wave function. Actually, the wave function is in the unit three sphere. So it's kind of like a unit quaternion. And it expresses the vorticity by using the error form of the two-dimensional sphere. And we call it spin vector. So we finished our extension. First year we have potential flow has no vorticity and has no pelicity. And then the original collapse representation, it has a non-zero vorticity but has no pelicity. So by using the hope of vibration, this scale Uh this this scalar representation can be any represent the velocity by using this form and this this representation has non-zero vorticity and non-zero helicity. So let me show uh example for for the example example of the Example example of the geometric claps representation. Here I show a vertex tube in the four different space. In the wave function space, it looks this. We don't know how to picture this in a three-dimensional space. And this what X tube in this space can be projected to Be projected to a two-dimensional sphere. It's like a patch on the sphere. So it viewed the vortex tube as a patch and the vortex tube's flux is proportional to the area of the patch in the two sphere. And in the physical In the physics domain, the text tube the velocity of a vertex tube can be viewed as a spiral velocity around the vertex tube. Here, the orange lines indicate the integral lines of velocity. And in this picture, And in this picture, it shows a vortex tube, the solid tube, is a vortex tube that has zero vorticity. So this picture is a vortex tube in a four different space. So when we solve different variables, we got different fluid patterns. Fluid patterns. So, different variable sets, including velocity, vorticity, wave function, and spin vector can be used to produce distinct flow patterns in fluid motion. For example, in this one, actually, this example is leap flogging vertex. It shows two vortex tubes leap flogging. As they move, they leap flogging. As they move, they leap flogging in the flow field. Here, I show for it evolving in the wave function space. And here I show how it will evolving in the spin vector space. And here is more like in our linear space. It just some like a rounding particle, so we can we can. Particles, so we can track these particles by using velocity. So, solving the evolution equations for different variables offer unique advantages. And at first, I introduced some basic ideas about the vertex surface field, the iso surface. The isosurface of the vertex surface field is a vertex surface. So there is a connection between the vertex surface and the verticity by using the collapse representation. For one thing, the scalar variable Scalar variables in the vorticity collapse representation of vortex surface field. So they satisfy these constraints. The gradient of the scalar variables are perpendicular to the vorticity for another. And we can use the vorticity collapsion map or vorticity collection representation. What is the claps representation to represent what is the U by using these three scalar variables? But these three variables only have two independent scalars because they are in the unit sphere. Here I show a vertex I show the vertex tubes in the turbulent. Vortex tubes in a turbulent isotropic turbulence by using the isosurface of vertex surface. And here I show the vertex structures by using the magnet, the isosurface of magnitude of vorticity. So I will introduce the numerical method. Basically, it it the numerical method is by is the difference of this numerical method from the traditional method is we solve the scalar variables the the collapse potentials our our focus is on the air liquid air liquid interface flows because we think Because we think this phenomenon is very hard, and especially when there are lots of vertices in the flow field, it's hard to solve by using transitional method. So we aim to address the problem of the interface without thickness, which separates the flow field into regions of liquid and air with distinct densities. And we also modeled the surface tension at the interface by using Jan-Laplos equation. And this equation describes the pressure difference across the interface due to the substantiation. So we solve this equation without viscous viscous uh as i as i said before the actually it's hard to uh add the viscous force in the in our text surface analytically because i as i said before the what we have uh Yeah, we have a Hemhor's theory. It said the vortex surface can move with fluid particles. So when solve the inviscid flows, the equation is easy, but we still don't know how to add a viscous force to the collapse variables. Variables. So we will introduce a numerical algorithm to add a viscous force to the wave functions, not analytical method. So we want to solve this equation. By the way, represent the velocity field by using the geometry. The geometric capture wave function to enhance fluid simulations. Basically, we use this expression to transform the velocity equation into this one. By transforming the velocity equation into a wave function equation, we can analyze the fluid's behavior more effectively and establish. Effectively, and is established a framework for simulating complex fluid interactions. So, remember, we still didn't add a viscous force in the fluid in the this equations. So, we propose the numerical method to incorporate a viscous force directly into the Directly into the we propose the numerical method to incorporate the viscous force into the wave function because viscous force directly into the wave function is very hard. Basically, the method is at first we apply the viscous The viscous force to the velocity field. And then we introduce an optimization algorithm to adjust in the wave function field to better align with the velocity field that accounts for these viscous forces. So we have two steps. First, we add viscous forces to the velocity, then we produce. Velocity, then we project the vasical force onto the wave function. We also validate the optimization algorithm, but it's a very rough validation. We investigate the The necessity of the optimization algorithm using a dam breaking example. If we disable this optimization algorithm, the flow field is over-energetic, like this like this energy. There is There is very the energy peak in the in the in the kinetic energy. This is not normal because in the normal the the the the energy is um the kinetic energy decay is uh it's decay as the flow evolving because we have no uh we have no uh Have no external force enforced in the flow field, and it also causes the non-natural bubbles in the flow field. So, this optimization algorithm can make sure we add a viscous force into the flow field and make sure the flow field is decaying as the time evolving. I'm involving. And we also propose a bubble volume algorithm. The idea is to flood fill each bubble on the grid cells and chuck its volume and topological changes with semi-Lagrangian bank chart. The idea is very simple. And we store a target volume for each. Store a target volume for each bubble during initialization. Then we mark each bubble using the breath first search method. And finally, we update the target volume for each bubble using the bank tracking method. Actually, I I also define a state equation for to make sure the volume of bubbles are conserved, but I Are conserved, but I remember to put the equation here. Do I still have time? Okay, thank you. Okay, finally, I show some results. Here is a recollection of bubble rings. Actually, this kind of phenomenon is very hard to simulate based on traditional method because the scale is. Method because the scale is very small and the vorticity is very intense. And we also show the leapfrogging of two bubble rings. And we can show the bubble rings can jump, can jump and and go through each other and completing the And completing the rounds of lip flogging. And finally, they can merge into one ring. And I also showed a sync vertex. Our method can, I think, the spiral of this kind of free surface flow is hard to. surface flow is hard to simulate because also because the scale is very small the spiral spawns and here here is the boss shoe vertex this kind of vertex can be created by the striders as I as I presented before And here are some energetic surface of the ocean. And our grades are very sparse. Even on sparse grids, our algorithm can reproduce vertex shading around the boundaries of solid objects. And here is a padding. Our solver can couple with moving solid boundaries, so can create this kind of cascaded vortex structures. Okay, here is a here is a rendering of our simulation results.    Okay, finally, a brief summary. So we propose a clapping method to solve incompressible fluid equations. And we simulate a diverse range of free surface flows, including horseshoe vertices, sink flows, bubble rings, and wake vertices. And distinct from And distinct from traditional direction numerical simulation or turbulence models, our method is based on the dynamic evolution of vortex surfaces, offering the advantage for preserving flow structures. But the limitation is very apparent. The main part of this work was presented at SIGGRAPH. At CGRAF, a conference in computer graphics. And we actually didn't analyze the accuracy or the stability. We just solved the equations and rendering it as a very beautiful result. And its application in gaming or movies is clear, but it's used. But is used in mathematical and physical research still needs further exploration. And we plan to develop a machine learning algorithm embedded with this vertex dynamic parallels. Okay, my presentation.
