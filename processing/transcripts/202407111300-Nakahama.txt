I thank the organizers for giving me an opportunity to talk. Today, the title of my talk is Production Symmetry Breaking Operators of Hormo Dixie Representations for SCO33 and SO star 6. Now I'll start my talk. Today, first I begin with the setting, and then I talk about the main theorems, and then I give the outlining proofs for the main theorems. Now I start with the setting. First, we variance G and G prime equals SCO33 and SO star 6 as follows. First, G is SCO33 and this is defined as a set of G in S6C, preserving this prime form of the signature 3, 3 as this. And then G prime equals SO star 6, as defined as a set of G in SO3, 3, preserving this symmetric bilinear form CO2. A symmetric bilinear form CYIZ but this. Then we consider the boundary domains P and D prime as follows. D is defined as a set of X in N3C, such that I minus X star is positively defined. And then D prime is defined as the intersection of D and O3C, where O3C is a set of three times three complex symmetry alternating matrices. Then G and G prime. Then, g and g prime respectively act on d and d prime respectively transitively by the linear fractional transform ax plus b times cx plus d inverse. And under this action, d and d prime become function symmetric spaces. That is, d is isomorphic to SO33 modulo S of U3 times U3, and D prime is isomorphic to SO star 6 module U3. And next, we call homomorphic D3 series. Call homophic D33 representation of SCO33. We recall that G equals SO33 acts on the set D in M3C. Let lambda be a complex number. Then, the universal covering group G tilde acts on the space of holomorphic functions on D, which is denoted by O lambda D, by this formula. That is, the action of A B C D inverse is given by rotating the base space by the linear fractional transform, and then by twisting. Transform and then by twisting the fiber by multiplying determinant cx plus d to the power of minus lambda. Here, if lambda is not an integer, then this is not verdefined on g, but this is verdefined on the universal covering group. Then, if lambda is larger than pi, then this results in a product given by a constant multiple of integral d of f times determinant of i minus xx star to the power of lambda minus. xx star to the power of lambda minus 6 dx. Then let h lambda d in O lambda d be the corresponding fibret space. Then this is called the weighted Bernaman space. And the unitary representation, tau lambda and h lambda d is called the holomorphic discrete representation of scalar type. Next, we call homologic discrete representation of SOST. We see the presentation of SO star 6. We recall that G prime equals SO star 6 acts on G prime in all 3C. Next, for 3, 2 plus of integers K, which satisfy this inequality, let how K prime and BK tech be the irreducible GL3C module, be the highest weight, minus K3, minus K2, minus K1. And let this parenthesis be the U3 invariant inner product. The U3 invariant inner product. Then let lambda be a complex number. Then the universal covering group G prime kilotra acts on the space of VK check valued homomorphic functions on B prime, which is denoted by O lambda B prime VK check by this formula. That is, the action of A B C D inverse is given by rotating the base space by the linear fluxion transform and then twisting the fiber by determining Cx plus D to the power of minus lambda over two times tiger. Over 2 times tiger prime of transpose of 6c plus d. Then, if lambda is sufficiently large, then this results in a product given by a constant multiple of integral d prime of the fiberwise inner product of fc and zc times determinant of i minus zc to the power of minus of lambda minus 4 over 2 zc. Then let h lambda d prime we can check in or lambda d prime we can check with the first. d prime v k check with the corresponding key bird space. Then this is also called the weighted Berlaman space. And the unitary representation of tau prime lambda k and h lambda d prime v k check is also called the homophic discretive representation. Now we want to consider the decomposition of H lambda D under the subgroup G prime tilde. We recall that D is contained in M3C and G equals S333. and D equals S333 axon D. And similarly, D prime is contained in O3C, and G prime equals SO star 6 axon D prime. And the oxonal complement of O3C and M3C is equal to CM3C, the space of 3 times 3 complex symmetrical matrices. Then, the space of polynomials on CM3C is the composite of the action of GL3C as follows. That is, the space of polynomials. That is, the space of polynomial on SIM3C, which is denoted by P of SIM3C, is decomposed into the sum where K1, K2, K3 runs over this set, that is, the set of partitions with length of more three of PKSM3C. And each reducible component, PKSM3C, is isomorphic to V2K. Then, according to this decomposition, it is proved by Kaviasri that H lambda D is decomposed under. H lambda d is decomposed under the action of the SADA subgroup G prime equals SOS TV6 as follows. That is, H lambda D restricted to the subgroup G prime T is decomposing into the Hilbert diagram where K1 K2K runs over the same set as this of H2 lambda D prime V T K check. That is, the decomposition of H lambda D and the G prime tilde is governed by the decomposition. The decomposition of the space of polynomials and the complementary space. Then, for each partition k, they exist uniquely up to constant markup, g prime to the intertwining operators between the larger representation h lambda d and the smaller representation h2 lambda d prime with k check. Here, the intertwining operator from a larger representation to smaller representation is called a symmetry rhythm operator. Symmetry reading operator and the intertwining operator of the opposite direction is called the photographic operator. Then it is proved by Schipzner that f dam lambda k is given by some differential operator in the form in the form of X setting, and this is called the Local theorem. Now we want to find the intertwining operators between these two representations. Now we give maps. Now, we give methods. In the following, elements of N3C is denoted by capital Latin alphabet, La J and Las D, and its alternating and symmetric components are denoted by lowercase Greek alphabets and lowercase Latin alphabets as this. Then, the theorem on flow of cooperator is given as follows. For lambda larger than Follows. For lambda larger than 5 and for partitions k with length at the most 3, the forward corporate f of lambda k from h to lambda d from b to k check to h lambda d from smaller representation to larger representation is given by the infinite order differential operator given by substituting a differential operator del delta c into some into some function f of lambda k and letting this act on the effect c and the symbol of the holographic operator. Symbol of the holographic copy, f of lambda kx zeta is given by the sum where L1, L2, L3 runs over this set of some explicit coefficient depending on lambda KL times some polynomial FAPKL Xzeta. Here, FAKL Xzeta is a GL3C invariant on CB2KXC valued polynomial on CM3C plus all 3CT. All three CK and the precise definition of this polynomial is given later. And lambda sub k is a usual shifter factorial. Here, x k l x zeta is not given explicitly, but this is independent of the continuous parameter lambda. And these are all non-zero and linearly independent. And hence, the lambda dependence of this operator is completely determined by this explicit coefficient. Explicit coefficients. And especially the positional force with respect to lambda is completely determined by this formula. And since L3 can take an infinitely large number, this is infinite sum, and this is an infinite order differential operator. But if we restrict this to the space of k prime finite vectors, then this operator becomes very defined. Next, I move to we move to symmetry rhythm operator. Let again lambda be larger than 5 and let k be a partition with lengths at most 3. Then the symmetry operating operator f dun lambda k from a larger representation h lambda t to a smaller representation h2 lambda d prime ut k check is given by the differential operator which is given by substituting the differential operator delta x. Putting the differential operator delta x into some polynomial f dal n like a, letting this act on f and putting small x to be zero. Here, small x is a symmetric component of large x. And the symbol of the symmetry operator, x double lambda kz, is given by the sum where L1, L2, L3 runs over this set of some expressed constant depending on lambda k l times some polynomial f dumb k l. Polynomial, F done KL Zeta G. Here, F done KL Zeta G is a GL3C invariant which 2K check variant polynomial on all 3C check plus SIM3C check. And the precise definition of this polynomial is given later. And again, lambda sub k is a user shifted factorial. Here, this polynomial is, again, not given explicitly, but these are independent of the continuous parameter. Independent of the continuous parameter lambda and these f down kl are all non-zero and linearly independent. And hence, the lambda dependence of this operator is completely determined by this coefficient. And especially, the position of poles are completely determined by this formula. And in this case, Neby's term minus K3 sub L1 plus L2. minus k3 sub l1 plus l2 if l1 plus l2 is larger than k3 then this term minus k3 sub l1 plus l2 vanishes and hence this becomes a finite sum and this is a finite order differential operator and and this is verifying on the whole h lambda d next we give the main theorem on possible pass on partial type formula we'll go that epsilon lambda k call that f dam lambda k is a map from h lambda d to h to lambda d prime v2 k check and the minimal k prime type of the smaller representation h2 lambda d prime v2 k check is equal to v2k check the space of constant functions on d prime and the pre-image of the minimal k-type is equal to pk all three c in h lambda d and we normalize the symmetry of equal data f dam lambda k such that if f is taken from the the preimit is taken from the pre-image of the minimal k-plan time pK03c then the square of norm of f the square of normal external k f is independent is independent of the continuous parameter lambda as and given by the feature normal of f that is f bar delta x times fx with substituted with x equals 0. Then under this normalization the following falls The following falls. For lambda rather than 5 and for f in h lambda d, the square of norm of f is equal to the sum where k runs over the set of partitions with lengths at most 3 or some constant c lambda k times the square of null of f dam lambda kf. And the constant C lambda k is given explicitly by this formula, where this kj with j equal to 4 is defined to be zero. is defined to be zero. And today I only today I only tweet the cases understood that the length is three, but this expression is also false for larger, for higher rank. And in the rank three case, by reducing the denominator and the numerator, this is given as this fraction. Today, I don't give the proof of this. I don't give the proof of this theorem. Now we give the definition of f up KFX zeta and f down KF zeta D. First, we recall that as GA3C modules, the space of polynomials on SIM3C is decomposed into the sum where k runs over the set of partitions with length atmosphere of pKSim3C. And each irreducible component, PKCM3C, is atmospheric. PKCM3C is isomorphic to V2K check. And the controller gradient at the control gradient version now this formula is given as this. Then, next, if we add determinant inverse to the space of polynomials, then this is decomposed into the sum where k1, k2, k3 runs over the set of three two-person integers satisfying this inequality of pKSM3C. And each pK sim3c is isomorphic to again. Is isomorphic to again a V2K check. Here, if K3 is smaller than 0, then this space is no longer a space of polynomials, but by abusive notation, we use the same notation, PKCM3C, even if K3 is smaller than 0. And the contragradient version is given as this. Next, we fix non-zero polynomial, KKX, as GL3C invariant V2K valued polynomial. V2K valid polynomial on SIM3C. Similarly, we fix non-zero VK check Z as a GL3C invariant V2K check valid polynomial on SIM3C check. Such polynomials are unique up to constant markup by the irreducibility of this space. And next, let X sharp be the adjugate element of X in M3C. Namely, X sharp is defined as the determinant X times X inverse. Then we define f upkr xzeta and f down krzetaz as follows. First, we define f upkrxzeta by the orthogonal projection onto each component of this function, exponential minus stress of x sharp zeta sharp times kkx. Here, this red function exponential minus stress of x sharp zeta sharp is in the sun where L runs over L runs over all non-negative integers of P2L or 3C check sensor P L L 0 or S 3 C. Here, this space P2L O3C check is a space of homogeneous polynomials on all 3C check with degree 2L. And by the definition of KKX, this fits in PKSM3C tensor of V2K. Then, this red space, PL0, tensor, P L L 0 tensor P K is decomposed known to the sum where L1, L2, L3 runs over this set of P of K1 plus L2 plus L3, L2 plus L1 plus L3, L3 plus L1 plus L2 of CM3C. And this space, V2K, is isomorphic to home C V2K text C. Then, according to this decomposition, we define F of K error zeta by the consonant projection onto each component. Similarly, we define f dumb kl zeta z by the osonal projection onto each component of this function. Here, this red function, exponential of mine stress z shape z over determinant z, is in the sum where L runs over all non-linear integers of p2l or 3c check tensor p0 minus l minus l sin 3c check. Here, in the former case, this is this space of p of l0 and in the latter. P of L L 0. And in the latter case, this is a space P of 0 minus L minus L. And by definition of KK check T, this blue function sits in PKSM3C check tensor V2K check. Then this red space is decomposed into the sum where L1, L2, L3 runs over this set of P of K1 minus L3 minus L3, K2 minus L1 minus L3, K3 minus L1 minus L2. K3 minus L1 minus L2 of steam 3C check and in the former case this these signs are plus and in the latter case these signs are minus now according to this decomposition we define f dung k f delta z by the orthonormal position onto each component of this function now now uh i again show the the explicit formula of holographic operators in the Formula of holographic operators and symmetry breaking populators. In the previous slide, we have defined f up k x zeta and f down k zeta z. Then, by taking a suitable linear combination of these polynomials, we get holographical platinum and symmetry of platinum. Since these polynomials are vector-valided, this expression is a bit complicated, but A bit complicated, but if the smaller representations are of the scalar type, then these become much simpler. The following, we consider scalar case, namely k is of the form kkk. Then, in this case, h2 lambda d prime v2 kk is isomorphic to scalar scalar variable representation h2 lambda plus 4k d prime. Then, let c k be this constant. Ck be this constant. Then, for lambda larger than π and for non-negative integer k, the intertwining operators between the scalar value representations h2 lambda plus 4kg prime and h lambda d is given by some infinite order differential operator and some finite order differential operator. And the symbol of the holographic operator, f of lambda k x zeta, is given by a constant multiple. is given by a constant multiple, a constant multiple of the sum, where m runs over from zero to infinity of 1 over lambda plus 2k plus 1 half sub n times n factorial times minus trace of x sharp zeta sharp to the power of m times determinant x to the power of k. That is, the symbol of the holographic operator is given by the Bessel function. Similarly, the symbol of the symmetry operator x double number is given by the It's given by a constant multiple over the sum with m runs over from zero to k over minus k sub m minus k minus one half sub m over minus lambda minus two k plus five over two sub m times m factorial times minus minus ratio zeta sharp z over determinant z to the power m times determinant z to the power k. Namely, the symbol of the whole symbol of the symmetry rating later is given by using It's given by using the Gauss hypergeometric function. And these operator norms, the square of the operator norm of the holographic operator and the minus square of the operator norm of the symmetry rate on the plateau, are given in this place to be by lambda plus k minus 3 over 2 sub k over lambda sub 2 k lambda minus 1 sub k lambda minus 2 sub k. Now we give some remarks. Today I talked about the results on SU33, SO star 6, but similar results also called for SO star 12 and SO star 6 times SO star 6, and E7-25, SEO26. And previous works on differential symmetry rating platers are given by, for example, by Rankin Kohen for SL2R times SL2R, SL2R, and by Ken Chang for And by Penichang for G times C G with G Harshiang. By U for SO01N and SO01N minus 1. By Iguikyamaku Maki Ochi for SP2NR, SPNR times SPNR. Bike wires Earth Summer Sochek for SO0PQ SO0PQ minus 1. Bike wire scriptner for SO02N, SO02N minus 1. SPN1, SPN minus 1R times SP1R, UN1 times UN1, UN1 and times u n one u n one and so on and by a bio bias core vector for all n1 or n minus one and this result to treat a vector wider representation and myself i buy myself a g and g symmetry or criminal symmetric spaces that the corresponding associated symmetric pairs of tube type next to i give the the autonomy Next, I give the outline and flu for the symmetric rental operations. To do this, first we record F method. In the following, let P plus and P minus be N3C, the space of three times three complex matrices, and we regard P plus and P minus be mutual real with respect to the bilinear form trace of XY. Then we fix the basis E alpha of P plus and let Z alpha be the coordinate of P minus corresponding Coordinate of P minus corresponding to this species E alpha. Then we define the vessel operator, which is a P plus value differential operator on P minus, given by one half of the sum of E alpha Z E beta plus E beta Z E alpha times del square F of del Z alpha del Z beta plus lambda times the sum of E alpha del F del Z alpha as this. Then this differential operator is independent. Natural operator is independent of the choice of the basis ER1. Next, let P1 plus minus be O3C and P2 plus minus be same3C and let K prime be U3. And let B lambda1 be the P1 plus valued differential operator on P minus, given by the orthogonal projection of B lambda onto P1 plus. Then the F method. Then the method of developed IQI spectrum states the following: that we have the isomorphism, and we have the isomorphisms among the space of symmetry operators from O lambda D to O to lambda D prime B to K check, and the space of holographic operators between the Bermud modules, and the space of K prime invariant B2K check variant polynomial on P minus, and satisfying this differential equation. Here, by the Local Net theorems, Here, by the Localness theorems, all symmetrical vacant operators in this space in a holometric setting are given by differential operators. And the isomorphism of the left-hand side and right-hand side is given by taking the single as a differential operator. Now, we want to show that if lambda is larger than pi and for partitions k, this f dump. uh this f dam lambda kg is the symbol of the different uh differential symmetry between platinums and by the by the f method it is enough to prove that f dam lambda k is a k prime invariant b to k check variant polynomial or p minus and this f dam lambda k solves this differential equation then k prime invariance follows from that by definition f down k a definition f down k l zeta z is a k prime invariant polynomial which we can check valued on p minus then it is it is enough to prove this differential equation to do this first we extend the parameter k of epsilon lambda kz to the continuous parameter namely k1 minus k2 and k2 minus k3 are positive integers and k3 or complex nine then Then we express f dam lambda kv by an integral when vr part k1 and vr part lambda plus k2 k1 plus k2 is sufficient sufficiently small. Then we prove the differential equation by the integrals by using the integral expression when the integral conversions. Then binary continuation the differential equation holds for the original region and by the f-method this becomes a simple The symbol of the differential symmetry of the game operator. First, we extend the parameter k to a continuous parameter. To do this, we recall that p1 plus minus is given by all three c and p2 plus minus is seam 3c. And the space of polynomials on p2 plus minus, seme three c is decomposed into the sum where k runs over a set of partitions with length atmosphere of pk, p2 plus minus. Here, in the following, the set. Here in the following, the set of partitions with length at most three is denoted by V3 plus plus. Then, if k is a partition, then each irreducible component pkp2 plus minus is of the form p of k1 minus k3, k2 minus k3, 0 of p2 plus minus times determinant z to the power of k3. Then, this good expression does not use that k3 is a positive integer. K3 is a positive integer. And hence, for K1 minus K2 and K2 minus K3 a positive integer, and K3 a complex number, we define PkP2 plus minus by the above this formula. Then we fix a non-zero polynomial, K2 prime, 0 check Z, in K prime invariant B2K check variant polynomial of P2 minus. But in the problem, we do not use K prime invariance, and hence we may forget K prime invariance. we may forget k-plank invariance and we may regard this polynomial as a scalar valid polynomial then we define for every k3 in a complex number we define k check k1 k2 k3 of z by multiplying determinant z to the power k3 to the fixed polynomial as this then for complex number k3 we define f dam klzeta z Define f dump kl zeta d by the formula by the same formula by the orthonormal projection onto each component of exponential minus stress of zeta shaft z over determinant t times kk check t. Then, by using this for complex number k3, we define f down lambda kz by the same formula, the sum of with l1 l2 l3 ones over this set of some explicit coefficients times f down k zeta z defined by. f dun k of zeta c defined by this then if k3 is not a positive integer then this term minus k3 sub l1 plus l2 no longer vanishes and this sum is an infinite sum but if k3 is a positive integer then this coincides with the previous definition now we have extended k to a continuous parameter next we want to find the integral expression Find the integrated specimen, this f down down the kg. To do this, we recall Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms on simple 3CR. We recall that P minus is defined as a set M3C. And let N minus be HAM3C, the space of 3 times 3 complex Hermitian matrices. And let omega be HAM plus 3C, the space at the cone positive definite Harmonian matrices. Similarly, P2 minus is defined as SIM3C and let N2 minus be SIM3C as SIM3R, the space of 3 times 3 real symmetric matrices, and let omega 2 be SIM plus 3R, the cone of positive definite symmetric matrices. Next, for complex number mu and 3, 2 plus complex numbers K, let gamma mu plus K be a constant. mu plus k be a constant multiple of the of the product of three gamma functions as this then by indicating the following holds for mu sufficiently large and for three two uh for partitions with length atmosphere and fz in pkp2 minus and w in right half plane the laplace transform the rate function fz times d times fz to the power mu minus two is equal to this blue minus 2 is equal to this blue function gamma mu plus k times fw inverse times determinant w to the power of minus mu and similarly for muffin is sufficiently large and for partitions k and fz in pkp2 minus and az in omega2 the inverse Laplace transform of the blue function gamma mu plus k times fw inverse times determinant w to the power of minus mu is equal to this red function fc determinant c to the power of mu fc determinant c to the power of mu minus two. Here, this integral does not depend on the choice of the counter if this a is the chosen from omega 2. That is, this red function, fg times determinant z to the power mu minus 2, and this blue function, gamma mu plus k times fw inverse times determinant w to the power minus mu, mutually corresponds by Laplace and the inverse. Response by Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms. Then, by the definition of F down KL zeta Z, we have that exponential minus trace of zeta shaft z times kk check z is equal to the sum where l1, l2, l3 runs over this set of f done klzetaz times determinant z to the power of l. Then, applying the previous Laplace and the inverse Laplace transform to this formula suitably, we can show the following. This formula suitably, we can show the following. For k1 and lambda plus k1 plus k2 sufficiently small, and for large z taken from omega and small a taken from omega 2, we have that if we by substituting z with x inverse into this function and multiplying the power of the determinant of x suitably and taking the in taking the inverse Laplace transform and then inverse Laplace transform, and then multiplying the power of determinant y to this, and then again taking the Laplace transform and then multiplying some ratio of gamma functions, we get this f tam lambda kt. The proof of the proposition is given explicitly by using the previous Laplace and inverse Laplace transforms. Then we have gotten the integrated We have gotten the integral expression with this function. Now, we want to prove that f dam lambda k solves this differential equation. And to prove this, it is sufficient to prove that this integral expression solves this differential equation. Recall that p rambda one is the differential operator given expressly by this formula, and by taking the orthonormal projection onto p1. By taking the original projection onto P1 plus. And hence, this is explicitly differential by time and explicitly computable. Indeed, this differential equation is proved by integration by parts. Today I omit the detail, but then by another continuation, this differential equation falls for all lambda k3, a complex number, even if this integral does not converge. integral does not converge. And by the method, this becomes a symbol of the differential symmetry of vacuum platform. And this proved the this proved the fair line on a symmetry of plate. Next, we give the outline and proof for chronographical platers. We recall that P1 plus minus is all 3C, P2 plus minus is SIM3C, and we have taken KTX as a have taken ktx as a k prime invariant b to k variant polynomial on p2 plus and let d prank check b g prime module k prime realized in the dual space p1 minus then we can show that in order to prove the kinematic on phological platforms it is enough to prove that for lambda sufficiently large and for k upon a partition and for x zeta yet in a sufficient in a appropriate In an appropriate region. The inner product of determinant I minus zeta x zeta x to the power minus lambda over two times kk of x times i minus zeta x zeta x inverse and exponential trace of zeta zeta star times the identity the identity map where the inner product is taken in the in the two r of the formal this in the smaller formula This is in a smaller almost representation with respect to the variable yet. It's given by the previously defined f of lambda k given by the sum where l123 runs over the set of this expressed constant times f of k x zeta. The theorem on holographic operators is proved by this theorem as follows. First, we can show that First, we can show that the integral corner of the holographic operator x false lambda k is given explicitly by this formula, determined I mean the eta large x star to the power minus lambda times k k check the projection p minus 2 p 2 minus of large star x times i minus zeta large x star inverse as this. Then by sending equivalential trace zeta zeta times i by this follow-up copulation. times I by this ologal calculator, then we can show that this is computed by letting C to be zero and multiplying exponential trace of C Z as this. This is proved by using the intertwining property of this F of lambda k. Then, this coloured function is computed by substituting large x with small x as this. And this red function is computed as this, and this blue function is computed as this. And this inner product is equal to the electronic value of the pair. And by using this formula, the image of the exponential trace yet zeta by the photographic copulator, we can show that this becomes this and this gives the differential expression of the phology copulator. Today, I don't give. Today, I don't give more detail. Now we want to prove this inner product. To do this, we use the two lemmas. First, determinant of i minus theta x theta x to the power minus lambda over two times kkx times i minus theta x theta x inverse is expanded as that sum where l1, l2, l3 runs over the set of this expressed coefficient times f of k lx yeta. f of k l x yet and the inner product of f of k l x yet and the exponential trace yet zeta star times the identity is equal to this expressed coefficient times f of k x2 zeta. Today I don't give the proof of these lemmas. Then by combining these lemmas we get that the inner product we want to compute is computed as first and the list First, this first term is expanded as a sum where n2 into lymph3 over the set of this expressed coefficient times this inner product. Then, this inner product is computed by the second lemma as this. Then, by reducing the denominator and numerator, we get this fraction, and this gives the symbol of the holographic populator, F al plum. symbol of the photographic populator f lambda k x zeta and we get the desired formula finally i again show the the express the expression of parallel operators and symmetric rating operators again and i end my talk thank you thank you very much so uh there's no comments So, in the case, you consider you have the localness results zero. I just wonder, in general, is there a general kind of approach to prove that the localness kind of zero? Localness solar only falls for holomorphic case. And for example, for For spectral principle series with distinction, then the localness theorem does not hold and the integral integral defines if integral operator appears. Phase is large and the bigger amount is large in the target space, and then solid phase is smaller amount. They're often local necessarily for which places. Thank you. So, just I will make sure support if, down, down. If down, down. I think that you define that function or polynomial, then you try to solve that polynomial satisfy certain differential equations by the data operator. So just I want to make sure how you define the polynomial. This is a difficult. This is this is difficult to explain, but I thought in my previous result I found I found some another expression by using some differential operator by in the following gentleman. In the following, uh, in the following in my previous result, uh, I have found some another expression of this f double lambda kz, but this is not computable, but but by looking at the expression suitably, we get an early result of this function, but this Of this function, but this this does not they this does not give the precise proof of this function. But by taking another approach, I explained it today, I find that this is precisely the defines symmetry rating predator.
