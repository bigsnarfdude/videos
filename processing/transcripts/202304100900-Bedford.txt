Okay, so here we are. So I'm thinking of invertible dynamics. So the thing about complex HMO maps, one thing is that, or HIML maps in general, that becomes new when you go to dimension two is that your mappings are inverted. Dimension one. Anyway, so Um anyway, so my own exposure to complex in-home maps was from Hubbard in 1987. I heard him just curious, it's not a problem. I'll be okay with it. As a little visual element to otherwise, yes. So, anyway, Hubbard was presenting. Anyway, Hubbard was presenting this very excitedly and trying to get everybody else interested in it. He succeeded in getting me interested in it. And he was looking at it as being a generalization of the quadratic family, the one-dimensional quadratic family. You know, it's been such an amazing success, all the things that people have been able to do in the one-dimensional case. And so, obviously, to Hubbard's point of view. So, obviously, to Hubbard's point of view, you know, wherever you want to do the same thing, dimension two, perhaps he was a little over-optimistic, thinking that you just add an extra little constant, and we'll be done by the end of the year. And so anyway, things have gone along, and now it's three takes years on you. And I'll try to give you an update on Hubbard's. So, um, So, um, I went forward two slides. Okay, so what I'm going to think about here in terms of the whole idea of going to handling maps in the first place is that you have mappings that are accessible in the sense that they're not the traditional dynamic systems of evolution of differential equations or something. They're very easy to write down, very easy to compute. Easy to write down, very easy to compute, and they have interesting dynamics that is complicated, but not so complicated you really can't say a lot of things about it. So, in fact, you know, the quadratic family, or even complex dynamics in dimension one, has got the virtue that you can say amazing things about it. It really is, you can almost say you describe it from data, and so, um. And so I'm thinking here in dimension two, we want to have something similar, something that's accessible, interesting dynamics. Just generally speaking, you could write down rational maps. In other words, here I am in two coordinates. My first coordinate is a rational mapping. My coordinates are x and y, x1, x2. And this is a rational function. I didn't write in x. Didn't write in x1, x2 in the second one just because it wasn't space, but you know, this would just be a general rational mapping. And just to remind you, what people should do, instead of complex two-space, you think of being this being projective space. And when you look in projective space, where you've got three coordinates, but they're homogeneous, so it's actually two-dimensional thing we're talking about. You write this this way, and then you come. You come, this is your mapping, this is the mapping f, and then you rewrite it in homogeneous coordinates. And then you get some, you get three polynomials here in the variables x over z and y over z. You multiply by some power of z, and then you have polynomials, and these will all be homogeneous of some desert. You want to make sure there's no common factor. Factor, of course. So that gives you your representation here. And the thing is, these are right, we want dominant by rational maps. Dimension of the image of each two. And so they have degrees. One way of defining degree is the topological degree or the mapping degree. You take the pre-image of a generic point, and this is a good quantity. It multiplies when you compose, so it's nicely suited for dynamics. Nicely suited for dynamics. Or else you could take the algebraic degree. And that's the, we have written our polynomial, we've written our mapping as three homogeneous polynomials of the same degree. And so we, of course, remove any common factors because we need to. And if we talk about the degrees of these guys, these are the same as taking a generic line and pulling it back by looking at the degrees. Falling back by looking at the degree of that curve. Or actually, if you're in complex two-dimensional space, you encounter all these facts of complex magic. If you put the Fourier studiometric on P2, the degree of an algebraic curve is actually there. Beautiful. And but then if we look at the algebraic degree, when we compose two mappings, or a mapping with this. Two mappings, or a mapping with itself, you could easily pick up common factors, and so that means that your algebraic degree is sub-multiplicative. So what we want to do, well, we want to consider the dynamical degree. Here I've just drawn you a little picture saying that, you know, if you paid your money to come here for their own maps, then I'm selling you birational maps. And I'm selling you biorational maps. You may pay somebody's money back already. Handled maps are clearly going to be inside the family of birational maps. And I'm going to be making a pitch that when you're considering henone maps in the same thought space, you should also be thinking about compact surface automorphisms since they. Since they have a lot of features in common with end-on maps and they introduce a lot of interesting new phenomena. Anyway, so gotten into complaints yet. So dynamical degree is the thing you would want to be looking at. The degree of a map in itself is not relevant, actually, if you take any HANO maps. Take a Hano map, say, and you conjugate it with another Hano map, you've got something conjugate to it, so it'll have the same dynamics. But when you conjugate it, in general, you can produce yourself some other mapping that's conjugate to it of a very, very high degree. But the only thing that's important here is dynamical degree. We want to take the nth root of the algebraic degree of the nth iterate and take the limit as n goes to infinity. N goes to infinity, this is obviously going to be less than the algebraic degree. My opinion is, especially after the more I hear people tell me about dynamical degree, well, that's I realize I know about it. It's clearly a very mysterious number. But if we're in the case of birational maps of dimension two, we're in good shape because Diller-Fav showed us that this algebraic degree, the dynamical degree is algebraic. Degree, the dynamical degree is algebraic, and it's a birational invariant. So it's clearly something we want. And just it's just to emphasize that it's a mysterious number. You always think of a degree as being an integer of a couple of degrees, like me. But if you have a compact surface automorphism, and if the dynamic of the degree is bigger than one, then it's automatic. Degree is bigger than one, then it's automatically irrational. So is it possible to produce examples in which it's not algebraic? You've got Jeff Diller right here. Yes, they have, but this would be for a rational map, not invertible, not birational, but for a rational map, Diller, Johnson, just looking to see if Johnson has to be here. Pardon me? Oh, Holly, yes, yes. And I was looking to see if I was, yeah, so I'm still looking for Matthias. Okay, okay. Anyway, they showed that you have a rational mapping with a transitional dynamical degree. Now, if I were going to say it's weird, then it's mysterious. That's the case closed. It's transcendental. Closed. It's transcendental. It's transcendental enough numbers for me to understand. Anyway, so we want to be looking at mappings with dynamical degree bigger than one. If we have a, so if we're, so for canon maps, we're looking at maps of CT, so sort of the topology is not. Is not doing much in some sense. But if we have compact surface automorphisms, we definitely have an action on homology and cohomology. And saying dynamical degree is bigger than one means that there is some eigenspace in homology or cohomology that gets expanded. And so that means then, for instance, like for homology, you know, there's a fact of linear algebra. But you know, it's a fact of linear algebra. If you have an eigenvalue, in this case, it'll be an eigenvalue bigger than one. So everybody, almost every homology class gets sucked into this eigenvector as a bitery forward. So this tells you that if you take just a generic two-manifold, two real-dimensional manifold inside your surface, in forward time, its area will grow exponentially. Grow exponentially. And also the dynamical degrees gives the entropy. So how do you get to Hangon maps in the first place? So I'm going to now do a little bit on Hanoi maps. So they're automorphisms of CT, polynomial automorphisms. And they're hundreds of. They're obviously among the birational maps. And if you're looking for dynamics, you're looking for conjugate sequences. I guess this next line with this audience may be the most useless line you can imagine. I've written it head-oh maps this way. The only possible thing I could be saying is that Hubbard writes it the other way around. But this is the way Friedland and Milwaukee write it. Friedland and Milwaukee write it. And so, what they say is that if you have any polynomial automorphisms, so they're answering the question, would you want to do dynamics on polynomial automorphisms? And if you did, what automorphisms would you study? Well, you're going to look inside of a conjugacy class. The conjugacy classes are huge because you're conjugated by polynomial automorphisms, and there are a lot of them. Marshaums and there are a lot of. And so, what they say is that if you have the dynamical degree bigger than one, then, in fact, we're probably not going to holomorphisms that integer. And, in fact, in the conjugacy class, it's going to be conjugate, conjugacy class will contain a finite proposition of limits. And furthermore, And furthermore, when you represent it as Henolm maps, this composition is unique more or less up to the permutation of these HENON maps. And then the Henome maps also have this nice feature that their own dynamical degree is the same as their degree. So, that gets us launched on the Hang on Maps. And so, for my talk, I'm going to sort of Make the pitch that if I were to redo Hubbard's talk 36 years later, I would say there are actually two very interesting quadratic families that people should be studying. There's the quadratic henomapse, and also we should be considering the cremona involution with the rest of the standard. The standard hormonal involution that inverts all the coordinates. And in dimension one is what it is. In dimension two, it happens to be a map of degree two. And so you can consider these maps and you can consider three by three matrices. You know, you can take first apply J and then multiply it by matrix. So, your first question is: certainly, what am I talking about? Are there any such things? In other words, this is, if you look at it, this is a rational map that has points of indeterminacy. So this is not a holomorphic map, which is not a holomorphic map, projective space. But in fact, several people have worked on this and inside this family there. Inside this family, there really are quite a lot of all the ones that you have to choose L correctly. But if you choose L correctly, then what you have will be a mapping that has singularities on P2. But if you replace P2 by something with, by blowing up some points on this moon, and you lift it up to this new manifold, you actually have an almost. But you know there are some, but we don't, it's really completely unknown. What is everything? What is everything at all? Okay. Anyway, so the idea is to think about the dynamics of these mappings. Okay, we're going to be looking at your own maps for surface automorphisms. In every case, the topological degree is one, so the dynamical degree is going to be. So, the dynamical degree is going to be bigger than the topological degree. So, if we're going to be looking at pre-images, the thing we want to be looking at is pre-images of something one-dimensional. So, if I say one-dimensional, I mean one complex dimensional, and sometimes when my mood changes, I will call it two-dimensional to real-dimensional. But anyway, we're looking at one, pulling back one-dimensional objects and And what we want to do is not simply geometrically pulling these things back. We want to consider them as currents. And this is the, in other words, we're considering them as elements of the dual space of the set of test two forms. And so what is a current? Well, it's an element of the dual space, so it's defined by its action on a two-form. So complex, another piece of complex magic, complex curve in a complex surface has a canonical orientation. See, normally when you go to define a current of integration, you have to specify orientation, but orientation is the word given to us in articles. And so we've got a current of integration, and if we're asking how do they converge, well, Asking how do they converge? Well, no, it's this very weak sense that you know. It just means that these games, the integrals, are going to converge to that limit current. So it's a very weak sense of convergence. It's ironic since the theory of currents was invented some while back and it was invented for the purpose of studying minimal surfaces. Studying minimal surfaces. So you look at surfaces that have decreasing area, and you want to have some way of discussing a limit of them. And so that leads to theory of rectifiable currency stuff. And we're looking at exactly the opposite kinds of currents. But anyway, we're happy to have currents. So suppose I'm looking at some birational Looking at some birational map. Well, going back, I think CBD was the main driving force to look at for rational maps. You want to have some invariant currents. Well, you're looking on projective space for what he was looking at. You're looking at maybe invariant queries of harmonic proteins. But the point is that you when the dynamic, oh, I think I left out the opposite. Oh, I think I left out the obvious hypothesis. I want to have a three bigger than one. Anyway, well, I guess in Stevens' case, he was looking at mappings that had a dynamical integer. Well, see here. Yeah, delta, let delta be bigger than one. And the thing is sort of a general fact that there's always an invariant current. There's always an invariant current that An invariant current that is positive and closed, but invariant means you pull it back and it multiplies by your number d. And now, if you take any smooth, now in this world they call them Kayla metrics, take any positive Kayla metric, pull it back, and it'll give you a positive multiple of the same thing. So, this is defining a unique unique ray in current space. Space, and in fact, for almost every complex line, you take the pullbacks and divide by d, delta, the right normalization. In other words, here you're pulling back something or other, and when you're pulling it back, the thing's getting larger and larger, so you're compensating by normalizing by the degree. And take this a generic line, and it also converges to It also converts mapping. And now, today it's a hypothesis, a special case, but I want to look at convertible mapping. So we can also look at the dynamical degree of the inverse, and it'll also be bigger than one. And for the mappings I'm talking about, the degree of F and the degree of F inverse are the same. So let me give you the. So, let me give you an example of this. So, I want to give an example that was actually studied in quite a great bit of detail, maybe 20 years ago. It's called the Golden Bee something or other. This is a birational map. If you think about that a little bit, it's exactly in the form of a Henold map, almost exactly in the form of a Henold map. You can see as long as A. You can see as long as a is not equal to minus one, if a is equal to minus one, it degenerates. But otherwise, it's a nice family of maps. And if a is less than minus one, well, in every case, well, in generic cases, the dynamical degree is the golden mean. And here, we're taking the case A is less than minus one, and we're taking just a general line. We're writing this map. We're writing this map, we're interpreting this map here in P1 cross P1. So this is this interval down below is supposed to be a circle. So it's RP1 of the circle. And the vertical is a circle. You pull this guy back, and as we are pulling, so a line has a length one in space. You pull it back, and the length of the pullbacks grow by delta to the n. And so And so, this is a case where the real picture illustrates the complexity. So, I said, so what is the current? Where is the current? Well, the current is supported on this picture, this lamination. Well, it's a lamination that's accepted a couple of, you know, some singular points, but it's a lamination. And so, what And so, what does a current do? It gives, it measures this lamination. So, this current measures this lamination. So, let me look at this portion up here. Let me look at that portion up there. The set of curves going through that is one and That is one, and this portion of lines and that portion of lines, this one has that is proportionate according to golden, and then you break it up again to the next generation, this portion and that portion, are proportionate, self-proportioned to the golden medium, etc., etc., etc. So you can see how I can figure out exactly what the transversal measure is on the set of lines coming through there. And so, I mean, I'm just trying to illustrate, you know, in our dream of. I've not quite understood what you said. Okay. So, so. What is the mass of the top left and what is the mass of the bottom left? That's the question. But it's a proportion that I forget, but related to the golden mean, and they add up to one. So this is something, and that's one minus a potato. So, you know, think of it, you know, like Bernoulli tried. Sorry, I forgot the name. You're younger and your brain still works. So I gave you the real picture. In the complex case, the idea of having an invariant current is that it gives you something very But it gives you something very, very nice. The stable manifold, take a saddle point, okay? I put an asterisk on top of the saddle because, I mean, it's possible in the case of surface automorphisms, it's possible that the stable manifold could be an eigenvalue curve. But this can't happen more than a finite number of times. It's an exceptional thing. But otherwise, so it means that this is not going to be. So, it still means that this is not going to be algebraic. But I have a sample point. If I take a little disk around the sample point, its three integers are going to fill out the whole state of the math. And if I look at the currents of integration, and I pull them back and normalize them correctly, I'm just going to converge to the stable current. If I take an unstable disk, I'll let. Disk, pull it back, normalize, that'll converge to some multiple of the unstable current. So the kind of currents we're looking at are the currents that came from, you know, well, if I look at these things inside of C2, in fact, any complex thing is minimal, but as I pull back, then it comes. So it's a stacking up of minimal surfaces and it carries a very nice structure of the current. There we go. And in fact, these currents do have a laminar structure, although in general, laminar structure means that locally. Parameter structure means that locally it looks like a product. You can have things misbehaving in ways that I can't really know. I don't know how they could misbehave, but surely they do. But in the sense of measure theory, you've got true laminarity. Okay, now if we look at birational maps, which is what I'm suggesting, this all should be seen as. Should be seen as just phenomenon inside the birational world. Birational maps have points of indeterminacy. So these are discontinuities of a very specific kind, namely points blow up to curves. So it's not just a jump or something, it's actually look at a small neighborhood of a point, it acts as a small neighborhood of a curve. And so it's If we look at birational maps with dynamical degree bigger than one, well, we are hoping to do dynamics, but and it's a problem if there's a point of indeterminacy, so something bloods up. But the big problem that screws up the study of dynamics is it could be that you have indeterminacy for the inverse. Indeterminacy for the inverse. For that indeterminacy for the inverse, that when you map it forward, or when you indeterminacy for F, when you map it backward, if they want to conflict with each other in order to either land on each other or get very close, that screws up what we want to do. But the hypothesis is if they stay, don't approach each other too rapidly, then in fact you can define intersection. Intersection product of stable and unstable currents. And that gives you a measure that has properties of the previous case. And in fact, the Lyampenoff exponents are bigger, you know, bounded away from zero. So in fact, this is a hyperbolic molecule. So you can apply Petzen theory and get stable and stable molecules. Stable from stable model. Uh do we know something about uh uh the case when lambda u is log lamb log delta over two and lambda s is minus, so if you want yeah yeah yeah yeah I I um yes, but I don't know why it's keeping the kitchen. Okay, ace or something, but of the Okay, so hopefully there are uh the ones going from uh are right right so right so for all morphisms uh yeah this it's it's a special case. I need I can since I'm speaking now just to it that's not it's still not here. It's still not known that usually we need to measure like oh yes yes yes no random case, except in empty case. Yes, yes, yes, right. So let me, yeah. I meant to point out important things that were not yet known. I should have pointed out here that in the handle, in the previous case that I had mentioned. So in, well, anyway, I guess it's the next, sorry, I got confused by the buttons where. Okay, here I am. Anyway, we've got this guy in the Henon case and in the surface automorphism. Case and in the surface automorphism case, this is the unique measure of maximal entropy. And as Romaine reminded me, I should have said it's not known in general here. If I was doing this on my iPad, I could write that right in there for you. Well, that's what tell us again. So, just to draw in the golden mean case. Case. This was the stable lamination. This is the unstable lamination. This particular, the golden mean map was something that came up from mathematical physics, and it's reversible. So its inverse looks like itself when you just flip the coordinates. So if So, if we go to look at the induced measure, what is the measure? Well, I told you what the measure on the current puts a certain amount of measure on this set of leaves, and it puts a certain amount of measure on that set of leaves. And so the measure puts the product of those two things on this set of intersection points. So, it's exactly what you might imagine. Exactly what you might imagine if you were saying, I've got a lamination, crossing a lamination, I have a measure here, I'm measure here. When I cross them with a product measure, then I take this measure, I use that measure, and that gives me the measure for seven sections. Okay. Oh yeah, so we have the discussion about real versus complex. Discussion about real versus complex. For instance, this golden mean map that I just now showed you was a map where the support or the this invariant measure is supported inside of the real points. So what that means actually is that the map is a the dynamics is real or the dynamics are real and I don't know how to answer that. But for instance, if you have a point, P1, whoops, my fat, thin finger, I just pushed the wrong button there. If I take a saddle point here and I look at its complex stable manifold, and I look at its complex unstable manifold, and I intersect those things, then I mean all those intersection points. I mean all those intersection points are going to be the type of intersection. That's something that you can get a lot of mileage out of. Here I'm saying, so the real dynamics are informed by the complex dynamics. So here I've said the dynamics are, and I've said the dynamics is. So I've been right at least once. Least once. So here we can, you know, studying this map, you're doing something that you might call enumerative dynamics. And that is, you need to prove something or other. You've got some curve, like a student or something, and you map it, and you want to know what it is doing, how does it cost something else. You can, when you're doing this, you have chosen things so that you know that this. That you know that this real thing intersects that real thing so many times. What you can also do is know what these are doing in homology, and that tells you the homological intersection. And in the complex world, the homological intersection is the same as the complex intersection. With the additional thing that, when you're looking at complex multiplicities, they're all Complex multiplicities that are all positive. And for instance, if you know by counting that the intersection has to, intersection number has to be one, that tells you that it can't intercept elsewhere. And this intersection has to be transversal. So in studying a map like this, we've got a lot of advantage because the measure, you know, the measure of maximum is actually inside the. Maximum enthalpy is actually inside the grid. So now I'm, this is the thing. It goes to the Hanone case and, oh, no, I still haven't said u detuse. I'll do it. But here's the measure mu. If you take the sample points and you take their closure, that's exactly the supportive mu. That's exactly the supportive mu. And if you look at all the saddle points and look at their point masses and sum them up, normalize, you get the measure mu. And finally, if you look at any kind of class where you're intercepting a this is complex stable manifold. Complex stable manifold and complex unstable manifold, their closure is exactly the support of it. So the measure μ has an important dynamical consequence. Now, if we go to discuss the dynamics of these mappings, we have the two sets. We're going to be the forward or the backward iterates are a normal family. And their complements are the Julia sets. Julia sets. And then we get another Julia set by intersecting the forward and the backward Julia set. And in fact, in the surface automorphism case, well, also in the Halo case, but in the surface automorphism case, it's not trivial that the support of the stable. That the support of the stable and unstable manifolds are exactly the Julia sets if you allow considerate modulo finite animal. And but you know the support of mu is an important thing, so you would think that should be a Julian set. So you know so that's clearly some important kind of dynamical set, and if you clearly inside of J, but is it actually the whole thing? And that is. That is something that I would say back in 1987, I was discussing with Sebani, and we had heard Hubbard's talk. And our response to Hubbard's talk was, well, you know, these complex henome maps are really interesting. Complex henome maps are really interesting things, but Hubbard not looking at the right thing. Next slide. Anyway, Hubbard is looking at the green function. He's all excited about the green functions. But we thought, well, he ought to be excited about the current, DDC, the green function. And we obviously know that you can intersect currents. And what we're wondering is the support of the intersection. intersection is the support of that measure the same as the supporting support the intersection is the intersection of the supports the support of the intersection and we scratched our heads and and i don't you know it's still a mystery so um anyway let's get back to the thing that's special about neuromaps in the complex case is we have um things but points Points that are escaping to infinity go in a super exponential rate, so we can define a green function. And when you've got a green function, you want to know what measure of what does it come from. So DDC is the two-dimensional analog of the Laplacian. So we apply DDC. We have these sets that are straightforward. That are straightforward analogs of what people define for polynomials in dimension one. Set downward, forward, backward orbits, the escape locus, and j. And this g plus is the green function of u plus. And the set u plus is a very interesting set. And Very interesting for complex analysis. This is the escape locus, and it's by I didn't write this down correctly as a theorem, but at the beginning, Hubbard believed that this was going to have to be true, and it's ultimately been proved that the bi-holomorphic character of U plus. Character of U plus determines the mapping. And G plus also, I can take round D since it's clearly harmonic, round D is a holomorphic one form that defines a foliation on the escape robes. Forward and the backward escape loci have foliations on them, which is interesting foliation. You've got the tangent seed locus between these. Between these two foliations, that's critical locus. And the green function leads to a butcher coordinate, which is very important for understanding the dynamics. And finally, the green function leads to external rays and it leads. So what about the bunch of coordinate? Well, when I go to define the green function, I can look at this v minus. It's the escape locus. It's a special, nicely behaved set inside the escape locus. It's invariant. Because it's invariant under F. And we're going to look at the definition of the butcher coordinate. And what do I have here? You can see that the butcher, so I've got K plus drawn in green and J minus drawn in blue. I'm going to look at the case where my mapping is positively contracted. I'm going to look at the dissipative case. And then in that case, Is a faitative case, and then in that case, v minus can have no interior, but I've got j minus, and I have the button coordinate defined on the on v minus, but not on j minus. So in the one-dimensional case, you're looking at the The complement of the filled Julia set. If this Julia sets connected, you can extend your butcher coordinate to the whole complement of a Feld-Julia set. What can we do in the Hanome case? Okay, well, the complement of the Feld-Julia set should be conceived of as J minus part sine of K. Outside of k and it's a theorem that if you have a dissipative map and if j is connected, then in fact phi plus extends all the way down to the part of the blue that I've drawn and not to the orange part. But anyway, this is very nice because what is going to be our model the um In the one-dimensional case, you look at z goes to w goes to w to d, that's the model and the complement of the disk. Well, in the two-dimensional case, we need something that's invertible. So we just, instead of looking at the complement of the disk, we look at the complex solenoid, which is the projective limit of that mapping on the complement of the disk. And where I've just sort of drawn one was saying. What I'm looking. So, this is a set of bi-infinite sequences that are like this: that's the complex solenoid. And if I take, if I raise the dth power, then I'm the shift map. And so if I can extend if I can extend phi plus, if I can extend phi plus to the whole complement of K plus, I mean, in J inside of J, if I can, sorry, if I can extend phi plus. Sorry, if I can extend phi plus to there, then I have a canonical mapping to my canonical model. So that's sort of nice. But so that's this mapping here. But in fact, if my mapping is also hyperbolic, Is my mapping is also hyperbolic. Hyperbolicity is a thing that I don't know exactly what to say. It's very useful and it makes you feel good. You're mapping it hyperbolic. And so if I look at the mapping zeta versus zeta the m, I've got this. This en-fold branch color in here. And the theorem is that there is some end, the lift, to something so you have a conjugacy. So this also is a remaining question. Do you actually have to lift? To lift, and if you do have to lift, where in the world does this number M come from? Anyway, so that's so there is a canonical model here, which I think is just sort of as canonical as the butcher coordinate. That's the one we at least we, I believe in the butcher coordinate in dimension one, it's we thing, but uh and this is the analytic continuation of it, and it works in dimension two. And it works in dimension two, but but do you have to lift so since we have our complex solenoid as our model, we're also going to have external rays. What does a complex solenoid look like? Well, it looks like the real solenoid crossed with the real interval to infinity. And so And so we clearly have rays inside the complex solenoid. And we, the inside of J minus, we also have complex unstable manifolds. It's a theorem that, in fact, J minus minus K is a Riemann surface family. And so the gradient lines defined by Gradient lines defined by G plus are our external arrays. And so if we have a dissipated hyperbolic map and J is connected, then in fact the external arrays land and the landing map is finite. So this is just like the one-dimensional case where you have the circle and you take the external arrays land and give you j as a finite quotient of the circle. And but you include this back in. What do you put as the fact that? Oh, by finite? Yes, yes, that's what I mean to say. Yes, yes. By finite, I mean that for every point, only finitely many rays are identified. But of course, this happens at infinitely many places. So clearly, there is something that should be investigated. Can you actually? Investigate it, can you actually execute this theorem in some example? In other words, can you apply this theorem in some example? Is there some example where you can say, what is that quotient? And of course, it's known that if you have a one-dimensional mapping of connected Julia set uniformly expanding and you make a small perturbation to a two-dimensional map, then you know that that will be. Then you know that that will be hyperbolic, and you can say that the J minus in the Hinon case is the projective limit of J minus in the one-dimensional case. But except for that. So this has, so actually one of the things that Hubbard was doing back in the day was drawing computer pictures. Computer pictures, and so you can take a saddle point and draw an unstable manifold. Well, you just draw a disc in the unstable manifold, and you intersect it with K plus, and the intersection with K plus here is black. And what he does is he has, he's looking at things escaping, and when they reach a certain level, And when they reach a certain level to escape, they're either in the upper half plane or in the lower half plane. The upper half plane is white, the lower half plane is green. And as you iterate more and more, you escape into period of time and you draw this picture. So, this picture actually, the picture that Hubbard was always drawing, is actually very useful because your eye can follow Can follow what must be the level sets of the green function, and it can also follow what must be the level sets of the harmonic conjugate. So this picture gives you a lot of information. And furthermore, if you look at these red curves, the red curves are gradient lines of the green function. And so the This was worked on by a lot of people, but in particular, and I took this picture from the thesis of Ricardo Oliva. And he figured out actually how to draw a very good picture of a gradient line. The trick, of course, is to let the gradient line go all the way until it hits the k because then the green function is singular. So following So, following a gradient line to a single point takes doing, but he drew this and he, you know, you look at this line and 0, 1, 1, 0, etc. He can look at that line and read off what point that represents on the solenoid. It was a solenoid. The real solenoid is coded by binary sequences of zeros and ones. You have the picture that tells you. The picture that tells you what the identifications ought to be, and so it gives you a very, very nice way of starting to get your hands on what should these questions do. Anyway, so I said, can this be proved? Maybe I should have said some other question like, can you have some understanding of what the possible quotients of the solar molecule look like? Just a quick question. So as in the one-dimensional case, are the landing of these grades also section off like a proportion of the measure that is? Oh, yeah, yeah. So if we're looking at the green function here, okay, at the green function, then the measure d theta coming in from infinity is the harmonic measure. And so this coding. So this coding here, so how much the harmonic conflict has changed tells me how much harmonic number in the examples that we got that Liba calculated, is it how many gold to body? Or does she look at this all about it? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think he asked that question. I don't know. I'm sorry. I never thought about it. That's actually a question that we should have. We need to go find it and ask them. Eric explained that we don't know whether M and V, but there are some computers. Right. Experiments would be good. I would assume M is one. I would assume M is one. But I didn't ever think about that. In other words, I think that Ricardo is looking at the naive. This is the naive picture, assuming that it's one. But is it actually one? Is this naïve picture actually? Is this naive picture actually? Yes. Oh, I have an answer to it. I have an example of a public complex in a map, which is hyperbolic. With connected Julia C. With connected Julia Carson, I mean other two. Yeah, so it has a two-doctor cycle cycle sort of which value of zero. Yes, okay, exactly. So, um, let me back up here. Hello? Uh, where is this? Um, so, in other words, Utaka is telling me that. Telling me that your example, which is from a few years back, you call it a non-planar example. It's hyperbolic and it has connected Julia set. And so that would be a thing where we can apply this theory. Did you actually write the pulchant? No, yeah. Okay, okay, so. Okay, okay, so so this question is okay on your to-do list. Well, you know, if we get snowed in here, we might have three or four lists. This example of the value is the same. Oh, um, oh, oh, Yutaka, are you actually looking at one of exactly Ricardo's examples? No, no, no. Examples, or no, no, no, see, but the thing is, this is an example of something or other that has a sink of period two. Um, so it has a sink of period one and three. Oh, well, yours does. Mine is a period two and three. Two and three. Oh, no, I'm sorry. This just simply has a sink of period two. This thing is a period two here. So this is sort of up. Is sort of up from the basilica. It's a few perturbations up from the basilica. And yours, and I guess, then must be much further up from the basilica. And so yours already has a single board of order of three states. Oops, oops, where am I? Okay, so so then. So then but I'm thinking even so so your case is probably harder because yours is bigger Jacobian, I think. This Jacobian is very close to zero, but it's clearly different from the silicon case. And even in this case, it's hard to say. It's hard to say what the pollution is. Okay. Okay. So let me think now about the other quadratic family. So any last words about Henon maps or is the subject of Henon maps completely cleared up? I want to go back to this other thing I'm calling the other quadratic family. If I look at this mapping J. Mapping J, I can look upon it as being a nice geometric picture. It's an inversion in the triangle. Namely, the side where z is equal to zero goes to the gets collapsed to a point. So here this hypotenuse of this triangle is entirely collapsed at that red point. Entirely collapses that red point. And the red point blows up to that z equal zero. So that's what happens to that side of the triangle. And the same thing happens to this side of the triangle. This horizontal y equal to zero maps up to that point. And this point blows up to that line. So it's an inversion in all three sides of the triangle. I just didn't want to draw all three at once. One and draw all three at once before. I knew if you saw one side, you'd probably know everything. Now, there is a criterion for having an automorphism. So the criterion is this. And I think what I want to do is actually block it. Use all these colors. So the picture is like this. Here's my very much blackened colour. This is my projective space P2 and I'm looking at some I'm looking at a map, and this map has got some curve, and the curve is going to map forward to some point, and then this point may map over, and then this point then itself is going to blow up. So, this is a symbolic picture of what my mapping. Picture of what my mapping L composed with J is doing. And I'm wondering if I could turn this into an automorphism. And the answer is yes, if it's L composed with J. I'm going to make a new space I'll call X and I'm going to take this black point and I'm going to blow it up. Going to blow it up. So, what you want to take the process of blowing up is an algebraic process, quadratic process. The map coming down is just the simple map S and T go down to the map S S T. That is simple as can be. But I have a new manifold upstairs. In other words, if I'm totally in the complement of purple and Purple, and I'm totally in the complement at this point. Everything is completely equivalent, so I've got a projection coming down projection, and the projection is a biholomorphic, biholomorphism outside of the purple. And so the biholomorphism lifts the blue curve up to something or other, and it lifts the red curve up to something or other. Curve up to something or other. And in my new map upstairs, in my new map upstairs, this guy is no longer singular, and I have an automorphism upstairs. Now, it's a little bit. So, in general, if I have my rational map down here in P2, I can do a bunch of blow-ups. I can do a bunch of blow-ups and make something or other upstairs, but the fact that I'm able to blow up just once and it becomes non-singular is special to this, the fact that I'm looking at a very, very special map, J. So, you know, so you can ask, is this going to give me a lot of, does this kind of thing give me a lot of automorphisms? So I'm looking at this side. That this side maps to a point, and then I apply L, and that point, you know, this side maps to the red, red and or L maps to some point, and then F will map that point to a point to point to point. Is it possible to arrange for that point to end up on one of these vertices? I want that to happen for all three sides. Is that possible? Well, you certainly have enough, you have enough unknowns to believe. Unknowns to believe that you've got room to work because L is a three by three matrix and you've got nine entries, it's an objective space, and you lose some freedom from that, but still you're trying to make try to control the orbits of three points. So I mean you figure, well, this got to be a piece of cake because I've got something or other. Where is F? Where is F? F. Here's F. L is a coefficient of F, and I iterate it, and I get some expression, and the expression that this lands on a vertex is just going to be some polynomial and though it's variables. So all I have to do is solve some polynomial equations. But unfortunately, that's not quite so straightforward, but it can be made to work. But it can be made to work. So I'm going to be considering this kind of picture, except I'm supposing that the criterion holds that every one of these sides, orbits, bang, hits a vertex. Bang, bang. Okay. And then I'm going to blow up all three of those orbits. I'm going to be blowing up some number. And in fact, The number is going to have to be at least 10 because I'm going to want, no matter what the number is, I'm going to get an automorphism, but I want my automorphism to have dynamical degree bigger than one. So that means I'm going to have to blow at least 10 points. That's part of it here. Anyway, so if, but what is there's a trick involved. The trick is that you That we require that you've got some cubic in your space, and all these points are going to have to lie on that curve. They're all going to have to lie on that curve. And in fact, that a priori makes it seem like you put in too many restrictions and you might not get anything. But actually, putting this restriction on here means On here means that wherever my triangle is, I can't even draw it now, it will intersect this curve in three points. Seems like I can't count. But when I map this side of the triangle forward, I'm going to map to some point, and wherever that point goes, that'll be the point will have to, if the curve is. To, if the curve is in very decent curves, point curves, you'll have to so it's going to have to map in the curve. So it actually is very reasonable to try this kind of thing. So you're going to, anyway, it turns out that you get some condition, but I'm still okay. I was lucky that you came. I was looking at you people looking very worried. Old applause. Why are you about the desktop? Because they teleport on the ships. Okay. Okay. What am I talking about? Oh, yeah. So the thing is, so there's a theorem that says if you, but the thing is, you can specify also how long you go until you land on a. How long do you go until you land on a vertex? And these are these numbers, n1, n2, n3, and they call these orbit lengths. And if you give your orbit data, so you have the orbit lengths, plus the permutation, which decides which vertices you're going to land on, that data specifies some polynomial. And it's a select polynomial, meaning its roots are, there'll be one root less than one, one root bigger than one. Be one root less than one, one root bigger than one, and all the rest of the roots have modular spot. And, well, actually, so there's a little redundancy here. This map, well, each root is going to give us an automorphism. And in fact, there is a formula for how to construct the matrix L and just the that you choose this root and or the irrational of each integral. and there'll be a rational each entry entry entry each entry in L would be a rational function of these roots and so in fact the this mapping will be essentially the inverse of that and you're going to have the this is a polynomial the integer polynomial there's going to be delta and delta conjugate so in fact there in some sense if you consider In some sense, if you consider f and f inverse to be sort of a pair, there are half as many pairs about them. Anyway, you have a lot of maps. And so let's go back and find ourselves in the world of birational maps. So, what about this approach by counting parameters? This nine parameter, you have six equations. Chance. So, can you get automatic just by noting that you forget about the queue? I can't give you a fax answer to the deep, but the answer is counting parameters is nice when everything is transversal. Or, you know, when you have some uh Jeff, what's the answer? What is the difficult translator? I actually don't have it. You know, this is something that we've been implicitly trying to do and we have not succeeded. We would have been so happy. See, you could get in any way, I don't know the answer. So, yes. Are the roots of the polynomial the points on the cubic? Or any what's the oh no no no no no they're they're um the roots of the polynomial the points on the cubic are some rational expression in the roots well you you choose one root and then the points on the on the three points in the cubic will be something if you really want to know you actually should ask young here you should ask Jeff so but yeah Jeff. So, but yeah, go ahead. Yeah. I'm not the big expert on this. I'm just, you know, they just asked me to speak because I'm the oldest person in the room. So where are we here? We're in birational maps. We've got the polynomial automorphisms. We've got the surface automorphisms. And then constructing these particular automorphisms I'll be describing, we have an invariant curve. I was describing, we have an invariant curve. If P is the polynomial inclined curve, we have a meromorphic two-form, eta. And the mappings that were discussed by Dilbert's theorem there are all of this form. They pull back the two forms, multiply by some constant. And that's exactly like the Hanone map. The Hanone map, if we apply it, pull back the volume. Apply it, pull it back, pull back the volume flow, we're going to get some polynomial times the volume fluid. This is a non-vanishing polynomial that has to be constant. And so, but also when you look in projective space, look at dx dy, well that's got a pole of order 3 infinity. So we're looking at something that our complex known maps have an invariant curve, namely the line of infinity, of order 3 since. Of order three, since that's the poll of order three is dx to y. Um, what's this here? Oh yeah, so um oh yeah, so I guess what I said previously was this is this is this is Jeff's method. He looks at parametrizing C. The orbits of our condition all have to be in C, and so In C, and so it reduces things to a problem trying to points in the complex plane. And so then that becomes a simple one-dimensional problem. By simple, I mean solvable. And the thing that gets constructed, that map, is going to multiply this two-form by the end. So we're in some. So in these. We're in some so in these mappings, we're actually something um very close to Henley maps because we have the invariant we're preserving an invariant volume. What makes um Henle and map within all polynomials preserve the line at infinity, I mean all polynomial automorphisms preserve, preserve, you know, multiply the volume form by some constant and preserve the line at infinity. But the thing that makes you know gets GNOME maps their character is. Gets going on maps their character is when we map forward, we map to one point, when we map backwards, we map to another point, and that is the characteristic of Hamilton maps. And also, the other condition is that L itself is super attractive. So, we're looking at mappings that have inside of P2 birational. inside of P2 by rational mappings that have an invariant curve that's super attractive. So that makes hanone, that makes a Hanone map a Henome map a Hanone map. Okay. So we can use the invariant curve instead of the green function, and I meant to rewrite this slide to say we can also use the topology of f. Also, use the topology of f because every time every time we do a blow-out, okay, we construct a new manifold. This, we've done something that's very, very interesting. This guy is a non-trivial element of homology, and this purple line is a complex curve, but it's rigid in the sense that if you go, you can't perturb it to anything. If you go to perturb it, it won't be. Be complex. You could perturb it to be a smooth thing, but not a complex thing. Or if you just want to think about it algebraically, you know, this blowing up is defined over any field. You can, if you go to perturb it, you can't perturb it to be something algebraic. And so the point is that when we've blown up at least 10 times, there's actually already a two-dimensional. A two-dimensional homology class here, if we blow up 10 times, we've got 10 more. So the dimension of the second homology is not 11. So there actually is topology to be used. So suppose we do this. If we take t bigger than 1, then actually the multipliers inside here at this The multipliers at the cusp point are t to the minus 2, t to the minus 3, so the cusp point is attractive. And so McMullen showed that in this case, whenever you've got an invariant curve like this, if t is bigger than 1, well, it's clear that it's attracting, he showed that the basin of attraction is the whole full volume, okay? Full volume. Okay, we showed that it has full volume, so that means the forward per two set is dense. But, um, by the way, it's not, you know, obviously, if you're expanding volume, you would expect that it's, you might think this is trivial. It's not really trivial because in this picture here, this curve, that's the pole set of your volume to move. So, anything containing, so this, you know, the fact that. So, this, you know, the fact that we're there means just any neighborhood at this point has anything fired. So, you can't cheat. Anyway, so what about the other direction? What about the other direction? Well, here's an example that I like very much. This is the case 118. And so we have a triangle here. This is our... So we have a triangle here. This is our triangle. And sigma naught goes to this point, sigma beta goes to that point, sigma gamma goes to zero, and zero goes to one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. This black point is seven. And this is the cusp, so we have a basin of attraction. And that will have full area, full bottom. And under the inverse, we'll presumably Go back to the blue is presumably some kind of repellent, but the question is. So, this is, by the way, both of these, this is a real mapping. So, this is actually a real picture. In other words, I can blow up real projective space just as easily as complex projective space. In fact, well, complex projective space, it takes a real slice. That's also the core, the real core, the real projective space. Anyway, so this, but as you know, RP2 is non-orientable. RP2 is non-orientable. So, when I do that in real case, I get a real compact surface that's not orientable. Anyway, so it's interesting to try to know what kind of attractor this will be. This blue. Rather, a repellent attractor to the inverse. Let me look at something else. One. One means beta lands on a vertex. Data lands on a vertex. So that links to that orbit was one. We're already there. Sigma naught lands on that vertex, so it's one. And then sigma gamma came to zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So this numeration is back when Kyung-hee and I were looking at this slightly differently, and we thought of the number seven for some other reason. There's some other reason for them in the south, but anyway, now I think that the better number is one that mostly chooses. 444 would have been more symmetries, right? And 555 is even anyway, he's, yeah, yeah, more symmetries means possibly more problems, yeah. More problems. So, Ushiki has done a lot of very interesting computer work. And one thing that he's done here is take, you know, just written down these automorphisms and looked at them in the computer. And I've drawn a picture here of what you get. This is like I mean, Kushiki told me about this and showed me his picture, so I said, okay, and I went and made my own picture. You know, you should always try to check out everything that somebody else does. And so in Mathematica, you can easily compute what this mapping is for 325 and the signal permutation. And you take an orbit, pick a point, random point. Anything non-real. Anything non-real, this is a real map, so I need to be off of the real, but take anything that's non-real and iterate it 200 times and then plot the next 2,000, 20, maybe this is 20,000 points each or something. It's sort of a long thing. It goes around and around. You get this. So, this is what you get for plotting any number of random points. With a picture, I took 18, I think. So, what are we supposed to be seeing? Well, if you think about it, we've got this map, 3,2,500. It seems like for every point, after a while, you end up on a smooth closed curve. So it seems like why isn't the, oh, and now we're taking backwards at what we're looking at f minus. Why isn't a f minus 4y isn't there or not? Must be 4y. Must be full of and this thing must be a Herman ring. This is your bit after many tweets? Yeah, after 200 or something, then you plot the next 20,000. But plot 40,000, 100,000 until your computer starts doing stupid things. But if you came with boundaries, then you say ambiguous, and you assume that you have a boundary clearance? Yes. So if you could be Yes, so if you could be as close as I am, you could see that it's getting flaky when we get to the boundary. It's getting jiggly. The inner boundary also gets jiggly, but not in this particular picture. It's hard to get points that aren't close to the boundary. Because you have to cheat start someplace. Close to the boundary means that you like a boundary or? Oh, um they have not been good points. They're not. There are no critical points. There are no critical points. There are, I mean, this is a diffeomorphism. We're on a compact, we're on a compact manifold. This number, 325, adds up to 10. 10 blow-ups. And so I don't know where this is. This is just a projection. I have another projection here. Okay, so you can well, you know, you can see that this boundary, you know, it looks like a horrid line to me, you know. And so, hello, okay, so if it's the case, well, looking back at the picture, the first comment here is that it seems like I'm not looking at. Like, I'm not looking at two rings, it seems like I'm looking at one ring. In other words, if I had a Fatu component of period two, I would expect to see one ring and one ring. So what I think I'm seeing is that I'm looking at a Fatu component, one Fatu component, and it must be an area. And I know that there can be no fixed point where no sort of got smashed, but I know what the fixed point. But I know what the fixed point, you know, with these mappings, you know, you've got the less fixed point, so you know exactly what the fixed points are going to be. And in the complex case, mentality is always positive. And so, you know, we know that we've got two fixed points here. There's a fixed point here and a fixed point there. And there's no room for another fixed point. So could this be an attractive? Oh, yeah. So could this be an attractive? Oh yeah, in the case of dissipative hen on mass, it's actually a theorem that if you had a Fatu component, or a HINOMAP, okay, if you had a HINOMAP with an invariant Fatu component, then if it contains no fixed point, Then you'd have to have a Herman ring and attracting Herman ring. So that's why, in other words, that was evidence for this one. It looks like we must have a connective, you know, it looks like the two set must be dense, so it must be connected. Anyway, in case we're asking about rotational disks, so the other one I'm looking at a ring attractor. In this case, I'm looking at a possible disk. In this case, I'm looking at a possible disk attraction. Well, for Hanoi maps, you can specify a fixed point with the right book requirements like this. I forgot to put a question mark here. I forgot to mark this with blue. So it's a question. It's not, I don't know. My only evidence is to ask Ushiki. And he has after three or four years, he hasn't seen that. So, in the volume-preserving case, suppose you're looking at volume-preserving hen-one maps. Could you have a FAT2 component without a fixed point for volume-preserving henon maps? If you did, well there's a theorem saying that if you have a volume-preserving hit-on map and a bounded invariant component, then it has to be by holomorphic and conjugate. By holomorphic and conjugate to a Reinhardt domain, and the mapping on the Reinhardt domain is diagonal with a rotation in both coordinates, and then you would have right here a Hermann ring. In other words, having a fixed point would be what your brain market name would have to be originally. So if you have a random Have a rank two. I'm sorry, I forgot to say. If you have a rank two map, so when you have rotation buildings, you have a torus action on the building. The torus can either be one torus or a two torus. If it's a two torus, then it's rank two. You see that right in order to ride. Then necessarily, you're going to have to have a from a grain, you necessarily have to be equivalent to a Reinhardt domain, and then you'd have to have a body type. Okay, so I want to look at the Fatu set of a surface automorphism. In the computer world, people look at the Fatu set by looking at the interior of where K plus G plus is zero. When you don't have the green function, we have to do something else. So, what I want to do is look. Look, so this was a theorem of Molsay come to Molse somebody, Dean Seabody. And so to draw the set, we draw where the Lyapunov exponent is bigger than something. Okay, and so in this is a different 118 map, so it's still same order. So it's still the same vertic data, but different choice of Solemn number or root, Solemn polynomial. And right here, that guy, if you may see it, that is the other fixed point here on our invariant curve. And in this case, I have my multipliers here. My multipliers here are delta to the minus 2, delta to the minus 3. And I know that I have my the 2 component is going to be ranked 1. So orbits, or this portion, I have ranked 1. And so that means that by inspection, just take any point there, look at the orbit. You're going to see that it's going to look like a simple closed curve, anything in that control. Control it. Now you magnify this. So this again is Ushiki found it. This is that fixed point. And in region one, take a point in region one. And oh yeah, so this is what I was just now saying. And the 30 seconds that are left. I mean, your shirt says stony books, so you must be a tough guy. So we know that these fixed points, if I have a rotation domain of my two, these fixed points cannot be in that rotation domain. But if I look at, if I go back here, okay, if this region one, a point in this region one, then the orbits of points in that region, so this is the coloring opposite of what I was using before. Your flight is the What I was using before. Here, white is the Fatus step, and black is the Julia set. So I take the orbit of one of those points, and I get something like this. Take more and more. Clearly, I'm booking one and more. I mean, this looks connected, and it looks like the closure, if I take enough points, must be of two choice. I'd love to have dimension two in my closure. So let me just summarize here. Let me just summarize here. I've given you a couple of examples of this second quadratic family, and I never did more. I know that I have to get something with dynamical degree bigger than what I have to do more than at least 10 blow-ups. I never did more than 10 blow-ups. Well, I didn't do a single thing. I just know you machine to tell me. But then it would be a very intriguing problem to show that. It would be a very intriguing problem to show that these, what appear to be examples, are in fact the case. Anyway, thank you for listening to me. That's pretty much all right. So are there more questions from the job? I'm sure. I'm sure Todd is already asked that question. So if you go back to the Hermann Ring conjecture, did you try to estimate the rotation number by putting the traverse spectrum? Yes, if I try to estimate the rotation number by putting the rotation, the radius of The notation don't really buy no? You look at the first returns and you have the no, that's a question that bothers me a lot. The question is: what is a first return? Because you're floating out in space and the, you know, when you're in one-dimensional world, there is a clear first return. When you're in a two-dimensional world, just take the distance and try it. Yeah, yeah. Um yeah, yeah, I anyway, I did not try to do that, but it's not clear to me that you can get a very I thought about it and it didn't seem to me that I could get a very good answer that way. But it would be you'd want to, yeah, but I agree entirely. You'd like to know what is the, what are the first return times and then get your track and expand. Well, you know, um so this guy so it's coming around the previous one with the other one. Okay, maybe I should do that one, yes. So right, so it's coming around and it's coming around. And that's coming around, and it's coming around. Okay. So, I mean, these curves: one, two, three, four. And it's pointing number around the triangle? Maybe? I don't know. I don't know. That's interesting. It's very interesting. I had a similar idea, but then I got a frame button. And I have one more question. So, I guess my first question was: can you find that actually close to the vertex? I guess the vertex cannot be all membrane with that peak? Yes, yes. What you're describing is very, in other words, this is some kind of projection. So, if we just project, take a simple coordinate projection, and you can see how. Coordinate proof actually, and then you can see how close it gets to the vertices. It seems to me that things get sort of close to the vertices, but I don't know what the meaning of close is. In other words, it's point zero when you're close. If you look at this picture, the way I've drawn it is we have a fixed point here and we have a fixed point here. We have a fixed point here and we have a fixed point there. The regular points are parentifies by c, and your mapping is looking like a multiplication by a number. So you're scaling out here. In this picture, this green thing is the invariant curve, and these two red points are the two fixed points. So, you know, in these pictures, things that in some sense are, you know, in the realistic sense, the two fixed points are very far away, but in this picture, But in this picture, they're very close. So that's why I don't know the meaning of close. Any other questions? Thank you again.
