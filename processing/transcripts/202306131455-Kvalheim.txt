Thank you. So I'll be talking about the feedback stabilization problem and some papers funded by the ARO and ONR. So, in particular, I'm going to review Brockett's necessary condition and then subsequent ones due to corona Mansuri and then And then I'll talk about some extensions to these results. And then, last, I'll conclude by just saying something interesting that sort of about periodic orbits that this leads to. So I'll be dealing with this control system. And for this talk, everything is just going to be smooth. It's not smooth in the papers, but I just thought I'd make things less technical. And also in this talk, I guess I'll be dealing with where my state lives in a general smooth manifold. And I'll just assume that the state control space is just M cross some Euclidean space. But again, you can consider more general bundle theoretic setups, and they do this in the papers. So two problems. The first one I'm not going to talk about except on the next slide. And the first one's the controllability problem. So given two points. So, given two points, point A and point B, find some function, some control u of t, depends on time, that takes your initial state A to your terminal state B. So it's just all about from going from point A to point B. But on the other hand, what I'm going to talk about is the feedback stabilization problem formulated in kind of the following general setup. And so for me, I'm not going to be talking about stabilizing points. I'm going to be thinking about I have some compact subset A. I have some compact subset A of my manifold, any compact subset at all. And rather than finding some function u of t, I want to find some u of x such that when I plug in u of x into equation one, a becomes asymptotically stable for the closed loop vector field. And just a reminder, what does asymptotic stability mean? It means if you pick some initial vicinity for any vicinity w of a, you can find a smaller vicinity v such that. A smaller vicinity V, such that if you start in the smaller vicinity and you go forward in time, you converge to A, and you also don't leave the bigger vicinity ever. So, but often and classically, for sure, A is a point, and M equals Rn and the stabilization problem. If M is not Rn, no problem, you can just zoom in for point, but for non-points later, the non-Euclidean ambient space starts to matter. Starts to matter. So, anyway, in Roger Brockett's 1983 paper, that's, I think, now a fairly well-known paper, he asserts that up until then, an oft-repeated conjecture was this stabilization conjecture, which says that, to be vague for the moment, some reasonable form of controllability was thought to imply smooth stabilizability of a point. And in this 1983 paper, Brockett. This 1983 paper, Brockett considered this now kind of famous example. You could call it the Heisenberg system or the non-holonomic integrator. So it's a pretty simple system on R3. It's controllable in every possible sense. But Roger Brockett refuted this conjecture by showing that for this system, even though it's so controllable, you can't stabilize any point, at least with smooth or, in fact, even less smooth, continuous and uniquely integral. Continuous and uniquely integral feedback. So, okay, so how did he do this? Well, he couldn't just check every single candidate Lyapunov function because the heat death of the universe would occur first. So, what he did was he proved this theorem. And this theorem, which is known as Brockett's necessary condition or Brockett's test, says that, well, if a point is stabilizable, then it must be the case that the image of this right-hand side has got to be. This right-hand side has got to be a neighborhood of zero. And here I'm using the fact that we're in Rn, so I can just think of the tangent bundle, which is the product of Rn itself. So why does this work for this example? Well, if you just look at vectors of the form 0, 0, epsilon, where epsilon is very small, and you stick it in the left-hand side here instead of x-dot, y-dot, and z-dot, you can just very easily check that none of these points are in the image of this f on the right-hand side. So you take f. On the right-hand side. So you take epsilon arbitrarily small, and so that implies that this image definitely cannot contain a neighborhood of zero. Okay, so I thought now would be a good time to just say this brocket test, it's about asymptotic stability, which is a local function. And I'm only going to be talking about such local things in this talk. But there's a lot of other work on the feedback stabilization problem for other versions of the problem. So authors have considered exponential versions, exponential. Exponential versions, exponential stability, some global versions. For example, our morning speaker has a nice paper where he introduces something called topological perplexity. There's time-varying versions of the stabilization problem, discontinuous versions, and I just want to acknowledge that these exist, are important, but I'm just not going to talk about them. So, okay, so we have Brockett's condition, and so the relevant history, so ignoring stuff on the previous slide, in my mind goes like. Slide, and my mind goes like this. So, around the same time, so Baracko was 1983, this monograph that was pretty influential appeared by, I'm going to get the pronunciations wrong, I apologize, Kraskoselski and Zabreiko. And they obtained a necessary condition for asymptotic stability just of an equilibrium of a vector field. And it's just that its hop index has to be, I guess, plus or minus one. Or minus 1 and negative 1 to the dimension of the space. And okay, so then using this result, Caron, and I think this is 1990, he introduces an obstruction to asymptotic stabilization that's actually strictly stronger than Brogatz. And then, Mancuri generalized. So, here's how these generalizations go. You define some set sigma here, and sigma is just the set of. Here. And sigma is just the set of points in state cross-control space where f doesn't vanish. That's it. It's just the complement of the zero pre-image of f. So I should also say in my slides, I've kind of put like the weakest versions of all theorems possible. So you can find stronger, you know, a little bit of stronger stuff in some papers. And Suri actually also has a 2007 paper where he considers a slightly different setup. But I'll just state the simple version. So Don said, well, okay, if you're Roland said, Well, okay, if you're in at least R2 or bigger and a point is stabilizable, then it turns out that the induced map F star on singular homology has got to send the n minus one homology group here. So here I'm just taking coefficients and the integers for homology. That f star has actually got to give you an isomorphism between this guy and this guy. So I So, I think that's a nice result. In principle, I think this is something that could be numerically computable, although I don't think anyone has attempted to do that. Okay, so then Mansuri came along and he said, well, let's, you know, I'm interested in things more general than just points. So for the version I'll state here, he considered a closed, i.e., compact boundaryless sub-manifold of dimension, of co-dimension two or bigger, of Rn. Of Rn. And so, just notation. I'm going to say something about this Euler characteristic in just a moment on a subsequent slide. But so, there's just something called the Euler characteristic. And what Man Suri showed is if it turns out you can stabilize this sub-manifold, then necessarily it's got to be the case that you have this no longer equality as you have here in Couron's theorem, but you have a Curon's theorem, but you have a set inclusion down here. And so in both cases, this right-hand side is some cyclic group just isomorphic to the integers. But here, it's better to think of this as being some subgroup of the integers. This is the subgroup given by multiplying the integers by the other characters. So, okay, so what are limitations of these results, in my opinion? Well, all of the results we talked about. So all of the results we've talked about, they rely on parallelizability of Rn in a completely crucial way to identify vector fields and control systems, to view them as being Rn value. So that's one limitation. Another one is that these results only apply to the case that A is a point or a closed submanifold of Rn. And so as opposed to some other more general set. So, as opposed to some other more general set, but even if you're looking at close to manifolds, this Euler characteristic has got to be zero to give you any information. Because if I go back to the previous slide and if I have a zero Euler characteristic here, then I just have that this group, whatever it is, contains the zero subgroup, and every group does that, so that doesn't give you any information. Okay, so these I would say are some limitations, but there are some cases where, and there are some. Cases where, and there are some cases where these limitations are important. So, for example, robots typically have non-Euclidean configuration spaces and hence state spaces. And you might want to stabilize a robot gate, which would correspond to a relative periodic orbit in some reduced state space. I think some other good motivation comes from, let's say, self-behaviors for autonomous driving or even safety in general, because safety is sort of under. Safety is sort of under time reversal dual to stabilization. So that was actually one of the reasons why I started working on this was I wanted a kind of a rocket type result for safety. So I'll tell you two ways to test for stabilizability in these more general settings. So the first is a generalization of Brockett's test in a paper that I wrote with Dan Kodicek when I was a postdoc at Penn. Check when I was a postdoc at Penn. And the next paper is, in particular, it generalizes the Coron and Mansuri tests, but it also gives you something a bit more. There's this theorem that I'll call the homotopy theorem in this talk, which I'm fond of, and I think it implies these coronavirus generalizations. So you may or may not be familiar with the Euler characteristics, so I'll just Familiar with the Euler characteristics, so I'll just give this a reminder in case we're not. So, if you have some kind of space, like here, a sphere. So, let's think about a sphere. You can draw a bunch of triangles on the surface of the sphere, like this, build a triangulation, and you can add up. You can do the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces, and that gives you a number. So, you do that, and it turns out you get two. So you do that, and it turns out you get two. And while that wasn't the only way to draw triangles on, I could also draw many more triangles here. And you can do the same count: vertices minus edges plus bases, you get two. And I'll be honest, this still amazes me. Turns out you always get two. You don't even need to use triangles. You could use, like, let's say, cubicle cells. Okay, we'll get two. You know, you can even use things more general than cubicle cells. You can use CW compositions, like what's shown on the right. So, no matter what Like what's shown on the right. So, no matter what, for the sphere, you do the same alternating sum, you get two. Now, if you go to other spaces like the torus surface of a donut here, same thing holds. It doesn't matter how you divide the thing up, but you don't get two anymore. And so for the donut, you get zero. And so for nanifolds, you can always define the Euler characteristic as being a kind of alternating sum like this. And for some reasonable spaces as well, for a general compact subset that we're going to be talking about. For a general compact subset that we're going to be talking about stabilizing, it gets a little subtle, and so you've got to use something, a fancy version of Euler characteristic, but I'm going to try to avoid talking about that unless anyone asks. So here's some examples. And so this is notation, Euler characteristic. So some examples, the Euler characteristic of a point is just one because there's one vertex and nothing else. Euler characteristic of a circle is zero. You can see that because you can take an arc and you can. is you can you can take an arc and you can glue the ends of the arc to a single vertex. So you get 1 minus 1 equals 0. Euler characteristic of a 2 sphere as we've been talking about is 2. And then because of a figure that will occur on the next slide, I just will point out that the Euler characteristic of a figure 8 is equal to minus 1. And so that's a little bit about the Euler characteristic. The only fact I really need about it for this talk is actually this theorem. And I actually only need one direction of the theorem, but I just thought it was kind of, it's nice to say both. Nice to say both. So, this theorem says that if you have, if you're a compact smooth manifold with boundary, then there exists a smooth vector field on this compact smooth manifold n that points inwards at the boundary if and only if, or if in, sorry, there exists an inward-pointing vector field that vanishes nowhere if and only if this manifold n has zero either characteristic. So, with this, I will give you a proof. I will give you a proof of a generalization of Brockett's test. So, the same proof holds essentially verbatim to proof Brockett's test. So, here's how the proof works. So, what does the theorem say first? So, okay, it says that if you have a compact subset of your manifold, let's assume that it's stabilizable. Okay, so arbitrary compact subsets can be a little tricky to talk about. Is there a well-defined weather characteristic? So, the first part of the theorem is there is actually always a well-defined characteristic. Is there is actually always a well-defined Euler characteristic. It's defined in terms of using a Czech Alexander Spaniard cohomology. Okay, so, but if it's, but if A is not too pathological, it's just, you can think of it as just being what I showed you on the previous slide. So if its order characteristic is not zero, here's the statement. So for any sufficiently small vector field x, there has to be some state x naught and some control u0 such that the vector field Such that the vector field and the control system agree at those points. The EncodaCheck really likes to think of X as being an adversary that you have to defeat with F by having the image of F hit the image of the adversary somewhere. So take that for what it's worth. So here's the proof. So let's assume there exists a stabilizing u of x. And let me ignore this or the characteristic part of the theorem. So assume this exists. Okay, let's define capital F to be. Okay, let's define capital F to be the closed loop corrector field. Okay, now converse Lyapunov function theorem tells you there exists a nice smooth Lyapunov function, proper C infinity of everything. Okay, so like let's look at just take an arbitrary sub-level set of the Lyapunov function. And that's what I'm calling this capital N here. So it's a codimension zero smooth manifold with boundary. Compact. Okay, so, and because it's a Lyapunov sub-like. And because it's a Lyapunov sub-level set, this closed the vector field points strictly inward at the boundary. Okay? And then a little bit of topology, I'm not explaining why, at the moment, says that the Euler characteristic of A has got to be equal to the Euler characteristic of the Liopena function sublevel set, which is not zero. So then continuity says, well, if f is pointing inwards at boundary n, so it's definitely not zero there, if you perturb f just a little bit, because boundary n is compact. Bit because boundary n is compact, well, just by continuity, f minus x is still going to point inward at the boundary if x is small. Okay, so Pancre Hoppes says that, well, because this Euler characteristic was not zero, f minus x has to have a zero. And then if you just online the definitions, that zero is a point x naught, such that the conclusion of the theorem is verified. Just a quick assumption on dimension of the Yeah, but nothing. So, this could be 25-dimensional stabilizations. M could be 316-dimensions, A could be the most pathological compact set you could imagine. Except you won't be able to stabilize the most pathological compact set imaginable, because an obstruction would be like if this order character was not well defined. But for all practical purposes, yeah, all compact sets, any one of them. Okay, so what are some examples? Because I actually claim that the theorems that I just showed you. Playing with the theorems that I just showed you, they seem pretty useful to me. And these examples did not take me very long to come up with, so that's why I think the theorem is kind of useful. So here's the Heisenberg system, and then here's another common one. You're standing on a segue or you have a differential drive robot, maybe also called the kinematic unicycle. You can do the dynamic version as well, but I just did the kinematic one. So, okay, so I have this adversary X that I want to find for both of these. So, here's what I'll do for this one: it's the same thing. I'll do for this one. It's the same thing that Rocket plugged in to show that you couldn't stabilize a point. But now, because of that previous theorem, you get a bit more. So, for this system here, and the same conclusion will hold for this system, but I'm using a different adversary. So, the theorem from the previous slide tells you, let me just focus on Q. So, Barca taught us we couldn't stabilize a point. The result on the previous slide says, well, not only can you not stabilize a point, you actually
