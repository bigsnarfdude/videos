Okay, so I will give a short introduction to explain what kind of results I will be talking about. And so the general setting is that I have a semi-simple Leggroup X. So for example, you can take X to be PGL to C or S L to C as in the previous talk. And then you have a symmetric space attached to this group, which is quotient by maximal component. Is a quotient by maximal compact. So for PGL2C, it would be the hyperbolic free space. And I'm interested in arithmetic lattices in this group. So I'm not going to say what an arithmetic lattice is right now. I will say a few words about that at the end of the introduction, but I think it's not very useful to give the definition in full generality right now. So we saw examples, some kind of example in the previous. Right, some kind of example in the previous talk. Um, but let me just say so, arithmetic lattice is a special kind of lattice that hopefully most people already know. If you don't know, I will explain it shortly later. And I'm interested in the homology of these lattices. So, I have groups HI of gamma. I take coefficients in Z. So, this is a Z module of finite tap. So, it has a torsion subgroup, H E gamma Z tors. And I'm interested in its size. How big can it be? So it's not obvious that actually it can be non-trivial, but for example. And so the main theorem that I'm going to talk about is that it can be non-trivial, but it will never be too big in terms of the volume of the associated locally symmetric space. So if I take the so here I have a torsion-free lattice, I ask for it to be torsion-free explicitly. So I have a manifold X mod gamma. manifold X mod gamma and the volume of this is a bound for the exponential growth of the torsion homology so let me make a few comments so like I said I asked torsion free for the lattice but probably the result can be extended to not to general lattices just we don't do it but you can probably just take what we did and so there would be a substantial So, there would be a substantial work to do to adapt to the general case. But it's probably doable. So, if you're interested in our defaults, then you will have to do some work, but probably you can prove a similar statement. So, I said arithmetic. So, you can ask, why do we need arithmetic? So, okay, I will explain why the proof works for arithmetic. But in fact, it's not a necessary condition for this theorem to hold because. For this theorem to hold, because in Rencoin, there's a result that is actually more general for negatively curved manifolds. That is due to Bader, Golander, and others. It's fairly recent. I think it's five years ago. So we'll prove exactly the same result for all negatively curved manifolds with normalized geometry. And there's one case where it's actually necessary. It's for exactly the case that Ruth talked about, arithmetic, non-arithmetically public. Non-arithmetic hyperbolic fermion default can have very large torsion with small volume because of hyperbolic density. So, our result in this case applies only to arithmetic ones. And Bader Galander especially asks inverse statement that the dimension is not free. And then, okay, so if you are not a negative curve, then you are you are high rank, so you are arithmetic. So the the restriction is not needed because The restriction is not needed because non-arithmetic is empty sets. Okay. But I mean, in any case, I will not talk about non-arithmetic lattices in this talk. So that was only if you are interested in general case. And last comment. So like I said, you can actually have some examples where there's a lot of torsion and you can have exponential growth of torsion in some examples. So the result is sharp in the sense that sense that you can have exponential growth but I will state so there's a conjecture that states a more precise asymptotic that that says that it should not be sharp for some G and for some I but I will go back to this later any questions about this statement okay so let me go to Let me go to shortly. I will say so you can ask also about Betty numbers. So, this is the other part of the torsion of the survey of the homology book. And for Betty numbers, we actually prove a more precise result. So, we will not be talking about this so much. So, let me be a bit quick. So, basically, the result is that for Betty numbers, you actually have better bounds in all degrees except possibly the middle degree. And in the middle degree, some. And in the middle degree, sometimes it grows as fast as possible, so linearly in the volume. And you know exactly when, and you know exactly what the growth is. You have explicit formulas in terms of combinatorics of the D group. So let me not talk about this yet. But so if you look at the statement that I just wrote, so there's an additional assumption that the lattice should be congruent, which was not in the torpedo statement. Which was not in the topshun statement. And this is why we can have a more precise statement. And this hypothesis is necessary in general. And maybe not always, but let me not talk about this in detail. You can ask me if you want to know. Okay, and actually, so I wrote fi like fi is a dummy function, but if you want a precise form for the function fi, you can have it in many cases of interest. You can have it in many cases of interest. So probably it's actually you can have a more or less explicit form for FI in general, but what we prove is not strong enough to get that yet, but it's probably true. Okay, so like I said, this statement on torsion was not super precise. And actually, you can have a conjecture about torsion that basically says that you can have the same kind of results for torsion. That you can have the same kind of results for torsion that you know for Petty numbers. So, this is not something I'm going to talk about at all today. So, this is completely open and the difficulties are pretty much orthogonal to what I'm going to talk about. So, this is kind of a footnote for the talk, but I think it's good to know that there's this conjecture that's probably true. I mean, okay. Okay, so like I said, so I want to before I go into how we prove the torsion bonds, I want to talk a bit about arithmetic groups. So I'm not going to say anything precise. Like I said, if you have any questions, please ask me no. So for me, an arithmetic group is like an algebraic group, but with integers instead of fields. So you take a group scheme. So you take a group scheme, I mean like an algebraic group over integers, and you take the points. And then this is an arithmetic group, and you can find a if you started from a number field, you can find a early group inside which is a lattice. So I put three dots because if you want to say exactly which group it is, it's a bit annoying. But okay, like if your group G is a like if you take instead of KGSQ then Like instead of KGSQ, then this is actually what it is. And so there was a slight difference between the statements and the second statement that had congruent subgroup in addition to arithmetic. So this is something that's actually quite important for part of our proof. But this is the part I'm not going to talk about in this talk. So it's important to know the difference, but for this talk, it's not so important. So I'm just going to. This talk: it's not so important. I'm just going to talk about it briefly. So, congruent subgroups are the one that you can describe. So, well, completely staying in like the number theoretical. So, here I said finite index subgroup. So, priority a finite index subgroup can be like anything. But so, congruence is finite index subgroup that is obtained by arithmetic means. By arithmetic, it means that you just reduce coefficients modulo p, for example. So, I mean, morphism to a finite ring just means you take an ideal and you model it by the ideal. So, if you have a number field, you have a finite ring as a quotient. And you can get subgroups that are not of this type. For example, if you have a subgroup, fairly neck subgroup that is normal and with quotient a symmetric group, that will never be a a congruence subgroup. That will never be a congruence because a symmetric group is not isomorphic to any group of this form G of R. And so this is a, so there's this big field of research called congruence subgroups, but in some cases you know that everything is congruence, in some cases you don't. And the point is that actually in most cases that where you know that there are some things that are non-congruence, you actually know that they violate the statements that I gave. Violate the statements that I gave about Betty numbers, certainly, and maybe about the algebraic categories conjecture, too. But since we don't know anything about this so far, it's not sure. So the congruence part is really important if you want the precise bound. But for the rough bounds and portion that I gave, it's not so important. And we will see why in the proof. Basically, the proof just uses the fact that you come from some integers. Integers and that would be a bit different, actually. But okay, so okay, I wanted to say that, but you can forget about it now. It's just to some explanation to why you have some statements that are precise and some that are not so precise. Okay, so I'm going to kind of describe the general approach that we used for this theorem. So I call it preliminary arguments. Argument. So, if there are any questions about what I stated so far, please ask now. Okay, so let me go to how we try to prove this statement about torsion homology. So, the starting point is linear algebra. So, we are going to give very general ones about torsion homology. So, I probably should have. So, I probably should have put this immediately. So, in general, if you have a so we are using simplicial homology, so the simplest kind of homology. So, this is just something that you compute from a simplicial complex, so you get integral matrices, and you compute some kind of co-kernel. And there's this general, very general immense. So, if you take a complex that has bounded geometry, so if you take one vertex, then If you take one vertex, then it belongs to only a bonded number of simplicies. So, equivalently, one skeleton has a bonded degree. So, if you put a bound on this degree, then you have a very general bound for the homological torsion in terms of just the number of vertices. So, this is an elementary. It's not super easy to prove, but it's an exercise for good master students, I would say. And the important ingredients. The important ingredient is this lemma. I think the statement is not super surprising, but this is a non-trivial part of the statement above. And as I said, it's a nice exercise. I think it's a good lemma to know in general. So what we want to do to prove the theorem. So we wanted to prove that I put V for the number of vertices. So I put V for the number of vertices. So V will be we want to replace the number of vertices by volume. So what we want to prove is that we can find simplicial complexes that are homotopy equivalent to our manifolds and that have a bounded degree and not too many vertices. So this is what is called the Colander's conjecture. So now it's a theorem. So I should say now that I didn't put any attribution for theorem. So everything that's Theorem. So everything that's called a theorem and that's not attributed is new from this work with Sebastian and Nicolai. And so this Gundorf conjecture states exactly that we have the kind of complexes that we want. So for every arithmetic, so if we fix local geometry, so if we fix a symmetric space X, for every arithmetic manifold that is local. A manifold that is locally isometric to X, we can find a triangulation, I mean, a complex that is homotopy equivalent to it, which has bounded degrees, so the bound depends only on the symmetric space, basically on the local geometry, and where we can control the number of vertices. Okay, so this is actually the main statement that we prove in the paper. So, the previous slide produces the statement. Reduces the statement of the theorem on torsion homology to Gunander's conjecture and improve Gundeck's conjecture. And let me just note that so for Betty numbers, it does not imply the sharp bonds that I stated. I mean, it cannot, it's way too vague, but it does imply a weaker statement that you just have linear bonds in the volume for Betty numbers as well as for structural images. I mean, this is completely obvious. This was known already before, but Before, but I mean, we get a, I mean, it's not in greater generity, and I give a new proof for this. Okay, so now I'm mainly going to talk about a Goland-Dors conjecture. So, how do we prove that? So, we prove that by using a classical method of triangulating manifold, manifold to the metric. So, this is, and maybe I should have made a slide. So, I was playing. The side, so I was planning on describing this by uh talking, but um okay, I'm afraid it's going to be a bit hard to follow. But let me let me try. So, so I want to prove this lemma that if I have any Riemannian manifold that is closed, I have bonds on local geometry, so I have this hypothesis on curvature that are bonded. So, this just says that I have a control over what happens locally. Over what happens locally. And then I can't, there's a way to triangulate it that gives me so it's not really a triangulation, but a simplicial complex which is homotopy equivalent to it with this number of vertices. So you integrate over the manifold this function that is one. So in the injectivity radius is so you have a fixed local geometry that means infinitesimal and then you want. That means infinitesimal, and then you want like the next step in decribing the local geometry, the injectivity radius. And that measures how far you can go without going back to the point. So you take the length of the smallest loop around your point. So in negative curvature, anyway, I should have stated a negative curvature. Actually, I'm not sure the statement is true in this form. So if I put a zero. In this form. So, if I put a zero instead of the one, it's definitely true. But yeah, sorry. So, injectivity radius is the smallest non-trivial loop that goes back to your point. So, basically, you can embed a ball with a radius, the injectivity radius around points. So, you have a control on the local geometry up to the injectivity radius. And so, if you look at the integral, when you have parts of the manifold that have small injectivity, Manifold that are small, that have small injectivity radius, so where you have a bad control on your local geometry, you get a large contribution to the integral. So you will need, and actually, so the construction that you use for this needs a lot of points at these places. So a nice way to explain this is if you look at 3D pictures with meshes, you see a lot of triangles in the places that have a lot of curvature. Places that have a lot of curvature, and this is kind of what happens instead of curvature because we normalize it. It's a when your manifold gets thin, you need to put a lot of triangles to compensate for the lack of control on local geometry. Okay, and so the construction is exactly that. You put a lot of vertices that are sufficiently separated, and then you construct automatically a simplicial complex that is like a ZovIps complex, if you know what it is. Like the RIPS complex, if you know what it is, or something like that. It's a purely combinatorial argument after that. And so we want to control the injectivity radius of our manifolds. That's what it's about. So let me state what we get after this maybe modeled explanation. What we get from this lemma, that is very general, is that if we can control the objectivity radius of an arithmetic manifold well enough compared to the volume in this precise sense, in this inequality. In this precise sense, in this inequality. So yes, and I'm apologizing. So I didn't define. So this M smaller than epsilon is the epsilon thin part. So this is a part where the injectivity radius is smaller than epsilon. And if this part is not too big compared to the manifold and the injectivity radius. And the injective feature address, then we win. Then we can construct by this general argument a good triangulation. So what we do is in this paper with Sebastian and Micolai, we control this part. And then we use a non-result about injectivity regress of arithmetic manifold that controls this part on injectivity address. So the point, of course. So, the point, of course, is that the injectivity address can go to zero. I mean, it could in principle go to zero. It's expected that it should not, but it's not known. And so we must control this for a small epsilon. But if you can find a small epsilon point, we can control it. So we are going to prove this. So I need one arithmetic invariant to state my. One arithmetic invariant to state my result. So we have this thing called the trace field. So this was talked by Ruth before. So this is an arithmetic invariant of an arithmetic group. And basically, if you know the definition of arithmetic group, I mean more or less the one that I wrote in the beginning of the talk, this is exactly the field that you need to build your arithmetic group. So this is not... Actually, the Actually, the the the name trace field comes from a work of Windberg that uh interpreted this field as a as a tr an actual trace field, so a field generated by traces. And this is what Ruth called the invariant trace field. And so if we so if you know a bit about um geometry of arithmetic manifold, maybe you have heard that uh so the injectivity radius of a closed arithmetic manifold is related to the Mahler. Is related to the Malar measure of the elements of the arithmetic group. And the Mahar measure is well understood if you fix the degree of the field. But what we don't know is that it does not go to zero when the degree of the field goes to infinity. And so what we do is when the degree of the field goes to infinity, we have a very explicit bound on the volume. So I will say afterwards what happened to the initial future, but for the But for the for the volume of the thin part with this very explicit bound, so the fraction of the volume that belongs to the thin part is controlled, is smaller than the exponential of, I mean, inverse exponential of the W. So it's very small compared to the total volume of the manifold. And now you have this classical bond of Dobrovolt key on Meiler measure that if you interpret it in terms of the lemma. Interpret it in terms of the elements of your arithmetic groups, it gives you this kind of bound on the injectivity radius, and so you see it's a logarithmic bound. So it decreases. If it decreases, it decreases very slowly. So, I mean, we have this clearly the exponential wins against the logarithm. It's even much, much more than what we need. So, this theorem about a thin part implies a Golandor's conjecture. Okay, so now I want to prove the theorem about the thin part. Now I want to prove the theorem about the thin part. And this will be the technical argument. So I have 20 minutes left, I guess. So I'll probably finish early. But before going to so the last part, the technical argument would be completely dedicated to the proof of this theorem about thin parts. But I want to say just I want to say just a short word about the sharper result about Betty numbers. So for Betty numbers, we need more than just homotopy equivalence infliction complexes. But there's a general method that gives this kind of result that I wrote about Betty numbers. So they're sub-linear in some degrees. And when they are linear, we actually have a precise atomic. Now we actually have a precise automatic. And this is what is called Benjamin Schramp convergence. So I should say more like an application of Benjamin Schramp convergence to these Betty numbers. Is that automatically when you have Benjamin-Michran convergence, you have this statement about Betty numbers and this statement about thin part, if you know what Benjamin-Sham convergence is, it immediately implies a Benjamin-Minishram convergence in the sense that you In the sense that you need for the application. But this is only when, so this is only in this specific situation, which kind of looks more complicated when the complexity of the trace field increases. So we also need to deal with the case where the arithmetic lattices are maybe not commensurable, but that the trace field of bounded degree. And so in this case, we have a more And so in this case, we have a more direct approach using parts of the, I mean, the trace formula in its, so in the co-compact case, so it's simple, but so there's a paper of Mikolai that dealt with PGL2C, so with hyperbolic arithmetic for manifolds, and we can generalize enough of it to the general setting to get the general statement. So it's completely different from what I'm going to talk about. So I just wanted to say it, but it's not important. I just wanted to say it, but it's not important for the rest of the talk. So, for the last 15 minutes, I'm going to explain the proof of this theorem about simply. Are there any questions so far? Okay, so let me explain how we prove this statement about the thin part. In part, so the menu tool that we use is we call it arithmetic Marboulis Lemma. But it's a good name because it's a stronger result than Marbouli's lemma, but it applies only to arithmetic lattice. And so the statement is new, but all the work was done by Emmanuel Breuyar in a previous paper. So the statement is this. uh so so if you if you know the arithmetic margin the classical sorry classical margulis lemma is uh so you remove arithmetic and you you remove everything that's arithmetic in the statement so you remove a trace field and you remove this and in this case you have the classical Margulis lemma for for co-compact lattice and of course here the this is much stronger than Margulis lemma in the cases that we are interested in because we have a bond Because we have a burn, so the basically the Marulis constant for arithmetic groups goes to infinity when the degree of the trace field goes to infinity. So more or less the local geometry, you understand more and more the local geometry around small elements with small displacement as the trace field W is equal to infinity. So this is kind of surprising, but it's so unfortunately I'm not going. Unfortunately, I'm not going to talk about the proof because I don't have sales about it. I don't think it has the time. So there's a result of Broyard that states that if you take elements with matrices with coefficients in a ring of integers with a large degree. And if they generate a terrific A Tariski dense subgroup in a semi-sypoly group, then actually you can find elements that are products of these matrices that you control the number of terms of and that have a that have a bonded displacement that is bounded below, just in terms of the group detection, the zeroistic closure of the group that genuinely. So you need to work a bit from here, but basically all the hard work is done by a manual lawyer. And so this type And so this statement is exactly what we need to deal with with large degree manifolds. Let me explain shortly how. So the point is that classical Mark Bullisch lemma tells you that you have Margulis tubes, which are things that, so these are the components of the thin part, the components of the part of the manifold that we are interested in. And you understand. And you understand the geometry very well. So, Margulis cube is just this thing, except that in general, you put instead of R, you put a Margulis constant. So, here is an arithmetic Margulis constant. And it's called a tube because if you look at a surface, so in a surface, the element gamma will correspond to a small geodesic. And in a surface, this is called a collar. And so, this is exactly, so you have your closed geodesic at the heart of. You close geodesic at the heart of your colour, and then you have a tubular neighborhood of it. So it looks exactly like a cylinder, and so it's shortest at the point of the geodesic, and then it goes like this, like a trumpet on both sides. And so the classical colour lemma gives you an estimate. If you have a very short geodesic, then you have a very large colour around it. And the point of the arithmetic mag with the ma is that we can, instead of very short, we can say very short compared. Very short, we can say very short compared to the degree of the field. But then, of course, the problem is that this field actually we don't have it's not as good as the classical mandarisma. So they could in pre simple same intersect and they could intersect between them. The geometry can be a bit complicated, but you can still say enough for applications. So basically, what we are going to want to do is to We're going to want to put a very large cube because we are interested in fixed R and our Margulis constant goes to infinity with the degree. So if we're interested only in the Margulis tubes of width, we can expand them to Margulis tubes of width comparable to the Margulis constant. Comparable to the Margulis constant. And we will get a much larger volume this way. And the point is that if the Margulis tubes of small widths already takes a lot of place, then the Margulis tube of larger width, so this one will take really a lot of place in the manifold and it cannot take too much place because at some point it has to fill the whole manifold. But then if you want to apply this kind of argument, you need to control a bit the intersection and self-intersection. bit the intersection and self-intersection and the arithmetic Margulis summar implies this control on this so on the left you have this sum so this is kind of the abstract sum of the volume of the Margulis tubes so this basically depends only on R and on the gamma and we'll have a precise formula with it and on the in the middle you have the thing that we are interested actually interested We are interested, actually, interested in so this thing is complicated, it can have a complicating combinatorics, but we control it. So, from above, it's obvious and it's not the direction that we're interested in. But from below, we control it by the thing that's easy to understand up to this factor that comes from the arithmetic margin. Okay, so now the argument is going to be that we are going to, like I said, we are going to fix R and like I said, we are going to fix R and we are going to control the volume of the, we are going to expand the tube up to what we can do by the arithmetic Marguerite schema and use this inequality to control it in terms of the volume of the manifold. Okay. Are there any questions about this slide? Because I'm not sure I was super clear. Okay, so let me continue to explain what we're going to do with this. So we are going to... So I said that this thing is well understood, but I didn't state anything precise. So now I'm going to state precise things about how to control this thing. So this is what. So let me, okay, let me put the statement. So the statement that we need is this volume is... Need is this volume computed by an arbitrary integral plus something else, and this something else is basically some kind of system for the manifold. So, this is a part that's not so important, but the important part of this statement is this orbital integral. And so, it's defined like this. So, this is a very general definition. Usually, it's defined when people talk about the trice formula. The trace formula, but it has other uses as well. So, in particular, it can. I mean, here we use it to compute volumes. And so, let me just explain shortly why these things actually compute this volume. So, here it would be also good to make a drawing, but basically, in the colour picture, you have this small geodesic in the middle, and this small geodesic is this part of the volume. And then you have this, so you have. And then you have this, so you have the orthogonal direction. So the widths of the colour and this orbital integral control the widths of the colour. And why does it do so? Because basically in the colour, the widths, I mean the distance from the geodesic is measured by how far the element corresponding to the geodesic moves you. And so this, if you take f to be the indicatrix function of the ball of radius R, then this function. Reduce R, then this function is equal to one exactly when your element moves it at distance less than R. So basically, when you do this integral with this function, you are integrating in the orthogonal direction. So you mod out by the centralizer, this means that you are in the orthogonal direction. And then you are integrating one up to the place where it displaces by R, and then you integrate zero. So this is exactly the contribution of the order. Is exactly the contribution of the orthogonal direction to the volume. Okay, so I'm sorry I didn't make a picture, but like I said, I don't have good drawing equipment at the time. So now we are interested in this orbital integral. And what we want to do to apply it to our problem is we want to so there's not, you cannot really get an exact formula that would be very nice. I mean, you can in some cases like I can. Some cases, like I guess, for a hyperbolic specs, you probably can. But in general, it's quite complicated. But we are going to give good estimates on it in terms of comparing estimates between a fixed radius and the radius going to infinity. Because what we want to do is the argument and explained in the previous slide that that's what we wanted to do. So the statement that we want is this one. So on the right-hand side, I have this. Right hand side, I have this so this is the volume that I'm interested in: the volume of the half in part, and then on the left-hand side, I have the volume of a much larger Marguerite2. So, constant C1 is not super important. So, the important part is that you will add a lot of width by adding S. And the point of the theorem is that when you take a Marulis tube, whether you add S. tube where you add s a width of s you add you multiply the volume by exponential of delta s so this should not be really surprising this is if you think about negative curvature also about like a hyperbolic space this tells you that I mean this is more or less the fact that and you can prove it like this in rank one the so the surface of a ball of reduced air grows like an exponential with the rate R goes like an exponential with the radius. So, this is a generalization of this in high-rank. Okay, so this is the part that I'm going to stop going into the technical argument. So, this is a really technical part where you have to do computations. And so this is basically computation using so it's a bit annoying because you have to so there's a case that's not super hard when your gamma actually corresponds. Actually, it corresponds to a busiologic. So, if you generate an unbounded subgroup, then you do integration in Ewasawa decomposition. And it's not easy, but you get what you want in the end. So it's quite an involved computation, but it's a bit natural. And then the part, I'm going to say the hard part, but I mean the part that I don't really understand that Sebastian wrote is when you have an element that Is when you have an element that generates a bounded subgroup that actually I think we don't need for this case, but in general, we need it, then it's kind of much less intuitive. But anyway, so this statement is all that we need. And we need it in this form. So the corollary is that if you increase the width of your Margolis tube by S plus, okay, this constant C1 that doesn't really matter. Constant C1 that doesn't really matter, then you multiply the volume by deltas. Okay, so now we can conclude. Okay, so I'm going to give a lower bound for the volume of M first I can say that okay, so any thin part of M is contained in M, so the volume is bigger, this is trivial, and so I'm going to take the largest thin part that I can apply the arithmetic Marvelism. Okay, so now I'm Okay, so now I apply the arbitratic Margulis the map. So you have a lower bound for the volume of this in part, so for the volume of M purely in terms of this Marculist tubes. And now I apply my computations of orbital integrals. I have a lower bound for the volume of these Marbulist tubes in terms of the volume of the Marbulis tubes that actually appear in the R-in-Part that I'm instructed. And so I have a uh so the s that i must take is uh i miss um so i'm missing a delta here but it doesn't matter um the s that i operate is this epsilon g minus c1 r but this r effects i don't really care and uh then i can just bound this below by the uh so this is this gives just an additional constant that depends on r That depends on R. And this part absorbs this part to give like this exponential. So, of course, this is not super efficient, but since I was not worried about efficient in the first place, it's not matter. So, in the end, I get that the volume of M is bigger than exponential of constant times WR field times the volume of the earth in part. So, this is exactly what I want. What I want. Okay, and this is also the last slide, so I think I went a bit too fast. I can discuss a bit more about the points if you want, but since I don't have any slides, I think I'm going to stop here and I'll be happy to answer any questions. So, sorry about the speed. Thank you, John. John? So, any questions or comments? This is Avner Ash. I have a question. Does this shed any light on the Venkatesh-Berjon conjecture? No. Like I said, the Berjon-Venkatesh conjecture, I mean, in some sense, this extends the setting where we can hope to prove. This extends the setting where we can hope to prove Benjamin-Willikate conjecture to all congruent subgroups. But like for Benjamin-Well-Katech conjecture, what you really need is orthogonal to what we do. So what we do applies to Betty numbers, but for torsion, you will need additional arguments. So there are actually you need many additional arguments. So there are small eigenvalues and regulators. And I think at this point, both are still obstacles, even in very simple case. very simple case comparative i mean comparatively to to what i talked about uh like the burden that categories conjecture really lies uh quite uh quite further in terms of difficulty and and unfortunately i don't think we we can say anything about it with this kind of method okay thank you those are questions or comments um I have a question. So, hi, Jean. In the beginning, you said that your torsion bounds are sharp in some sense. Could you say one more word about what you mean with sharp? What kind of examples? Yes, so sharp means you can actually have groups gamma for which the torsion is about exponential is the volume. But so, okay, so the question of sharpness. So, okay, so the question of sharpness. So, this is sharp in the exponential aspect. And I so this is okay. I think probably it's sharp in every degree if you don't ask more, if you just ask arithmetic, it might be sharp for every eye. And if you want a sharper bond, then in general, then probably the correct bond will be a Bergen van Ketch. But then, so there's a question of estimating the constant c and so in this part, so we can probably get some value for c but I mean we cannot, but um so actually I think Sebastian is working on getting some explicit value in arithmetic Marvelist lemma, so in principle it's possible, but uh I think this kind of method will never give you an optimal C. So if you want an optimal exponential growth. Growth, then I think you have to work case by case. You probably cannot say much in this degree of generality. Even if you fix X, it's probably quite hard to find a good constant here. That would probably be something that we would find like looking at the covers of a manifold or something like that. But are these towers of finite index normal subgroups the examples, or are they just. Oh yeah yeah yeah sorry I should have yeah I was thinking about the sequences of abelian covers which is basically the only case where you know you can prove exponential growth of torsion in all degrees if you know some hypothesis. You can construct example dimension free. And I think if you really want to maybe you can construct examples in higher dimensions. So you say the statement is sharp but maybe not for all G. For all G. So, which G's is it sharp for and which ones not? So, it's probably not sharp for the G's that have zero L2 torsion and the congruence subgroup property. Because in this case, you would expect, so this is kind of what I wanted to get at with this slide about congruence and arithmetic. So, in the case where you have the congruence group property, then you would expect Benjamin-Katesh conjecture to always be true. And so, if this is And so if this thing is zero, which happens in many cases, like for example for SL4, no sorry, for SL5 and higher SL, then you would have a sub-exponential bond in every degree for the torsion. So in these kind of cases, you would expect to actually have a better bond, but yeah, in general, you expect to actually have to. You expect to actually have to exponential growth even for even for conference. But you would expect better bonds for eyes that are not equal to meter degree. Can you say a few more words about how you construct your simplicial complex that is homotopy equivalent to the many? That is homotopy equivalent to the manifold. So, this is the usual construction. So, you take a net that is separated. So, basically, you take some delta that will depend on your local bonds on the local geometry. And you take a net that is locally delta times the individual separate Okay, so you have to adapt the size of the net around each point. Exactly. Around each point? Yes. So this is basically this integral is estimating the number of points in such a net. I mean, yeah, this lemma is not... I think I didn't see the statement anywhere, but this is classical. And then you construct the classical construction. So you say up to, I put edges around to every vertex that is at distance less than... That is at distance less than like twice the injectivity radius, maybe, or something like that. No, sorry, injectivity radius over two or something like that. And you complete this to a flag simplicial complex. So you put all the simplicity that you can, and then you have a general theorem that tells you that you certainly know, that tells you that this is a motop equivalent. Okay. So let me make two. Okay. So, actually, let me make two comments here since I finished earlier. So, I should say that Orel and Mike Lipnovsky do actually use this construction in practice. Yes, but not with the variable size of balls. And so, also, I said, so I did not talk about this, but you can also construct actual trilingulations this way. So, it's much more complicated, but so there's a But so there's a work by Boisona, La Yer, and other people. So people in computational geometry actually do this kind of construction, but they use variable curvature analogs of Dolonetry unbelievations. So in fact, in this lemma, you can replace homotopy equivalent by homeomorphic. So I think it's still a preprint, but they have a work that deals with this kind of thing. Deals with this kind of thing. So, so I mean, this is not a fuel for homology computation. And this is really like a much higher technical burden, so I didn't state it. But if you want a homomorphic, like if you're interested in a I don't know, I don't know what you could be interested in that does not follow from a topic event, but if you like nice things, you can put homomorphic. Okay, thanks. Other questions or comments? Okay, I I do have one about your estimate of orbital integrals. Can you be more precise about the constants and C1, C2 in particular, about delta? So C1 we expect to be one. So C1 comes from some distant estimate. So C one comes from some distant estimate. So we need at some point we need a reverse triangle inequality in the integration. So we expect it to be one, but we did not need one, so we didn't strive for one. So C2 is like one of these constants that probably depends on the geometry. And this delta, let me have a quick look about where this delta comes from. I don't think we can say much about it, but I don't think we can say much about it, but this delta comes from the geometry of a root system, I think. So probably you don't try to give explicit estimate, but I think if you if you take a proof and you you are interested in a given group, you can probably say a lot about delta. Can probably say a lot about delta. So I'm sorry, I cannot be more precise, but I'm. Okay, so C1 and Delta, if you really want a precise constant, then you can probably work for it. C2 under the show. But I would say it's not the most important aspect. I mean, for me, I think. Okay, very well. No other comments? Okay, very well. No other comments? I have a question. Hi, I'm mostly interested in special linear groups and their congruent subgroups and the homology of that. And I was wondering if you switch between different special linear groups, like the size of them, do you get any connection between the different Um, constants you get, you mean, like, um, like in this statement, or do I know the dependency of C on the group G or something? Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, especially if you vary the special in your group with different ends. So, definitely what we do, um, so we work, uh, we work with general groups, so for more arguments, you can definitely not say anything. Uh, and uh, I don't, I think and uh i don't i think i think it would be really hard to like if you're interested in c as n go if you're interested in c for sln as n goes to infinity uh i think it would be pretty hard to to get estimates so um but this is a good question yeah so um so i think it's it's an interesting question to look at uh at the geometry um i mean what we do is basically orthogonal to what you are interested in um we are looking at one group and we are taking uh we are maxing the rate Uh, we are maxing the arithmetic complexity of the lattices inside, but we are fixing the group. And uh, like if you look at SLNZ, more or less the simplest lattice, arithmetic lattice that you can find in SLNR. And if you take n to infinity, you are going in the other direction. So I think it's a it's an interesting question, but uh I think you would need a completely different method. Um I mean you would study the same kind of things, but uh Would study the same kind of things, but you really need a different viewpoint on it from what we are doing. But yeah, I think it's really interesting to look at the geometry as n goes to infinity. And as the random goes to in 20, probably that's even harder. Well, thank you for considering the question. Good, thanks. Okay. So no other comments. So, no other comments. So, thanks, the speaker, again. Thank you for the invitation. So, we will meet in one hour for the next session with short talks. See you then.
