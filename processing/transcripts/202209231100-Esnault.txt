Forgive. So I closed the door, so it's not going to happen again. So, thank you very much for the kind invitation, and I apologize not to be here in person. This would have been really very difficult. I also apologize for not making slides here. The reason is that I'm currently at Columbia University for three months, and I'm talking to Johan. Months and I'm talking to Johan de Jong. And then we developed something in the last one or two weeks. And it was not appropriate to make slides because it's really a work in progress. So I just take the PDF. I prepared a little bit as a working document with Johan, and I hope you can enjoy the or not enjoy. Enjoy the or not enjoy the lecture just like this. So the purpose is like this. I will first present the theorem which came out from our discussions and then I will motivate the theorem and then if time permits I will say what it's where it's coming from. The proof is relies on deep facts. So let us start with complex algebraic geometry. So X is a smooth quasar projective variety of a Smooth quasi-projective variety over the field of complex numbers. And then we denote by x lower s a model of x over an affine scheme of finite tap over z, where the rig of functions of z or the field of functions of s, I'm sorry, is inside of c. So c is a geometric generic point. And so to say that it's a model, it means that the morphice here is flat. The morphism is flat, and as with best change to C, then we have X. And then we are looking at close points. So, close points have a residue field, a finite field, and we will denote them by little s. And then the geometric point above it, we will denote by a little s-bar. So, I start with the first statement here. So, the theorems are The theorems are written in such a way that there is a statement, and then the second statement says something indirectly about the proof, and then reinforces the statement. But the first part is a statement which everybody can understand. So X is a smooth quasi projective over the field of complex number, as I said, and we fix an R. R is a positive natural number, and that's going to be the rank of local systems. Local systems. And we assume that one Betty moduli is not trivial, the one of rank R. And we assume that the stable point, so to speak, on this moduli is not empty. So that means assume, forget the moduli, assume there is one irreducible topological local system complex of rank R with trivial determinant and udipotent monodromia. Unipotent monodromy at infinity. So here I put trivial determinant as unipotent monodromy at infinity because we didn't discuss in more detail the more general case when we assume that the determinant distortion and the monodromies at infinity are quasi-unipotent. But this is for as a working document here. It's work in progress. Then the conclusion is that for any prime L, any L, any. There is a rank R L adic local system with trivial determinant and unipotent monodromies at infinity, which is irreducible over QL bar. And the theorem goes on by saying, assume there are infinitely many irreducible topological rank R complex local system L C with trivial determinant and unipotent monodromy at infinity. Then the conclusion is that for any The conclusion is that for any prime L, there are infinitely many L-adic local systems which are absolutely irreducible, offering R, trivial determinant, and unipotent monodromies at infinity. So, if you don't like the story with unipotent monodromies at infinity, assume X is projective in addition, and then we don't have this discussion here. So, now the second theorem here is going to give a hint on To give a hint on what happens to prove this theorem here. In addition to theorem 111, the L lower L, that means the irreducible eladic local system, can be constructed in such a way that there are two closed points on S of different characteristics P and P prime, such that for any L not P, the L addic local system descends not only to a local system. Not only to a local system on X over S bar, that means over F P bar, but also an arithmetic local system, that means it is invariant under the Galois action. And then for the remaining P, so we have all L not P, and then for the remaining P, L P descends to an arithmetic P addic local system on the The fiber of the model here over S prime, which has a characteristic not P. And in addition to theorem 112, where we assume that we had infinitely many such local systems, then the L L can be, I'm sorry, sorry, the type push here, can be constructed in such a way that there are two close points NSS prime of different characteristic P and P prime. Different characteristic P in P prime as before, such that for any L not P, infinitely many such L L descend to an arithmetic LADIC local system on X S bar, and infinitely many L P descend to an arithmetic local system on X prime bar. So the CRM doesn't tell you which ones are going to do it when you start with your complex local system, how you can produce all How you can produce out of your specific complex local system eladic local system, which in addition are arithmetic at a given place S, but it says that if you had infinitely many to start with, then you will have infinitely many to at the end. So now I'm going to explain the motivation of the theorem. And here is the motivation. I'm not sure what you see. I'm not sure what you see on your screen. Can you tell me, Z, how far do you see on the screen? Okay, so you see the part I'm talking about now to start with. So I explain now 2.1. So first we have to talk on the moduli. So this is a very classical topic and which is also linked to your conference. So we fix Conference. So we fix a point once for all. So we have this model here of X over S of finite tap over Z. And then possibly after replacing S by a finite extension, we fix a point, an S point of the scheme here, because we are going to talk on the fundamental groups, the topological ones, the arithmetic one, the topological ones, the protendic ones, the profinite one. One, the profile net one, and then the arithmetic one. So we fix the base point. And this base point is going to do it for all versions here. As I have written, all fundamental groups are based as X lower C, which we explained before, or X lower S bar. Now we use the standard notation M square or M box, if you like, with a frame moduli, Betty moduli, a frank R representations of pi one with an Pi one with in when I write x of c I means the underlying topological space, so this means the topological modular space, the topological manifold here, with trivial determinant and unipotent monotromy at infinity. So this is a fine moduli representing the functor A goes a functor on rings, which goes to represent on rings. Which goes to represent on rings to representations with values in GLR of this given ring. It's an affine scheme, a finite tap over Z. And the reason is that pi1, the topological pi1, is finitely generated. In fact, as we know, the topological pi1 is not only finitely generated, but it's finitely presented. But to show that the moduli exists as a finite tap scheme, and in fact, it's a fine moduli, we need only the finite general. We need only the finite generation here because the presentation is on the Neutronian space. So, and then we define the categorical quotient of F box by GLR, because GLR is acting on the coefficient GL. And then this is a categorial quotient. And the ring of function, by definition, is an invariant of the ring of function on M box. And it's still defined over Z. Defined over Z, and it's called the Betty moduli. So it's really a very classical object. The fibers of M box over M are the closures of orbits of an orbit and a point of M with values in algebraically closed field K of characteristic zero are semi-simple local systems defined over K. So all that is very classical material. Is very classical material. And we define inside of M box, we define the sub-functor of irreducible representations. We have to define what irreducible means because the functor is defined over rings. And then it means that if you look at your representation defined over a ring here, you take all k-value points, field-value points of your ring A and ring A and K has characteristic zero or characteristic P, then you request that this representation is irreducible. So I want to make a remark here. This is this irreducible subfunctor, which is open, has been used by Drinfeld in his proof that the De Jones conjecture implies the Cache-Barre conjecture. So it's an open subfunctor. So now I go to the second page. Can you tell me whether you see? Can you tell me whether you see it? One second. It's not a success. What should I do to get on page? I cannot hear anything here. Probably you need to make it a normal size, change the page. Normal size, normal size, yeah. No, my size, yeah. Okay, I apologize. Okay, let me try here. Okay, but now zoom again. If I apologize, but now I cannot move the text here. So I cannot zoom too much because I cannot shift the page on the screen here. The screen here, or do you uh do you have any? Ah, one second. I think I found okay, we are good. Yes, are we good? Yes, yes, okay, thank you very much. So, uh, you remember on the previous speech, and I'm not going to go back to the previous page, I apologize, we had this irreducible subfunctor, so it defines an open sub-scheme because the thing was representable, and then And then we look at the categorical quotient of this irreducible subfunctor and we call it M-irreducible. So the fibers of this map are GLR orbits and not closure of GLR orbits. And for rho being a complex point in it, then the image in the Betty moduli here, the image is in the CP. Which is in the C points of the Betty moduli. There is a ring of finite type over C such that ρ descends to ρ A and L descends to L E. That means it's a local system with values in a projective module over A. Okay, so that is a classical thing. And now I come to the deep conjectures. And it starts with Simpson in 1990 in his plenary address. In his plenary address at the ICM in Japan. So now we come to the complex points here. The isolated point LC of MC are called rigid local systems. So we have zero-dimensional components, so we cannot move the local system in the modular space. So they are called rigid local system. They all come from points in M box A for a certain A of finite up over Z and so this. And so this means the L C descend to L A because we have, I forgot to say, because it's a scheme of finite tap over C now, we are looking at the moduli over C. Then we are looking at the zero-dimensional components, so we have finitely many of those. So there is a common A for all those. That's the one we take here. And then those local systems are defined over A. And then for any. For any Z L bar points of A, then I denote by yotter this point here, then we define a Z L bar topological local system. But now, because the L bar is endowed with a profinite topology, the topological representation we had from the topological fundamental group with values in this GLR of GL bars, and it is. R of the L bar, then it descends to the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group. And the profinite completion of the topological fundamental group by Riemann existence theorem is a Grotendik fundamental group, et al. fundamental group of X defined over C as a scheme. So it gives an LADIC local system. And Simpson proved already at the time that Already at the time, that if we started with this isolated point, so the rigid L C, then L Yota is arithmetic. And arithmetic means that as an eladic local system, it descends to X defined over a field of finite type over Q. So, and he conjectured, so he showed its arithmetic. So, this was, of course, a very enlightening. Lightning phenomena that rigidity implies this arithmeticity in this sense here, and he conjectures that not only it is arithmetic, but it comes from geometry. And coming from geometry means that it's a splitting of a Gauss-Mannin local system. If I come back to the complex local systems, the topological local system, it's a splitting of a Gauss-Manninine local system on a smooth Gaussmannian local system on a smooth projective morphism over a non-trivial open of X. So the local system is over X. I restrict, there is a non-trivial open. And now because the fundamental group of the non-trivial open subjects to the fundamental group of X, to restrict to the non-trivial open means losing no information at all on this local system. And then on this non-trivial open, it should come from a Gauss manning or a splitting of it of a smooth. Of a smooth projective morphism. And this conjecture of Simpson has been indirectly enhanced by Sasha Petrov a year ago. Sasha is a former student of Markissin. At the time, he was still a student of Markissin. So for any eladic local system on XF, so it's already arithmetic. So X not being projective, we assume that the determinant distortion and That the determinant is torsion and a unipotent monodromy at infinity. So, in our discussion here, we just assume trivial and unipotent monodromy at infinity. Then assume it is geometrically irreducible. That means it's reducible viewed as a local system on XF bar. Write L C for the induced point of the irreducible moduli here, M irreducible, which is obtained by post-computer. Which is obtained by post-composing the representation of the arithmetic local system with injection from the topological local system and then going from the, I'm sorry, the injection from the etal local system and then further post-composing by the map we already discussed from the topological. Discussed from the topological fundamental group to the etal fundamental group of Grotendik, and then noticing that we have best changed for the etal fundamental group from pi one of x over spar to pi one x over c. Then Sacha says that the relative frontier mesh conjecture revisited by him, based on the work of Schulzer and Yuju, which comes from periodic geometry, predicts that L C is geometric, thus integral. Is geometric, thus integral. So Simpson's geometricity conjecture all of a sudden becomes a particular case of Fontaine-Mesur conjecture. Okay, so this is what we have as conjectures, the conjecture of Simpson and the conjecture of front-end measure, which encompasses thanks to Petrov the conjecture of Simpson. Uh, the conjecture of Simpson. So, uh, there are, so to speak, uh, various reasons to think that it might be true because uh, uh, Simpson's conjecture relies on his uh vision of uh Rodge theory, while Fontaine-Meser's conjecture relies on some vision in pure number series, that means really arithmetic geometry over number fields. And the way to go from one to the other is uh. The other is recent advances in P-A-Dico theory due to Schulze and Juju. So, yeah, so it gives certain reason to believe in this, or at least to think about it. And so, now I come back to Simpson, I come back to Rigid Local System. And in 2018, with a young postdoc. Postdoc originally from Austria, Michel Grushenik, who is now a professor at the University of Toronto. We prove the integrality conjecture of Simpson under an extra condition. And this condition is that the isolated point is not only an isolated point, but it has the property that it is a smooth point of the moduli. That means the Zariski-Tenson space is zero, because when you look at Because when you look at the Zariski tantrum space of an isolated point, then if this isolated point is reduced, then it is zero. And if it is not reduced, then it's not zero. So the condition is equivalent to saying that the point is reduced. And it's called comologically rigid. The reason why it's called comologically rigid is because we have a moduli functor. So the Zariski tension space is expressed. Space is expressed via the moduli functor, and then it's a homological condition which can be explicitly described. For example, in the projective variety, when you don't have the condition at infinity, it means that H1 with values in the trust-free endomorphism of the local system is zero. And if you have condition at infinity, it means that the perverse H1, I mean the intermediate extension H1. intermediate extension h1 with values in the same endomorphism of the local system and from it the trace free part is zero let me sketch the proof one part of the proof which explains why our proof cannot be enhanced to a proof of the complete Simpson conjecture which did not assume that the point Can assume that the point had no multiplicity, it was a reduced point. And it goes like this. Let me give you the spirit of the proof, the philosophy of the proof. So again, we look at this composition of fundamental groups, which we mentioned before. So it goes from the topological fundamental group, which goes, it starts with the topological fundamental group, which goes to the etal fundamental group by taking the Fundamental group by taking the profinite completion as discussed before, which makes best change from C to F, bar, and then goes via rotendic specialization homomorphism to the TEM fundamental group. So TEM appears only if X is not proper. The TEM fundamental group of the geometric fiber of X over a closed point. So this little X bar, and then further goes to the TEM fundamental group. The 10th fundamental group of x over s, that means the arithmetic fundamental group. And this, the first part of the sequence of arrows here exists always, but the last part you need p large in such a way that you have good reduction and also a good compactification of x in case x was not proper has also a good reduction. And okay, so this is all Grotendik. all grotendic and now comes the lang lines correspondence so uh thanks to simply correspondence thanks to simps theorem our initial uh our initial topological system once we were taking a z L bar point of the string of definition A of the L adic local system then Simpson was telling us that it becomes arithmetic so it will becomes arithmetic so it will descend to xs or maybe replacing s by a finite extension so now the lang lens corresponds has as a corollary a conjecture formulated by donin in well two which is so-called existence of companions heladic companions so we have an arithmetic local system with trivial determinant and with unique Determinant and with unipotent monodromies at infinity. And then the conjecture of Deline was saying that they are L-primadic companions. What does that mean? That means that we fix a field isomorphism between QL bar and QL prime bar. NQL prime bar. So, of course, it's a field isomorphism, so it's an algebraic isomorphism, but it cannot be a topological isomorphism because there's only one eladic topology. And then we fix that. So, Delin was predicting that there is, once we have this eladic local system, which is elitic, then there is an eladic. Is arithmetic, then there is an L primadic local system, which is arithmetic, defined over the same x lower little s with the property that the Frobeni, all the Frobeni at the close points of X, of capital X, lower little S, that means the variety in characteristic P over the finite field, that all the characteristic polynomials of the Frobeni of those closed points here are the same when you transport. Are the same when you transport them via Sigma. So that means a loose way to say is that the companion is uniquely determined by the fact that it preserves the set of functions of the sheaf. So this was a big conjecture and it has been proved by Laurent LaFour as a corollary of the Langlands program on Of the LangLens program on curves over FP, smooth curves, and has been generalized 10 years ago by Dreenfeld in higher dimension under the assumption that X is smooth, and that's the reason why we assume that X is smooth. While the conjecture of the linear was not for Xmoose, but for X normal, which would be more appropriate as a framework for this question. But we have the This question, but we have the theorem for Xmoose. Okay, so we have this companion, it gives an eladic shift. So, in particular, it's defined over Z L prime bar. And so we go back via the sequence of arrows, which is in the star here, star formula, displayed formula on the board. And then all of a sudden, we obtain a topological topological local system with values in Z L prime bar. And in order to finish the integrality conjecture, we have to know that this L sigma, which we construct like that, which comes from an L prime adic local system, that this one has a property that when we look at The property that when we look at it via the star arrows here as a topological local system, it is isolated, it is rigid, and that we cannot do. But what we can do is under the assumption that the LADI clocal system was homologically rigid, that means this H1 vanishes, then it is the case that the H1 of the companion, the geometric companion, also vanishes because the Also, vanishes because the L function is the same, and the H1 is precisely the weight one part of the whole homology of the endomorphism of this local system. And then to go back to characteristic zero here, one uses best change and comparison isomorphism between Betty Cohomology and L-Adykomoji, or more precisely, L-prama dichomojy here. So that was the proof we had with Michael. With Michel and with Johan here, we try to think again of this proof, and we came with the following idea. So we can reformulate our theorem above here by saying that if we take a zero-dimensional component Z over Q bar of the irreducible open of the Betty moduli here in a given rank R. In a given rank R. And then this map from, so then we take this component, we assume it is non-empty. That means it is equivalent to saying we assume there is an irreducible local system, topological local system of rank R. Then we take the Zariski closure of this Z, which was defined over Q bar. We take the Zariski closure. We take the Zariski closure in the role M irreducible over Z and then the conclusion is that it is surjective. So we ask the following, I apologize, are you still with me? Are you still with me on page two here? Yes. Do you still see? Yeah, thank you. So, because me, it had jumped, I apologize. So, we are, so now I have to, okay, I make it small again. Okay. And I go to page three. Do you see page three now? Yes, you are. So, you're scrolling page three. That's fine. Okay, thank you. Fine, fine. Okay, thank you. So then we ask the following question: Let Z be a non-empty irreducible component here over MQ bar. Is it the case that Z bar, which was a closure in M irreducible, is surjective? As I said, what we proved with Michel is that it is precisely true for zero-dimensional components. So, this question one here is because many people came to me. Because many people came to me, number theories, people doing arithmetic geometry, people doing complex arithmetic geometry, they all asked this question, what is so specific in those zero-dimensional components, in those rigid local systems? And then what I explain now is a try to answer this question with Johan de Jong, which addresses also the high. Which at risk is also the higher dimensional component. So, for the higher dimension, I had also made a try with Maurit Skertz, which was going in a very different direction. This try here is not a try, which is based on the geometricity property, which Simpson was predicting. I mean, this motivity of the arithmetic local system, but it is based on the consequence. Based on the consequence, which is the integrality, and this is what is written here. So, I repeat: we take any component Z of M irreducible over Q bar. We assume it's non-empty, then we take the Zarsky closure, and then we ask whether this is objective. And we can also go on, and that would be an extension, but we will never reach this point too. We will never reach this point too, but I say we can even take a non-empty embedded component and then we didn't have before anything like this, and then ask the same question. Will it be the case that if I take this IC closure, it's going to be surjective on spec Z bar? And we can ask a weak form of one and two together by saying assume that MQ bar irreducible, that means the whole moduli is non-empty, then is it the case that? Then, is it the case that M irreducible is surjective over spec Z? But now, this third condition here, and that's the remark A I made already, saying that one for zero-dimensional components is precisely Simpson's integrality conjecture. But now, this remark, which the remark B, is that this weak form of the conjecture. Of the conjecture has a positive answer, which is precisely theorem 111. Because if you entangle what it means, it means it is surjective. What does that mean? It means that for any prime, first you assume it's non-empty over q bar, so there is a point over q bar, fine. So now we are interested in the characteristic p points, I mean the close points, and then you ask whether. And then you ask whether it is subjective. So that means you ask whether for any L you will find an LADIC local system. And an LADIC, I should say, you should find a ZL-bar, I apologize, you should find a ZL-bar topological local system, which by the discussion we had already before is equivalent to saying you have an eladic local system, which is geometrically irreducible. Irreducible. And that's precisely theorem 111. But the theorem is more general than this, but this is precisely theorem 111. And if you take the 112, which was saying that if you have infinitely many topological complex local systems, then you will have, for any specific L, you will have infinitely many eladic local systems, which are all perwash different and which are also geometrically an absolute. Although geometrically and absolutely irreducible, then theorem 112 is an approximation of one in the sense that we cannot fix the component in which they are located, but we can just say that there are infinitely many of those. If we could locate the components, then we would prove the Simpson conjecture. This is an extra remark here, which I make. And now, in the remaining time, so maybe I make the lecture shorter because it becomes, oh no, okay, I just tell you what kind of mathematics are behind and then I stop. So now I address your M111 and 121. So that means when I have only one irreducible local system, a complex local system, and I want to produce an eladic local system for any L, and I want in addition. Any L. And I want in addition to say that, in fact, there is a closed point S of characteristic P, which is such that all the eladic local system I have constructed, in fact, first descend to this X over this finite field of characteristic P, this little S bar, but in fact are arithmetic there. So that's the one-to-one. So I have repeated here. Repeated here the question, and uh, yeah, to say that it is so okay. So, we want to show that it's subjective, and because we know that we have a characteristic zero point, all we have to do is because the image of such a morphice, because M bar is finite, so the image is constructable. So, in fact, what we already know is that there are only finitely many such L to be considered. So, bad is a union of finitely many. So, bad is a union of finitely many primes. So, recall, we assume we have an L A here, where A was a ring which was in characteristic zero, a ring of finite type over Z. Now, we argue that by the generic smoothness of M irreducible reduced here, so this reduced, you know, when you think of the zero-dimensional component, in the proof with Michel, we had precisely the assumption that all the The assumption that all the components, the components we were looking at, were reduced. But here we take the whole moduli, we take the reduced part of the whole moduli. Then for LR, in particular for L at least three, there is an F L bar point of A. A was again a ring of finite top over Z on which our local system existed here. So we take one such point here, yielding. Take one such point here, yielding now a local system with finite coefficients FL bar. So, and therefore define over some finite extension of F L. Why therefore? Because the fundamental group is finitely topologically finitely generated. In fact, we were looking at the topological fundamental group, so it's even finitely generated, such that the completion here is formally smooth. So, this is generic smoothness here. Smoothness here. Now comes and now we do linear arithmetic. On the other hand, because it's generally smooth, the thing, another way to say that this little X we are looking is absolutely irreducible as a top, that means as a G L R F L bar representation, it is irreducible, and consequently. And consequently, the functor of deformation of a residual representation, little x of measure, is representable by a formal scheme that is part of the theory. And by this formal scheme, one computes just by looking at the moduli fonteur, that this formal scheme is precisely identified with the completion of this irreducible. Of this irreducible moduli, which we defined before, at the close point. So, this is denoted here by M irreducible hat, hat for completion, at the close point little X. So, now we choose close point S in our base of our model. I recall that this S was precisely the scheme finite type over the Over Z, over which X was defined and had a good rational point, S-valued rational point. And we take a point here, S of characteristic, which is not dividing the order of the monodromic group of this little X, which was residual representation. Or if we like, we can even assume that it's not dividing the order of GLR of L A with a notation we introduced before, that's a little X. Before, that's a little x is defined over f L A, where F L A is the residue field of little X. This is a characteristic, not again, this little S is going to be a characteristic not being the cardinality of any of the bad primes. So we take an S which is in the good locus for the morphism we want to analyze, and such that now it's a geometric condition such that the Such that there is a good compactification of X, which remains a good compactification by reducing modulus this little S here. And why that? Oh, there's a typo which I have to correct. Then via grotendic specialization homomorphism, then it is surjective. Otherwise, specialization, I mean, if X is proper, there's no condition on the compactification, but if X is not proper, If x is not proper, then I need first the existence of the specialization homomorphism, and this is guaranteed if we have a good relative normal compactification. And then it is objective on the temp part. And in addition, this is an isomorphism on the pro p prime completion. And because of the choice of s then the residual characteristic is precisely pro p prime. That means the order is not divisible by p. Not divisible by p and consequently descends by uh Grothendieck because he's telling us that this is uh neither of these on the probi prime so it descends to x little s bar and now because the monodromy is finite then the Frobenius of S does not necessarily respect the residual monodromy, the monodromy which is denoted by little x. Which is denoted by little x, but uh, but because it's finite, then a power is respecting it, so we can replace s by a finite cover on which inside of s bar on which the monondromy is trivialized of the residual representation. If you like, it becomes a pure um, yeah, it's uh not trivialized. I said nonsense. I said that a power, yeah, but. Said that the power of the Frobenius is going to stabilize the residual representation. And so the power of Frobenius defines this finite extension S prime over S. And consequently, we can assume X is Frobenius invariant. And consequently, a Meserce deformation space of X is also Frobenius invariant. I should say this construction I'm talking about here. Construction: I'm talking about here with replacing X by the finite extension so that it's Robinus invariant is also due to Drinfeldinis proof that the Deyon conjecture implies the Cashivara conjecture. So now, because we are in the good locus here, the reduced dx, that means the reduced formal scheme here, then it's smooth, it's formally smooth, I should say formally smooth here, and verifies De Jong's conjecture because De Jong's conjecture. Conjecture because De Jong's conjecture, let me say what I've written here. De Jong's conjecture, I mean, he formulated the conjecture in a slightly different way, but observed already, and this is a main corollary of De Jong's conjecture, is that if we look at the Frobenius, because the Frobenius is acting, as we said, we had prepared the situation where the Frobenius was acting on DX and consequently. On dx, and consequently dx reduced, then the Frobenius is acting. So I can take the invariant formal subscheme, which is closed, and then look at the morphism on the ring of it vectors over FL bar. And then this is finite and flat. That's the main corollary of De Young's conjecture. And De Jong's conjecture has been proved now not with the Lange length program, but with geometric Lang. But with geometric length for L at least three. And that's the reason why I was careful to take L at least three earlier on on the file here. And this is finite flat. But now a Frobenius invariant pointer on Mesor's deformation space is precisely an LADIC representation, which is arithmetic. And consequently, we find an absolutely irreducible arithmetic LADIC local system, LL. So now I have. So now I have to change the file right. So, okay, so we learned something. So tell me whether you see now we zoom. Yes. Is that good? Yes, we can see page four. Well, page four is page infinity. So we stop. Okay. So, by the way, what time is it? Oh, we are good. Okay. Well, I remember. Okay, well maybe we don't explain the second part, but uh second second part is interesting, but okay, fine. So uh well maybe I say one word because there is a numerical computation which is really fun. So now I finish the theorem. So we choose an L prime which is one of the bad primes. We choose a sigma as we said. We do the companion of L sigma. It's now we compute in Now we compute inside of Deline's conjecture on the existence of the companion, which we know. The L lower L was absolute geometrically irreducible. So the companion is geometrically irreducible because this is something you can also read on the L function. And it will still have, you follow the theory, it will still have a trivial determinant. A trivial determinant, the geometric one still have trivial determinants, unipotent monotromes at infinity. That is the theorem of Delin, not Lafourg and Rinfeld. By the way, there's an interesting thing here because Delin controls that it is still unipotent. I mean, in general, Delines control the semi-simple local monodromy, but it does not control the local monodromy itself. So if I start with unipotent monodromy, Monodromy at infinity. I will land applying the Langlands program and the companions. I will end up with uniponang monodromy at infinity, but I will not know whether I have the same Jordan blocks. So this is an interesting thing. We have no hold on it. So anyways, unipode and monodromy. And those, when we go back, you remember this star here meant we were coming back to complex geometry and topological. To complex geometry in a topological local system, we obtain the L prime bar point of the modular space of topological local system. And here I forgot the bars, bar of irreducible. I apologize for the typo. So by definition of bad, so now we have a point Zp here already. But so that means But so that means I should say it terminates the it ends the proof of one one one that means the existence of an eladic local system for NEL but and also it has a proof of the S part of the theorem one two one the S part meaning that we can make them arithmetic on X lower S for all of them except the one at P and the one at P And the one at P, we just do the same thing by choosing another P. You remember, P had a lot of room. We had only three bullet points to respect with the order of the monodromy and so forth. Okay, so that's the end of the proof. And when we have infinitely many of those, let me not redo the proof. Let me just tell you that we put them all. All we put because we have infinitely many of those over the Fidel complex number, if you like, over Q bar, we put infinitely many of those on one irreducible components, and then we argue irreducible components of M irreducible, and then we argue again by a geometric, by a generic smoothness, I apologize, for the underlying reduced scheme of Z. But then there is a There is a little funny computation. Is that you remember one condition we needed over the characteristic? We had three bullet points. Two of them are coming, one was coming from geometry. The geometry is good when you reduce modulo P. So this is okay. It doesn't have anything to do with infinitely many local systems, with the choice of the local system. But then the first one I forgot, but I forgot, but this was nothing new here. But the new thing is that we were talking a P, which was such that it was good with respect to the order of the residual representations, the little X. So here we cannot do that because we consider, of course, I didn't read the first part of the proof, but we will consider rather than looking at one X. Rather than looking at one X, we consider many X, many close point on the closed F L bar fiber of M. And so we consider those close points. And who, I mean, how can I know that I find a P which is good for the order of all of them? Because we move the. But then we are over F L bar. So when you F L bar. So when you look at the you had one L one P which was good, it was good with respect to the order of G L R with coefficients in F L A, you remember. But now this order is a special number which everybody can compute because it involves only powers of L. Do you remember this is L n? Remember, this is L N, I'm sorry, L A minus R, I apologize. So this is L R A minus L R minus one A times L R A minus L R minus two times A times, etc. Okay, you remember that? So it goes. So when you take this number and you This number and you raise it. So, what does that mean? That the order is prime? It means that this magic number is a unit in the field FP. So, that means said differently, yeah, it's a unit in the field FP. But now, when I take P powers of it, it's still a unit in the field FP because that's itself, modulo P, and so forth. So, I can take the P power, the P square power, and so forth. Square power and so forth, and that means replacing L A by L A P, L A P square, L A P to the power 3, and so forth. So we have infinitely many L like this where we can restrict. Okay, so that's the end of the story. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you for your beautiful talk. So, are there questions here in the audience? Here in the audience, Mark? Bruno, I don't know. Bruno, do you have a question? No? It's a hard stuff. It's difficult to understand. So what about the people in the chat? Yeah, yeah. I mean, if I had been on the board, it would have been much easier because we can talk. Easier because we can talk, but here I had no time to prepare slides, so the PDF is not very thankful. I apologize. No, it was a beautiful talk. Thank you. Thank you very much, Lynn. So we thank her again. And yeah, thank you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. So we resume in 50 minutes. 15 minutes. Yeah, the button we got. So I will have to bring a spot out in the room. Yeah, yeah, I will do that, I will be open. If we do that, I think we all have uh some of the URLs. So, Bruno, before you go, couldn't find uh
