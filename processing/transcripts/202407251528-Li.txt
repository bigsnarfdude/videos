I think this micro event. Now that a lot of previous speakers and charts have introduced apologies for any of the concepts, I hope to not take more than 20 minutes. So Gali, you can basically ignore this. This will be made up afterwards. I will tell you where it really comes from in a later slide. So you know, like I want to introduce Polygenic Business 4, you all know what this is and it has to be used for And it has been useful, and I think Lucia showed this picture about the end representation of non-European populations and their performance in non-European populations into different local populations. But it's actually more severe than what's actually shown in BCL's papers because we're talking about complementary. Because we're talking about continental foods. But it's actually related to Mal's question earlier in the morning to Cheng Yang. When you talk about really African, not African Americans, when you talk about African Americans, it's really a very diverse range of percentage of African European ancestry. So people actually start to realize the need for minority populations, their constants, methods of mainly developed by people in this audience. Audience. But then they really focus still on engineers, the leaders. We have models like the PICCI box that takes UK development and data, which is primarily European ancestry, and then Atlantic and Japan, which is primarily Chinese ancestry. But really still multiplied into mixed populations. American British markets are mosaics of a different Different continental ancestry groups. So there are some methods, which I will give a little bit of background to, that deal explicitly at mixed populations, and then we'll talk about some of the limitations. Okay, so the first method I briefly mentioned is the Geraxy CSX. I think Charles also mentioned the method at all. CSX is actually. CSX is actually red out by the last author. So I think people are quite familiar with this framework. It means shrinkage. CS part comes from the X part is across populations. So that's how it's used information across diverse ancestry groups. And like a biological guardian, of course, there are certain And of course, there are certain issues like an existing pattern that haven't dealt with. So, for Wolfgang's CSX, the main problem now applied to admix populations. It's like a steel bias towards European populations. Some of the statistics which are strongly biased towards European ancestry individuals. And of course, it didn't explicitly. The other method, which is probably the only method that exists. Are probably the only method that explicitly deal with ethnics of populations because we do consider the percentage and the local percentage of different ancestor, like local ancestry segments. And the applied ancestry-specific GOS results based on the target individuals and local ancestral mixed parties improvements for dealing with that mixed. with that mixed population's other method. But you know, like still, there are like the same issue, you know, still biased towards broken as history population. Summary statistics, broken is based on much larger sample size and African, it's very not only we saw smaller sample sizes, but we saw actually also African birds. So it's depending on the Depending on the composition of the individual GWAS, where the summary statistics for COVID-Africa derived from, there can be stronger bias. And then they ignore the complex ULD information and mixing. So now that's where the name really comes from. The name was actually motivated by a very famous Spanish architect Gaudi and I got it, and I see the architecture, so very universal design and big competence in architecture. And here we're dealing with genetic motives also. In terms of methods, it's actually a very simple method. We first of all explicitly consider local ancestry. I think that's That's the like a biggest part, both in terms of what information is used and different from a lot of the standard public analysis score method. So for illustration, my purpose, I'm just showing two ancestry groups, like the right one ancestry one, and who would ancestry mean about the African American individual with the ancestry from African and European. From African and European ancestors. The X denotes the allelic status. So I is the image index, J is the worker index, and when 2 is the Hapal time index. And this is basically the allele information which we typically use. But then, in addition to that, we also have local accessory information in this case. And this particular locus of this individual comes from. This individual comes from a red ancestry, so the L and is a simple art. And sorry, like I just copied the slides from my Windows so this didn't show up very well. But this is a phenotype of the individual eye and then like a standard PRS, you just have one beta for each marker. Here we're basically, in this case, I have two betas. In this case, I have two betas. So, we see that we allow the effect of each marker to be different when we are of different local ancestry values. And the other part is the same. So, basically, when the beta A's and beta B's are the same, it's just reduced like a terminal basis. And in terms of, sorry, this is really. This is really the objective function. It shows up very well, but like the first part is the standard and auto-known part. It's basically where the observed value is different from the predicted value. And the second part is the panel part. And we basically did this animation construct correctly. So this red box is supposedly to be on the lambda. So the lambda uh controls the overall minimalization. Control the overall utilization as we said you saw so far for the test of the latest people awake. Sorry about that. And then like this is supposed to be on the D part. And the PT is the total number of markers. So this, you know, like in this D matrix, if we have P T markers, this matrix will be of dimension 3PT times 2 P T. So we'll have a 3 P T probability. You know, like three PT rows and then two PT columns. So, let me explain the columns first. So, basically, like each marker, you have like two columns because we have the data A numerical for each marker and data P for each marker. And the way we design it is that we have one and negative one next to each other so that basically this is a fusion part. We can take a few solar cell framework and this part, the way we construct the E-matrix, we are encouraging. We are encouraging the two parameters for the same marker to be similar. So, although we allow them to be different to accommodate, you know, like sort of markers have differential effects, but we do realize most of the markers, they have very similar effect, if not the same effect. So, the lambda controls overall, and now let me explain the roles of this D matrix. So, the top part is basically the fusion part, which I just explained. Which I just explained. And the bottom part is actually the standard, like a sparsity part. So we basically want fewer markers and fewer parameters to pronounce it. It's actually a very straightforward model. And the gamma part, so as you can see, the gamma part basically controls the balance between the future and sparsity. So the larger So the larger idea is it's how it will increase the sparsing and decrease the future. So basically for the QSO RSO framework we have two tuning parameters. And okay so Charles introduced the PAG consortium and the Women's Health Initiative is one of the contributing studies. Contributing studies like sub-studies within WHI, and in particular, there's two sub-studies we used because they have large sample sizes of either African-Americans or European ancestry because MAGA has around 7,000 African-Americans, and the WIMPS has about 6,000 European ancestry individuals. Our Gaudi method actually does not need like Not need like European ancestry indicators about it because we want to also compare with the PRCCX acts and like a bunch of acts. So they require European ancestry indicators. But I would also include the women's study. And we, you know, like also besides the two methods I said, you know, like identity diverse populations, we also use it uh precise just as a match market because it's one of the most frequent. Participant because it's one of the most like Paris construction methods. So we need a valuation using this for the R squared. So I have to talk about the traits. The next slide. But we used a gold across validation. And in some parts, I will probably talk in more details. It's nasty the five fold across validation because in a training part when we use eighty percent for training, we we further like a dual fivefold within the eighty percent. Fivefold within the 80%. So just to get into the result part compared with the other methods, again, none of them are specifically acceptable for partial charts. The other two methods were not developed for admixed populations. So it's not surprising to see that they actually move doubling the square compared with the ice. And there's also quite a big important partial care asset. And so I showed two results where we also saw a big difference. We also evaluated quite a few methods. For a lot of the binary traits, we don't see as much improvement. But the good news is it's very similar performance. There's no performance impairment either. So, here I show for C-reactive protein and white blood cell count. I think Lisa talked about the Duffy period, which will come up in C-period, which is a big part of white blood cell counts. So, in the red lines from our college and the company methods, you can see visually that's much better. And so far, you know, we're doing co-code fair. Very quote-quote fair comparison in that we use the exact same, you know, like 7,000 African mergers and 60,000 European ancestry individuals. But people may ask, okay, you know, if you're in precise, if you're using GRX CSX, you know, you can use summary statistics for much larger published than like a GWA studies. I don't have to restrict yourself to the GPS studies that we have in hand. So that's what we did. We basically compared with precisely incorporated over half a million European ancestry individuals into as a mosque reactive protein. And we also used the Kerala CSX, which is based both on the 5,000 cross-parallel Asia, 80% of 7,000 is about 5,000, and plus the over half million ancestry. And you can see, you know, like I am similar for white blood. For white blood cell count. And you can see, even in this case, the other two methods use more information basically. And at least for those two traits, you still see an explicit model that local ancestry has gained. So I feel like this is a useful message for the ability to appreciate local ancestry. Of course, this adds to more practical Uh, more practical, um, like uh issues like how do we share it with low ancestry information, and uh, like how do we share it together with the genotype information. Um, I think I have wait more minutes. Um, the last message I want to talk about is basically the outliers. And like remember, like we have with this few select framework where we have two sets of priorities of each marker, one corresponding to each. Marker one corresponding to each ancestry. And then you may wonder: okay, if whatever we, you know, if the beta A's and beta J's are saying here, I'm plotting the beta A's versus the beta J's. They all align, you know, like a line, the diagonal line. I mean, there's no point of using that. And in those two traits, zero active protein and white blood cell count, we do see some of the outliers. And I'm just taking white blood cell counts, for example. Taking white blood cell count, for example, this is a famous marker, and it's very high, and those two are actually very high LD with the doping all variant. So you don't see doping covariant itself because it was not genotyped or well imputed because those are in the region that have very high LD with the Duffy Albearant. So basically, you know, like the outliers where the ancestry specific. Ancestry-specific estimates are quite different across the two ancestry groups. They can give us quite some useful information in terms of the biology of the really driving markers and aligning traits. So, yeah, I will see. But the bears is basically like a bear. So we have So we have some more examples like I mentioned before. For some of the trades, you see a bit more gains, for some of the other trades, like a bit more significant difference. So basically we try to find a few more trades how to choose where I also formed a significant metaphor. So as a summary, we developed the discarding framework where we explicitly all the local ancestry information. All the local ancestry information, the lot of ancestry-specific exercise. And you can see this is a summary of the trade, a kind of auto-perform method which takes summary statistics derived from what you call over half a million European ancestry individuals. Also, as I showed in the last example, sometimes they can find those large ancestry differential effects. Here, I don't know whether it's really differential because the Davino mirror has quite large. Because the Daphnell mirror has quite low frequency for the ancestry and missing ancestry-specific effects that can be quite useful to understand. And we added to thank students who lead the work, Janssen and Bryce Morland, and my group, and of course for full author list. The work is actually published earlier this year in Nature Communications. And of course, thank and also the EPIC PRS, the European, and within the private consortium. So Charles and Langjin and Alicia are all in this polygenic school construction consortium with different populations. So a lot of exciting collaborations within this group are actually working actively with three or four groups a final effort to I'm after the tool like African workers paid for from Deppers Alabama and work the windows have to take them out and get it. Yeah, I was just quickly asking about the application, right? So you treat these African-Americans as a mix of application. You do PR support for that. And then you give two accessory applications. History population. What is the other one? I'm not exactly sure. Effort. Where are you getting that data? So basically, in terms of reference panels, people have been using 1000 genomes and the HTTP. But there has been debates whether the HTTP should be used. But 1000 genome has been high-standard in a reference panel because there are indicators from African continent. Yeah, but even for Africans, there's several different subpopulations, you just put it together. You just close it together? Yeah. Okay. Right, right. At least for one project, there's about 500 individuals. But you are actually getting to one of the active projects we're discussing. Here, I mean, you see in the same place the pause for example, there's only two ancestral groups. But then there's big debates or trend of arguing against putting people in discrete buckets, right? Even for reference. Exactly as you said, there's not just one African There's not just one African population, you know, like West Africa, Central African, East African. There's, you know, like African population is arguably more diverse than any other continental Europe in terms of genetics. So, you know, like how can we basically using more continuous ancestry information? And then how do we model that? And then, you know, like if you do one parameter for each ancestor group, this will not be a As good, this will not be a very efficient framework, modern framework. This one should be quicker. You need a first push-facing, right? I mean, this is very channeling. Well, the first push-facing, you do the local mixture, man. For everyone, right? Is that for everyone? Yeah, I want to. It's related, but it's not type inference more and makes her happy. So you just infer the local ancestors. Because it's giving you a small example. Oh, because it's giving us a couple of table 40 cable. Right, right, yeah, yeah, yeah. But the whole is on the table. So the local answer inference is just a usual agents one time. So that's the same for like a flare, for like a Sharon and Rhine Ron, they have the new method, which is actually a Python. So what is the rich of the element of fraction the damage ideas? I think I would say it's less. I would say it's like 60 to 70 percent Armenian. Japanese is actually all African, so there's a difference. And Mesa is actually very, very diverse. It's like only 50-60%.
