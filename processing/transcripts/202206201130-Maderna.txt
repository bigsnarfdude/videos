So it's time to go back. The next speaker is going to be Ezequiel Moderna, and he's going to talk about these busmanic functions and hyperbolic motions in the Newtonian and body problem. Part one. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you to organizers for. Thank you to the organizers for this nice invitation. And I will talk about a joint work with Andrea Venturelli from Avignon University. And it's a work. The first part is already done two years ago, and there is a second part which is in progress, more or less finished. And this second part will be the subject of Andrea's talk tomorrow. So essentially, So essentially, today I will talk about existence theorem and Andrea tomorrow will explain the unique unicity. And okay, so I don't. So the substitute is the n-body problem. So I have n masses, positive masses in the nuclear space. Pace of dimension at least two. Okay, if you want, is R2 or three, but you can have more dimensions and you have the configurations with position R1 and Rn. This is for the notation, and I will consider the consider the the the the the the mass in the product in the space of configurations if i have another configuration the the mass scalar product is nothing but the sum of the product of the positions affected by the mass the volume okay this is very important to to to write uh compact equations to use this this inner product To use this inner product. And I use, of course, the classical problem. I have the potential function, which is the sum of the product of the masses over the distance, where Reg is the distance between body I and body G. Okay, so with this potential. So, with this potential, I have the Newton equation, Newton's equation, which are in this compact form, x double dot equal naval u of x. Okay, so the solution of this equation are the motions of the embody problem. And okay, so the work with Andrea starts. So the work with Andrea starts five years ago looking for the final motions, which is the final evolution of an orbit, assuming that this motion is definite for all the future times. Because of course, in this embody problem, you can have motions which end in finite time with collision or even with another more complex ways of ending. Ways of ending call it the pseudo collisions. This is more or less well understood now, and we know that there are pseudo collisions with four bodies in the plane, but you don't have pseudo collisions for three bodies. Okay, and then this goes back to the work of Jean-Jacquis, which has already. Which was already seated by Tere this morning, and the classification is more or less the same, but there is one case which cannot occur in the three-body problem, but can occur with more bodies a priori. It is not known if this such orbit exists or not, which are called the super-hyperbolic motions. I think that it's open to know if. Think that it's open to know if probably you have a super hyperbolic motion for when you have four or five bodies, uh, it's more or less the same complexity to find the set of collisions. So you have a classification, okay, and the classification is a okay, hyperbolic, parabolic. Bounded is a colour by Jossy elliptic, oscillatory, and super hyperbolic. Super hyperbolic, and they are combination of and also partially hyperbolic. Which are of this kind, and also you have a hyperbolic and elliptic, which is kind of partially elliptic bounded. You can have these combinations. And you can have, okay, you can have this situation for the future and also for the past. And we will look at some special case of. Some special case of motions which are geodesics for the Jacobi metric for all the time. And this exclude a lot of possibilities. This exclude, for instance, oscillatory and bounded. And I will see that also this kind of super hyperbolic. And okay, this parabolic occurs in the In the zero energy level, and if you start looking the parabolic motions, you see that it's well known that for parabolic, if x of t is parabolic, this means that that x dot of t That x dot of t goes to zero, and in particular, the energy is zero. And you see that the norm of H of t must be like t power two-third, and that and moreover, if you divide by the size, x of t divided by of t divided by norm of x of t this must approach the set of central configurations okay so you you cannot go to infinity in the in parabolic case with any uh shape for the Shape for the expansion. So, for instance, if you have three bodies and you have a parabolic motion, at the end, the bodies go to, for instance, equilateral shape or perhaps a collinear shape with a ratio given by the Ratio given by the Euler, the ratio of the Euler central collinear configurations. And so this was the first question we pose with Andrea to know what happens if the energy is positive, if you have a hyperbolic motion. And we look at the paper of Chassis. In fact, there are previous works of Chassis. Previous works of Chassis in this subject, and we see that Shassy says that probably you have a motion like this one. It is possible that the motion will be hyperbolic in this sense. So the theorem of Chassis is a theorem of classification, not a theorem of existence. Not a theorem of existence. You know, this category, for instance, oscillatory, was open for a big time to know if there are motion or not. And here in hyperbolic, Chassis says, okay, hyperbolic means that x of t is like t times a plus small o of t, where a Where A is a configuration in the set of configurations without collisions. This means that the distance between the bodies goes to infinity. Go to infinity like t in fact this is like t times the norm of a A E G okay the distance between the positions A E and G here so all the distance diverge like T more or less and uh as he gives also a And Shassy gives also more precise asymptotics in infinity when you have this situation. In fact, he proved that this is a term in log t. A more precise expansion. And okay, so the question is for parabolics, you go to a central configuration. And when you look at the positive energy level, the question is: is it possible to The question is, is it possible to have motions with any limit shape here, A or not? And the answer is this with Andrea. It says that you can find this kind of motion for any A with the collisions and for any energy level. But in fact, the energy level is. fact the energy level is is given here by by the the configuration the the energy level is a uh so the limiting velocity is is a this is a consequence of of the just see the the asymptotics because here if you derive you have a but you don't know what is the derivative of this model o but in fact the asymptotics of c allow us to to show that the the limit velocity here is is That the limit velocity here is a, okay? And then you have that the energy is one-half norm A square. So if you choose the shape, you can rescale the shape to have any value of the energy, positive value. Okay? So the theorem is that So, the Ethereum phase. It's given any initial configuration and And any L shape, A, a configuration without collision, there exists an interval of motion as three goes to plus infinity. And the natural question here. Question here is inspired by the problem of know if you have the combinations for the three-body problem, if you can have oscillatory in the future and bounded in the past, etc. Here you can ask, okay, can you have instead of fixing the ah okay and here the term says that x of zero is x0 so you have two n You have two n parameters, n parameters for the configuration and n for the initial configuration. So the other natural question which remains open is instead of fixing the initial configuration, try to find motions with fixed final evolution in the future, a fixed A for the future, another fixed A, a minus for the past. For the past. So open question. If you fix A plus and A minus with the same norm, of case, of course, because you you you are looking for a motion which is a asymptotic to the limit shape. Is asymptotic to the limit check A plus A plus in the future and A minus in the past. So you need to have the same size for the configurations in order to have the orbit of energy H. If it's two configurations, which norm of A minus equal norm of A plus. Okay. The question is, did you exist X of T such that Such that x of t equal t a plus minus plus small o plus minus of t when t goes to plus minus infinity. And this is a for me a very very interesting question because if if yes you have a very high Very high complexity of the motions in the positive energy level. Usually, we found the chaoticity of the n-body problem. You know, looking at the periodic orbits and the conjugacy of with a shift, so this is done in the negative energy level. Negative energy levels in general. And here you can probably see the complexity of the system in the positive energy level. And perhaps it's another kind of complexity, which is not a shift or horseshoe, another kind. Okay, so first of all, we are asking to, we are looking for the existence of this. for the existence of these solutions. And the conjecture is that perhaps you have motions connecting these limit shapes for a dense set of pairs, perhaps for all. Okay, so what is the method for proving this result? This result is using a geometric and variational method, which is more or less looking at the solution of the Amit-Jacobi equation. Yes, solution of the kind, the Busman functions. And here, the Bushman functions, we will see that there are not smooth functions, but there are. Functions, but there are global viscosity solutions of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation corresponding to this system. So the Hamiltonian H of X P is, well no, it's one over one half norm of P squared plus minus U of X. And in fact, we will solve this equation. Solve this equation for H positive constant or zero, also zero and okay so how we we found these uh solutions in fact I we define the okay the Lagrange action we know the the for a curve gamma from From AB to EN, you have the dagrangian action, okay? And we define for given, okay, I will define the set C, X, Y, and T, the set of curves gamma. Gamma some interval with n such that gamma of a equal x, gamma of b equal y. And then I define the critical, the action potential. The action potential will be this function. Sorry and phi H of X Y will be the infimum of of phi of x y t plus h t and when the gamma is any curve gamma in the set of all curves so c of x y is the union in positive times of the set of curves c of x y t so if we minimize Nice. Yes. But yes. No. Okay, yes, yes, yes, it's the same. Okay, it's the same to write this formula or minimizing all the curves. Or minimizing all the curves going from x to y in any time. Okay, it's the same. It's okay. Okay. And this is the this v h is exactly is the distance is the distance function of the Jacobi metric. This is Jacobi metric. I'll continue here. CH is okay, it's a factor is 2H plus U of X times the metric given by the mass scale. The metric given by the mass scalar product. And then, and then I will define the set of subsolutions, weak subsolutions of the Hermitage Covid equation, which are this set: SH. H coincides precisely with the function u from the space of configurations to R, such that u of x minus u of y is less or equal to the distance of Jacobi. You can see that this set agree. So this is the set of functions which are one Lipschitz respect to the Shachoimetric. Its respect to the Jacoboi metric, and this is precisely the set of weak solutions of this equation. In fact, if you write this equation explicitly, you can see that asking this quantity to be less or equal than h is more or less that solving the A-connell equation norm of du equal one for the norm of the Jacobi metric. Okay, but here. Okay, but here I only say that the set of solutions is precisely this set of functions. And then I will construct the Bootsman function, or not Bootsman's function, or functions. So U in C0 is another function. Of En is another function whole function if u is the limit, sorry, u is the limit of when n goes to infinity of a sequence of subsolution of this type. phi of x to p n minus phi of zero p n so this function phi h sorry phi h ph this function phi h from x to p n is nothing but the distance function to the point p n for some sequence. Or some sequence P n going to infinity. Okay, so essentially we have the points P n And we look at the distance function from x to pn and then we normalize with this factor in order to have this function in zero value the value zero. And if you have this limit, we have a We have a that we call in the Gromov study of the boundaries at the infinity of a metric space, or the metric length space, it's the colour of the Order of functions. And this contains the special case of Busman function. The case of Bushmann function, you've got this Pn is a sequence in a geodesic array. But a priori, you have any sequence Pn going to infinity. P n going to infinity. Okay, but so if we prove with Andrea, we prove that that we have proved that if you Or a function then the gradient curves generalize because these functions are purely are not uh smooth. These functions are purely not smooth, but you have in a generalized sense guiding curves are geodesic rays of the Jacobi metric. And so the technique is And so the technique is take a well-choosed sequence Pn to prove the existence of hyperbolic motions. We take a sequence Pn, if you take a if P n is of the form lambda n A plus Plus, well, this form, lambda n A, with lambda n going to infinity. So if you choose Pn in the direction given by the configuration A, then in this case, we have that these restrict rates are hyperbolic. Then we have that. That the judicial is the gliding curves are hyperbolic with a limit shape are And this is time, no? It's finished. I have three minutes. Yes. More? So if you look at the to explain this more clearly, look at the Kepler problem. If you look at the Look at the Kepler problem. If you look at the Kepler problem, so we take a direction A here, so P n is a half line. And then when we look at the gradient curves of these functions, which are the same that this part, because this is a constant for n fixed at n, this is a constant. So the gradient curves of this is are the. This is are they more complicated? It's something like this. If you don't have gravitational force, this is the gradient. force this is the the gradients of the distance function to this point pn but with the the force of the center you have this this image and then and when n goes to plus infinity you have the the the gradient curves of of this limit which is the the the solution which are nothing but the the set of hyperbolas with this direction a A functionality and then once you have the function and you have the Guardian curves in the United States. The generalized sense, you have for any x0, you take x0, you have a calibrating curve, started at x0, and the limit shape A. And this proved the theorem. So let me say one of the aspects of the proof. One of the aspects. The first one is that if you take this PN. If you take this P n as lambda n A plus nothing, like lambda n A, and you construct this function. Of course, this is a distance function. Distance to B n is one Lipschitz respect to the Jacobi metric. So it's a subsolution. This is a weak subsolution of the Amito-Jacobi equation. If you subtract a constant, it's the same because the Amitro-Jacobi equation is up to a constant. But the question is how to have a little. To have a limit. So we need compacity. You need to have in this space some kind of compacity. And this is one of the main facts is due to the estimates that I have proved time ago, 15 years ago for the Lagrangian action. For the Lagrangian action, let me uh so let me explain. Ah, okay, so I will finish this talk by showing the compacity of this space, and I will see that with the same estimate we can prove that the geodesic rays are not super hyperbolic. Are not super hyperbolic, and this is key to prove the limit shape of the gradient curves. And moreover, that the calibrating curves of these solutions don't present set of collisions. So in fact, it's a more general result, is that the geodesic rays, the geodesic rays of the Jacobi metric are not super hyperbolic when I've defined it for all the future. When I define it for all the future, and cannot present set of collisions. This is key for the proof of the main theorem. So the estimates are like this. So this is like I prove it in 2006, but it's provisioned in 20. Okay. And there is there are constants, positive constants. Constant such that the minimal action for going through x to y in time t, okay, if such that if you have two configurations and you have a real number R which is bigger than the distance of the between the configuration. Distance between the configurations, then this minimal action in time t is less or equal than alpha and r square over t plus beta t over r. And this is important that I take a constant r which is bigger than the distance. Why? Because of course, if the configurations are different, this is positive. And I can replace by I can replace by continuity here strictly strict inequality. But by continuity, this is continuous in error when error is positive. So if the deconfigurations are different, I can put here by continuity distance between x and y square and here the distance. But when the configuration coincide, you have Coincide, you have here infinity. Okay. So, but what is the question? With this estimate, we can show another estimate when if you take phi zero, for instance. Phi zero is if we take the minimum of this value for any t positive time. And if you take the minimum, the minimum in t minimum in t here you have this can be bounded by the minimum of this function in t so if you take t equal uh taking t equal r power three half you take this time from going to x to y where r is any constant bigger than the distance then you get alpha plus beta plus beta r power one half okay and then so this is so you have a by continuity now you have you have that that that phi of x y phi zero is less or equal that that some constant That some constant times the distance over one half. Okay, so it's a one-half held for the critical action potential when you look at the zero energy level. And if you look at the positive energy level, you can make more the similar reasoning. So if you look at the positive energy level, we can bound. We can bound like this. We so p of xy t plus h t case is equal to that alpha square t plus beta plus h beta over r yes. L yes times T okay or positive H we have this and then you minimize this function in the all positive times and you you you obtain some error depending on some time t which give the minimum of this function and you get this this inequality. Inequality that the distance, the Jacobi distance between two configurations is less or equal than something like this: alpha one norm of x minus y plus beta one h norm x minus y square and the square root of all this. And this is not a This is not a helder function globally, but it's saying that when the configurations are close, this is more or less like a square root of the distance. And when the configurations are far away, this is more or less like the Euclidean distance. And then now to finish, I will take two minutes only. Two minutes. I will show that so this is this gives the capacity of the set of solutions. Now suppose that suppose gamma No, sorry. I will prove the case, only the case of the pseudo collision. Is also minimizing is minimizing for pH so and present. Present acid collision in the final time in T equal T star. Okay, I will prove that this is not possible. That you don't have pseudo collisions with the geodesic minimizing geodesic. Minimizing geodesics. So, and so if you have this, you apply the von Seipel theorem theorem. We know that you must have a sequence. A sequence times Tn approaching the final time T star such that such that the distance sorry such that the norm of gamma of T n that you call this or Or take the distance to command of zero, comma zero. I call this Rn go to infinity. Because von Seibel theorem, see one minute. Von Seibel theorem says that if you have a pseudo collision, the positions are unbounded for night time. And then if the motion is minimizing, you have that the You have that this distance is equal to phi h. So phi h between gamma of zero and gamma of tn is this is bigger than the we have a lower bound which is trivial due to the Cauchy Schwartz inequality. So if you integrate the kinetic part, you must have that the that this action it must be bigger than if you Bigger than, if you integrate the kinetic part, is one half rn square over t plus h tn t n for time tn in one hand. And in the other hand, you have this inequality. You have a square root of alpha one ln plus beta. Rn plus beta one h rn square. Okay, and what happens when tn approach t star? So this tends to t star. Okay, so this has this tend to to t star. So this tends to a constant. So this must grow like a n square. Rn is the distance. Rn is the distance between the point gamma zero and gamma of tn, but rn go to infinity. So this goes like a rn square and go to infinity. But here, this is a well equal to some constant. Okay, so it's impossible. In the same way, you can prove that there are no super hyperbolic motions and then And then another argument. So thank you. Thank you. Is there any question in the room? What is the relation? The relation. Why I am interested in see that the interested in see that these motions are not viperbolic. Yes, because I will explain quickly. I want to apply a theorem of Marcel and Sari, which say this that says that if x of t is defined for solution motion Define it for all positive time for all the future. Then ether x of t is super hyperbolic. This means that r of t is the maximal distance. Between the bodies, I type t is this function divided by t tends to plus infinity. This means superhyperbolic. Or you have the well-behavioral situation, X of T is like a H of t is like a t times something plus a big O of t over two-thirds. Okay. And then the scheme of the proof is you prove that you don't have a pseudo-collision with this estimate. You prove that this situation also is impossible for pseudosic rays. And then you have this. Once you have this, you must prove that this is precisely. This is precisely the configuration A that you have choose at the first time. What happened with the conjecture? Just try to understand for n equals 2 for the keeper problem. Yes, what is happening? For the n2, the hyperbolic motions are hyperbolas. And the hyperbolas have Perbolas have the limit shape, it is a direction in the plane, and this direction only you can have any pair except the opposite one and the same one, because any pair cannot have a opposite direction or the same direction. In fact, this is this is when you okay for hyperbola, you can have a limit shapes which. You can have a limit shapes which is close to A, very close to A plus to M1, but not the same. The same will be the limit of this and it will be with the collision ejection. And in the other side, you cannot have also the opposite. If you want to have A minus equal minus A plus, this will be the limit. Limit when the gravitation disappears, but so in the Kepler problem, the answer is you have hyperbolic motion with prescribed limit shape in the past and future, but not for a dense, an open and dense set of pairs. But for three bodies in the plane, it's open. That is the answer. Yes, for any yes. You cannot make a conjecture if it is not true in the Kepler case. Ask if there is some other question. Yes, if there is any other question. So, thank you.
