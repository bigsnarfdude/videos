Thank you organisers for being patient to come to growth again. And also just a very good chance to meet all the friends and meet you, friend. Enjoy you very much listening to all the other talks. So today I'll report something recent. These are recently these are high This recently, this high-dimension case. In order to compare, I will also recall very quickly the local diffusion case, where diffusion is represented by the Laplacian. And also the local diffusion case with the free boundary. And then I'll explain the non-local case, why the non-local. The non-local case, one of the non-local diffusion cases, and then non-local diffusion with the free boundary, but in one space dimension. And finally, I'll come to the new part, n dimension, but with a reduced summation. And I have a recent survey paper appeared in this journal, and that covers most of the material here. And that paper was recommended by Neil Tuning, who asked the bay, to take this opportunity to advertise this relatively new journal. That's a journal you publish and you get rewarded with some money. Instead of paying for them, they pay for you. They pay you for you. Anyway, so I'll just start with this old story, the Fisher-Kevitive story. Basically, they start to use Ragschen diffusion equations to describe propagation phenomena. And here we are concerned with positive solutions because we want to use U to represent the population density. As I mentioned before, so here is local diffusion. We use the Laplacian operator. And then the story, the main story is about the spreading speed. And the story, I think, this idea of a paper by Aronson and Weinberg, appeared in 78, give quite a good description. That is, so if you have That is, so if you have a you have a non-zero but a non-negative initial population compactly supported. And then with this typical feature KPP nonlinearity, it can be more general, but throughout this talk, I'll just use this special one. And then the possibility. And then the population goes to the current capacity one inside of this growing ball whose radius grows linearly is roughly six dot times t. And outside of this ball, the population density is close to zero when t goes to infinity. And here for accurateness, we need to introduce an arbitrarily small epsilon. And this result indicates And this result indicates that the population spreads to new territory with the speed of C-star. But how to calculate this C-star? Well, that's not from these earlier days, from Fischer and the Katy P. C-star, that particular form of F, is given by 2 square root D, D is the diffusion coefficient. And this is obtained by looking for travel waiver solutions, and then you can show. and then you can show for C greater than or equal to the C star you have such a terminal wave solution and for C less than C star you don't. And it turns out that this minimal speed is the spreading speed. Now of course very often we not only are interested in the spreading speed, we also want to know what's the spreading from the population range. So because we are still in So, because we are still in the pandemic, of course, we give this population range, if the population of the virus, we are very sensitive about this population range. Ways of the frog, where is the boundary. However, this classical model is not very suitable to answer these questions. In fact, if you look at the place where the The place where the population is positive. Once t is positive, though initially the population is compactly supported. And then when t is greater than zero, we get t is our n for any t. But of course we usually use this ramification and we normally support delta to say u greater than delta gives you the population range. And I think everything becomes natural. Becomes natural. And then, so this boundary is contained in the spherical shell whose boundary, whose radius is roughly six-star on its t. And that's why we say the spreading has been six-star. And of course, nowadays we have a much more accurate description than Ariston Weinberger for the solution. And in the radio case, we And in the radio case, we know it converts exactly to this minimal speed wave profile if we add this shift chip. And that's the radial case. But for non-radial case, you can still use the comparison principle to get something like that. And nowadays we know much better approximation, but I want to talk more about that. So now I just say I want to recall a model I was involved in in the last 10 years or so. And in high space dimension, that's the extension of the class. Extension of the classical feature KPP model. And here, to better represent the population range, we just say this reaction diffusion equation is set to farm just over the population range. And the boundary of the population density is zero, and then we add another condition to govern the evolution of the boundary. And then that's And I think that's the initial condition. And here, so the only difference from the classical model is that now this population rate is specified. The price we pay would make the problem a very boundary problem. So more difficult to handle mathematically. And in the case f is identically zero, actually this will reduce to this well-known one-facet stepping problem and many famous people And many famous people are working on that. And here I'll just mention very briefly the meaning of these added free boundary conditions, these stebantop conditions, really says that the boundary moves in the direction of out toward the normal. Outward normal of the boundary, and with this velocity proportional to the spatial gradient of the density function. And in a rigid symmetric case, we can write it in more simple forms. And also, we could deduce this free boundary condition under certain reasonable biological assumptions. Biological assumptions. So we did that in this paper. And then the meaning would be the mu, the parameter there. The parameter here means d over k. k is in the assumption we assume some k units of the species are lost near the boundary in order to expand their population range. And also in this generality, we have to talk about a weaker solution. We have to talk about weaker solutions. In joint work with the Zonian Buer, we prove that we ought to have a weaker solution. I won't explain how it is defined, it's involved. But anyway, we could show the problem usually opposed. In the weak sense, we have a unique solution defined for all T pods. And in this joint work with Professor Martino. With Professor Martando and Colleen Wong, a young mathematician who you see in China, very, very prominent. By the way, he had many nice joint works with Jin Cheng here. So we proved that this omega t, the population range is band with time over time, and also its boundary is smooth outside. Is smooth outside of the convex half of the initial population range. Moreover, because these expand all the target, we can talk about a limit of this set. And this limit, when t goes to infinity of this expanding set, we denote it by omega infinity. And then we have this dichotomy. Either it's a bounded set, or it is the entire Rn. It cannot grow into It kind of grew into an arbitrary unbounded set. If it's unbounded, there has to be Rm. Moreover, in this case A, we can come back to the population density. We say it converts to zero uniform. In case B, we can come back to the population density to show its limit is one. Moreover, in this case, we can come back to see more about the We can come back to see more about the smoothness of the Fourier boundary. We can show that for large T, omega-T becomes a smooth, closed harper surface contained in this spherical shell of a fawned thickness. And this fauna thickness is determined by the initial population range of theorem. Moreover, these kind of, if we call this the radius, it converts to infinity. Radius, it converts to infinity with a kind of a constant speed. We use the C0 stop. It's a new constant different from the classical spreading speed in the Fischer K model. And this one can be determined again by looking at tremendous wave solutions, and then you reduce to this ODE problem, and you joint work with. Problem. And he joined work with Ben Dong Lowe, who gave a talk here yesterday. And we proved that, among other things, for any parameter new positive, and this problem 4 is a unique solution here. So it's not a minimal speed. It's a unique speed. The speed is the same. We denote by C0 star. The profile is Q C 0 star. And we call this a semi-wave. And we call this a semi-wave with spin C0 star. But I have to mention that actually, so in my case, I started to look at these first boundary problems in dimension one in the joint work with Chi Yilin from Yangzhou University in China. And also, it was this, what we call spread evaluation dichotomy, was first discovered there. And it was difficult. And these it was difficult to extend it to high dimensions without a reading symmetry. So this earlier result result this result was later. And here there's a numerical simulation of the case where our omega theory is not a convex, it's like a bit. So there's a column, there's a hole. There's a card, there's a hole. And when T increases, and you can see inside of the convex hull, we do have singularities developing. And we have these cosmos and the hole. And then we don't have a cosmic, but we still have a hole. And then the hole disappears. So for a large time, the free boundary becomes a smooth, closed puppet surface. And in the case, it goes. And in the case it goes to omega t goes to Rn and this becomes round and round and contained in a spherical shell. And this is the old traveling wave profile Q, and this is the new sending wave profile little Q and Smith C0 start here, the old one, C0. And we could also try to get a more accurate approximation of the solution through the semi-wheel profile. And here we look at the radio case and then we can show this convert to the semi-wheel profile in that way and this RT has a C, low T C. And this C1 star is something new, but it does not depend on the New, but it does not depend on the dimension. But this limit C depends on the initial function. All these C0 star, C1 star, it doesn't depend on the dimension, nor the initial function. And of course, if we know this sharp estimate, in the real case, we can use comparison to get a reasonably sharp estimate for the third boundary. Verde boundary, the location of the vertical boundary in the non-radial case. And another result is contained in the joint work with Zhang Yang Guo from Hannah Nova University that tells us the relationship between the free boundary and the traditional fisher-catypic model one. So when μ goes to infinity, μ appears in the free boundary condition and actually Boundary condition. And actually, the free boundary problem has the classical problem as it's a limiting problem. So the solution of the free boundary problem converts to the solution of the classical problem if you have the same initial function. For the severity speed, C0 stop, that's not the same. It converts increase to, well, here I should call it the C0. Well, here I should call it the C star for the classical fisher-cat case. So therefore, for fixed mu, C0 star is always less than C star. And at least for both classical problem 1 and problem 3, there are many further results. For example, for treating more general nonlinearity, for treating systems of equations. Treating systems of equations and all various heterogeneous environments. The function f is not a function u, only it can be a function depending on t, time, or on space. But today I just want to uh concentrate on the exchange where we replace this local diffusion operator by a non local diffusion operator. A non-local diffusion operator. And this, as we know, this direction has received a lot of attention in recent years. And the non-local diffusion operator we look at is this kind. And then for classical problem, so you replace this Laplace and U by this blue part, this non-local diffusion. This non-local diffusion or itself. And so, very often, people make these assumptions, but it's not necessary. This makes the theory a bit easier to establish. And we will all assume this all the time. And then, for the classical case, and as we know, the thin-tailed condition becomes important. If it's a thin-tailed, Important. If it's a fee entailed for the feature-capital case, many of the features for the local diffusion case retains for the non-local diffusion case. So if the kernel is thin tail. But if the kernel function is not a thin tail, we call it a fat tail, and new things happen. So if it's a fat tail, for example, from this earlier For example, from this earlier work of Weinberg, so we know for problem six, if you have an initial function which is compact and is supported, then again you have when t goes to infinity, the solution converts to one. I'll assume the K to P nonlinear average. And then again you have to use this convention to define the population range. And then in dimension one And then in dimension one, you can use the smallest interval to contain these sets. And then the front goes to infinity with the finest speed, some say lower star, if j the kernel function is a thin tail. Otherwise, it's infinity. And this case is also called accelerated spreading. And moreover, Ghana Ghania for this kind of kernel functions has got estimates on how fast the front goes to infinity. So like for these ones it's exponential, for these ones it's power-like with a better group than one. And there are also results for fractional appliances, but because of time I think I'll just escape it. And then I'll come to the 1D case. So, for the 1D free boundary problem, we change the Laplacian by this one, and then that's the population range. And for the free boundary condition, because of the change here, following the same kind of biological assumption, the free boundary becomes these ones. And then, so these are assumptions. And then, so these are assumptions for the initial function, quite natural, and that's what we assume for the kernel function. And so I'll skip these ones. I'll skip this one as well. So here, basically, we have existence and uniqueness. This is from this paper here. And we also have spread and vanish in dichotomy. This is a parallel to the local diffusion case. And then for the spread and vanishing criteria, there are some differences from the local diffusion case. The main difference is this one. In the local diffusion case, you don't have these caves. For any D, you always have something similar like that. So that's the first difference. Now the main difference arises when we look at the spreading signals. When we look at the sprint speed, so this is from John working with the family and Maulin told me yesterday. We found that for the free boundary conditions, J1 is crucial. And so if spreading happens, then if J1 is a centrifugal, we have a finite spreading speed. If it's not, then we have infinite spreading speed. So accelerate spreading heaven. And to determine C0, again we look for traveling wave type solutions. We end up with this problem, and then we can show if J1 is satisfied, this problem gives us a unique pair. And if this is C0 because of the sparing spin in the previous field, and if this is not satisfied, this problem has no solution at all. Now how fast is the spreading? Fast is the spreading, and then you join to work with Wenji Ni, who is my postdoc. We look at this case, if J behaves like x to the 1 alpha near infinity, and then what kind of a sharp estimate can we get? And then of course, for the basic assumption to be set forward, alpha has to be greater than 1. has to be greater than 1. For J1 to be satisfied, alpha needs to be greater than 2. So alpha greater than 3, so J1 satisfied we have C0, it's ready to speak. Then we can check the shift. So the shift is bounded. If alpha equals 1, the shift is no longer bounded, that's along the T order. If this is between 3 and 2, the shift is unbound and it's this order. For alpha between between 1 and 2 including 2, so J1 is not set forward, then we have infinity spreading speed, then this is accelerated spreading, then we have this estimate. So alpha equals 2, alpha between 2 and 1. So that's for last basic dimension. I'll skip this one because of time. It's just a try to compare the differences. Now, in high dimension, so the natural extension with the radio symmetry of this one-dimensional case is this one. And then we assume this basic assumption for the kernel function hard dimension. It's a really use metric. And then if we want to write this problem in a form similar to this. In a form similar to dimension one, we have to use this original curl to define this J tilde. And then we have this one. And this looks similar to the one-dimensional case. And then we have parallel theorem with existence, uniqueness, spreading management, dichotomy, and a criteria. Spreading management, dichotomy, and the criteria. These are all parallel to the one-dimensional case. And then we look for spreading speed. It turns out this is a bit difficult because we have to introduce a new function j star through the original function. And this one will determine when we have a finite spreading speed, when we have infinite spreading speed. And this one and the original gender. And the original J relationship is like that. And this equals this. That's important because we need to know when J star satisfies J1. Now we know it satisfies J1 if this integral is followed. And then the spreading speed is C0 if J stars as far as J1, infinity, if not. And if C0 is also. And if the C0 is obtained from theorem 1 with the one dimensional J replaced by J star. J star is one dimension. And for reason for spreading, we check again this case and we have this result. Now this result is a bit weaker and we could suspect we always have that and we can only prove that with n equals 3 because the other cases we could Cases, we couldn't have it more common. Compared with the dimension one, the big difference is this case. So, in dimension one, with beta greater than three, that's corresponding to beta greater than n plus two. In dimension one, this shift is bounded. But in high dimension, this is a lower T gap all the time. So that's the main difference. So that's the main difference. And as a rating C equals A equals 3 is easy actually because we have to involve this J T order. You can see when A equals 3 and even here, these complicated terms become 1. So that's why we can handle this case at the moment, but not at the others. I'll still be. Thank you. Are there any questions? Are there any question? Yeah, for the number, why you don't take the classical fractional J? We support to do that. That fractional one has a singular kernel and it's not integrable. We are trying to do that. But there are more extra difficulties for you. So if you think about the non-radial case, you get comparison. That's something we are still working on. For the non-radial case, how to propose this question. Because of these uh for the boundary condition and condition and it is easily in the one-dimensional case and in the high-dimensional radio case. But we look back at the biological assumption, it's not so clear how to propose it in the non-reader case. But that's the, like the fractional Laplacian case, that's another important direction we want to move to. Because the free boundary condition is quite evolving and all of the comes from conservation of mass. We just hadn't figured out what's the correct extension to the non-reveal case. Very closely creation clause. Oh, that's the same question. Okay. Other question?
