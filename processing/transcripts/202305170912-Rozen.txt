What can mutational signatures tell us about what causes mutations, in particular what causes mutations in cancer? It's beeping, but okay, gotta go okay, down. Okay, so let's just talk about the concept of a mutational signature briefly. So we examine mutation patterns in the tumor or other tissue to infer mutational exposures or processes that led to the mutation. Led to the mutation. So, again, our focus is what causes the mutations, not what the mutations do to the cell. There can be different types of mutation patterns. There can be single base mutations in the context of preceding and following bases. There can be different kinds of short insertions or deletions, patterns of clustered single-base mutations. We can use information about whether the transcribed versus the non-transcribed strands of genes have more mutations. Strands of genes have more mutations and so on. So, mostly for today, for simplicity, we're just going to talk about single-base mutations in the context of preceding and following bases and a few different kinds of short insertions and deletions. So, in a larger context, we can discover mutational signatures by analyzing large databases or by experimental delineation in cell culture or in mice, for example. And we can use them then downstream. them then downstream that we can use them for molecular cancer epidemiology. We can try to figure out which mutational processings are causing optogenic mutations. And we can use them to understand DNA damage and repair. And so today I'll mostly be talking about analysis of large databases and then some of the downstream applications for you. So I'll talk about three stories. One is an example mutational signature that's very easy to grasp conceptually. To grasp conceptually, that's the example of AA, which stands for aristoclic acid, and especially its role in liver cancer. I'll talk about the techniques we use for mining mutational signatures from somatic mutations in 23,000 tumors. This was the PCOG study. And I'll talk about discovery of the cause of an insertion and deletion, hypermutative phenotype in human cancer. So, on to the first one: why is AA? Why is AA important? So, AA emerged in the 1990s as a human health problem when about 100 young women developed end-stage kidney disease. And this was identifiable because they were attending a single weight loss clinic. This was in Europe, in Belgium. And it turns out that this weight loss clinic was using herbal medicine, and they had replaced one kind of fungi with a different kind of fungi. With a different kind of fungi, and the first kind of fungi, this one, doesn't have any AA, and this one has a lot of AA. And so this is the one with no AA, and it's a slice of a root that's then been dried. And this is the one with AA, also the slice of a root that's been dried. And unless you're going to do DNA barcoding, it's practically impossible to tell these two things apart. And basically, they're often just sold simply as fontes. Simply as Fonti. Okay, so many, so AA was identified as a carcinogen when many of the AA kidney failure victims went on to develop upper tract urethelial cancer. So that's cancer in the lining of the ureter and the lining of the renal pelvis, so the tube that drains the kidney down into the bladder. So these cancers are relatively uncommon. So it actually also very much stood out as an unusual event. As an unusual event. So, this is the mutational signature of an AA-exposed upper tract urethelial carcinoma from Taiwan. So, in this picture, each bar represents the total number of single nucleotide mutations in a particular context of preceding and following bases. So, the highest bar here represents the number of CAG to CTG mutations across the entire CT mutations across the entire genome. Obviously, the higher the bar, the more CAG to CTG mutations. And this is across the entire genome, not in any particular gene. You want to look at all the mutations. So next door, we have AAG to ATG mutations. There are not so many of those. And then there are hardly any mutations from C to A, C to G, or C to T. So in 2013, we had seen A mutation. We had seen A mutational signature in upper tracheothelial cancer and in AA exposed celluloses. And we published this back-to-back with another group from Johns Hopkins and Science Translational Medicine. By 2016, we had at least anecdotally seen PA mutational signature in liver, bile duct, kidney, and bladder, as well as upper tract urothelial cancer. But no one had studied AA. AA in kid, sorry, in liver cancer in any depth. And so, for reasons that I won't go into, Taiwan was a known hotspot for AA kidney failure and AA upper tractureothelial cancer. So, we thought it would be a good place to investigate AA and liver cancer. We did that. We sequenced 98 exomes, and we found that 78% of those liver cancers have been exposed to AA as determined. Have been exposed to AA as determined by its signature. So here are these red bars represent the number of mutations ascribed to AA. The other colors represent mutations ascribed to other mutational processes. This is exome data. So this is a really heavily mutagenized, these are really heavily mutagenized cancers. Very, very strongly mutagenized cancers. So again, the red bar shows the numbers of mutation caused by AA. Numbers and mutation caused by AA. Today, with 2,000 liver cancers for various projects, we know that AA exposure is prevalent. Taiwan remains an outlier in terms of the prevalence of exposure. And I'll show you in a minute, it's an outlier also in the numbers of mutations due to AA. About half of the HCCs in the mainland, China, have AA, Southeast Asia, multiple countries have A.A. Southeast Asia, multiple countries have AA exposure, and Korea has AA exposure. Japan, very little, and then North America, very little. Europe, very little. This is the Mayo Clinic. We suspect that these may have been patients who went from overseas to the Mayo Clinic for treatment because they're all listed as Asian and there's no country information associated with them. So this is so many of the AA exposed. So, many of the AA exposed liver cancers have multiple known cancer driver genes with AA mutations. So, this is the Taiwan data, or this is the data from my 2017 paper. So, again, you see that this is the number of AA mutations ascribed to AA in known driver genes per tumor. So, the median in Taiwan is two. Mainland China, the median is practically zero. Other countries have sort of intermediate levels of exposure. So, it remains quite a mystery why the exposure is. It's quite a mystery why the exposure is so high in Taiwan. Okay, so I'm pretty sure that AA can cause liver cancer. The evidence for this is the fact that it's an AA, AA is a known mutagen and urinary tract carcinogen. Multiple known cancer drivers have AA mutations in HCCs. Some studies in Taiwan where they can look at actually health reimbursement for herbal medicine treatment. Verbal medicine treatment, so they can find that there's a linear relationship between AA dose and risk of liver cancer in hepatitis B and in hepatitis C infected patients. So the hepatitis infection could be an important compound because people might go to a TCM, to a herbal medicine clinic if they have liver problems. So it's better to just look within the infected population. So A causes liver cancer in mice. This is from a lab in Shanghai, Jiao Tong University. And Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Okay, so pretty sure that AA causes liver cancer. My suspicion is that it's in synergy with hepatitis. So if you have hepatitis and exposed to AA, it's much worse than if you don't have hepatitis. Paul? Yeah. Do you know anything about the clonality of AA associated mutations? Do they tend to happen early or preferentially late or pretty much uniform across the the history? Across the history? So, of course, we did most of this work early. We did, so I'd have to go back and look at my notes actually. We did see cases where people were obviously continually exposed as the cancer developed. So, we did certainly see, but I don't know if that's an anecdote or whether that's a common phenomenon. Phenomenon. I wouldn't be surprised if people were continually exposed during the cancer development. Yeah. So, you know, so going back to Aaron's comment about the reviewer comment, so sometimes you say, oh, it's not a problem because it's banned, right? But then here's, but here's what you could buy on the web as of July 2021 on Taobao. And so it's actually. And so it's actually kind of ironic because the Chinese name for arisalopic acid is Madolingsuan. And so this is just, this is just being able to buy Mado Ling. This is the fruit of the herb, the dried fruit of the herb. And these are various parts of the root. And this is to grow the plant as an ornamental plant in your garden, I think. So, okay, it's not just an Asian problem. It's used as in herbal medicine and romantic. It's used as an herbal medicine in Romania. So, this one combats cancers and ulcers, it prevents hair loss, and it helps cure hemorrhoids. This is Romania. This is a tea from Brazil. And this is the same fruit, maybe it's too small to see, but it's a green fruit before it's been dried, and it's used in India in Ayurvedic medicine. So, almost every culture has used plants from this genus, probably because it does something obvious when you take it, right? Something obvious when you take it, right? It probably acts as a diuretic. And so it's used in almost every culture. It was used in European herbal medicine, also. It's even in ancient Greek texts on herbal medicine. Yeah? Any questions? In terms of exposure, how much exposure counts as exposure? Well, we don't know. I mean, so one problem is we don't know how, right, so we just don't know. And we don't know how much it synergizes with hepatitis. How much it synergizes with hepatitis, right? So, I mean, we know that aflatoxin, for example, another liver carcinogen synergizes with hepatitis strongly. And we know that lots of mouse models of liver cancer require some kind of liver damage before the mice actually develop cancer. So that's one of the issues. And the other issue is we just don't know how much people are being exposed to because the amount of these chemicals in each plant, even the same part of the same Even the same part of the same species varies quite a lot from specimen to specimen. So it's just very hard to know. And that really ties back to the mystery of Taiwan, which is we have no idea why the exposure is so prevalent and so intense in Taiwan. So we really just don't know. And it's hard to get funded. It collides with all these kinds of cultural sensitivities. We've been using it for 5,000 years. How can it be bad? Right. Okay. So any more questions on eristochic acid? So it's a good example of using signatures for molecular epidemiology of cancer. Okay, so then I'm going to switch gears and talk about techniques for mining signatures from somatic mutations and lots of tumors. So just to change the vocabulary a little bit, I talked about what we just saw as the AA mutation signature. AA mutational signature. Actually, other mutational processes were going on in those tumors, but they were so low relative to AA that you basically couldn't notice them in the figure. But in general, what we call a mutational spectrum is the observed counts of mutations due to all mutational processes operating in that tumor. So here we have a BRCA deficient breast cancer, and we have multiple signatures. And we have multiple signatures operating. So we have SPS1, which is 5-methylocytosine deamination. We have SBS2 and SPS3, which are both caused by activated APOVEX. And SPS3 then is the single-base substitution signature of hemolygis recombination, repair deficiency, BRCA deficiency. And then SPS5 is another signature that's going on all the time in all of our cells. So the actual spectrum of this breast cancer is a linear constant. Cancer is a linear combination of these one, two, three, four, five signatures. So here's the reconstructed spectrum, and here's the actual spectrum. So basically our job in discovering mutation signatures in lots of tumors is to try to find these signatures which we can think of as latent variables using a different vocabulary, right? And the typical approach here that almost everybody uses is non-negative. Is non-negative matrix factorization. So we have, in this case, 23,000 tumors. Each column is a tumor. We have 96 mutational types. So as it turns out, there are 96 columns in this figure. And our idea here is to express this matrix of observed mutational spectra as a product of some number. A product of some number of signatures and exposures or coefficients for each of those signatures. Right, so that's the idea. So here, in this matrix here, each cell contains a level of exposure of one tumor to one signature. So that's the idea of how we are going to deconvolve all these. All these 23,000 spectra into, and we're going to discover the signatures that could have explained those 23,000 spectra. So we used NMF, Gutenberg Alexandroff, Mike Stratton, Jay Gilkim, other people we combined 23,000 tumors for this reference paper. It actually turned out that it was actually useful as a reference paper. So it turns out that when you run NMF on different So it turns out that when you run NMF on different subsets of data, you get slightly different answers. So it's actually quite useful to have some kind of reference signatures. And this paper then provided that set of references. This is the insertion and deletion mutational signatures that we've got in that paper. So here we have one base pair in deletions of the cytosine orthymine, one base pair is I mean one-base pair of insertions in homopolymers in different lengths. So, including a single insertion or an insertion into a longer homopolymer or so forth. These are deletions in microsatellites. These are insertions in microsatellites. And these are deletions with microhomology. And I'll talk about that very briefly later. So, again, the most common approach to mutational signature discovery uses non-negative negative. Discovery uses non-negative matrix factorization. There are multiple approaches that use this. There's lots of fine points. We worked on an orthogonal approach discovering mutational signatures by data mining, and this uses something called hierarchical de Richelay processes. Turns out that this discovers signatures similar to those discovered by non-negative factorization methods, which provides some evidence of the reality of these signatures. It's not the only evidence of the reality of the signatures. The only evidence of the reality of the signatures. And this was an extension of work by somebody called E.Y.K., who's now a statistician at Oxford and then a graduate student at Cambridge, Nicola Roberts. So basically, as Roma and I talked about yesterday, it turns out that mutational signature discovery, like other things, is orthogonal to Sorry, where am I here? It's orthomorphic to probabilistic topic modeling and document classification. So, exactly the example that Rob Mai gave yesterday. So, a document would correspond to a tumor, i.e. the set of mutations, observed a tumor, or the document is just a set of words and accounts of each type of word. A word corresponds to a mutation type. So, like, genome would correspond to something like ACG to H. Like ACG to AGT. And then a topic of the document corresponds to a mutational process in the tumor. So if you're talking about forest fires in Canada, then you have words like smog and smoke and healthy, and then a mutational process with generate different types of mutations, like the CG, the TG mutations due to 5-methylcytis and deamination. And what happens is. And what happens is that there's a generative model. So, topics i.e. mutational processes generate word or mutation instances by draws from a multinomial distribution, and that multinomial distribution is the mutational signature or the fingerprint of the topic. So, this is a pretty, I'm not going to go into a lot of detail, but this is a sketch of a hierarchical. This is a sketch of a hierarchical Dirichlet process, and I'll talk about it and then I'll briefly talk about how that relates to late Dirichlet allocation. So here, each dot in these circles and in this square represents a mutational process and that shading, dark versus light, indicates the frequency of that topic or proportion of that topic. Okay, and I'll try to go through this in English. And I'll try to go through this in English. Okay, so the idea: we have a generative mod here. So a mutation arrives at the tumor. We're going to generate a mutation at the tumor. And you have to decide what mutational process generated that mutation. And you select the mutational process from the Dirichlet process here. So usually the mutational process is Usually, the mutational process is already here in the tumor, but because this is the Dirichlet process, sometimes it's not present, and you have to go to the base distribution of the Dirichlet process. So you go to the parent. So if not already in the tumor, then we have to select the mutational process from the parent Dirichlet process here. Okay, so again, hierarchically, the mutational process is probably already known here, but occasionally you need a new But occasionally you need a new one, and you draw that from a base distribution here, which in practice, just to make things confusing, is a Dirichlet distribution, not a Dirichlet process, but a Dirichlet distribution. All right, so it's very complicated to talk about because it's multiple multi-domino distributions and multiple Dirichlet processes and Dirichlet distributions. But anyway, okay, so I want to show something here. Oh yeah, okay. And then I should okay. Okay, here. So Steve, I mean you should use the hierarchical PRC process prior when you believe that there's some shared some shared distribution over the, in this case, the signature activities. Are you sharing the distribution over tumor types? So all the breast cancer distributions? We can do both. So, I mean, there's another, there's a historical process. This hierarchical process, this hierarchical theorem process can be extended to multiple levels, in fact. Right. But I'm going to show that here for simplicity. Yeah, and then so what is it that you are, what levels are you modeling? This is just showing all cancers. So in this case, all cancers share the same hierarchy, whatever type it is. Breast cancers and bladder cancers and prostate cancers all have the same, which could share the same hierarchy. So you're learning a prior or learning. So you're learning a prior the distributions of the signature exposures? Signature, no, mostly we're interested in the signature shapes. Oh, the signature. We want to learn the multinomial distributions that correspond to the mutational processes. So our goal is to discover the multinomial distributions. So you're allowing the mutational signatures to change from tumor to tumor? No, we share them, right? So each of these is a process that has a... Let me just Have this. Let me just finish. I skipped the slide badly. So basically, once you've decided on your process, the process is associated with a multinomial distribution. And then you actually select from that multinomial distribution what mutation you're going to get. And our goal is to find out the shapes of the frequencies of different types of mutations. So, as I see, I can talk about this better next time. Well, I mean, it's just a topic model. Yes. It's just a topic model. Yes. Unless, for some reason, you want to use it to choose your number of signatures. We do both, actually. But the benefits hierarchical because you're sharing something. And what you're sharing is the activity prior, probably. And UI stuff, I think that they showed the activity prior. The activity prior, I don't think so. I think we're sharing the shapes. We want to share. All the mutational processes are shared across all the leaves. Right, so the signatures are all the same. Yes, that is. The multinomic distributions are all the same. And they're shared across all the leaves. Right. Yeah. And what we want to discover is we want to discover these things, which are the multinomial distributions of the signature. We take a signature processes. That's what we're trying to discover. Right. You can do that with topic home. Sorry? You can do that with a topic call. That's right. You can have the topic all. That's right. So, this would be the frequencies. This would correspond to the frequencies of different words. Right. Right? So, if it's about forest fires, a lot of words about smog. Yeah, yeah, I mean, they're multinomial distributions over your types. That's right. Yeah, that's right. Precisely. They're multinomial distributions over mutation types. And those distributions are shared across all the tumors. Yeah. Yeah, like an NMF or like in your Calvary model. That's right. But you make it hierarchical because there's something else you want to start saying. There's something else you want to start saying. I guess it's labeling. So they get to that because, remember, it's a genitive model. The mutation arrives, and occasionally you don't find, you have to go to another signature for that tumor. But sometimes you get stuck, right? Because it's a dirichlay process. And sometimes you actually have to go to the base distribution and invent the whole new mutational process. Okay. And so basically, this method can estimate the number of mutational processes. Can it estimate the number of radical processes? Right. Okay. Oh, you're using it for model size. Yes. And LDA does not estimate the number, directly estimates the number of processes. And so the thing that governs how many processes you're actually going to get is your concentration parameter of the Dirichlet process. So if it's very liberal, you get too many signatures, and that's a problem. And if it's very stringent, you don't get enough signatures, and that's a problem. So it partly solves the problem. So it hardly solves the problem of having to decide on the number of signatures, which the NMF people do by putting NMF on multiple pens, right? They try every possible number of signatures from 5 to 40. In this case, the model estimates that directly, but it's contingent upon the prior for the concentration parameter. Okay, so anyway, so our goal then is to determine these what I call partial spectra, which are the numbers of mutations of different types that have occurred in each tumor. And then the spectrum of these tumors would be the sums of these partial spectra. Okay, so then we used this little KUI. KEY used the Bayesian formulation with good sampling to estimate posterior probabilities of the number of mutational processes and then to estimate the partial spectra which mimic the shape of their signatures, i.e. the associated multinomial distribution. So somehow in this very simplified diagram, we have posterior chains and we have given samples. Each of these different colors represents a different partial spectra due to Partial spectra due to a single process, and we have to cluster them together, and then we then just sum up the mutation counts and the partial spectra, and then make that turn that into the multinomial distribution we're looking for. But it's a bit tricky because I don't know how we're getting a point estimate out of the posterior, right? We're getting a point estimate of where the shape is and what the activity is. Actually, the activity estimates aren't very good from this model. Good from this model. The shape estimates are good. Okay, so I just what I said. So this is some benchmarking. This was our approach. This is a approach. This was the top NMF approach, showing positive predictive value and true positive rate. It turns out that It turns out that we obviously tuned our prior for the concentration parameter for this and also because the generative model, if you think about it, it's not very satisfying. So the more mutations you have, you're going to get to get more signatures because every time you have a mutation, there's some chance that you're going to have to generate a new signature, right? So that's not very satisfying. So we actually, intellectually, but we actually then downsample highly mutated tumors to avoid that. Mutated tools to avoid that problem. Also, for computational efficiency. So, what are you measuring here, like the spectrum of the mutational signature? I'm measuring just what it was detected. So, we just match up some of the synthetic data with noise, and we say, did we detect signature X in this sample? And did we detect a signature that doesn't exist in this synthetic sample? So, a false positive is we found a signature that doesn't. Is we found a signature that doesn't exist, and a false negative is we didn't find a signature that exists. Okay, but then you're using the model, you generate a lot of samples from the posterior, and you're somehow deriving a point estimate. Yes, correct. And then you're just plugging that into a topic model. Or how are you getting the activities in that case? Because you have to get the activities in order to estimate if the signature is there or not, right? We're not estimating it. We actually felt this this this benchmarking, we're just focused on shapes. We're just focused on shapes. The multinomial distributions that the processes generate. We don't care. In this case, we don't care about the activities. For this. Activities are actually hard. Whether it's present or not, we care about, right? But the focus has pretty much been on, so going back to the NMF, going back to the NMF formulation. Formulation. Going back to the NMF formulation, we're mostly people have been focusing on this. So that's this, right? Basically. So those are the multinomial distributions corresponding to different mutational processes. So true or false positive based on those distributions? We're saying, in our set of experiments, Well in our in our setup, I appreciate the question. So we have synthetic data where we know the mutational signatures in each synthetic tumor, and then we have some resampling noise. And then we say, okay, we're going to run across all these synthetic, say it's 1,000 synthetic tumors, and we're going to say which signatures, which multinomial distributions did we discover? Okay. Okay? And so this really will help the next few. This is really this really will help the next presentation on this. So we say, did we discover this one? Yes, okay. And we say, what I mean by that, I mean, did we discover a highly similar distribution? Okay. And or did we discover, and so maybe this one wasn't in that, that we discovered something like this, but it's not actually in the synthetic data. That's a false positive. Or maybe we didn't discover this one, and that's a false negative. So is it whether you discover it? So, is it whether you discover it in the code, in the sort of thousand tumors or yes the individuals? In the thousand tumors. So, the other issue is, which I didn't, I'm not going to go into, it's hard actually, is, so we did it a little bit for the AA and HCC, but there's a couple other questions like, given a specific tumor and known signatures, i.e., known multinomal probabilities of different mutation types, what, how do we best reconstruct? Best reconstruct the spectrum of that tumor. That's actually really hard because there's a lot of ways that you can do it plausibly in most cases. And then there's a slightly related question, which is, given a spectrum, just give me a statistical estimate of whether or not you think a given signature is present in there or not. Those are slightly related, but they're different questions. They're actually harder than discovery for the reasons I just described. Yeah. I think I have about uh well, okay. So we have about um seven more minutes here. Um so thanks very much for the questions because they really will help the next time I have to present this. I haven't presented this very much on the technical level because usually for a general audience I'm afraid to present too much detail, but okay. So Okay, so wait, okay, so neither approach is perfect. Please assess results in the light of all available evidence. And also think about what question you're trying to answer. Don't just run the stuff through an algorithm and then say what the algorithm produced. In practice, it's often best to use both approaches. Our code's on GitHub and has a singularity container, and the code is called msyghtp, so you can just Google msyg HTP. Will actually guarantee. So I think, okay, so are there any more questions on this point? I think if there are no more on this, I'll go on. Did you try putting a hierarchical prior in? I mean, you could just use the DR shape process prior for your topic model to do what you're doing with that. The reason the hierarchical thing is exciting is because you have this problem mutation signature analysis that certain tumors only express sub-signatures. That's right. So, like, the way that you normally do. So like the way that you one normally does that is just set those, just only consider those signatures. That's right. And the hierarchical prior actually allows you to capture that and to model that. Have you tried using the hierarchical priority? No, it's another idea. I didn't really thought about that. I've been focusing on, I think you're talking about sort of the assessing activities, right? Yeah. Yeah. So that's again, so as I was just saying, it's quite hard. I never tried, we haven't tried it. Quite hard. I never tried. We haven't tried it. I have a student working on it, and we're actually having trouble with our synthetic data. It works really well on synthetic data because parts falling apart on real data. So I don't really know. So, I mean, the data are, yeah, so I haven't tried it. It's an interesting idea. Yeah. I'm wondering what have you learned in terms of accessitivity, cover their fossils. Terms of the sensitivity, you have the false narrative brains and things. So, what's the kind of sensitivity for detection for different signatures? Which one of our yeah, so that's a kind of complicated question because there's a couple of parameters that govern that, right? So one parameter that governs that is one parameter that governs that is the shape of the signature. So, for example, and how many similar signatures How many similar signatures there are in the universe of signatures that are present, right? So AA here is like a really easy case because almost no other signatures have like a mountain of gray, right? So AA is pretty easy, right? And that's why I was able to use it as an example where the spectrum is almost the same, plus the fact that it's high-emotic, right? But hard ones are: how do you want to separate SPS3 from SPS40 or discover? SPS 40 or discovered. And this is actually a continuing problem. If you rerun, sometimes you'll get 40, and sometimes you get 3, and sometimes you get a merge, right? So one parameter is what's the shape. Like angle back, we always can find that, right? So SPS2 and SPS13, they pop right out, right? Because they're very spiky. So that's one parameter. And the other parameter is how many mutations do we have, right? So it's resampling noise. So that this resampling noise and the number of mutations just due to calling errors is greater in exome data, for example. So if you have low numbers of mutations, if there's low numbers of real mutations, then errors will be a larger proportion of what you observe. So that's an issue. And then you just don't have as much information about what's there. And then the other thing is how many tumors have the signature that you are. That you are, if you want to have sensitivity to discover that sensitive, how many, how many, if every, if all the tumors have that, you can discover it. If only one tumor has it, you probably won't discover it. If we had that exact same problem with SDM3 and 40, we have very small circle size for kind of get the signature in charge to make sure that the stability or low stability are SDM3. So it's there and the right. Look at the indels. If you could can you indel column? Did you indel colon? Yeah, so if you look at the indel colon, it's very distinctive. The back of the fission are very distinctive. So I'm not going to go into my third topic because I need to wrap up in about a minute. I've got to show you just the indel signature. Okay, so here. So here, these are deletions with micro-hommology. These are deletions with micro-homology, and they're very characteristic of the BRCA deficiency model combination. And so, what that means by that, what I mean by that is, so that'd be something like, so you're deleting CTACA, but it's also flanked by a CTA. Or here you're deleting CTA, CA, G, G, but there's a C here and a C here, so that's the micro-homology. So that's very characteristic of the homologous recombination. Characteristic of the homologous and combination of the pair conditions. I'm happy to, yeah. So I think I'm actually about up on time. I was wondering, have you considered adding, because I guess particular signatures they're very hard to discriminate between could be that one is in sort of open chromatin and the other is in closed chromatin. Sort of use the genomic space that it occurs in as an additional variable. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah, I mean, yes, people do. The most common one is again transcribed versus non-transcribed strands of genes because vocatics will tend to get repaired if they're on the template, the transcribed strand. So you'll have fewer mutations on the... It's too hard to talk about, but if you basically you'll get transcription coupled, nucleotide decision repair on the strand is the template, and you won't drop the other strand. Drawing the other strand. And so you can detect that pretty easily. That's usually a single little bulky adduct causing the mutation. People look at not, I mean, so people have looked at early and late replication prominently. I don't can't think offhand of open versus closed particularly. Sorry? I mean quite similar to open source. Right, right, right, yeah. Right, right. A transcription, right? So, one of the problem for non-integration is identifiability. So, in your case, I just wonder whether or not the GIF sampling will be have a hard time to converge to have identifiability should. I observed that the GIF sampling is not that great, and that actually, if you have different starting points, they often do not actually sample. They often do not actually sample the same posterior. So we often start different chains from different random C's. We usually start different chains from different random C's and also sometimes initial states actually. So I'm not really an expert in this, but I observed that from a pragmatic point of view, it's best to start, do multiple chains, and also possibly do from different starting points. From different starting points. Which then, of course, presents the mutilation problems about how your different starting points might have skew your results. All right. Thank you.
