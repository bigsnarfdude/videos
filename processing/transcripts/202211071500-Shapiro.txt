So, welcome to the last session. I'll introduce myself. I think you all know me. I'm Jesse Shapiro from McGill in Montreal, Canada. I put my Twitter handle there as well. I think that by default, the CMO and Burrs will tweet links to the talks if you've agreed to be recorded. So, I don't know if people are tweeting stuff. I'm not saying to tweet my talk. Stuff you, I'm not saying to tweet my talk, but I guess speakers could also say if they don't want to be tweeted, but anyway, I don't think there's particular um secrecy at play here. Um, so just as a little aside there. Um, okay, so I'm going to talk about animal-associated sequences in SARS-CoV-2. Okay, is that that's going not so great? Okay, thanks. Excellent. Okay, great. Um, so I'll, I'm gonna start with a little pitch and and and and a And acknowledgement of data sharing. So, this first genome sequence was published on January 28th, 2020, received on January 7th. But this sequence was shared publicly on Twitter immediately as it was available. I'm not going to unmute myself, right? Okay, because I've got this. And was shared immediately. And as Sally said, immediately people started scanning this genome, even when there was only one, comparing it with other SARS one, and just crowdsourcing a bunch of analysis. So since then, so that first genome was done with shotgun metagenomics. People didn't know what it was. So it was just unbiased sequencing of everything to see what was in this patient from Wuhan. And this enabled the design of. And this enabled the design of primers to go in and amplify just SARS-CoV-2. And since then, we have millions, over 13 million, I guess, at last count, of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shared on websites like GSAID. And these are mostly from humans, but increasingly there's a trickle of sequences that were sampled from animals. There's some wastewater samples that I'm not going to talk about today, but this is just a But this is just a thank you and a pitch for all this data that is being shared. The first part of the talk is going to focus on consensus sequences. So we get short read sequencing, we can line them up to a reference and we call the consensus, which is kind of just the majority rule, but that doesn't necessarily exist within an individual. And if we get enough deep Illumina sequencing above an error threshold, we can actually look at variation that's happening. We can actually look at variation that's happening within an individual. I'll talk about that right at the right at the very end with some very fresh results that I was just putting together 15 minutes ago. So from this first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, we could compare it to SARS-CoV-1. So it has about 80% nucleotide identity. It has about 91% identity to a pangolin coronavirus, about 96% to a bat. 96% to a bat, right? So we think that the bat is probably the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 in sort of some not too distant evolutionary past. What's a little bit less clear are the very proximal events that brought us into the pandemic, which also very likely involved animals at the market in Wuhan. So, this is a cartoon that was in this cart. That was in this, I guess, in the preprint version of this paper by Warriaby at all that did environmental swab sampling in the market. I don't think this figure made it into the published version, but I like the figure, sort of a brief overview of recent history where we have most likely a bat reservoir. We probably have some intermediate hosts that made their way into the market. So these could be like raccoon dogs or other animals that found their way into the market. Probably two. Market, probably two distinct introduction events of two different lineages of SARS-CoV-2 into people in this market that led to local community spread and then international spread. And we all know what happened next. So animals are kind of at the base of this story. And I guess what I'm going to talk about today is this ugly depiction of human-to-animal transmission once we have. human to animal transmission once we have millions of humans infected they're infecting animals and then are those animals reinfecting humans again okay so fancy words for this that i learned i think most of you are familiar with zoonosis right so animal to human um i learned i think from angie rasmus and this is when you get to talk to different people and learn new things so zoanthroponosis is what people might also call spill backs or humans then back to animals um so starting to So SARS-CoV-2 is increasingly adapted to animals, as we saw in many of the talks this morning. But what about adaptation to other animal species? So why do we care? If the virus starts replicating in animals, this makes it hard to eradicate. Even if the unlikely event that we eradicate it in humans, it's still going to be passed around in animals. It also opens up new and unexpected evolutionary trajectories, whether that is selection for adaptation to a virus or whether For adaptation to a virus, or whether it's sort of drift where there's less constraint in that animal relative to what it would have in a human, but it can explore evolutionary space in different ways. So it's still on the table that Omicron could have evolved in some kind of rodent host. This is not mutually exclusive with a chronic human infection. But even if that wasn't the case, it's certainly on the table that this could be something that could happen in the future. With adaptation can bring trade. With adaptation can bring trade-offs. And this is, I think, the cartoon summary of this nice paper, which was an experimental infection, where these authors, Joe et al. passaged SARS-CoV-2 through Ferret or Mink, which selected for this spike mutation in Y453F. But then, if you take that mutant, which is shown as a cartoon here in red, and you try to infect human airway cells, it's less fit. Cells, it's less fit. So there's sort of a trade-off. It's apparently selected in ferrets or minks, but then it doesn't do so well in humans. Now, so there have been a few of these studies, and they're really interesting, but they're kind of one-offs, anecdotal, and lacking statistical support. So what we tried to do, and this is the work of a master's student in my lab, Sana Naderi, who's done all this work, is to take a comprehensive look. So basically, let's look at what's in the data. So basically, let's look at what's in the database and let's try to see what we can learn about transmission events from human to animal and animal to human by looking at big phylogenies. So that's going to be the first part of what I'm going to talk about. And then the second part is, can we actually pinpoint potential animal species specific, potentially adaptive mutations? We don't know that they're necessarily adaptive, but that are statistically associated with different animals. And most of this work is in a pre-print that's available right now. Okay, so working with the data that's available and building big-ish trees, there's all kinds of pictures, you know, there's always bigger trees, but anyway, we're doing what we can with the available data. So Sana started by downloading animal-derived viral sequences from Gisaid, and she included any species with over 30 sequences as a reasonable sample. And she actually worked with the people at Gisaid to get this. worked with the people at GISAI to get this metadata kind of available and they were very helpful with that and I think now it's there so other people can do the same thing and so what we ended up with was about a thousand mink just over 100 deer 78 cats and 39 dogs so this is always this is going to be sort of a caveat throughout is sort of have better stronger conclusions for mink and deer and less for cat and dog sampling is always just going to be a um uh a difference here it's mostly experimental infections No, okay, great question. Jesse, can you repeat the question? Sorry, yeah, the question. Yeah, the question is: Are these experimental infections? These are not. At my very last slide, I will include some experimental infections, but they are not. Thanks. And that's a filter that we added. So to our knowledge, these are natural infections. So for each of these animal-derived sequences, we find the most closely related human. Find the most closely related human-derived sequence, so its closest match in the database. So we make sure to have its closest relative that we can find. And then we add in sort of a representation of the tree. So we add in randomly sampled sequences over time. We just randomly sample 50 sequences per month over 13 months of the pandemic, I think. Wait, is this adding up? I can't do math on the fly. Something like that. And we do this 10 times, 10 random tree resamplings, just to sort of average. Tree resamplings, just a sort of average over phylogenetic uncertainty. We build trees. Yeah, so these are all animal cases derived from human infection. It was already when the virus was like obviously circulating in the human population. Sorry, yeah, exactly. So this is post, exactly. So we don't sorry, Dussie. Okay, sorry, wanted to remind you to please. Okay, sorry. I just wanted to remind you to please repeat the question. Yeah, yeah. So, so the question is: this is all like post Wuhan, so to speak. So, there's no bats, for example. So, this is looking at everything that's happened in the tree since the pandemic. Yeah. So, human ancestral sequences. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. Great question. Yeah. So, these are sequences in the database that are tagged from one of these animals. Being from one of these animals, but we're not using bats, for example, because those tend those are very divergent. They differ by, well, like it's like 96% nucleotide identity. So it's very clearly like a deep ancestral branch. These are all that fall, things that fall well within the clade of human diversity. And I'll show some trees, and humans are always at the at the root, like Wuhan is always at the root. Yeah, great question. Okay. And from many other countries? So, the question, another question is from different countries. There's different representations. So, it's skewed for sure, right? There's lots of North America and Europe, a lot of mink outbreaks in Europe. There's some Asia as well. So it's the usual sort of skews, but yeah, from multiple different countries. Okay, so this is what the trees look like. This is for cat and dog. So the bright blue are human. The bright blue are human sequences. So, these are, you know, these are mostly human trees. The animal sequences are in yellow. And what we're going to try to do is use ancestral state reconstruction to identify potential transmission events in this example from animal back into human. So, from human to animal, now back into human again. Okay. We do some filtering for bootstrap support. So, in order. Bootstrap support. So, in order to use a clade as informative, we want bootstrap support. And you can see the red triangles. If we don't use that bootstrap support, you see a couple of inferred events, but there's no blue squares for cat and dog. So basically, if you do these bootstrap filters, we don't identify any of these events of animal back to human in this example. This is one of 10. Example. This is one of 10 resampled trees. For Mink and Deer, it gets a bit more interesting. Okay, so for Mink, you start to see some of these blue squares, which are bootstrap supported inferences of transmission from an animal back into humans. So these are outbreaks in mink farms mostly, but then there's a human sequence that's really nestled within those minks and well supported. Deer as well, that you. Supported. Deer as well, there's one well-supported example there for deer. Yeah. I think that Mike doesn't work. Yeah, I'll repeat the question. I'll repeat the question. So does your ancestral characters reconstruction approach account for the very different amounts of sampling that are done, the animal versus human? Yeah, no, it's answered. Yeah, no, it's sensitive to that. So I think I had a big caveat here, right? So this is all, and there's better ways of doing this, right? That are Bayesian and are better at dealing with the different sampling effort. That's something that's to do. This is easy. And I guess sort of the caveat here is everything is roughly sort of internally comparable. Sort of internally comparable, but I think that the absolute rates are very subject to change depending on sampling. The number of animal to human events reflects the number of branches that are assigned to animals, and that's going to depend on the number of animals you can see. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. So, this is really sensitive to sampling. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, this is sort of just like a view of the data, but I think there are better ways to. Of the data, but I think there are better ways to do this. Okay, the other thing that I wanted to just note, and I'll come back to this later on this tree, is for the deer in particular, you can see these quite long branches for deer in particular. And this is actually, I didn't mention this filter, but we actually applied some filters for sequence quality and we removed real outlier branches that were outside of an interquartile range filter that just seemed like junk sequencing error. Like junk sequencing error, very strange things. So, even despite that filter, we still see there's these quite long branches, which we think are real and plausible, which I think suggests some unsampled deer-to-deer transmission chains that are happening. So, I'll come back to that, just a feature of that tree. So, if you summarize the information from these trees, and we've got 10 random tree resamplings for human to animal, we have a relatively Human to animal, we have a relatively stable range of five to 13 events. I'm focusing on the bootstrap filter, so that's sort of higher confidence. So it doesn't vary that much across the animals in the human to animal direction. And again, that could be because the tree is dominated by humans. And so even though there is variation in the animal sampling sizes, they're all small relative to humans. That could influence that. And then for animal back to humans, this is very rare. So again, I just want you. Very rare. So, again, I just want, you know, this, there are biases according to sampling. So, it could be that there are, you know, cat and dog and deer animals back to human events that we just haven't found yet because of sampling, but we clearly find them in Mink, right? Which are the best sampled, but we are finding them. Okay. All right, so all of that was sort of meant as a bit of background. Of background because I don't want to hang my hat on these results too much, but it's more exploratory. But what I want to actually get to, which I think is quite robust, is a genome-wide association study where the phenotype here is the animal species from which we're sampling. And we used a method called poutine, which was developed by a PhD student in my lab who graduated recently called Peter Chen. Poutine is a food in the province of Quebec. In the province of Quebec. The name has nothing to do with the method, but I just decided today that we can think of the French fries as the phylogeny, the basis of this all. And then we're looking for homoplasic mutations for the cheese curds that are just sprinkled atop and really give you this great signal. And the gravy is just Peter's special sauce of coating this up in a really nice, user-friendly way. So we're So we're focusing on homoplasic mutations. Marina talked about the power of these before. We can think of them as convergent mutations as well. It's kind of a bit of a semantic issue. But this implicitly controls for population structure. We're looking for mutations that happen independent parts of the tree that are independently associated with, in the lingo of GWAS, cases over control. So cases are the animals. Over control. So, cases are the animals. And homoplasia or convergent evolution is a hallmark of positive selection. So, this can happen at random at some rate, just according to the mutation rate, but above some threshold, it's a really strong signal that something non-neutral is happening. Okay, so we're going to focus on these. We're doing genotypic ancestral state reconstruction down the whole tree to get where the mutation changes are happening. In this case, we're only using. In this case, we're only using the phenotypes at the tip. So, the animal state, we're not trying to infer that down the tree because I think that can get unreliable. So, those are the true observed phenotypes. We're not reconstructing that. And we're just going to use a simple binomial test statistic where the sort of successes, x, are the number of homoplasies in cases. So, we're going to, I should say, we're going to do a separate GWAS for each animal species relative to human. Species relative to human. Okay, so mink versus human, deer versus human, etc. Those are our cases. N is the total number of observed homoplasies at a particular nucleotide position. So this controls for the background mutation rate, just because we see a lot of homoplasies in cases. It could just, you know, we're accounting for this could be a nucleotide position that just evolves really quickly anyway. So that's taken into account. And our expected proportion is just the case to control ratio. Is just the case to control ratio in the data set. So, like, how many tips are animal versus human? For p-values, we're going to estimate empirical p-values based on label reshufflings of the case and control labels. We're going to do that 100,000 times. And to correct for multiple tests, we're going to calculate family-wise p-values using the max t-method. And so, to do this for each replicate, we save the maximum test step. The maximum test statistic to create a distribution of maximum test statistics. And the corrected family-wise p-value that we end up with is the rank of our observed test statistic in this distribution of maximum tests. And this provides strong control over multiple testing and is also less conservative than just doing something like Bonferroni or even false discovery rate. So, this is what we get. These are Manhattan plots where. Hatton plots where so this is the SARS-CoV-2 genome along the x-axis here. It's coded by genes. It's a little hard to read, but I'll point out notable things. See, there's no signal, okay, for cats or dogs. It's a small sample size, so not too surprising because we're looking for big peaks of the negative log p-values. So these are for significant hits. For Mink, we start to see some interesting things, and the size of the dot. The size of the dot, go back a slide, are the number of replicates. So we do 10 tree resamplings that we find this hit in. So we also repeat the GWAS 10 times to get a sense of support. So we get these three hits in Mink. They're all non-synonymous. So that's the color coding. They're all red. And this is what they are. So there's this N501T mutation. This has been documented in experimental infections and noted in Noted in natural outbreaks, a mutation in the replicase, and also in ORF3A. And these are all have been documented previously in some literature. What's a bit newer and kind of surprising is we get a lot of hits in deer, 26 hits in deer. None of them are in the spike, which is this area. And a whole bunch of them are synonymous. So those are the Are synonymous. So those are the blue points. Okay, so this is pretty different. My collaborator on this, Selena Sagan, who is a virologist, has been digging into what these could mean, but I think it also highlights looking outside of spike and also considering variation that is synonymous could be of interest. So, as I said, all three mink hits have been previously reported. Mink hits have been previously reported in the literature, but not really tested in such a rigorous way for statistical significance. These are some references. A recent paper came out just as we were doing this. Khan et al., this is from Francois Valloux's lab, used a very similar approach, very similar data set. Their sample sizes are off by like, I don't know, depending on like what hour of the day they downloaded from GSAID. And they took a similar approach. They also focused on homoplasic mutations and they used what I would describe. And they used what I would describe as a set of reasonable, but ultimately arbitrary filters to say how many homoplasies do we want to see in different clades? But ultimately, there wasn't a formal GWAS that was applied. So they came up with four mutations in Mink, of which we recover three. So I think that that's pretty good support. They only found one mutation in deer, which we also recover among our 26. So I think this kind of shows that there's some overlap, but then we also are gaining something. Gaining something in our approach. Okay, so are all these deer mutations real? It's a whole bunch of them. Are we just detecting a bunch of garbage? Okay, and I can't completely answer that question. Depends on what you mean by real. I believe that these really are statistically associated. I think we have a pretty strong association testing framework here. So I think they're statistically associated, but what does it mean? Are they dear adaptive? Are they neutral? Are they deer adaptive? Are they neutral in deer but strongly constrained in humans? There's a lot more to explore. A question that I think we can address is: did they plausibly arise in deer? And this was a question that a reviewer asked when we first submitted this paper, or in nearby humans, right? So are they really, did it happen in a deer plausibly, or in humans and then transmitted into deers? And we can't, again, know for sure because of sampling, but we can address. Because of sampling, but we can address this using. Now we're going to use all the sequence data available, 13 million sequences in Cove spectrum. And basically, we're going to define a local transmission odds ratio. So we're going to define first regions. So these can be US states or Canadian provinces or countries. So whatever resolution is available, where the animal associated mutation was found, where that animal with that mutation was sampled. And then we're going to define any. And then we're going to define any other region where it's not found. And we're going to look for the animal-associated allele or the alternative allele in humans. Okay, so humans in that region, do they tend to have the animal-associated allele, right? So our odds ratio will be greater than one if that tends to be the case. Humans as a plausible source with a p-value cutoff. So when we do this, two of the mint hits, the Two of the mint hits, the mink hits, this is the case for two of the mink hits. So, two of those mink mutations were plausibly occurred in humans before transmitting to mink. And 501t does not. So, it more likely occurred in a mink based on this criteria. And for deer, 18 of our 26 have this odds ratio greater than one, six do not. So there are six mutations that plausibly, more plausibly occurred. Plausibly, more plausibly occurred in a deer. Even if we take this criteria as truth, there's still six times more mutations that occur in deer than in MIC. So there's some more detectable deer-associated mutations for whatever reason. And remember, the sample size is 10 times as big in MINC. Okay, so just to wrap up, this is a last little icing on the cake that Sana is in the middle of working on. So many, many caveats. This is like she's doing this now. Caveats, this is like she's doing this now. We looked at within host diversity in these animals. So we went back to NCBI, downloaded the raw reads for not the exact same samples because it's not available. For some, we just have the consensus sequence, but for a subset, we can actually get the raw reads and try to look at within host diversity. So why do this? Other talks today have talked about chronic infections within host evolution. So within host diversity tells us something about the demographic. Diversity tells us something about the demographics, selection that might be happening within individual animals. And so we can ask: how does this vary across these species? So we download these raw reads, we use samples with paired-end Illumina sequencing only, map them to a reference genome, use a minimum depth cutoff. We're looking at intra-host single nucleotide variant frequencies between 25 and 95. 25 is just actually the observed minimum. You could draw a cutoff below that. Minimum. You could draw a cutoff below that, but we only see things above that frequency. And we calculate the total number of isonivs and the pairwise nucleotide diversity pi on these samples. Very preliminary. Sana just did this. And we're trying to expand the data set to look at, there's a bunch of samples that only have single end reads, a lot more, which seems like a red flag potentially. I don't know, but we can get a lot more data if we do it that way. So we're still playing around with this. That way. So we're still playing around with this. Here's what it looks like. So, this is just the number of polymorphic sites, the number of eye sniffs per species. So, deer really has a lot more. So, this start to see the axis here. It goes from zero to 40. In work by Katrine Lithgow from the UK in humans, the range is really like goes up to 20, but it's really, you know, tends to be 10. So, these are sort of in the high range. That said, we have done. High range. That said, we haven't done every power filter for errors and things like that. But it looks like there's a lot in Deer. That said, this is the average depth of coverage per sample. There's a lot more coverage in Deer as well. So we have to properly control for this. Eyeballing this, I think that coverage can't explain all of this, but we need to do that properly. This is just like hot off the press. There could be something to this as well, the average depth being higher and deer. There's a hot there that could tell you something about. That could tell you something about higher viral loads. And then, if you look at nucleotide diversity, so pairwise nucleotide diversity per site averaged across the gene, it's also higher in deer. This is less sensitive to depth because it's more sensitive to intermediate frequency alleles. Again, leading me to believe there's something real happening in DEAR that's not just due to sampling. But we'll see. This is where we are. These are things that Sun has just been sending me like 15 minutes ago. Just been sending me like 15 minutes ago. So, this is really what we're working on now. So, just to wrap it all up, my thinking on this. So, first thing, more sampling, right? Data sharing and sampling could reveal more transmission and additional GWAS hits. In mink, okay, so mink, we might have limited mink to mink transmission. It seems like potentially there's more cycles of mink to human back. Cycles of mink to human, back to mink. And maybe this could be linked to less potential for adaptive evolution. So, this not so many GWAS hits that we're seeing, despite a pretty big sample size. In contrast, in deer, there might be more deer-to-deer transmission, right? So there's these long deer branches. Potentially, there's more intra-host diversity. Question mark there. We need to rigorously look at that. And as the result, more. And as the result, more potentially adaptive mutations that we're finding. So, these are sort of my thoughts on this so far. The GWAS hits regardless, I think, make some interesting candidates for experimental follow-up, our colleagues who are actually doing experimental infections in animals and things like that. I think a big question is: do these mutations have trade-offs for infecting humans? Which I think is important for whether something that's in an animal is actually a risk to Risk to do something like the next Omicron come from an animal reservoir. So I'll stop there. I will thank, I've already really thanked, I hope enough, Sana, who's really done all this work, Peter, who developed the GWAS method, some other members of my group and of CobarNat who have been doing this work. So thank you. And I will maybe take questions. And I will maybe take questions or maybe meet up. Thanks very much, Jesse. It's a great talk. Maybe one question quickly, and then we, in the interest of time, move on to the next speaker. But there will be time for discussion at the there's a question from the root from Santiago. Yeah, I was thinking about. Here are two potential scenarios. What about accelerated mutation rates or high rates of pre-combination? Okay, hi. Did everyone hear the question on Zoom? Yes. I think we can basically hear it. Okay. So the question is: could it be accelerated mutation? Question is: Could it be accelerated mutation rate or recombination in deer? That could be happening, right, for those long branches. I think that the GWAS shouldn't be sensitive to that in the way that we've designed it, where it should be controlling for that background mutation rate. Although the background mutation rate is assumed, it's the number of homoplasies across the whole tree. So I guess it could be sensitive to a deer-specific acceleration. The deer-specific acceleration. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, I wouldn't exclude that. Thanks. I've got a couple quick question or related questions from the room. Okay, so if we have time, so I was thinking, what is like the tolerance of deer to COVID? I mean, could they just be like infected forever? Be like infected forever, and so you're effective getting mutation, long mutations for that reason. So, basically, do they show any symptoms of sickness or something? Yeah, and that are we seeing chronic deer infection, essentially. Right, I think that might be the case where I think deer, deer are a bit of a question mark, but there's some there's data for cats and dogs, and there's references in the paper to this where about which animals are known to get more or less sick. Animals are known to get more or less sick. And I think we don't know for deer, but it's plausible. It's plausible. Yeah, but I don't think there's good data on that. But maybe my collaborators who are really in the animal realm would know. All right, I think we should move. I'd love to take more questions. We can do it after, but we'll move to the next talk of the session.
