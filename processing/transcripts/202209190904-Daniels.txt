Towards the end of my talk, How Much Mountains Mean to Me. And I'll close with the reason I'm not there. We will get there eventually. And I promise it's a good one. So yeah, so I decided to be a little bit cheeky. And since the title of the conference is Building Networks, I figured I'd say, well, that's literally what I do. I'm a laboratory scientist. I build networks. And I take them apart and I put them back together. And so I'm mostly going to talk about: can you guys see my cursor if I do this? Guys, see my cursor if I do this? Yes, yes. Yeah, okay. So, the um, let me just check. There we go. All right. So, the picture on the left is a 3D printed disordered network. The picture in the middle is of a laser cut network that we're breaking, and the green breaks are marked, marked, the breaks are marked in green there. And the picture on the right is a movie of networks sort of continually changing in a granular material. Granular material. And the bottom right is another network that we've printed. And I am mostly going to talk about the two that were movies. The two that are printed are a new project that's just getting off the ground. And I'd sort of show them here in hopes that conversations can be had about them during some of the discussion sessions. And the second piece of this is: I couldn't have done any of this work without the huge network of collaborators who've worked on all of it. And I don't know if I got Of it. And I don't know if I got all of these lines correct. I made an attempt. And all of the folks in red are folks who've been doing stuff in my lab here at NC State. And then, of course, we draw on a huge chunk of people all over the place because we are experimentalists and we want our work to matter. So, this upper right corner, this little community here is our sort of geoscience community, right? Right. This middle stretch here is sort of statistical physicsy world. And then over here, except for these two, this is sort of the applied math world. And some of these are folks that you guys know. And then this is a new collaboration doing some material science with the 3D printing. And we're hoping to tie them into the applied math world. So, this is who's been involved in all of this. And you'll hear more about all these people's contributions as we go through. Through. And just how dense this network is, I think, is fascinating. You know, how many people have collaborated across other collaborations? I think why meetings like this are important to meet people and sort of float these ideas. All right, so a large chunk of what I work on is granular materials. So a pile of grains. In this case, there's a force being ramped up here at the bottom. Okay. And every Okay, and every place that's bright is a place where greens are transmitting force. Okay, and at some point, this is all going to fail. And it's coming up in about a second on the upper left, right? It's been resisting the ramping up force for a long time. It's on one of these lines ramping up. And now it suddenly gives way in the span of a couple hundred milliseconds, right? And then it lost its rigidity and could no longer sustain that force. And this was a movie that was taken. For us. And this was a movie that was taken actually like two years ago now, or actually pre-pandemic, like three years ago now, by a bunch of folks in my group who hooked up the high-speed camera to see if we could actually see what was evolving in a small portion of a granular material. So this yellow box is approximately this movie over here. But as the force on this inner wheel was ramped up, what was actually going on inside the system? Okay. And it's this network of connections between the forces that. Of connections between the forces that were holding it up, and ultimately that's what fails. And I probably tell you a little bit about how we're managing to spy on all the forces inside there. Okay, and so one of the things that physicists love to do is use cool optics tricks. That's all this is. Okay, so every place, oops, let me just, so every place that you see a particle in one of my images, it's just a piece of polymer. It's usually polyurethane, the same stuff that's like in a bike seat that's squishy. That's like in a bike seat, that squishy, sort of erasery-type stiffness. And polymers have a really cool property that they rotate the polarization of light in variable ways depending on how hard they're stressed. And so when you view polymers through polarizers, here we have a set of crossed polarizers, so it's a dark field polariscope, right? If there's not much force, just see dark particles. If you apply a little more force, then some of the light that couldn't get through. Light that couldn't get through before now is able to sneak through due to the rotation of the light by the polymer. And so you can basically read off by eye in any of the movies I'm showing if something has more or less force by how bright it is and it's higher sort of how many fringes wrapped back around. And these will be in different colors and different pictures, but just keep in mind that dark is low force and high variability is high force. And in fact, we have ways to get actually measure the vector. Have ways to get actually measure the vector contact forces at each of these points, but that's this is all the knowledge you need for today, okay? And the con because this is about the force on the particles. The second thing is to think about the configuration of contacts, and this is the networks, right? And one of the things I like to think about is that, you know, rigidity we can think of as just being whether or not something can resist stress that's imposed on it. But I've done a little, well, this isn't playing here at the right. That's a shame. There's a little animated. That's a shame. There's a little animated GIF that's supposed to play, and it's not playing. Oh, well. So, the animated GIF is supposed to show the following: that the configuration matters, right? And so, if I arrange my beams like in this picture here, this purple beam, right, and this purple beam are both on the left, then this is actually floppy over here. It's like a picture frame that's wobbly, okay? But if I move this beam over to the right-hand side, so I change the connectivity of the network without changing the number of objects in the network. Without changing the number of objects in the network, right, then both the left and the right are rigid, right? And this is sort of just a toy model of that anything that we call rigid probably contains both rigid and floppy subregions, right? And often one of the things we like to do is take system-wide averages, okay, which in this case would lead to the wrong answer, right? That the system-wide average of the number of connections, right, per particle would be the same whether or not this purple beam is on the left or the right, okay, but in fact, it Or the right, okay, but in fact, it changes it from being globally rigid to only locally rigid. Okay, so this also sets the stage for saying we should be able to use networks of connections to determine things like which areas are prone to failure, they're not rigid, right? And possibly even when those failures are going to occur, which is what I'll get to by the end of the talk. And so, this is sort of the framework for trying to understand things we want to do. And what I'm going to talk about today uses sort of Day uses sort of three different frameworks for doing that. So, one, and I'm sort of put these on a scale of less physics to more physics, right? And so, you know, I could just look at these particles and who they're touching and possibly how strong they're touching, you know, via the force networks and just analyze them using the tools of network science, right? So, just the topology and possibly some weighting, right? I can sort of go one step up at a little more physics and say for one of these particles, you know, how many degrees of freedom does it have? How many. Degrees of freedom does it have? How many constraints does it have? Do I have, in other words, in the math sense, do the number of equations and the number of unknowns line up? So I can use that. And this is just using Newton's laws, just torque and force balance, right? And then I can go add a little more physics in and say, I actually can talk about the energy of the system, right? And so how are perturbations propagated through it? And that's a bit more physics. And so the question is, why might we choose to use one of these? You know, why might we choose to use one of these methods versus another? What are the costs and benefits of each of them? What are the pros and cons? And to do that, I'm mostly going to show you two materials. So one is these granular materials where you can see the force chains throughout them. And the other is actually, it's the same data essentially. We took pictures of force chains and cut them as lattices in the lab, right? So we can have sort of a simplified explanation. And so we'll go back and forth between these two different. Forth between these two different disordered materials and talk about how rigidity and failure arise. And I should say, if people have questions, they should just jump in and ask them because I can't see hands. And so somebody should just unmute and ask. Yeah. All right. So these chains that I'm showing you in the granular materials are really common to any amorphous material. So folks who have done experiments. So, folks who've done experiments in everything from bubbles to emulsions, so think about these left-hand side as being mayonnaise, oil and water droplets mixed together and stabilized. Colloids, so tiny particles with thermal motion, right? In water beads, like the ones you put in vases. So, at a huge variety of length scales. So, these are micron scale, these are centimeter scale, right? Most of them are rather circular particles, although that's not a requirement. Particles, although that's not a requirement, right? Any place that you seem to look at a variety of amorphous materials, you tend to see that this is heterogeneous propagation of forces. So things don't share the load equally. And in fact, if you look in and say, is there a story to the patterns of those? The answer is yes, that in fact, the degree of isotropy in those, the carrying of those forces often tells you what the history of loading was. The history of loading was right, and so you can have things that are quite isotropic when something is isotropically compressed, and when something is sheared, so compressed in one direction and expanded in the other, you can actually have very long chain-like structures. So, the correlations are tremendously different because of the history. And so this gives, these are very different networks of inter-particle connections, even though if you just look at the particles, it's just a bunch of circles touching other circles, right? Circles touching other circles, right? They can be very dramatically different. Okay. And so, where do these come from, and how sensitive are they to how you make your system? So, this was an experiment that Jonathan Colemer did when he was a postdoc in my lab. And this isn't really a movie. It's actually a series of images that were taken and strung together into a movie where we took one of the walls and released the force chains and then put the wall back and made the force chains again. And you can see the particles only barely. Again, and you can see the particles only barely are moving between they're moving by tiny amounts, okay. But every time that we repeat the experiment, right, there's a slightly different configuration of the force chains, right? And so the network of connections is not just about positional information, right? It's about the, again, the history of how these things came together. And I'm going to play it one more time. And I want you to look at a question: Is it, can you find an example of a particle? Can you find an example of a particle that seems like it's almost always on a strong force chain? So it's got these greenish fringes on it. And you can find an example of one that almost never is, or one that's really flaky. And you can probably find examples of all of those. Oops. So this guy seems pretty consistently on, and this guy seems pretty consistently off, right? And so there's something, and these particles are all identical as far as we're concerned, right? So they're all just cut in a machine shop out of the same material, right? And so there's something about the configuration of the particles that's making some of them more likely to be on a force chain and not. And when I say there are Chain and not. And when I say they're identical, I'm lying. In fact, if we zoom in at the scale of the edges, of course they are rough, right? Of course, they have some surface roughness. And in fact, you know, if a high point for this particle bumps into a high point from another particle, right, that's going to be more likely to form a contact than if two low points happen to be aligned. And so this is where these real sensitivity to tiny initial changes gives you, quite naturally, an ensemble of valid configurations. Ensemble of valid configurations, right? All of which are slightly different from each other. And we'd like to understand why some particles are bearing more load than others. And to address this question and a bunch of ones that follow, one of the techniques we're going to use is to write our particle systems as networks, as I said, so we can do network science on them. Okay, so for the image you just saw, we have a bunch of circles, a bunch of particles. We can write each circle as being a node in our network, and if they're touching each other, we connect them by an edge. Um, we connect them by an edge, okay. Um, we can decide whether or not we want to weight them by something, for instance, by the normal force between the two particles or something like that. Okay, so we have a choice whether to look at an adjacency matrix that's either binary or one that's been weighted by the force, okay. And then this frees us up, once we've written it this way, to use a whole host of network science techniques to ask questions about our system and sort of in a sense, in the uh the aim to do a little bit of reviewing. They aim to do a little bit of reviewing, right? What kinds of network science techniques you want to use would depend on the questions you're asking, right? So, if we're asking about something that's about the whole system, right, how efficient it is at some property, we might want to look at system scale measures, right? If we're interested in single particle properties, we might go all the way down to the lowest scales and look at things like clustering or small loops, okay? And where I'm going to hang out today is actually in the middle. Out today is actually in the middle, right? Looking at things that either are about domains or about paths, right? And so the kinds of techniques that are helpful for looking at this mesoscale, right? So not the bulk system behavior, not the particle properties, right? But the mesoscale behaviors, okay, as we saw from this cartoon of rigidity, we're going to care about things at the mesoscale. Or one is to use modularity techniques or other community detection techniques to sort of find patterns. Detection techniques to sort of find patches that are correlated with each other. Okay, and the other place we might be interested is looking at transmission, right? So, how do things transmit across the system, right? In which case, we might be looking at paths with curves, so notions of betweenness and centrality and things like that could be really useful. So, I'm going to talk briefly about one notion of centrality, not by any means the only one. So, if we take a box of grains, right, and we can Of grains, right? And we consider for any two grains in the box, what's the shortest path between those two particles, right? Again, we might do this weighted or not weighted, depending on what we're interested in, right? And then do that, go through and do that for all the particles, right? We're going to discover that some of those particles are on a lot of shortest paths, okay? And those are numbers that have high centrality, gender betweenness centrality. Okay, and what these correspond to is they're like the Chicago's of Of transportation of getting to Van, right, or to California, right? So there's some airlines that lots and lots of, you know, airports with lots and lots of traffic has to go through, and those are the ones with high centrality. Okay, so we're going to look at this as a measure for our grains. Okay, so which particles lie on a lot of shortest paths? Okay, and we're going to do this for this data set I just showed you of asking which of these particles are going to have stronger force chains. Okay, and so. Force chains. Okay. And so we normalized things. We normalized the pressure zero to one. We normalized the betweenness centrality zero to one. And we saw a large bunch of scatter. Okay. But if we bin it, okay, and we sort of bin the forces sort of into four quartiles, right? Low, you know, medium and high. Okay. And we look at the histograms of this data as a function of which bin they're in, they're quite different from each other, right? And so the ones that Right, and so the ones that have the highest forces, right, on average, you tend to have higher betweenness, right? And so, if we take the slopes of these lines, right, that characterize the histograms for each of these distributions, so it's a characteristic force scale, right, that's associated with each of sorry, characteristic betweenness scale associated with each force bin, right? So, what's the characteristic betweenness scale as a function of which force bin you're in? You see quite a strong. Venyurin, you see quite a strong trend. Okay. And so this says that the reason that a particle in this packing is on a force chain is because it's on a lot of shortest paths, right? And that if force is being transmitted from one wall to the other, or between any two particles, there's a high likelihood that force is going to have to go through there just on the basis of topology, no physics at all. And so this suggests that network methods can really be very, very useful. Really, you know, be very, very useful for without including almost any physics at all, in this case, essentially none, right? Making predictive behaviors. Okay, so this gave us confidence to go forth and try a lot harder. And it would be fantastic if we could forecast failure locations. You know, so if I've got some network of particles, is there some patches in here that I should be worried about? Okay. Erin, could I ask a question about? Yes, please do. So, in some of the previous slides that you had, and also in this one over here, you see that the particles are different sizes, which I think that the network approach doesn't account for. So, is that something that you see in your results that they fit better when your particles all have almost the same size versus when you have very heterogeneous particles? Ah, that's a good question. So, we haven't, so okay, so I'll tell you two things. I'll tell you why our particles are different sizes. I'll tell you why our particles are different sizes and also why we haven't addressed that specific question. So, our particles are different sizes so that we don't get crystals. So, two-dimensional systems are very prone to crystallization when particles are close in size. And so, we want to use particles of two sizes to break up crystals and keep the system disordered. And it's an easy way to do that. If we were to take that too far, however, and have particles of dramatically different sizes, then you Dramatically different sizes. Then you end up in situations that are colloquially called the Brazil nut effect, when you take a can of mixed nuts and all the big particles are at the top, right? Or you open up a container of chips and all the chip dust is at the bottom, right? So granular materials tend to segregate by size, right? And so if we pick things that are dramatically different in size, we actually have trouble doing experiments that are in steady state. And so this contrasting size is sort of the balance between those two effects. Between those two effects being about okay to work with. We do still see crystallization effects, we do still see segregation effects, but neither one dominates. We have not ever examined what happens if you, for instance, weight edges by the particle radii, right? We just sort of treat them all as nodes that are equal. We have not broken them down into having any particular size. And that's an interesting question. Yeah, I don't know if there's interesting. Yeah, I don't know if there's interesting information there. Particles that are larger do tend to have more force because they have more space for more contact. So that correlation does exist, but it's not a strong effect because these are similar in size. Does that answer the question? Yes, thanks. Thanks. All right. So in fact, at this point, I'm going to leave granular materials because it turns out that we were having trouble deciding what we meant by failure locations, right? That was, you know, how much do you. That was, you know, how much do you have to move to be called a failure, right? And so we actually switched track for a while and said, what if we take our pictures of the force chains, draw the contact network, and then cut that contact network out as a lattice out of plastic, right? And then we can squish that lattice and look where it breaks, or we can stretch that lattice and look where it breaks. And a broken piece of plastic is an obvious thing, right? We know it failed there. It failed there. And so, Estelle Bertier, who was a postdoc in my group, did a bunch of experiments where she was using granular-inspired data, but on this sort of laser cut systems. And we are now going back to revisit the granular problem, but for the moment, we'll stick with this because we learned a lot doing it. So, one of the things she did was take on this idea of betweenness. And here she was using edge betweenness because the disordered lattices more strongly have edges than they have nodes. Then they have nodes. And so she considered a network of edges and calculated the edge betweenness for the lattice. And every time something broke, that edge was taken out of the lattice and we recalculated the edge betweenness. So this is a movie. Oops, I meant to both of that betweenness calculation being recalculated, okay, and of the place that the next broad. And of the place that the next break happened. Okay, and what you'll see is those red ellipses very often lie on the highest betweenness areas. Okay, often on one of those brightest yellow edges. And so what we saw statistically was three quarters of the time, the failed edges were had above mean betweenness, right? And that's much, that's about double their population. So it's a huge enhancement where things are going to fail. Are going to fail based on this betweenness measure. Okay, so again, it doesn't say this one will fail, but statistically more likely to fail. And so one of the ways that engineers look at these is to sort of do these plots of how many possibilities there were and what your success weight was at making a prediction, right? And a perfect test would be a red line across here. Okay. And one of the things Estelle did was say, all right. And one of the things Estelle did was say, all right, our really simple model of centrality, which is this green one, right? And something that's random has no predictive power would be this blue line, right? So anything in this upper quadrant that's white is an improvement over random. Okay. And so her, this model I just showed you is this green one we just considered centrality. She made a slight improvement where she put each edge that she was squishing from in as basically giant nodes, and that provides some more improvement. Provide some more improvement? And essentially, this model that has no physics, right? It's just the topology of the network, does as well as ones that have some simple physics in it. So a common, you know, a common statistical physics, nonlinear complex systems model is to look at fuse models, right? So if you have a network of fuses, if you go above some threshold, the fuse fails and the current has to get redirected to the other networks. So this actually has some real physics in it. So, this actually has some real physics in it. This could be stress and fracture rather than your current and fuse, and it would be the same model, right? And the blue and the yellow have pretty much the same degree of success, even though this one has a lot of physics in it and our model has basically none. In order to do a lot better, you really need to jump up to much more sophisticated models, right? Where you stick in whole beams that have bending moments and things like that. If you put in all of those mechanics, which she did. You put in all of those mechanics, which she did, right? You can get something that's a much better prediction, okay? But with a lot more work and a lot more that you've required that you know about the physics of the system, right? And so what we're seeing is that the network, without knowing anything except the connectivity, does a very, very good job. And so this is what it looks like. I've shown this small, I wanted to show it large, right, as one of these networks is fracturing. And this is one where it's a very diffuse fracture pattern, right? And so, this example is one where we saw a very distributed failure. Okay, the material science term for this is often ductile, right? And in fact, that's not the only behavior we saw, right? And so, we also dug in and said: if I change the connectivity of my network, what does that change about the patterns of failure? And so, And so, okay, so physicists call this coordination number. In network science, it's called degree. It's how many connections on average each node has. And so, on average, we have around three connections per node, but we've ranged these from two and a half up to three and a half, right? So, a very small change actually in the degree of average connectivity as we span this series of plastics networks that we cut. Cut. Okay. And I'm going to show you what the cracks looked like. So when you have a low connectivity, right, you have very ductile-like broad distribution of failures. That's the one I just showed you. And as you increase the connectivity, you start to get much more brittle-like with like narrow, discrete cracks that cut across the system. And this really changes the dynamics also. So these tend to happen all at once, and these tend to happen slowly over time. To happen slowly over time. Okay, and so if you are, um, so delta is the displacement of the two plates that are either squishing it or pulling it apart, um, and the force is the force that's being recorded. And so, what you see is you, as you push down on it, eventually it fails, and then it fails again, and then it fails again. And this is a series of repeated failures until the final crack propagates all the way across. Okay, so in the first phase, most of the beams, those edges, are bending and stretching, they're just deforming in. And stretching. They're just deforming in place, right? And you can see rotations, right, as well, okay? But it's accommodating the load by elasticity, the elasticity of the lattice, okay, not by failure. Once we get past this point here where the first failure occurred, we see more and more damage progressing as it pushes further and further and further. And eventually, in all cases, we get a crack that spans all the way across the system. Okay, and that's that last stage here. And then intermediate. Last stage here. And then intermediate, you're seeing a combination of where it switches back and forth between these two modes of behavior. Okay, accommodating things elastically and catastrophic failure. And this is the pattern that we see if something has a low degree of connectivity. If we see something that has a high degree of connectivity, so that green one I just showed you here, that whole green drama is all the way down here on this plot. On the right-hand side of the plot, Okay, on the right-hand side of the plot, we have this brittle failure. You see that elastic deformation, and then only one crack, and then another crack. Right, so it takes place in basically two discrete events instead of a dozen smaller events. Okay, so that's that distinction in the behavior, okay, controlled again by the degree of connectivity. Okay, and so you know, we can characterize this a bunch of ways, you know, the sizes of the cracks, how wide they are, how long they are, right, how the load was when they first. Right, how the load was when they first failed, and so here I've just plotted the crack with what the load right before the first failure was. Okay, and you can see there's a strong trend in both of these, okay, from as you change the connectivity going from what's called ductile-like to what's brittle-like. Okay, and so this is an easy thing that if you know this about connectivity affecting material properties, it can become a design principle, right? Okay, and so now we want to try this back in granular experiments, right? Experiments, right? And so Jonathan Colner was a postdoc who took this data, and Kong Miu was at the time a graduate student at Syracuse who did a lot of the data analysis. And the question is, can we see how rigidity arises in a granular material, which was our original question. Okay. And here we'll get back to the networks eventually. But here I want to put in that we actually went with a more physicsy Model for a while. But I still classify them as less physics and more physics. So, one of the techniques we use is to write it as a network. And then one of the cool things that have been developed, and Zilke Henkel and Jen Schwartz are the masters of this, is to say if every node has three degrees of freedom, right, so it can translate in two directions and it can rotate in one direction, right? In one direction, right? Do we have enough constraints on the system to cover those degrees of freedom? And a technique that exists is called the pebble game, and it's sort of drawn schematically here, right? That if these are your three odd degrees of freedom, do you have enough constraints to cover them? And then a lovely numerical procedure called the Pebble Game. Looks like the game of Go. There's rules that you can follow numerically. And they will tell you whether or not you have a rigid cluster or a floppy region. Okay. And a rigid cluster. A floppy region, okay, and a rigid cluster is one where you have enough constraints to satisfy your degrees of freedom locally, and a floppy region is one where you do not. Okay, so we can look for clusters of rigidness, okay. And this is a little bit of physics because it has this notion of degrees of freedom, okay, but it's mostly just topology, right? Both of those come into play, but there's just a little bit of physics, okay? Sort of the more physics way that sort of this comes to us a lot from the glass community is to say. From the glass community is to say that any large system has eigen modes, right? And it vibrates, you know, and there's a spectrum of those modes, right? And any place that are low frequency modes, right, are very, you know, those are places that are associated with a loss of rigidity. And so in order to do this, these are not Hamiltonian systems, right? They are dissipative because. They are dissipative because the particles have friction and they are inelastic. And Zilka Henke has done a lot of work to sort of write down models for that and then take the Hessian, even though it's not a conserved quantity. And in simulations, they've seen that this can nonetheless still work to identify how rigid a system and how close it is to failure. Yeah. That potential with two wells, what is the connection, the meaning of the two wells relative to the rigidity? Oh, sorry, okay, yeah, all right, that's a little too schematic. Okay, that's a little bit too schematic, sorry. So there's a okay, so the first thing is if this were one well, right, we would know that these two have different stiffnesses, right, based on the frequency of. Right, based on the frequency of oscillation. Like, if we're just a single well, if it's just comparing these two wells, right, you know, the square root of k over m simple harmonic oscillator would tell you that each of those wells has a different stiffness, right? So that's how rigid it is, right? So this can't tell us about failure, but it can tell us about rigidity, right? And so a stiff spring is more rigid, right? And as a higher frequency, right? And so that's the connection. We're making an analogy to Making an analogy to sort of simple harmonic oscillators. Okay. But now for the whole object, not just for one particle in a box. So I'm using the, I'll use these two icons to sort of tell which framework I'm working in a couple of places. All right. I'm actually going to skip how to play the Pebble game in the interests of time. It has rules. Okay, and skip to this one. Okay, and skip to this one because this actually goes right to your question, which is if we actually calculate, and so this actually requires a numerical step, right? So we have our experiment and we know the contact forces at each grain because we can measure those using the photoelastic method. That's a whole giant ton of work that I won't talk about, but we know what the local forces are on each particle, right? And so we can actually locally put that back into a simulation temporarily. Into a simulation temporarily and use that to calculate the eigenmotes and the eigenvalues. And what we see is that if we do a histogram of the eigenvalues, okay, for systems that are, and now we're progressing, so A, B, C, D is a system under progressing shear, right? So as we start to shear the system, right, we maintain these two populations. There's a population of low frequency modes and there's a Low frequency modes, and there's a population of high frequency modes, and there's a chasm between them. And so, we separate those into two different states, okay. And they are here drawn in gray and in purple, and the purple are the rigid clusters, okay, or so they're the things that have the highest stiffness, okay, the highest eigenvalues. Okay, so we can separate those into two piles, and that's just binary, okay. And what we see is as we shear a system, okay, it develops more and more. Develops more and more rigidity in response to that shear. Okay, so if you push on the granular material, it resists, okay, it resists shear, but it resists it in this very patchy way. We can also do that with the pebble game. Okay, so we can go through and see. And we can go through and we can find the places. Let me try to get that centered again. Find the places which are rigid because they have enough. Have enough constraints to satisfy their degrees of freedom, and we can classify those. So, these are regions, this green region here is a rigid cluster, and these gray regions are places that did not have enough constraints to satisfy their degrees of freedom. And now we can compare those two results. Okay, and so what we see, if we start from a picture of our force chains, okay, and we measure the contact forces at each of these points, okay, we can use these two different methods to classify where we think are rigid. And they're very, very different from each other. And they're very, very different from each other, and they give nearly the same patterns, right? They're not identical, okay? But luckily, but you know, we were very happy to see that every place that was classified as rigid under vibrational modes was also classified as rigid under the constraint counting. Okay, now there's some pros and cons. The constraint actually gives us clusters. These are discrete objects, right? They can be small or they can be large. Whereas the vibrational modes just tell us areas, you know, but it doesn't. Areas, you know, but it doesn't classify into groups, okay. And the thing I want to point out here is that neither of the pictures on the right can be inferred easily from just a picture of the force chains, right? So if we just looked at the particle scale, like who is on a strong force chain, like there is one feature that shows up strongly in all three of these, okay? But it's really tough to guess from the force chains which are going to be the rigid regions, okay? And so this is a place. Rigid regions. Okay, and so this is a place where these two techniques use the mesoscale. They use information from beyond just the particle itself and what its force is to do this calculation. And they reveal a lot richer structure than is available just from the image of individual particles. Okay, and so it suggests these are really what are behind the origins of rigidity. And we shouldn't, and I've been guilty of talking about force chains as being super important and lovely and whatnot. And really, it's not, it's the mesoscale structure. Not and really, it's not, it's the mesoscale structure of those chains that's important. Okay, and so if we watch this in movie form, okay, what you'll see is we shear the system, and now you can see all three pictures together, as you see, shear the system, the force chains develop, okay, and we start to see larger clusters that span the system. This is known as rigidity percolation, by the way, and has a lot of similarities to other percolation problems. Okay. And that throughout the whole process of shearing and unshearing, Of shearing and unsharing, right? The two different ways of calculating where things are going to be rigid are very, very similar to each other. And we can correlate them. So we can look at what fraction of the system was rigid by the two different methods, and shears going one direction is unshears coming back. And they're really, really telling the same story. And so this has been a highly successful project. Okay. And I'm going to. Project. Okay, and I'm going to skip this and go to this. And note that one of the things, this came out of the pandemic. We were doing this while we were on shutdown, was that there's a lot of rigid structures in the world that have holes, right? And if we were to go through and use the clusters, instead of focusing on the clusters, focus on the floppy regions between them, okay? There are large floppy regions. And in fact, in red, those are entire. In fact, in bread, those are entire voids, right? And yet, a system can still sustain stresses, right? It's sustaining it through the other paths, right? And so, this begs the question: what is the relationship between these floppy regions, okay, and where we ultimately are going to see failure, right? Do they have something to do with each other? Okay, so can we use the floppy regions to forecast failure? Okay, and I don't know the answer in granular materials. Okay, we haven't gotten that far yet, okay? But we can see it a bit if we go back to. It's a bit if we go back to the plastic frame, the plastic lattices that we were breaking, okay. And we saw this transition from ductile-like behavior to brittle-like behavior. If we sit right at the middle, okay, so right at this middle point, okay, it looks really different from the others, okay? And in fact, we can also use this pebble game to classify rigid clusters in this system, okay. And if we look at the rigid clusters as a function of how well connected the system is, so this is two. Well, connected the system is so. This is 2.4 is low degree, 3.6 is higher degree. Right, what we see is we actually have a we can see that there's a correspondence that the brittle system has large percolating rigid clusters, okay? And the ductile system has small, really, really isolated rigid clusters, okay? And right at the transition, okay, you see clusters of a bunch of sizes, right? Which is maybe not unexpected. Maybe not unexpected. This looks like a lot of percoation transitions that we see in general, that there are critical fluctuations right at the critical value. But if we look at this picture a little more closely, I can tell you where he broke. So if I, I'm going to skip forward here. If I zoom in on that picture, right, I can actually go back to the movie. Having calculated the rigid clusters in the beginning, I can tell you that these ellipses are where everything broke. Are where everything broke. And it sure looks like they fell along the floppy regions and not along the rigid regions. Okay. And so I don't know if this is what happens in granular materials, but it's definitely a promising tease of something to follow up on. And so we've recently gone back to address this problem in granular materials. Okay, so can we forecast a loss of rigidity in that movie that I opened up with? So this is the one where I was increasing the force. Where I was increasing the force here, and the force chains were strengthening, and then ultimately failed. Okay. And we've gone back to using community detection on this and saying if we cast each of these pictures as a layer in a multi-layer network, and they're all connected along their edges by the forces in those interparticle forces, right? Then can we find communities that stretch forward in time? Communities that stretch forward in time, right? And one possibility is that this strong community here, for instance, might be this pink community here, and it lives forward in time for a long time. It's also possible that those communities break up or they merge. And so we can track those using methods developed by collaborators. And so we're using Jen Luhmann modularity maximization to adjust the spatial resolution gamma and the temporal coupling or strain coupling. Coupling or strain coupling omega to look at how these partition into communities. And this is the work of Fernand Stazelpoor, who just got her PhD in my group. And she's been characterizing the communities she finds with three numbers. So one is size. So just how many particles are in that community. Again, stretched over time. These are multi-layer communities. Strength, so what the average force is. Okay, so these are places that, like we said, Places that, like we said, we have a question of whether or not strong forces are what are leading to rigidity, or is it more about topology? And the second thing is how switchy the communities are. So are they changing from layer to layer? Are they hanging out and being consistent at some point? So she measured all three of these. For, and it's actually not for this movie. It's a different data set where she, this is, again, you're building up torque on the inner wall and then it. Up torque on the inner wall, and then it slips forward. You're building up torque and then it slips forward. So each of these events are one for which she has a high-speed movie. Okay. And she can calculate what all the particles are doing before and the lead up to that event. Okay. This huge image processing, data processing goes to get from here to the next slide that I am leaving out. Okay. And she goes through and she checks to see which Which nodes are in are distinct between the two communities, so that's the delta, and which are shared between the two communities. And that ratio, okay, tells you how volatile it is. So the higher the green is, the more switching is going on, okay? And the lower volatility is, the less switching is going on. Okay. And if she plots that, that's this blue curve up here. And this is, this is preliminary data. Here, and this is this is preliminary data. This is this isn't not published yet. These plots will probably change in the coming weeks as we finalize this. Okay, but what she's seeing is that there is this precursor period where the volatility in the community detection goes up before we actually start to see the failure happen. And so it looks like it's a precursor to that. We are also working with this data to do rigidity pebble gain calculations. Those are not, those don't exist yet, right? So there's lots. Are not those don't exist yet, right? So there's lots going on here. But I like this community detection method because it's actually much easier to calculate than many other methods. And we also can still use it to test some of our hypotheses. So is something going to lose rigidity? Do they involve the largest communities? Do they involve the strongest communities? And the answer is they do not. The answer is that if we try to improve, so that the signal I just showed you is this purple one, right? Just showed you is this purple one, right? There's a nice strong precursor leading up to failure. And if we try to weight the large communities as being more important or the strong communities as being important, the signal actually gets worse, right? And so what this says is that there's, you know, small forces are often stabilizing chain, force chains, right? And this is why a lot of these mesoscale methods are really important. It's not about saying the strongest force is what is controlling the rigidity of the system. Is controlling the virginity of the system. It's not about saying the largest collection of strong forces, it's about saying what is the network of those connections that leads to something having this collective property of rigidity, because rigidity is a collective property. It's not a property of a single grain. So there's more to come in this space as Fernand and I try to finish up these projects this fall. And so now I'm going to tell you why I will not be here after Wednesday. And that's because we want to try this on real landslides. We want to try this on real landslides. And so, since the beginning of the pandemic, and this is not playing as a movie, oh, this is the saddest thing in the world. Let me show you this. This is a landslide in which half this mountain range ends up down in the half this hill slope ends up down in the sea. And this happened in 2017 in a big soar, California. It's an area called Mug Creek. And we've been trying to see if we can use network. We've been trying to see if we can use network techniques to retroactively forecast this failure, okay, and see if we can. And so, Al Handberger is the expert at satellite images who's given us all the data that we're using. And we finally, we were supposed to go out to see the site at the start of the grant three years ago. A pandemic has happened, and we finally got our reservation to actually go to the field station and visit the site on Wednesday, Thursday, Friday this week. So I will be traveling there. Friday this week, so I will be traveling there. But what Vrenda has been doing is taking these same methods that I just talked about, the grains, and applying them to satellite data. So, from satellites, we can get digital elevation model. We can use there's interference techniques for measuring which parts of the hill slope are moving. And she's using community detection to try to see if there are correlations at the mesoscale that tell us that certain areas are ones that are likely to fail. Are ones that are likely to fail in the future. And what she's seeing is that the question that's helpful to ask is to ask which locations have reliable community detection. Okay, and so every color stripe here corresponds to a geographic region on the plot. The white area is the Mud Creek failure, the catastrophic one from 2017, and it's marked in black on here. Okay, and every place that And every place that there's a community is drawn as a blob that's the width. The width of the blob tells you the strength of the community. And so what she's seeing is that there are episodic blobs in other places. Okay. And she's marked a couple regions here. But really, there's one that is showing the most dramatic and reliable community detection. And that's Mud Creek. And that's the one that failed. And in fact, what Okay, and in fact, what triggers each of these events is precipitation. So, one of the things that we're concerned about is that as these extreme weather events that we're seeing, and actually, California is due to have one right now, we're seeing them in Puerto Rico, we're seeing them in Alaska, right? So, as these extreme precipitation events become more common, mudslides like this one are going to become more common as well, right? And so, an ability to forecast regions where the road should be closed and keep people out of harm's way. People out of harm's way would be very beneficial given that the extreme weather events are not going to stop anytime soon. And so here's some snapshots of the community detection. And one of the things that you can see is that things are messy, right? But as we lead up to the time before failure, they start to get a lot more consistent. And we can consistently detect that community. And so Vernda developed a metric, which you may notice is now community persistence and not community volatility. And not community volatility. I do not know why the sign of our answer changed between the lab and the real world. But now, what we're seeing is that the persistence of communities seems to forecast impending doom. Okay, so she measures how persistent a community is, right? So over, you know, in the sort of the two years leading up to the event, it wiggles around a bit and it just climbs dramatically in the two months leading up to that event. Months leading up to that event. Now, we can't predict exactly when it will happen, right? But we can say that we're in an area of possibly increased risk. Okay, and so this is another paper that we are in the process of working out the details on, and I am completely befuddled as to why one is volatility and the other is persistence, that two students working adjacent to each other came up with two different answers, and they both seem to be the right answer for their particular problem. So, that's something I have lots, I would love to talk to that people about. All right, so some conclusions. People about. All right, so some conclusions. Okay, so some really, really general conclusions, right? You can do better predictions if you put more physics into your model, right? But what we're seeing is that simple models can go a long way towards giving us predictions, and they have the benefit of not needing to know the exact interactions, okay? And it really feels like topology is a huge control on these problems. If I wanted to, you know, be a little bit more specific in my Specific in my conclusions, right? I might say that we've been using centrality to identify specific target locations where things are going to happen, right? So these paths that, you know, these highly central paths seem to identify force chain locations and lattice failure locations. So that's a really good tool. We're seeing communities seem to be able to detect the changing character of the stability, rigidity of a system leading up to failure. Leading up to failure, right? And both of those require not much information about the details of the problem. Okay, if we have more detailed information, right, then we can actually see some really cool things that start to get at mechanism. So the Pebble game was able to identify rigid areas in a very similar way to vibrational modes. And we sort of have this hint that they may be classifying regions where those locations might be likely to fail or not likely to fail. And so continued. Are not likely to fail. And so, so continued cross-comparisons among these will hopefully sort of start to make it clear when you want to use one technique and when you might want to use the other. But they're all coming out to show at least some type of success. And the last thing I want to close on is that none of this work would have been possible without my amazing students and postdocs and without my amazing collaborators. But perhaps one of the biggest and most important developments of the last while is. Developments of the last while is the development of open science tools, right? And so we are publishing data from our papers. All of the ways that we get our forces out of those pretty pictures, that's an inverse, a horrible inverse problem that was solved by Jonathan Colmer, and he published that on GitHub. All of the tools for playing the Pebble game and detecting rigidity from vibrational modes, Silica Enke's, our collaborator in Leiden. She has put that on GitHub, right? And then we are getting all. And then we are getting all of our network methods from other people's open source resources. And so I just want to make a huge shout out to everybody who is contributing to these. Thank you so much. And if you want any of our stuff, you know, we are trying to get as much of it online as we can as well, because I think we're all stronger when we share these things ourselves. And with that, I'm going to go back to my pretty pictures from the beginning. Thanks. From the beginning. Thanks. Thank you so much, Gareth. Such an interesting talk. Maybe we'll start with questions online. And I can see those and then repeat them. So we've got questions. Anyone on Zoom have any questions? I think Zara. I think Zara's raising her hand. Oh, go ahead. Yeah, I was wondering what initially inspired you to look at failure in these kind of round particle systems? Okay, so why do I use why the failure or why round? I guess, right, okay.
