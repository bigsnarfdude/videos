So, yes, the next speaker is Joaquin Dobato. He's the director of the bioinformatics area of the Progressive Saloul Foundation. He has previously directed the Computational Genomics Department of Principe Felipe Research Center in Valencia, the Bioinformatics Unit of the CNAO in Madrid, and the Bioinformatics Group of Glaxo-Welcome SA in Trascampos. His other work covers functional genomics and systems biology oriented towards. And systems biology oriented towards personalized medicine, and is currently working on laying the foundations to facilitate the use of genomic data for patients within the health system in Andalusia. So, thank you so much, Joaquin, for being here. You can share your screen. Okay, so thank you. Thank you very much. It's a real pity that I cannot be there to share this excellent meeting with you in this nice place. List. So let me see. I think you can see my screen. Yes. Okay, good. So I'm going to talk to you about, well, maybe the title is a bit click-byte, but the idea is that we can manage to use the bigger. The big amount of data that we have available now to try to learn some biology in terms of connection, functional connection between genes from the data. But once we know very well the context in which this connection happened. So if you have a look at the application of artificial intelligence in health, Artificial intelligence in health, you can see that the most successful applications are related with image, are related with signal analysis, are related with text, etc. And all these data have several properties. One of them is that these are typically data which can be easily encoded for the algorithms. And on the other hand, they have quite simple relationship between the features. So in an image, The features. So, in an image, the relationships are geometrical relationships. So, a pixel is related with the next pixel more related than the pixel in the other corner of the image. And you typically have a lot of data for training. Contrarily, in the case of genomic data, we have a very complex encoding because different questions typically can Different questions typically can have different encoding of the data. The features, the features of the genes, they have complex relationship among them. And even though that we have a lot of data on Earth, a lot of genomic data on Earth, it is very difficult to find data sets large enough to properly train the data. So the relationship between data and the number of features that we... Between data and the number of features that we need to train is not as satisfactory as in the case of images, for example, etc. So I mentioned that different questions require different encodings. What is the main question? The main question typically is definition of phenotype. Typically, we are thinking of a phenotype related to disease. Either disease, Either the disease or their response for a drug or for a treatment, etc. So, in medicine, in personalized medicine, we use this biomarker, which are typically mutations on genes. And these biomarkers are used to provide specific training for specific patients. This is what we call personalized medicine. And actually, they have been. Personalized medicine. And actually, they had been very successful. You can see here it's a not very study from the 90s, from 90s to the 20s, and the progression in survival in cancer. So we have passed from a 50% of survival in cancer overall to almost 70%, which is fantastic. Fantastic. And one major factor in this successful, in this success of the treatment, has been the use of this biomarker. However, these biomarkers, these conventional biomarkers, they are successful, but this success has to do with the probabilistic association with the trial. And this And this association sometimes is modest, and in many cases, lacks the mechanistic relationship with the fundamental cell processes. And we actually know that most tribes are the result of the interaction, the interplay between a lot of genes. So typically calculative genes are in what we call a biological. In what we call a biological module, right? So actually, when we use these biomarkers, we are using the tip of the iceberg of the real process. And actually, there are some multigenic biomarkers that actually take maybe, if not all, the module, part of the module, and actually predict much better phenotype. This is the mammaprine, which is. This is the mammaprine, which is a very famous example of breast cancer decision support test, which is based on the activity of 70 genes. And actually, this paper is very nice because they actually simulate the behavior of one of these modules and demonstrate that the value that they obtain for the activity of the module is more related to the trite, which is in this case is. The tribe, which is in this case, is a patient survival, than the activity of any individual gene. You have to keep in mind that this activity is inferred, it's not measured. You measure the activity of the genes and you infer the activity. So we have this a lot of information on how the genes relate to each other, which are these pathways. The pathways is recompilation of the Recompilation of the knowledge, of the biological knowledge on how genes interact, functionally interact to each other, and how there are cascades of genes which activate to each other, and one gene at the end of this cascade triggers a given function. And there are different repositories, typically extracting this information for different sources. There is one of them is There is one of them is wiki pathways in which people contribute with information, etc. And there are other specific pathways in which you have this information, but especially in the context of diseases. So we have to do to understand how genes relate to each other is to try to understand how the function How the function is triggered by these genes, right? So, if we have a look at this simplified version of the apoptosis pathway, we can see that this, when we have a look at these different sub-pathways or pathways, what we have is the conceptualization of some group of functions, related, for example, in the case of. Related, for example, in the case of apoptosis with cell death. But typically, in this panel, you have both functions. You have cell death, but you have cell survival, because typically you have all the process that goes in both directions. So to understand how a pathway works, you cannot look at the pathway as a whole, because saying that you have a lot of activity of the genes in the pathway means nothing. Of the genes in the pathway means nothing because you don't know if the cell is committing suicide or if the cell is surviving. And pointing to a specific gene is also uninformative because, for example, you look at the gene BAD, which is here involving two of these cell pathways, you can see that it depends very much on the rest of the partners, it can lead to survival or it can. Can lead to survival or it can lead to cell death if the gene is active. But if the gene is not active, there are other ways by which the pathway can go to survival or to sell death. So pointing one single gene is again uninformative. So, what we do is to try to focus on all the genes we trigger the trigger the specific functions and then go backwards until the so essentially going from the right part of the figure to the left part circuit by circuit and we model what happened in the circuits this is an example of there are different ways of modeling this activity this is one of the most successful which is something like very similar to a propagation of probability Propagation of probability in which the values of gene activity are taken as are used to calculate the joint probability of the activity of the circuit. And so we can calculate what is the activity of this circuit. And therefore, in theory, we would have the activity of this specific function in the cell. Interestingly, these models convey causality because essentially what you calculate, what you do is to calculate the activity of the function as a consequence of the activities of the different genes. So if a gene changes the level of activity, it has a consequence on the activity. on the on the activity of the function or not it depends very much on where is the gene and how is the are the other behaving the rest of the genes um let me show you some examples in which we apply this this type of um models to to real data taken from the uh cancer um atlas uh in which they have In which they have a real patient, they have measured the gene expression in the biopsies, and they know what happened with the patient at the end. They have some co-variables, etc. Not a lot, but enough to do the analysis. And you can identify in the cell functions, functionalities which have to do with cancer, like apop. Like apoptosis, like angiogenesis, like replic DNA replication, which means proliferation, or cell addition, which is related to the potential arising of metastasis. You can see that in patients with a high activity of anti-apoptosis, they have a clearly worse prognosis. Patients with a high activity of DNA replication. High activity of DNA replication, they die clearly more than the patient with a lower activity. Patient with low cell adversion die more than the rest of patients. And same with patient with a high angiogenesis. So we can see how we can infer a function which has to do with a phenotype, and the phenotype has a consequence, and this consequence is patient survival, and there is a clear correlation. And that is even more interesting because you can use these models for infer, you can take a condition and you can say what would happen if I knock out this gene. So you take the condition and you put this gene to zero, for example, and you do the comparison and you can see what pathways and what sub-pathways and what sequence are affected. Massibles are affected, and you can calculate the functions which are affected. This is an example in which we infer, we predict what mutations or what inhibition would kill a cancer cell line, a group, experimental group, could confirm our prediction, and we published that in cancer research. So arriving to this point, some Arriving to this point, something which is very easy is: okay, let's try, let's include this relationship between the genes that we already know in the architecture of deep neural level, for example, to try to learn or to predict characteristics. And actually, they work quite well. These deep networks with an architecturally inspiring With an architecturally inspiring biology. But this is only the introduction for the talk, but this is important to put in context. So all these models require of these pathways. And currently, we have only one third of the genome which are part of these pathways, just because we have not generated so much biological knowledge to have all these connections. Have all these connections. So producing one of these arrows is a lot of work because you have to demonstrate that you have to detect what protein is interacting with your protein, what type of interaction is this, and under what conditions, and you have to prove that this is doing this, this interaction is actually what you expect, et cetera, et cetera. Respect, etc. So, the idea would be: so, this is a slow process, an experimental slow process, and it can take years. And actually, we wait for all the genome to be modeled, to be part of this pathway. We could have to expect maybe 50 years or 100 years. We don't have so much time. So, one of the ideas was: would it be possible to use To use some machine learning algorithm to generate this biological knowledge from the data that is using this data on gene expression, for example, to try to learn these arrows. Well, we are in a problem of course of dimensionality, clearly, because we don't have so much data yet to do that from scratch. But it is true that we. But it is true that we could try to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and say, okay, let's not be so ambitious. We are not going to solve all the biology in one shot, but let's try to see if we can manage to relate some proteins, which are interesting for some reason, to the part of the biological knowledge that we already have. That is, to draw one or two, a few. Or two, a few, a few arrows. Obviously, in this example, if this external gene, I don't know if you can see the mouse, but I mean, the gene who has a blue arrow, if we manage to say, okay, this gene is actually affecting this cell function, but probably we cannot go to the detail of what gene. What gene through what gene is doing this action, but I mean, to me, if we can manage to put the big arrow that from this external gene, you know that is affecting the function, to me would be great. So we saw in the middle of the pandemic, we got some money for this project. This project about drug repurposing, right? In COVID. So fortunately, we were part of this consortium, the COVID-19 disease map community, a large community with more than 200 biocurators, modelers, domain experts, etc. in more than 100 institutions in 30 countries. 30 countries. And the idea was to design a very, very detailed map of all any event that happened once the virus infects the body, not only the infection, but all the consequences downstream regarding immunological activation. Activation, etc., etc., the consequences. So they delineate this very detailed map, which is like a very nice pathway. And the idea is, okay, let's use this map, let's model this map and let's try to see if we can predict the activity of this map or power. This map or parts of this map from the activity of other proteins, being these other proteins target for other known drugs. With the idea of if some of these proteins can predict the behavior of the MAP, then probably the drugs against this protein. The drugs, okay, these proteins could act on the map, or in other words, probably they are candidates for drug reporters, right? So we use this training data set, which are approximately 12,000 gene expression profiles from the GTEX project from different orders. So we have a variety of combinations of genes relating among them. And we try. And we tried to see if we can manage to do this prediction using a multi-output random forest regressor using Sharpie additive explanation to try to see what of these features in this case were the most influential over the map. So, in that case, well, these are small examples. Well, this is a small example of some of the results in which you could see that a specific protein, which is target of a specific drug, has a lot of effects in this pathway, which is cell receptors in a limb pathway, whatever, which is related in that case with the immune activity. So we have the detail of where the proteins The proteins which were the more relevant proteins are acting at the level of pathways, and what these pathways are related to what we call the cobalt holy markers. So we have different effects, immune activity, antivirus defense, endocytosis, inflammatory response, et cetera, et cetera. So we can do that. So interestingly, in the model in which we have the paper. In which we have the paper in review, they publish this other paper, which is review of all the trials. It was a review of the trials currently in this moment. It was one year and a half ago. All the clinical trials, testing treatments, and prevention for COVID-19. And interestingly, almost all the drugs that were in testing in this. In testing in this clinical trial, which have a specific target who were predicted by our model. I say that have a specific target because other didn't have a clear target, all the inhalation of gas, so we don't know where it's actually acting over which protein. But all these drugs have a specific target or a couple of targets or whatever. A couple of stars or whatever could be modeled and were modeled by our model, and we could see that so we were more or less on the way. So then what we did was try to say, okay, let's see if some of these drugs can be detected in the patient. So we have here in Andalusia this population health database, which contains all the clinical data for more than 13 years. For more than 13 million patients from Andalusia, there is one month of delay between the moment in which these data are recorded in the hospital and the moment in which they go to the database. So we could follow more or less what was happening during the first wave of CLI. And so we were. So we were checking some of the drugs that were used in this moment. Actually, the first one was this vitamin D, which for some reason that I never understood, but was very popular in our region. So there was high interest in this vitamin D. And we could see that actually we have. That actually we have predicted that vitamin D will have a protective effect, and actually, this is what we see: that there is a clear protective effect. So, we managed to collect a retrospective cohort of more than 16,000 patients and a large number of them, I mean, not very large, but since there were 16,000, there was a large number of them. Actually, the number. Actually, the numbers out there is in the range of 1500 different drugs. They were taking this drug because other conditions that they have before and in the cultural analysis is demonstrated to be protective. Actually, we extend this. Actually, we extend this analysis, and many of the drives that we predicted are, I mean, many, but some of the drugs that we predicted were demonstrated and effect. So the idea was to use this, to use all the co-variables that we already know that could affect the prognosis of the disease and to evolutionary disease. Disease and to evolution of the disease, and try to see if, in the same condition, being a patient which have a prescription of a given drug was better for you or was worse for you. And in some cases, it was clearly protective. So, just for finishing, I always show this slide to my students in the courses, saying, okay, we have Saying, okay, we have made here a whole cycle from the hypothesis to the validation. We model the biological knowledge, we learn with data from data, and we validate with real-world evidence with data. We did all the process without doing any single experiment. We just use data, and but the idea is that. But the idea is that, apart from this, that we managed to find these drugs, these repurposed drugs, is because we know that these dietalids have an arrow directed to the mechanistic map of the disease. So, we have learned this arrow from the data. We have learned biology at the end of the data. Today that and well, that's all for me. And this is part of the group when we could in those times in which we could take a picture all together. And so thank you very much for your attention and I will be happy to take any question you have. Let me see. Okay. Here. Okay, are there any questions from the audience? No. Okay, I have a question. Two actually. So the first is about your studies using the population health database in Andalusia. How your findings can be translated to other health systems, in other region of Spain or in other countries even? Or in other countries, either? Like, how specific of the local, let's say, health system is what you are finding, for instance. I mean, the sound has cut a little bit in the middle of the question, but you say that how is translatable to other if you can, I mean, if what we have concluded can be extrapolated to other regions or to other regions. Exactly, exactly. Like these studies that are based on So these studies that are based on data that comes from local data, like how can they be yeah? Yeah, I mean, the short answer is either no. But, you know, I mean, the more elaborated answer is probably quite well translated, extrapolable. Probably there are, I mean, I was discussing with Sarem Brunak. Discussing with Sorem Brunak because they have similar studies with the database in Denmark. So, probably we are curious in comparing results and probably we'll do at some point because probably I bet that probably there will be differences because of the, you know, because of the food, the weather, social, etc. Probably across Spain will not be very different. Be very different, will not be very different. But in any case, it would be almost equivalent to a randomized clinical trial. If you made the randomized clinical trial here in Spain with Spanish patients, more early, you ask the same question. What would happen with patient in other countries with a different um environment that you are not including in the in the uh in the clinical trial. In the clinical trial, they are different. Yeah. The second question is about the mechanistic models, like it's about the limitations of the mechanistic models. So I was wondering, like, to what extent all those knowledge-based mechanistic models can accommodate for the redundancy that is present in biological systems. Just to give you an example, like, for instance, activated cells produce a lot of interleokines too. Of interlevines to then induce the proliferation of these cells. Now, it's not like the specific interlevin, it's more like the action of many interlevins that are produced. So, like from those graphs, you are actually retrieving like parwise associations, like very specific type of information. But actually, like the biological system are much more noisy and much more redundant. So, like, to what extent those mechanistic models, so precise, can accommodate for what actually seems to. What actually seems to happen in reality? Well, again, the quick questions, I don't know. But again, I would bet that probably, I mean, in our experience, it depends very much on the specific type of study. For example, if we If we deal with signaling and we are working with cancer, which is a disease mainly of signaling, the results that we have got are very, to me, I mean, the first time that we get the result, I was surprised because I didn't expect the model to work so well. As you go to other diseases in which the signaling is not the main component, Is not the main component, you probably need to include other details in the models. And the redundancy is, I mean, is built in the, it should be built in in the model, but again, I don't know. Probably because we go from the simplest application to the more complex application. In the case. In the case of cancer, they work very well from a practical point of view. Okay, okay. Thank you so much. If there are no other questions. Yes, one. Please. Baklene, this is Sushmita. I was wondering a philosophical question that what you were saying that you try to make sense of Try to make sense of, let's say, at the gene level, then do the pathway and all that. But in the presence of multi-ionics data, suppose we just feed in gene, data, protein, data, metabolomics data. Of course, to run any model, you have to do the dimension reduction. But however, at the end of it, we will get some result. And then try to explain this in the context of. This is in the context of system biology. Is that a better approach, or just dig as much as you can in one platform and try to translate that into another platform of molecular data? Yes, it's philosophical. Well, I mean, again, I'm very practical in terms of the application that we terms of the application that we developed. And we were very centered around gene expression. Why? Because gene expression is quite, I mean, it's very cheap to obtain. There are a lot of gene expressions that are. Obviously, everyone is now talking about multi-omics. Actually, some omics are a bit redundant. But to accommodate other omics like Other omics, like, I mean, probably if we could measure proteins instead of protein activity instead of gene expression, I would go obviously for protein activity because we are using gene expression as proxies of protein expression, as proxies of protein activity. So, we are using proxies of proxies. But this is because this is the data that we have. This is because this is the data that we have and this is available and cheap, etc. You can use also metabolites, but we don't have metabolites in the model. We are working on that, but you should use also metabolic pathways and we should take into account that some of these metabolites are activating or they are activated. Activating or the activating genes. So, are at the same time activators and deactivators? And you have another problem for the model on top of that. We don't know, I mean, we know how measured genes organs genes. You can say, okay, this gene is up, this genus up, they are producing at the same. But I don't know if we normalize genes and we normalize. genes and we normalize metabolites if zero choma5 in genes is same as zero chroma five in metabolites. I don't know how to align the scales. So there are still a lot of problems for this for this and you need to model that more. And I don't know if I have answered your question. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, so we thank again Dr. Johan and Joaquin Dobato and thank you. Thank you.
