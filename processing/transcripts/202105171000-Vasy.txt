Motivation is um wave equation asymptotics, uh in particular um black hole curve uh space-time times. And but you know, these are already interesting, and in fact that's going to be the focus of the talk in actual sort of straight just Euclidean phenomena. And so concretely, um, a question is whether um one can phrase the uh what's called the limpting abduction principle, which I will get to in a moment, as a platform problem. A moment as a platform problem. And the structure of this talk will be that I will talk about Euclidean problems and the geometric generalization at the beginning. And then this shouldn't take too long, and then talk about the microanalysis. And probably I won't really have time to talk about the low energy limit, but we'll see. But there are sometimes miracles. But I do want to spend a couple of minutes on curves based. Of minutes on Kerr space-time as in part as a motivation for this and to make some remarks connecting exactly what part of what I talk about is relative to that analysis. So I'm not going to do justice to the GR. So I have slides that I'm just going to sort of go through quickly, but I do want to emphasize the connection on the one hand and also what's involved. On the other hand, I don't want to get too distracted by it. So I think you should be able to actually. I think you should be able to access the slides later on so you can read them more leisurely later on. So, anyway, the basic thing is: so, curved spacetime is just a family of Lorentzian metrics on a very nice and simple manifold. So, just a real line and a time variable, and then a half-line, a radial variable across the sphere. And so, again, they're just the metric depending, we're not a metric depending on two parameters. And so, you should think of this t as some sort of So if you think of this t as some sort of time function, there's also something Euclidean. And the stability question is what happens when you perturb. So this is going to be you are solving Einstein's equation, which is a nonlinear wave equation after suitable efforts. And the basic stability question is what happens if you perturb initial data. Okay? Like, do the solution check this globally, how they become, behave asymptotically, etc. So again, I'm going to skip most of Etc. So, again, I'm going to skip most of these things. So, again, just think of like p equals zero, it's where you pose initial conditions. So, this is a nonlinear problem, various complications. In the case of a positive cosmological constant, that's where you don't have this duplete and infinity. The nonlinear result is known. That was my work with Peter Hintz in 2016. And the lambda equals zero is a very degenerate limit that, however, it of course. That, however, is a focus of a lot of people's works. In particular, relatively recently, Clymer and Schapter and even more recently, Dr. Emoswitze, Garonyansky, and Taylor have partial, I mean, more and more general as time goes on, stability results in this nonlinear setting. The only general results at this point, so there are some extra assumptions, the only fully general results are in the linearized version. And so that's what I talk about directly. That's what I talk about directly relates to. And again, it's messy because of lots of things going on. But I just want to show you what the theorem looks like. So this is the Ditches, Hefner, and Geter hints. So you have linearized perturbed initial data, which is like a metric and a second fundamental form on an on the initial hypersurface. On the initial hypersurface, which are supposed to decay in some ways and have some regularity, and then you ask how the solution of the linearized equation behaves. And the statement is that it's asymplotic to an infinitesimal perturbation of the curved space-time, that's the G B dot B dot, plus a lead derivative, which is to say plus an infinitesimal diffeomorphism. So this already shows some of the difficulties. So, this already shows some of the difficulties going on, going happening here. The family, that's this GB dot. So, it's not just a single family that you have converging to, there's a dithyomorphic unimarium that gives you a little bit of a headache by this lead derivative that somehow you might have to change coordinates, and then there's something that decays at some polynomial rate. Now, the part that I maybe wanted to say all this is to make the connection. Mainly wanted to say all this is to make the connection. So, this is the key analytic ingredients is what I talk about: the Fredholm theory and various aspects of it. So, technically, rather than thinking of time, as I had before, it's actually better to think of basically P minus R or slightly more modified. And basically, the way you reduce, right? And basically, the way you reduce, right, how do you reduce to a scattering problem, Euclidean problem, the Fourier transform in time? So it's this T minus R will show up in a conjugation later on, the analog of that. So I will only talk about scalar problems, but the extension to systems is straightforward, so it's not an issue. The issue, I mean, that's usually the situation. Some of the systems have a scary reputation, but there really is nothing scary about them. What is annoying is the. Annoying is the additional degeneracies caused by the very non-trivial zero energy null space. So in fact, the Skirr paper from which I quoted the theorem is much longer than the sum of the two papers doing the sort of analytic background that I talk about in the rest of this lecture. So, okay, so that was just a very quick and I'm sure way too quick I'm sure way too quick discussion of GR application, but I just want to put this in its place while I talk about it. So I really talk about scattering theory. So use your Schrodinger operator, so it's a Laplacian of a metric plus a potential. And so for starters, just think about the Euclidean metric, G0, and then perturb it. So G is a metric on a Riemannian metric on Rn. Metric on Rn so that it differs from this Euclidean metric by something that's decaying, and then add the potential, which is a negative order symbol, and make it real or make its imaginary parts decay a bit faster if you really want to have an imaginary part. I should say for the actual curve applications, there's some other things you have to add, like a first-order term, but I mean, which depends on the spectral parameter, blah, blah, blah, but that doesn't really play any role in the analysis. So, anyway, the So anyway, so let's just concentrate on this Euclidean picture. And so I think everybody knows symbols, right? You differentiate, you get decay. So here it's in spatial variables that you think they will symbolic behavior. And so let's just rephrase it in the way that Richard would like us to rephrase it, which is to say that if you apply vector fields that are linear vector fields, so they are Field, so they are calling it Z on these sublab spaces. Okay, and of course, it's a very long history. So, I'm only really listing here the zero energy limit history in this context. In particular, Jensen and Kato started this as far as I know in a systematic way, although I'm sure that in concrete cases, there's quite a bit of work before. And maybe the main thing is. And maybe the main thing I should relate to is that mentioned in connection to this meeting is the earlier work, so roughly a decade and a bit ago, of Guillar Muhessel and Sikora, who constructed this limiting absorption principle resolvent in a uniform way. So parametrized construction down to Down to zero energy. So, what I'll talk about is sort of a Fretome estimate version rather than a parametrics construction version of what they did. All right, so I just stated everything in the Euclidean setting. So, one question is: what sort of structures are involved? And so, one way to address this. So, one way to address this is what does it generalize to? And so, what it generalizes immediately to is asymptotic cone. So, right, a cone is just if you have a cross-section, which is a Riemannian manifold, it's simply the metric dr squared plus r squared times h, where h is the Riemannian metric on the cross-section. And so, the Euclidean spaces case, this is just a sphere, conover sphere, standard sphere, but you can do the same sort of things more generally. Things more generally, and in fact, you can locally identify your conic cross-section with subsets of the sphere, and so do a corresponding conic identification with cones or asymptotic cones in Euclidean space and basically move things over. So, I think this is already played a big role. I mean, one part of how. One part of how Richard introduced this geometric scattering theory in the early 90s, this identification. So you can also think about this straight compactified. You don't have to, right? Because you can just think of this identification using the conic structure to move between sort of coordinate charts on the cross-section and the sphere. But you can also think about it in a direct and compactified way. Directly compactified way. So, just the same way as in Rn, you replace R by its reciprocal, and then this is what the conic metric looks like. So, this would be a warp product type scattering metric as Richard defined it. So, one question then is, can you make these function spaces more precise? For example, can I make an actual invertibility statement? Invertibility statement. So the important thing about fatal and invertible statements is that they are necessarily sharp. Like you cannot just change the domain or the target space. So in the way I had it before, in the nitty-gritty principle, there's this L and L prime, the decay orders, and they had to satisfy some inequalities sort of independently. And I could sort of move them around. So there's some free. So, there's some freedom in that. And also, in that case, there was no difference between the domains and target spaces for this plus I0 and minus I0 limits. And on the other hand, these two inverses, of course, differ. I mean, they give rise to the spectral measure. So, you really, if you want to have an actual invertibility theory, you must have different domains and target spaces for these two. For these two inverses. So, a natural question is: what are they? And so, for this, it's actually useful to, I mean, again, this is a long tradition in scattering theory to rewrite the spectral parameter as a square. So lambda is sigma squared. And then let me just, so I already had the lambda picture, right? So we're zero, this is the complex plane in lambda, and then we're doing this plus minus i zero limits. So instead, if you write lambda sigma squared and declare that imagine part sigma positive. That imagine part sigma positive is the physical half-plane that corresponds to the slit complex plane in lambda, then you get a picture like this here: zero. So this is the complex plane in sigma. And then you are always approaching the real line from above. So the two arrows in the lambda plane correspond to these two arrows in the sigma plane, approaching negatives of, I mean, the two points are negatives of each other here. I mean, the two points are negatives of each other here. And then the limit is then this plus i zero limit. So plus i epsilon inverse limit of this operator p, where now I just rename this spectrum of timely into p sigma by just subtracting this sigma squared from the Schrodinger operator. Okay, and then so just to reiterate, Just to reiterate, we have this existence of this limit of this linguistic absorption principle. And again, it's not a sharp estimate, even though it is sharp in the scale of the weighted Sobolev space. So you cannot certainly improve this in the weighted Sobolev scale space scale. But I mean, the point is that they're just not a satisfactory scale. So I think in math, you do this a lot that something is optimal, but it's optimal within the world that one is talking about. And it, of course, it might just be a competitive. Talking about, and it of course it might just be a completely wrong world. So, um, so one really has to think about this a little bit more. Now, one way to see this is that there's a so the loss of decay is strictly bigger than one. And you don't really expect that. So, in fact, the phenomenon, the underlying phenomenon, is the same as what happens to hyperbolic PDE relative to elliptic ones. You lose one derivative there. So, here you should lose one order of decay. One order of decay relative to the elliptic estimates, like what happened off the spectrum. So that would be exactly one loss. So I'm not sure. Okay, so let me, I hope that this. Okay, so I don't know what's going to happen here. So I was just asked for some permission, but let's hope it works. I think I'm just going to keep going. Oops. Going. Oops. Sorry. All right. Let's hope that it will keep going. All right. So another thing that what you would like to do is to have a more precise description of the output of this inverse for well-behaved input. So for example, we'd like to see outgoing spherical waves. So they are like exponentials e to the i sigma r or e to the i sigma over x times something. That's what the spherical waves are supposed to be. Time, something that's what the spherical was supposed to look like, and so you suppose you would like to have a description that that uh uh sort of matches this, and so I will often use um replace r by rho and for notational reasons. I want to use the r for like decay orders and things like that. So, uh, so from now on, rho will be the radial variable, all right. So, so that was sort of the introduction to the problem, uh, and then uh now on to the actual micro. Now, on to the actual microlocal analysis. And for this, the fundamental reason that we have this trouble of the non-sharp estimates, I mean, sharp on the Sobola scale, but just the wrong scale, is that we are not taking into account the phase space behavior. So we just do these weighted spaces with weights that are just based in the position space. In the position space, and that's not very satisfactory. And to see what one should do is to think about, is to consider scattering differential operators, of which this is an example. So this class, which I'm going to call PSIML here, I suppose, was introduced by Maros, but it has a long history going back to Schubin and Parenti. Back to Schubin and Parenti in sort of non-geometric settings, like I'm phrasing it right now. And of course, it's one of Hermander's Weil calculi. I'm not phrasing the Weyl calculus here. And so the point is that here you take amplitudes, which are A, which have like the usual kind of property in the momentum variable zeta. Like if you differentiate, you get more decay, but they have a matching property in the position variable z. So it's a product type symbol. Z. So it's a product type symbol in this sense. And so if you differentiate Z, get decay in Z, differentiate in Zeta, get decay in Zeta. Part of the reason for this, if you just think about the class of coefficients I introduced for the Laplace and the perturbations of the Laplace, like what kind of a metric it is, et cetera, or potential. So exactly this symbolic estimate. So that's exactly what Cora's. Symbolic estimate. So that's exactly what corresponds to that. So it's like coefficients, the coefficients themselves are symbols. And then, of course, you might have some. So for differential operators, we have polynomials in zeta with symbolic coefficients. And then you quantize these as a usual way, as a interpreted as an oscillatory integral. And then, so, so the thing to keep in mind is that these form an algebra with the An algebra with the orders behaving properly so they get added on their composition and also closed under adjoints. But just as important as just this straight algebra property, it's important that you can actually do computation. So modulo trivial, which in this case may order minus infinity in both senses, operators, you can actually compute what this complex. Actually, compute what these compositions give. And so, for example, to leading order in both the zetas, that was momentum and z, that's position decay, the composition of two operators, so namely operator corresponding to A and the operator corresponding to B, is just the operator corresponding to AB. And then the class of A, where you quotient out by symbols that are one order lower now, both in position and the momentum, is the principal symbol. And you say the operator is invertible if the The operator is invertible if the symbol is invertible. And then the other thing gets important that these sub-differential operators give you continuous linear maps between sub-L spaces with the order shifted as appropriate. And so in fact, you could define the weighted sub-LF spaces as tempered distributions for which when you apply to this an elliptic pseudo differential operator of the Differential operator of the correct order, so the matching order, the result is in L2. And this will, in fact, be play a role in a moment. And the algebra, two differential operator algebra, will transport to asymptotic cones just like the Sobolev spaces in differential operators. So just use this, you know, identify coordinate charts in your cross-section so that corresponds to the. So that corresponds to the boundary, if you can factify it, with pieces of the sphere, and everything just transforms, or you could do it in a different, sort of more sort of fully geometric microanalysis way by doing blow-ups, but you don't need to. Okay, this would be the scattering operator, two-differential operator. All right, so now the point is that the operator would really like to look at. The operator would really like to look at. So, I'm just going to write down some explicit things for the Euclidean Laplacian, but it's, you know, by the I'm going to change anyway in a moment to sort of a radial versus spherical variable decomposition, and then it directly extends to the full generality I'm talking about. So, the principal symbol of the Laplacian minus the spectral parameter squared is just zeta squared minus sigma squared, right? So, zeta is just usual. Squared right so zeta is just usual momentum variable in Euclidean space. And the issue is that, so here we have to quotient out by one order of decay both in zeta and in z. And of course, this is independent of the z variable. So everything matters. And so in particular, this is not elliptic when sigma is real for certain finite zeta, so the sphere of radius sigma. Of radius sigma. So these should be as the position goes to infinity. And this is not exactly surprising. I mean, one way of thinking about it in the actual Euclidean problem is just conjugate by the Fourier transform. So then the role of the position and momentum interchanges, and what happens to this operator becomes a multiplication operator by zeta squared minus sigma squared, which Sigma squared, which is not the base variable zeta, and you know, it's a modification operated by something that vanishes. So, of course, it's not elliptic. But the principal symbol is real. And so, as usual for wave equations, we expect propagation within the characteristic set. Any questions so far? Okay, so I think I. Okay, so I think I have a picture. Yes, here it comes. So this is the picture of the characteristic set. So this 2 and μ are, so I think it's on the next slide, yes. So I'm writing out, I'm going to go back to the picture in a moment. I'm writing covectors, so there are zeta times dz in terms of this radial decomposition. So remember, dx over x squared is minus d rho. Uh, minus the rho, and one over x is just rho. So, this is just the standard sort of polar spherical decomposition. Um, and then the uh so to and mu are the corresponding components, so to is the radial component and mu is the spherical component, and then the dual function is just to squared plus mu squared, and then the principal symbol of the operator is just to squared plus mu squared minus sigma squared, since I still had that sigma squared subtracted. So, going back. That sigma squared subtracted. So going back, this is the picture. So this is just the sphere, to squared plus mu squared equal to sigma squared, and it's only at infinity, so at x equals zero in the compactified space. And then the next thing we'll want, as I mentioned, is what is the structure of the Hamilton flow? So this is what Richard analyzed in his paper where he introduced this class of problems. And so the structure will be is that there's a there's a Will be that there's a source manifold and the sink manifold. So keep in mind that I'm not showing the cross sections. I'm showing the quote whole unquote fiber of the cotangent bundle, the momentum variables, right? But I'm not showing the cross, this physical space cross-section, which I will call, I think, Y variables. And because, you know, there's only so much I can show. And so the structure of the flow is that there's a source. Structure, the flow is that there's a source and there's a sink, and then the Hamilton flow will go from the source to the sink like this. Okay, so that's going to be the structure. So let me just go to the next slide, which will say exactly this. So within the character, just like for wave equations, you will look at the Hamilton flow, right? So the Hamilton flow of the principal symbol while made into homogeneous something. Well, made into homogeneous something homogeneous the right degree or re-normalized so it extends non-degenerately to the boundary. That's another way to put it. So that's our Hamilton vector field. And then, as I said, it has this source sink structure. And the other thing I want to point out. Another thing I want to point out is that the source and the sink are really the phase-space location, so where, say, the wavefront set lies, of these sort of spherical waves. So the exponential factor in the spherical waves, this e to the minus i sigma times r, or e to the rho, I should say now, and e to the i sigma times rho, or over x instead. And moreover, these. And moreover, these two differential operators, x dx squared, which is basically, so this is minus d rho, right? And the spherical derivatives, so minus d rho plus or minus or plus, the spectral parameter actually annihilates. So all the exciting behavior in terms of spherical waves that you see in scattering theory corresponds to. In scattering theory, correspond to this source and sink manifold. Okay, so now away from the source and the sink, Hermander's propagation singularity theorem applies. So here put as propagation of estimates. And so it actually reduces to the standard one by the Fourier transform, but so in this in the full generality here was proved by. Here was proved by Merrows. And right, so it's basically you can propagate estimates along the Hamilton flow. So you can control something somewhere, in this case, in this B1 region, by controlling it earlier, maybe in a slightly bigger region, that's this B2 region, and of course controlling PU in the sort of union of these two regions. And there's a sort of trivial remainder here. And I made the differential orders just asterisks because they don't matter for this. They don't matter for this. Everything's happening at finite zeta. Okay. And then what happens at the source and the sink that you get a similar estimate. But the amazing thing is that, and so this again played a key role in Richard's work on sort of microconalysis of scattering theory. If you are in a In a space. So that's R is the decay order, which is strictly bigger than minus half. So here's my estimate. So R is the decay order. If it's strictly bigger than minus half, which is sort of borderline corresponding to spherical waves, then in fact, you can cross out this B2U term. So that means you get an estimate. It looks like an elliptic estimate, except there's a shift by one order from R in terms of B1U and R plus 1 in terms. B1u and R plus 1 in terms of B3PU. Okay, so while if R is less than minus half, so below this threshold regularity, you can propagate estimates to the radius. So to the sources or sync. So this L here is my source sink manifold. And the statement is that if I'm in a space of weight strictly bigger than minus one half, I get the free. Strictly bigger than minus one half, I get the free estimate around it. If I'm in a space of order strictly less than minus one half, then if I control things away from but near L, then I can propagate it to L, including L. So now the basic issue is that in order to get Fretlum estimates, we need estimates. Uh, Fretwom estimates, we need estimates both for both p and p star, and not just on any spaces, on spaces that are dual to each other in the appropriate uh matching. And so, what uh in order to get an estimate for either one of these, either at the source or the sink, you will need high regularity because you know that's what gives you a free estimate. So, propagation is always like you know, something somewhere and then you know it's somewhere else. But uh, here you, you, I mean, but how do you start? And so, the only How do you start? And so, the only way you can start in this sub is by having a better than threshold regularity at either the source or the sink, which gives you a free estimate, quote unquote. And then you can propagate it until you get close to the sink. And there you can propagate into the sink once you make, or the source is already going, once you make the decay order low enough. So, what this means is that Is that so? If you have high regularity somewhere, so you could, of course, say, why not just have high regularity everywhere? It sounds lovely. I can just get the free estimate everywhere. But of course, when you dualize, that means lower regularity for the adjoint operator, and that would be a disaster. So what this means is that you get to decide at either the source or the sink. So let's say we decide at the source, we have high regularity, but that means we should have low regularity at the sink so that when you take adjoints, for the adjoint problem, we have a high regularity there. We have a high regularity there, but in order to do this, of course, the decay order needs to become variable. So it's something we have to deal with, but that's not really a problem. So these variable order or so-called anisotropic subola spaces go back to circa 70, the work of Unterberger and Deutschermat and others. And basically, you can just define them using the same definition as I mentioned for the usual weighted sub-Space. Dimension for the usual weighted sub spaces, choosing two-dimensional operators. So, here I don't have to make the s variable, so I'm not going to, just so I want to say more. But I'm making the decay order R variable. So, I'm making, and the way you do this is just introduce a homogeneous, make it the homogeneous degree zero function in the Z variable. So, of whatever you want. So, for example, you could do So, for example, you could do as a concrete example, you could do something r equals minus half plus or minus some constant times, and this would work actually for this particular problem, something like this would be, so this is near, since I put this near zeta equals sigma. In the elliptic set, it doesn't matter what it is. So, that would be an example of such a variable order. Such a variable order. And again, it's the same thing as usual for microcanalysis. We're talking about what happens when z goes to infinity, or I just compactified, so it doesn't like z equals zero is not an issue. All right, and then the theorem is that, in fact, this spectral family is invertible, and so in particular frat horn between two of these variable-order Sobolev spaces. Sobolef spaces where the orders are shifted appropriately with a slight twist that you need sort of a graph norm and the domain. So the map, I mean, this P is not going to map HSR to HS minus 2R plus 1 because it's not going to give you the extra decay. So you have to put this into the domain. But so this is a very nice, sort of quasotropic really function space. And for example, I mean, how nice it is, one way to capture it. How nice it is, one way to capture it, and of course, it's fine from the Hilbert space perspective, but it's also fine in a sense that strongly mirrors, which is to say that something like short functions are actually dense in it. Basically, because how do you show this? You regularize and that gives you a commutator and commutators in true band order. So if I put r plus two in place of r plus one, I wouldn't be so lucky. And so what I need here is that this r has to satisfy my inequalities and be monotone along the Hamilton flow. And then I have this estimate. Estimate. Okay, so the point here is that you, this is not now a limiting absorption principle kind of statement. So there's no limit. It's an actual, you say that this operator is actually invertible between two spaces. And notice that the distinction between the two limits, the plus size and the minus size limits, come from deciding whether R is big, so it's bigger than threshold regularity. It's bigger than threshold, regularity minus half at the source or at the sink. And that's what distinguishes these two inverses. And the other thing to note is that we can actually make R high everywhere, except in a small neighborhood of the, say, the sink. And that's a bit annoying because shouldn't we be able to do it everywhere? I mean, we like to say that the output is nice everywhere except at the sink. So this is where second. So, this is where second microlocalization comes in. And so, informally, what you do is you just blow up the phase space. And so, a version of this goes back to Bonnie in the 80s. So, here's the blow-up picture. So, this is the same characteristics, I think. So, here's what my source and then blowing up the sink. And the point is, and so here's my Hamilton flow. So, this is the front face of sink blown up. Up. So the point is that now I will get to have a new order, like decay order, a separate one corresponding to this front face from what was just the previous decay order. So I get a new index to play with. So again, we blow up this sigma manifold, creates a new hypersurface, and then Hypersurface and then the orders now arise from the orders at this various boundary hypersurfaces, of which now there are three. There's the momentum goes to infinity, there's the position goes to infinity, but not in this front phase, and there's this front phase. So this, let's call this new front phase behavior the B decay for a reason that will become transparent in a moment. And then beforehand, this general scattering decay. And then the statement is that. Uh, the statement is that that, uh, so the point is that now we can have that the scattering decay order, so that's not corresponding to the state of source where we have to make things high, can be bigger than minus a half as you want. It's a, it's, I mean, as big as you want a trillion. And at the same time, we can have the decay order low, so say less than minus a half, so worse than threshold at this front phase. And if you do this, you get a nice, again, a nice frat home problem. So invertible. Nice fratome problem, so invertible problem in this Sobolev spaces. So, in the last few minutes, let me just be a slightly more precise about this second micro-localization, so how this comes about. So, what you can do is to conjugate the operator by this exponential, basically removing the spherical wave asymptotics to make things a little bit more familiar, or that this conjugation. All that this conjugation does in terms of phase space, it slightly rearranges this. So replaces toe by toe minus sigma, leaving everything else unchanged. And so the new principal symbol just so I can change the variables, basically. And this is the picture of the characteristics that you just shifted it. So again, this is now the source. This is the sink, and you have the flow. You shift it up the sphere. All right. And And uh, so I just think about the moment what we are doing. So, so now the uh the um the sync was moved to the zero section. So, what you want to do is uh to blow it up. And so, what does that do? Well, you can think of it as introducing projective coordinates. So, they are just, well, you're blowing up to equals zero, mu equals zero, x equals zero. So you get to over x and mu over x. But why are these? Well, tau was the principal symbol of x squared dx, and mu was the symbol of x dy. x dy. So this to B just corresponds to x dx and mu b to d y. So these are exactly the tangent to the boundaries, I B vector fields. And so this lets us think about phase space in a different way. It's really what we have really is a B phase space. And what we do is blow, so this is again the picture. So again, this was the source. This is now the front face, and this is the flow. And what we do is a different way of thinking about this is that this front face is really the B cotangent bundle over the boundary. I'm going to call it X mySpace. And the original boundary, so where 2 and μ are finite and non-zero, will correspond to the B cotangent variable going to infinity. To infinity. And let me just, I think I have a picture of that as well. So here's from the picture from the B cotangent bundle perspective. So this is like the fiber left is the fiber compactified. So compacted the fibers as well. And I'm just blowing up the corners. And these corners, this is where to mu finite non-zero. That's where they sit. And so the point is now that Now, that you can use all the BSU differential operator algebra machinery of MAROS to be good symbol calculus, except, of course, now you get a normal operator rather than as well, rather than just this symbolic behavior. And so then you have to analyze this. So that's where, but it's going to be super simple. It turns out to be this first order differential operator basically giving you. Operator, basically giving you the overall sort of decay factor in the spherical waves. Can I have like one more minute, Richard? Yep, go for it. All right, so let me skip the normal operator discussion. Just wanted to say that I can go back to some of the ones who asked me about it. But so the high-energy version, so when sigma goes to infinity, it's just the usual semi-classical rescaling. The diagram is the low. The delicate thing is the low energy version, so sigma goes to zero. And for that, you really need to do an extra resolution because of a degeneracy, basically a normal operator. And so I'm not going to actually say what the estimates you get and then the full sort theorem for this. I just want to show you this picture of what you end up doing. So you end up blowing up. So, you end up blowing up. So, the left is the easier thing. So, you just think in the little B picture, because after all, this scattering phase space was just an extra blow up, is one way to think about it. Blow up the corner. So, here is the B phase space, but you blow up in this the corner x equals zero, sigma equals zero. So it's a B phase space parametrized by this variable sigma. And then if you want to do the full sort of scattering behavior up here, Behavior appears, you also blow up now the corner where basically the sigma x is on the top. So where you're at fiber infinity and at the in the B sense and at the band area. And so that's the place where you can do basically a completely analogous and now non-degenerate micro-local analysis. So I think I skip this and just say thank you very much. Thank you very much, Andras. I don't know, yeah. Does anyone have any questions? Don't have the usual Zoom delicacy. Speak up if you have questions, please. Andraj, what did you want to say about the normal operator? Thank you. I didn't give him plant the air. All right. So it's just this. Just this. Let me just go back one more. So, this is the conjugated operator looks like, right? So, originally, it had these two squares, the flash and minus a sigma squared, modulo things that you sort of ignore. And the conjugation just added this minus two sigma x squared dx. There's one more relevant term that is sort of one order lower in the scattering sense, this in minus one over two x. Max, but it's actually important for this B, a new B change, the change in this new B world. So, what happens from this B perspective, the first two terms, this x squared dx and x dy squared, they are actually order x squared. So they are, you know, well, they are order x squared. But this extra term, this first order operator is just order x and both terms, they're order x. So they're the same size. So that's what it is. The b normal operator is just this first order. The B normal operator is just this first-order differential operator. And so now, what this means, so just think about what you do with B analysis. Well, eventually you do something like you want to do a Marion transform. So maybe rehomogenize and then want to do a Marion transform. So of course it works out beautifully. So if you take into account the weights, like we are working relative to this metric L2 space rather than the L2 space rather than the B L2 space, that's what the normal operator becomes. It's sigma times to B minus I over 2. So the option is that this is going to give you invertibility as long as you are not borderline, which means that the decay order is not minus a half. So that's the final bit. So you get, in terms of estimates, you get the usual problem. Estimates, you get the usual propagation estimates in the sort of scattering sense, so on the lift of the original boundary, and then you get a normal operator estimate. And as you can see, it becomes degenerate as sigma goes to zero because of this extra fact exposed factor of sigma, hence the extra work in the low energy limit. Nice, thank you. Anyone else have a question? I had a question, Andras. So, when you're doing this second micro-localization, you blew up the sink at the boundary. And presumably, you could have blown up the source as well. Is this choice just based on sort of whether you're propagating your estimates along or against the flow? Or is there something else? Yeah, so the thing is that what you so if you have that, you want to have an as precise result. Is you want to have an as precise result as possible for what happens, and you have a very nice input. Then you want to have your function spaces sort of as nice as possible. And so here the choice was to make the high. So in other words, you want to have the high regularity in as much of the space as possible. So it's going to be everywhere except where you have a force to have low regularity. Of course, dually, everything is reversed. So dually, in most of the places, Reverse. So, dually, in most of the places, you have low regularity. It's not that you escape that. So, you really, at the end of the day, you have both. But for the sort of direct problem, for actual mapping properties of the inverse, this sort of optimizes in some sense the strength of it. And this actually really made it quite a lot easier to deal with the, I mean, these sort of very strong results rather than just having variable orders, made it much easier in the actual curve work to. In the actual curve work to deal with the zero energy nodes space. Thank you. Okay, anyone else? So Andreas, this was clearly what Bonny actually wanted to do. But if you think of it in terms of traditional scattering theory, I mean, what you're doing is somehow mixing the spherical wave. Spherical wave and the coefficients in some sense. You have the expansion coefficient of the spherical wave. Have you sort of thought of writing down what this says about it precisely? I mean, so you're giving, of course, low regularity. It would be interesting to see what it says about the expansion. But the actual terms, the expansion. Yes. Yeah, no, I have not thought about this. Yeah, no, I have not thought about this. But indeed, as you say, this is, I mean, somehow, this is the funny thing, in some ways, the usual second micro-localization is really best phrased as the Fourier transform of this. So in some funny way, if Bonnie had been thinking about scattering theory, it would have been a bit cleaner, in fact. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. In fact, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree. So, I mean, it makes it almost the traditional B calculus this way around, as opposed to some transformed version of it. Yeah, micro-localized version of it. Well, very interesting. So, if maybe I just say one, maybe I just say one more thing, which is that one funny thing is that, so, so one can wonder, okay, so if you look at the quantization maps in the in the B algebra versus the scattering algebra, so like, what's Scattering algebra. So, what's the gain here by thinking of it as a scattering lambda B problem or is a scattering problem? So, the difference is that, I mean, in both cases, the sort of quantization maps are really supposed to represent what near the diagonal. In the scattering world, like in Rn, right, you just get away with everything, like not having to worry about anything because you have this nice rapid decay as you go away, like Z minus the prime M minutation would be going away from the diagonal. But in the B world, things are. The B world, things are not quite so good. So, you really put in a cutoff. So, this cutoff in the quantization map is what really makes all the difference. So, that's why the naive, like trying to just think of as psychomaticalization as just having singular symbols is a headache. Because one is somehow trying to trying to think yeah, exactly. I mean, it's been a headache. And that's basically why, because you really are forcing something to be global that should not be global. To be global, that should not be global, right? Yeah, I mean, so you haven't really got a classical calculus here, I suppose. Um, I mean, you could presumably get one, but you wouldn't get a calculus with bounds. I mean, that normally comes about exactly because those cutoffs tend to have global effects when you take the free transfer. Right. Yeah. It would be nice to have a classical calculus as well as the estimates that you've got. Estimates that you've got, but maybe not worth the trouble for you. Okay, anyone else? So it's now five minutes, so we'll start again.
