Okay, so great pleasure to announce Maria Lilia Saladara for the afternoon session. She will speak about relative tomology for re-art points and how to compute their characteristic classes. Thank you. So thanks the organizers for the invitation. It's a pleasure to be here. So I will talk about something that I'm thinking about. I'm thinking for a while and that hopefully will be a fortune collaboration with DeCa. So for those that were in the abed, so I explained the part of the glupoid part and now I want to explain the agebroic part, which must be easier. So I will tell you something like some pure. Some few results, but I really want to focus on the techniques which makes this topic very easy to understand and very geometric, and give some very nice explanation of the algebraic part that appears when looking at the cohomology of relative homology shift for algebraids. Okay, so just some background and motivation. So if we look at the algebras, so the story is somehow classical and we know. So you can start with a Lie group G and a Lie subgroup K. So groups. Then here we have the Lie algebras. Okay, and then we have the contained complex for the cohomology of G relative to K or the Lie algebra K or the Lie group K, which is a subcomplex of the Chevalier L number complex of J. And we have this inclusion. And we have these inclusions. So this will be the one for Delie algebra relative to Belie algebra K, and this is the one relative for the Delie group. Okay? And the definition is, well, you take the intersection intersection of the k horizontal quark with the k divided quark. So this means that you take a form on g, right? And k horizontal means that whenever you plug in a vector on k, this must be zero. And invariant means that it's invariant with respect to the adjoint action of the Lie algebra K. Okay, and for the Lie group, so it's also the intersection of the K horizontal part. Okay, horizontal part, and now you ask for things that are invariant, but now with respect to the adjoint action of the group, so these are the alpha such that adjoint of alpha is alpha, where g is an element of the group k. Okay, so actually this when you compute When you compute the cohomology, well, the cohomology of these sub-complexes, they appear, for instance, when you compute characteristic classes of some geometric structures, or also when you want to compute the cohomology of a link group. You can, I mean, I can give you, so for instance, so this if you want to compute the differentiable homology, Homology, then what you can do is to take a maximally compact sum of G and then, well this has to have like cannot be many components, but it doesn't matter. The cohomology of G will be isomorphic to the relative cohomology of the Lie algebra relative. Algebra relative to the legal k. And so you can see like a reference to see one of these isomorphism. You can check at the paper with a card like Vanessa Differentiation and Integration Maps. Okay, so uh So, in this talk, what I want to do is, okay, so you realize here that if I want to generalize this notion, so there is a very obvious problem, is that we don't have adjoint actions of the Lie group, point, or Lie algebra on itself. But in any case, there is a very natural notion that generalizes this one. Notion that generalizes this one and that it makes sense is very geometric. Okay, so in the first part I want to talk about this relative cohomology for Lya de Broid and in the second part an application which is an alternative definition of characteristic classes. Of characteristic classes associated to representations of a Lianic group. And I say alternative definition because they were originally given by Marius Kleinig and Rui and then they wrote a paper together. And somehow this was like the motivation for me to start to look at these things because it was like the definition was kind of involved. Of involved. So I really wanted to see what was going on. Okay, so let's start with the algebra. So just to set the notation, recall that the complex, the Chevrolet Element complex of A, well, this is just sections of wedge of Of A star, and here you have the differential. What else do you have there? Well, for elements of sections of A, you have two operators, which are given by contraction. This is a minus one. Or is a minus one or the lead derivative and the lead derivative is defined by the use of Cartan formula okay and well actually we have all the Cartan algebra behind these complexes okay but when we when we start with When we start with Lynn Gebroid given by induced by Adam Poi, we have a very nice interpretation in terms of forms on G. So A will be the Kermel of the differential. So this G is the attribute of Ligukoid. So a Ligu poet over M which so it's our target. It's so restored target, and we have so A is just the kernel of dt restricted to M and of course we can see the sections of A as left invariant and left invariant vector fields on G, which are tangent to the kernel log T. kernel of T. Right, so alpha goes to the left invariant no it's not alpha, it's a left invariant vector field and the Lie bracket, well this is close, you can show that this is closed, this this this space here is closed under the Libracket of vector fields, so the Lie bracket on So the liberator on A is defined actually as the Libra act of vectoring by number two. Okay, and then, so here what happens is that if you look at this complex, then this identification here allows me to identify this complex with left invariant form zone G. Left invariant forms on G, which are polliated by the kernel of DT. And then these operators here, contraction and this derivative, they correspond exactly to the contraction of the left invariant vector field and the usual Lie derivative of derivative of the left environment vector field. So the Chevalier Eilember differential corresponds to the Ram differential. This is somehow like more or less well known. But now what we can do is that there is a very natural way to make sense. Way to make sense of the adjoint action of in this setting, only that instead of considering G you pass to the group of bisections of G. Okay? So what I'm saying here is that we have this group of bisections. So these bisections are just maps from M to G. From M to G, such that when you compose with the target, it's the identity, and when you compose with the source, it's a diffeomorphism. There is a product here that is not difficult to guess. And you see that when you take a sec dissection, this will actually induce This will actually induce a conjugation by the bisection on G. Okay, so this is a map from G to G, which maps an element to what you want to conjugate by this multisection. So this is P of P of G and here is V of S of G minus what. If you look at the Lie group, this is just conjugation by a point. Conjugation by a point of G. Okay. So this maps, it respects the fibers, the fibers and fibers, and it maps M to M. Okay? So, and also it respects left invariant forms. So, you can see that if you do the pullback of alpha and then you look at the left invariant form, Invariant form, this is going to be just the pullback of the left invariant form associated with one. Okay, so what I get here is that I have an action of this group here and here. And the action, well, is what I just defined. So you take a bisection and act here as the pullback. Or the same here. And because what I just said, this corresponds to this identification. And well. And, well, I mean, it's really the adjoint action. I mean, if you look at the groups, this gives me the adjoint or the quadjoint action. So I will call it. Okay, but now what you can do is to differentiate this action. You can think that sections of A morally Morally, this is the Lie algebra of bisections of G. So you can differentiate this action. Let me put it here. I really want to keep this backward with this information, so So if you differentiate the adjoint action, you will get an action of A on these spaces and well the r the the the NABLA, which is uh the action I mean, is The action, I mean, is just well, they're useful for that. So naval applied transaction applied to an element here is just by definition, you take the derivative of this. I will explain what this means. Okay, so these are bisections associated to Associated to this section of A, which are just, so these bisections are just the flows of the left in biovector field associated to psi restricted to L. Okay? It's not the connection, no? Isn't this a little bit? Why is this the alpha nutmeg? Well, this is the surprise. This was the surprise. This is just a little relative. But you have to realize, I mean, you have because I define I mean, you have because I define the action as conjugation by the bisection, right? So let me just show you, I mean, yes, what you expect. It's just that everything becomes very clear somehow, like very natural, very geometrical. So these bisections, they have the property that, or this left invariant vector, Or this left invariant vector, the flow of the left invariant vector fields, they have the property that they are left moving in the sense that these are just G times this bisection. Okay? And from this, and because, or also you have, I mean, you can also write it down with the with L if you go to the If you go to the forms left invariant and alpha L is left invariant, you can show that this action, which was defined as the As the conjugation by these bisections, right, the pullback is actually the pullback of the flows. Okay, here is a pullback. And this is why what you get here is just the lead derivative of Derivative of psi. So from here, what you get is that these things are just petty derivatives, right? Or if you want to get away from the colours, Okay, so some corollaries that you get immediately is that, well, first of all, because I'm doing just pullbacks and the Chevalier A number corresponds to the RAM differential, then the act. then the action commutes, the action of the bisection commutes with the differential. And the second thing is, well, this thing, right? So that the infinitesimal action means just the leader you have. Action is just the leader you act this is pretty, I mean after you realize this somehow it's pretty obvious everything what is going on. Okay, so let me pass to the cohomology. I mean after you realize these very basic things, defining what I need to to define is really straightforward. Define is really straightforward. Okay? So cohomology of A relative relative to first as a L subalgebroid. Okay, this is a subalgebraid. Or the same base? What? Or the same base, yes. So the first thing is that, okay, I have the horizontal part, which is the kernel of the contractions. And I have the invariant part, which is the kernel of the derivatives. Okay, but then you realize that if you take a section of B, well these L derivatives, they restrict to these spaces. So they take horizontal sections and they land on horizontal sections whenever you take a section on B. Take a section on B. And this is just like a new solve formula for this part-time formula. This is somehow this formula here. Okay, so so the B basic subcomplex will be Will be just the intersection of these two. And this will be a subcomplex of the child Elementary complex of A. Okay, this also works because of the Cartan algebra that I have. Okay, so far so good. I didn't need anything of these bisections. Sections. Okay, and then, well, the definition is that the cohomology, the relative cohomology is just the cohomology of these complexes. Okay. Now, what is more interesting? Now what is more interesting is what when you pass to the to at least a group of G This works this works even if the algebra is not integrable, right? I mean I didn't use anything that it was coming from LD proof point so now if you have a Li superpoid over G and which is white. So here A will be the Lie algebra of G and B the Lie algebra of K. What happened is that if you take our bisection Bisection of K, well, in particular, this will be a bisection of G, right? And you remember that I took conjugation. Then I can differentiate this. But what happens is that when I restrict to K, this goes, this descends the tangent of K to the tangent of K. Of k to the tangent of k. So actually, I have this map. This goes to the quotient. Okay? So actually, this also induces, if I restrict to the unit, this induces a map on this portion. Okay? And even though the action of the bisections of the The action of the bisections of K, right, on the sections of A. This action does not come from an action of K. When you pass to a quotient, it does. Okay? So what I'm saying is that actually k will act on these spaces. these spaces just what is that the formula is just k let's say that the source x and target y acts on an element here by well you take any bisection of k with the property that b of y is k and then you act by this bisection. Act by this bisection, which by definition was conjugation, the pullback of the conjugation of alpha x. And the ambiguity, so you see that I chose here a bisection, but when I go to a quotient, the ambiguity, ambiguity, whatever, it disappears. Okay? So if P is trivial, then you get a classic? Yes. Yes, yes, but I mean here the here I think the the message is that usually the groupoid doesn't act on the algebraid, okay? But if you want to have actions, then you may consider pairs, the groupoid and a subgroupoid. And then you will have an adjoint action on the quotient. Okay. So this is nice, I will call it a joint. So this section you wrote it on the exterior power of A mod B. Yeah. But is it also on A mod B? Yes, yes. I mean is that on A mod B would be this one. I I'm just considering the dual. And it all tends to the group also. Yes. I mean, but there is something even before you pass the group. Even before you pass the loop once, right, if you take just a little bit of the log size and size a section B, then that becomes a connection on A mod B. Sure, which is this one. Which is this one. But I mean, I'm saying something even more crazy. It's just B is a representation of P. Yes, I mean what you are saying is also along the way. Saying is also along the way. I mean, this is very clear. You know that this action where you take the differential, it goes to the derivatives, right? Now, this one will be an action of an algebra, a real action, right, coming from an algebraic, because this space is actually you can identify it with the wedge, with sections of the wedge of A mod B. Okay? And yes, what you are saying is like. And yes, what you are saying is like I you take the differential of this one and this one it it's immediately is immediately true because everything is very natural. Okay, so I think the point of this talk is making you realize that everything is very natural. I mean if you go from this perspective it's like everything works because it must. I mean the calculus of money for it works. Okay. Okay, so um right so so what what you were saying is that note that um that the horizontal part of this complex is actually sections of this wedge. Okay, so I do have a Lie algebraic complex on right, so K is acting here as a representation of a Lie group point. So I can define this Lie algebraic complex relative to k as As this one so these are the horizontal uh forms such that they are invariant with respect to this representation. With respect to this representation. And the proposition, which follows directly from this very obvious corollary, is that this is as complex. Of this of this one here, K. And if K has connected fibers, fibers, not fibers, then they are equal. Okay, so what is that for it that this is containing this one is because what Prui just said, if you take the differential of the Take the differential of the action, this gives me the lead derivatives. So I have this inclusion. And the part that is a subcomplex is just this one, this one here, that the action commutes with the differential. Okay. So everything So, everything so let me point out that before I realized this very obvious picture, I was doing everything like point by point. I was looking at bisections. And proofs were really messy. The algebra behind was horrible. Okay? But as soon as you realize this global picture, everything is straightforward. Okay. Okay, so let me look at the transitive case. So think that now k is transitive. So in particular, g will be transitive. So I have, so here I have my g algebra, then I have. Then I have the answer to Tm, which is objective. The kernel will be, I will denote it by G. And well, this will be the Lie algebra of K, which is by hypothesis is transitive, and the kernel I will denote but K. Okay, so J is the kernel of the S intersection with the kernel. ds intersecting with the kernel of dt and k as well intersected with d. Okay, so from here because you realize that if I quotient a mod b, well, this is canonically isomorphic to the quotient of j and k. So what I'm saying here So what I'm saying here is that of course G and K are Lie algebraids. So what I'm saying is that the horizontal complex, the B horizontal complex of A is canonical isomorphic to the K horizontal complex of G. Okay? And this action, the action that is the same. The action that initially I described on these quotients also acts in the same way on the quotient of G mod K, just because the conjugation by B respects T fibers and S fibers. So I have an action in the same way I was acting here, I can act here, and this comes from a representation of K. comes from a representation of K on G on the wedge of G mod K. Okay, so the thing is that in this way I can identify this complex naturally. Remember, this was the intersection of the B basic part with the K invariant part. And now I have the H K horizontal part with the K invariant part. And so now the natural question is: okay, what is the relation between the cohomology given by this complex with the cohomology of the isotropies? Because right now what I can do is the following. So relation with the With the relative cohomology of the isotropies. So now I can take an element of M and I can look at the isotropies. The isotropy group will be by this intersection. And here I have disotropic. And here I have the isotropy of K. These are Lie groups. And the Lie algebras, well, are the fibers of this bundle. Okay, so here I will have the usual common. The usual complex, the well-known complex for the algebras. And here, I will have this complete. Which is actually this one. But right now, I really want to work on this side. And what happened is that I will have. And what happens is that I will have an extension which is, well, you take a form here and this extension of this alpha at any other point is just okay, so take a bisection of k Because it's transitive, I can find a bisection so that B of M starts at M at inside Z and the definition of this extension is just the pullback of alpha, which I see. Just a pull. And this doesn't depend on the bisection, just because I'm taking things that are invariant by k z okay so you have some hole in like for for what? Base is not assumed to be simple. When the fibers are connected or No, you don't need anything, only transitive. So the theory is that the theorem theorem is that um well this extension map is actually an isoportisome. I shall add an isomorphism. And now I will put this one just because I mean I identify. And the inverse is just a restriction. So it's a nice of complexism. And if you take if you take another point on M, what you can do is, okay, you can join Z with X by an element of K, because K is transitive, and this isomorphism will commute. Will commute when this so you have here conjugation by age, okay, which is an isomorphism, conjugation by H, here you have the extension, here you have the extension, and this point is Okay, an application of this very natural picture is as follows. Can we think of this in a slightly different way? Maybe it's a slightly different. So you have a representation of K on A minus. Representation of K on A mod B. And you are assuming K is transitive. So you are looking at a good way for merging coefficients in A mod B. Could restrict to a point that's weight equivalent. So yes, I mean you know that this works with things that are transitive, right? So you can come That are transitive, right? So you can compute, like in the isotropies, will give you the same cohomology of the group, right? But you don't have, what I'm doing here is everything at the level, at the co-chain level, which is what I really want. When you go to the... Yes, yes. I mean, yes, I don't know how to go in the direction when you don't go relative. I don't have a map. I don't have a map when you don't go relative, right? You know that they are isomorphic, but if you want the maps at the co-chain level, I have no clue. That's why I went to relative, actually, because I really wanted to have these maps at the co-chain level. Okay, so an application, and actually, I think here you can And actually I think here you can you can see why I really wanted to correlative. Is that um so to compute the characteristic classes for representations Okay, so let's think that you have a representation of a a complex representation okay so this is a this has rank complex Has rank complex rank n and then so a representation is just a Lie algebraid map of A to this Lie algebra which is so these are operators on sections of A which are linear and if you plug in a function then this function, then this goes like f of ds plus here you have a vector field associated to this d. You differentiate the function and put x. Okay, so what I get here is a map from code chains of G and E to code chains The co-chains of A Okay But now you can I mean this group Y G L E comes from a this algebra G L E comes from a group Y which are just the Which are just the isomorphisms of the fibers, the linear isomorphisms. This group point is transitive, and now if you choose a Hermitian metric. I will take I think three minutes then Then you have this little group O which is just the the isometries of the of G L E Okay, and this is transitive. Okay, now what you can do is, okay, I can look at the isotropies. So the isotropies of GLE, well, if here this is X, so I can't identify P of X. Identify P of X with C L, right? And this is just G L N C And this one will be identified, the isotropy of this sucrupoise will be identified with U n okay so the Lie algebras in the disotropies will be just Um well the adjustments they are not by the same So what I have here what do I get here? So I will get a map from the isotropies right Right? This is an extension map to this subcomplex, to this basic subcomplex. Here I have an inclusion and here And here I just have the charge A number complex of A. So the characteristic classes of A are just the images of the generators. of listing here which are easily computed and look that I got a map defined at the co-chain level which previously like we I think we didn't have that Okay, and from this construction, I mean you can see many things of these characteristic classes. For example, you have a representation which is hermitian, somehow is compatible with the metric, then the characteristic classes are zero. If it comes from a complexification of a representation, then some of the characteristic classes will vanish. And this is somehow some like a you You take the definition, and then some things will commute. We have some diagrams that show that some things are zero or some like very basic properties. And that's all any questions from Maria and Maria. Maybe I have a quick question. I mean, the transit case integrates with group part that space which is corresponds to an invincible bundle in the picture. It's well the transitive case, I think I talked about it in the the audiette. You also have like an extension map. You also have like an extension map when you go relatively. But I don't know what uh you are telling you are saying. I mean I was just to say if you have a transit uh cool point that basically means the bundle and then transit structure means reduction destructive remote post. I mean kind of wondering what does it mean in this language? I mean in the transitive case you have all these isolations. You have all these isomorphisms of the cohomologies. It's just that if you really want to go to the maps at the cochain level, I haven't seen any natural maps. But if you go relative, then it goes very natural somehow. Maybe what you're asking is what is the meaning of the characteristic classes? Yeah, yeah. Classes which are we also are characteristic. But in this transitive case, you should be able to say everything in terms of each well in for the characteristic classes of the glucoids you have a similar very similar picture and also very easy to understand at the co-chain level. You don't have to go to the princip to the to the yes, I mean there are these constructions of marus and rules that u that y they use principal bundles, I think. Use principal modules, I think, maybe of matures, but it's more involved. So I really wanted to. Yes. So I really wanted to understand that. Question here. So classical case, the characteristic classes of a complex spectrum model, how do you want to play it out? Um what are I don't know what you are asking me and bundle of M or will you take eight TL of E to get the characteristic classes of the character bundle? It doesn't really seem like you have a represent uh you have T M and then Uh you have T M and then E is what? I don't know. Like you want to compute characteristic classes of M. Of a volunteer or something. They are related, but I think like what Marius and Ruiz said, that there are some characteristic classes that they vanish and what they were computing were tests. And what they were computing were the secondary characteristic classes, which is actually idealistic. Yes, we can. Hi. Yeah, can you just give, maybe I missed it, but can you give us an example of a representation of what these characters are? Representation and what these characteristics classes are? No. Well, I haven't worked out the examples. I mean, I think Drui and Marie worked out some examples, like for the Poisson case, this modular class. It was computed with the characteristic classes that Marus can redefine, right? But what I did was: okay, I have the same characteristic classes. The same characteristic classes, so these are the same characteristic classes that we already know or that they produced. It's just that I got, I mean, I defined them at the coaching level. So if you take one of the examples of Ruby or Marius, then this is an example. But if you really want me to compute it, well, I haven't done the example. Well, I haven't done the exercise yet, but I mean it's what they get. So the modular class of a Poisson manifold and etc. Okay, if there are further questions, let's thank Maria again. There's no coffee break. But I mean I can hear what you'll do. I know, but I agree with you.
