In Antarctica, Andrew talked about viewlands, so now let's move back to Antarctica. I'm going to talk about a coupling, showing some coupling, isolation coupling results that we've done, and so looking at parametrization, something that a lot of people are looking into these days. So we saw, we talked yesterday about the importance of eye shelf for buttressing and how when you carve eye shelves, you're just buttressing anything. Shelf, you're just purchasing it impacts ice streams fitting them. The same is true when you also melt the ice shelf, and so that's an experiment that was done by Liz et al. where you have this model of Antarctica and you so you for boxes of 20 by 20 kilometers, you thin the ice shaft by one meter and you see how much it impacts the total discharge over Antarctica. So you see there are large variations depending where you look at and if you zoom onto some of these regions you see that Onto some of these regions, you see that usually the impact is larger as you get closer to the grounding line and this large variety of results. So Andrew talked about the ice-ocean interface in Greenland where you have the ice, so some glacial flow, you have the ocean here, you have some treatment and you have your freshwater plume that rises along the ice front and melts the ice. Things are similar in Antarctica. Are similar in Antarctica mostly, so the same thing with plumes flowing along the base of an ice shelf and training and melting the ice shelf. There are some differences between Greenland and Antarctica. In Greenland, you have mostly vertical fronts, near vertical faces, while in Antarctica you have mostly horizontal face. The ice of the slope are very low. In Greenland you have a lot of subglacial water flow that comes Water flow that comes from mostly from surface runoff, and you have some seasonal signal in there. While in Antarctica, you have very limited amounts of subglacial flow that comes from melting the base of the ice through frictional heat and heat flux. So, you have a very limited amount of flow here. So, most of the fresh water comes from melting the ice at the ice interface. And also, the size of the systems are very different. Are very different. In Greenland, you have fjords that are kilometers, 10 kilometers on the order of 10 kilometers. In Antarctica, you have ice shells that are 10 hundreds, thousands of kilometers. So the scale is quite different. But otherwise, the principle and the ideas around this ice-ocean interface is the same. So I'm not going to go back to it. It's great that Unre presented that, so you know all about it. I don't have to go back to these details. So what we want to do is to have to is to have to I'm looking at this from a very ice ice sheet modeler perspective. What we're interested in having is knowing how much melt the ocean is provided to the ice and how to get that. So I will not talk. We have some, so what you want to do ideally is have ice shelves that an ocean model tells you how much amount you have. You have these three equation models that you can compute at the interface. So you have the heat balance at the So you have the heat balance at the interface, you have salt balance, you have the freezing point of seawater. And so these three equations you can solve and get the temperature, salinity, and melt at the interface. And you have these gamma-s-gamma t coefficients that are heat and salt exchange coefficients that can be, yeah, that are usually velocity dependent. And so you solve for that, and hopefully you have a good ocean model, and you put that into your ice, and you have good melt rates, and life is good. So I'll show one example. I'll show one example that's something that we have done on Twitter's glacier using a coupled ice-ocean model. So, we're coupling the ice shape system model with the MITGCM. And we're solving, we're doing simulations of Twitter's glacier. So, the ice model is just Twitter's glacier and the Amanten Sea, the ocean model is in the Zantig region that goes like hundreds of kilometers after the continental shelf. And these simulations were on a coupled model, isolation model, for 50% of the world. Model, isolation model for 50-year simulations. We have a coupling time step of a month. The resolution of the model for the ice is about 500 meters at the grounding line, and for the ocean, it's about two kilometers. And we have a spin-up of the ocean first for five years or so until you have some reasonably stable condition. And then you start the coupling. And then we did some experiments with coupling and compared that to uncoupled parametrized simulation. What will the force impose be now? So, sorry, yeah, very good point. So, the idea was to test sensitivity, so it's using results from Echo. But did you talk about that? Well, I don't know. So, it's ocean, did you? It's the same, so it's the same 1992, so we repeat that over the same first thing for this particular year, over and over for fifty years, and we also use that for five years, so after five years it's kind of uh um balanced. Balance. And so Echo doesn't have eye-shell cavities, so that's why you want to do that. So you have something that propagates and have something reasonable in the cavities. If we want to put that in the context of what Zeilar mentioned about the diversity of coupling techniques, this is some very simple coupling. It was offline, you can call it MATLAB coupling if you want. So you start, you run your model, Ice, ocean model, your ice model, and each iterate at each coupling time step, which here for us is. Coupling time step, which here for us is a month. You get the melt rate from the ocean, put that to the ice, run the ice, and then you get the new shape of the ice cavity drowning line, which we put that back into your ocean model, and so on until you finish. Because it's an offline MATLAB coupling, we did use, we restart the model each time step, so we extrapolate the ocean conditions from the closest grid when you have new cells opening. In terms of In terms of having problems of re-queuing, what we do is that we can have these interactive queues on the cluster where you request to have a number of CPUs for a given amount of time. So you don't have to queue each time. So you have these CPUs, you can run whatever you want for this period. And so you run one after the other, and you don't have to re-queue, you just need to have like a bunch of scripts that detects when you have run, when it's finished. But once this is in place, at least you don't waste too much time. At least you don't waste too much time. And then, just quickly, do you use about the same number of CPUs for the ocean? No, no, for the ocean. And the ocean run is like 95 or at least percent of the run. And there's a lot of time wasted because we re-initialize the ocean model each time. But this is a, as you said, this is a simple approach. And if you want to test, like, do we need coupling, what kind of coupling time steps, or whatever you want to investigate, do that's the easiest way to do it. So that's where we started. Do it. So that's where we started. So you're starting the ocean or rest each time? We're starting from the temperature resolution conditions from the previous time step, but yes, there's no velocity. So that's yeah, absolutely. And of course we have, so the MHDTM has structured grid, so you have like here ocean, ice shells, and here you have some no ocean, like grounded ice. The ice model is unstructured, so you have ice shells here and grounded ice. So we just linearly interpolated. Linearly interpolated the values between the two models. And if you do that, you have about 3% or so difference. You can have up to 5% difference between the different parent rates. So we just scale them so that globally they change things, but it doesn't necessarily conserve properties locally. So that's how that's done. This is what the snapshot of the ocean temperature at 530 meters. At 530 meters depth for this region. So you have warm waters here aside. The continental shelf makes it onto the continental shelf. You have warm waters that reach all these different cavities, vinyl and twates and so on. We're just interested in twates. And the simulated MEL traits for these regions are these numbers that are roughly in agreement with estimates that we have from remote sensing. Crossgrove is a bit overestimated, Laudson-Proson is underestimated. Lots and Proson is underestimated, but Pine Land Twites are doing pretty good. And this is how your ICE model of tweets evolves. So you have your model going this way, you have a grounding line, and over this 50-year period, you see that the tweets accelerate a little bit, not too much. You have grounding line retweets here on the main trunk of Twitter. You also have some retreats here on the western side and here on the eastern side. Western side, and here on the eastern side. And here on the right, you have the MEL trait simulated by the ocean model. And so you see here that the highest mass is located to be the grounding line. And I don't know if we need to maybe show this again. Maybe, yeah. And if it wants to go, maybe not, that's fine. So with the highest melt. So the highest melt follows the ground young retreat, and when you have these retreat, you start following that. Okay, that's better. And Zeilar mentioned that you talked about the spin and when you start coupling them, you can have some jump. Here, the male traits that we had for tweets was relatively in relatively good agreement with the observations and did not respond too strongly. You can see some of that on the Too strongly, you can see some of that on the eastern part of the shelf where it's so the blue lines are the water column thickness under the eye shelf. And you can see here that the water column thickness increases quite a lot because this probably the circulation is not strong enough or and the melt is too or it's too high. It's the opposite. The melt is too high, so you start by thinning quite a lot the uh eastern part of the uh the eye shell while the the main trunk was was doing a was a better job and you don't have such a big uh adjustment at the beginning. Adjustment at the beginning. So that's actually what you see here. So this shows the total melting rate under the ice shelf of Twitter as a function of time for this 50-year period and the volume change from the glacier. And you see here that you start by like the melt first decreases. And what happens is that on this eastern shelf, the ice shelf was too thick. And so it starts by thinning. And then the base of your ice shelf starts to rise. Starts to rise and it gets further from the warm waters at depth, and then at some point it's kind of stabilized more, it's more in equilibrium with the ocean conditions, and then you have overall an increase in the melt as the ice shelf gets bigger. If we compare that with observations, while we capture the bulk of the melt traits, we have these two estimates from Winyo et al. and the Porter et al. They're based on the same data sets, but the estimates don't really overlap, so I don't think we. Don't really relax, so I don't think we can say much more than, well, we'll do a decent job at that. If we look at the evolution of the grounding line, which we're doing this same period, so this time here shows the location of the grounding line of the simulation. And we also have some observations. We have the green and the purple lines here that are taken at like about 10 years. There's a 10-year period between these two measurements. And we can see that, well, the retreat that we simulate. Retreat that we simulate happens in the same place that where you see we see retreat in the observations, and the time scale is roughly the right order of magnitude. We have a retreat here, that's about 10 years or so. So it shows that that's doing a pretty good job. I found is that when you run a couple models, as I said, 99% of the time is spent doing the ocean model, so you can run 50 years, but doing more than that seems to us to be a challenge. That starts to be a challenge. So, if you want to do ICE simulations of hundreds of years or do many simulations, that starts to be a big problem. And therefore, many ICE people are trying to find parametrization that don't involve running full ocean models. So, if you look at the melt here, so we take the end of the five-year spin-up, you look at the average melt over the last year, and that's what it looks like. And if you plot it as a function of depth, you see that well, this seems to be. Well, this seems to be taking like a linear depth-dependent approach, seems to be doing a decent job. So, what happens if you run the same simulation with just parametrization using these values? This is what happens. So, here we had the previous simulation with grounding line retreat for this period. This is another coupled model where you have a notion that's fi half a degree warmer. So, the retreat happens in the same place. You have slightly more, so at the end you start to open, for example, this place here on the B. Plays here on the B, and the retreat is slightly faster. When you do the uncoupled simulation with this parametrization, even though you have calibrated it to match your ocean model, you see that the retreat, especially here, and the retreat happens much faster, especially in this part here. This is because you overstimulate the melt very close to the grounding line, and you also don't have any signal signal, and what you had at the beginning of the simulation doesn't hold as your gravity evolves. Doesn't hold as your gravity evolve. So there are quite some differences here, but this is very simple parameterizations. And many people have been trying to make this more sophisticated, fancy, to be able to, again, not having to run ocean models. So this is our some, these parametrizations starts, this seems to be like a new ones all the time. So I forget me if your favorite parameterization is not listed here. Parameterization is not listed here. So I explained how this the most simple thing you can do is just do MET as a function of depth, depth parametrization. You also have local quadratic parametrizations that have been used for quite some time, so they depend quadratically on the thermal forcing at the eye shelf. Recently, we also had something similar that was proposed, but using both local and non-local dependence on the thermal forcing. So it's also quadratic parameterization we have here. So here you have the thermal forcing. Have here, so here you have the thermal forcing for a given point, but you also have the thermal forcing averaged over the eyeshadow cavity. And what that allows you to do is to capture more like the overall strength of the circulation in the cavity, and therefore not rely just on the local, you still capture the local properties by this local part here, but also the strength of the circulation. And I'll talk about that more a bit later. Something that I don't want to talk about much because it was mentioned for Greece. It was mentioned for Greenland, and it's been going on for a while. It's to use plume models to simulate that. There also are new actually reviving box models. It's Pico Potsdam ice shelf cavity model reviving the box model. How does that work? Instead of solving an entire ocean models, you just have a few boxes that you have under your ice. Well, there's no more pointer, so we'll do without that. Boxes, so you have your ambient. Boxes, so you have your ambient ocean conditions, and then you transfer them from boxes to boxes. You have about like five to ten boxes, and they follow the grounding line. So, you go, they go all the way through, they follow the grounding lines, and then you move from one to the other, and you conserve the properties going from boxes to boxes, and therefore you have, you can estimate the temperature and salinity in these different boxes, and use that to compute your melt rate. So maybe some new batteries. And maybe some new batteries. Yeah, I'll just see if you want these ones. I would use these, but let me go ahead and leave that and you can continue on. Thank you. So that's a box model. There's also been another recent parameterizing combining plume and box models called Pico Plume. And what that does is that, so for the Plume model, you need to have You need to have ocean conditions, temperature, salinity. And so, what you do is use the box model to compute your ocean conditions in the different boxes. You have your temperature salinity, but then you don't choose the melt rate from this model. You put that into a plume model so that you have your ocean conditions from that combined with... Thank you. That's perfect. Combined with the plume model. And one last thing you need in the plume model is to figure out where the, from what part of the grounding. From what part of the grounding line are you coming, and so there are different ways to do that. And this example, they use the ice flow directions to figure out where the depth of the grounding line was coming from. So Helen, are the boxes sort of contour-shaped? Yeah, so maybe that's a better way to see it. The boxes follow the so they so you have your ambient conditions that go all the way to the running line, and you have your boxes that follow the shape of your. Shape of your. I don't know how you exactly choose. Yeah, I don't know if it's, I don't remember if it's distance or depth or something like that. Just basically, it follows maybe better. So you're talking about the interfaces between the boxes? Yeah, how do you choose like an interpolation between the calving front and the grounding line? So it's based on distance, basically. Okay. I was more thinking about the vertical dimension of the boxes. No, only with one dimension. There's no vertical dimension. It's all over the entire box. It sits over the entire column, yeah. So you just have the ambient properties that come at the first box. Yeah, sorry, it's uh yeah, no, it's just flagged one after the other. So the ambient conditions here are coming from an ocean model or just sort of prescribed? You could take, so you start from here. You can have this change in time, so you can take this from wherever you want. So either it's climatology or an ocean model. There's climatology or an ocean model, or whatever you want. The idea is, like, for example, if you have an ocean model, you don't want to rub the coupling, you use this as a forcing and then you put it through the different boxes. So you'd be running an ocean model that doesn't resolve the eyeshadow cavity? Yes, yes. Is it expensive to redraw the contours? The contours of the boxes? Yeah. I'm thinking if it's coupled in the ground line is changing. That's no, you have, so you have to, yes, you have to redo that regularly, but it's not expensive compared to running. But it's not expensive compa compared to running an and oh it's it's you have yeah no it's not expensive it's hard to implement but then once it's done it's relatively cheap to just redo it. So yeah, for example you take a point here, you say let's say I think the good analog for my conditions outside of the is here and you take this and that can come from wherever you want. Okay so and then you can compare these different things to observations. So here you have the same again Vino et al. observations Again, we neo-adal observations of MELT in the American C sector and comparing the from kind of simpler and making it more complex from depth-dependent quadratic Pico-Picof model you see that usually you have improvements and you start to be capturing some of the features with higher melt close to the grounding line and so on. So you can compare that with observations, you can also compare it with coupled ice-ocean models. Coupled ice ocean models, and that's something that was done by Favier et al. So they took an idealized configuration of an eye shelf cavity coming from the Mesomib intercomparison. So that's the eye sheet was like this. You have this eye shelf ocean cavity and it's like a confined eye shelf cavity. And so you can compare simulations performed with coupled ice ocean model here on the right at different resolutions with and without tides with the different And without tight, with the different parametrizations. So, here you have the linear quadratic, non-local quadratic parametrizations. Here you have some box model with different number of boxes. And you also have some plume models with different ways of figuring out where the water comes from, from the drowning line. And so all these parametrizations were calibrated to have the same mean melt, but then the distribution looks quite different. And more importantly than that, you want to see how this. Than that, you want to see how this impacts the evolution of your ice sheet and your glacier. And so, these are for different scenarios. You have again here the simpler parameterization here, so the linear quadratic and so on. And here, the plum and box models, and they are several scenarios. The top row is cold water, and then you have some warm water scenarios. And so, the gray shading here shows the spread in the coupled isolation models, and the other lines show the individual. The other lines showed the individual results for each parameterization, and overall, they showed that box models tend to do a relatively good job, but also that the non-local quadratic parameterization was doing a decent job. All the simulations tend to underestimate the magic close to the grounding line. And so we use this, I'm not sure why I want to say the year. I'm not sure what I want to say here. Let's marry. So, we use this for e-semiptics. So, I'm sure you've all heard about the ice sheet modeling comparison for CMIP6. I've been working on that for some time, which dragged me on from continuing the coupling models. And so we wanted to have a parameterization that as many models could do, but was doing a decent job. And looking at this previous publication, using this non-local quadratic parameterization is something that's not too difficult to implement, but still. Too difficult to implement, but still does a really decent job at capturing the melt and the changes. So that's what we did. But in all this parametrization, you always have some parameters that need to be calibrated. So we did that using these estimates of Meltraites from Reno and the Porter. And so that's this part. And then you have ocean conditions from observation, combining all the observations that you have to figure out what the thermal forcing is here. And so if you have this and that. Is here, and so if you have this and that, you can figure out what your gamma zero parameter is. And so, we did use, but you have some uncertainty in both. So, you draw 10 power five or so samplings randomly within these observations and with these different ocean conditions, and you come up with a distribution of gamma zero. If you do that, you can have a melt that overall has the right is in the The right is in agreement with the observations, but you have some discrepancies by basin. You could do that by basin, but then you end up with a gamma zero that changes drastically, can in some places changes drastically from one basin to the next. And while there are some physical reasons why it could be different if your eye shall base is rough or whatnot, there's no reason why it would spend such a large amount. So what we did, but we also know that you have observation, the errors here in the observations. The errors here in the observations, and these observations, actually, maybe that's why I have this, come from, first of all, they come from remote sensing estimates that have errors. And these estimates, so now we start to have, this estimate is like an average over a six-year period using satellite observations. And the ocean conditions that we have are very sparse, especially under ice shells, and they were measured at a Eye shells, and they were measured at a very specific time. There are no mini moorings, and so you also have errors there. And rather, therefore, we decided that the best approach would be, instead of changing gamma-zero by basin, would be to have some small correction in the thermal fossil in the ocean temperature that accounts for all the uncertainty that we have in these observations, because they are really sparse. Um these corrections are usually small on the order of 0.12 degrees, usually less than 0.5 degree. Usually less than 0.5 degree. And then, so once you have this gamma zero that you take, like for example the median value, you can calibrate this delta t so that the melt rate by sector is in agreement with your estimates of melt. So that's the approach that we did for ISMIP6. And another way, we also did different calibration using high melt values in Pine Land Glacier because this is the region that where you have. is the region that where you have first of all you have more observe direct observations and also maybe might be more representative of what could happen in a in a warming ocean scenario so two different calibrations what happens if you use that and put that in an ice in an ensemble of ice models here we're mostly interested in so I will spare you all the results I can talk about that for hours if you want ask so I ask me if you're interested but so here in the Ask me if you're interested, but so here in the purpose of looking at how uncertainties in ocean transfer into ice sheet simulations, so we have here for this, so we have the median gamma zero, but you can also use the 595% of the distribution. And the old calibration sheet is starting from the same part. So you always start from melt, simulated melt that are in agreement with observations and then they evolve in time. When you do that, you end up with um basal melt that varies by about ten percent. That varies by about 10%. And these figures on the right show how the ice sheet evolves over this period. Thomson showed about that how Antarctica is not so dependent on the RCP, but also not losing or gaining too much mass because mass gain in East Antarctica is roughly balanced by mass loss in West Antarctica. It looks like the total paper melt at sort of size. Um wave or melt at sort of saturated um any explanation, anyway. I don't think it's saturated, it just depends on the ocean conditions and you can sometimes have like waves and it's I don't I'm not this is not absolutely not like accelerating or something. It's just it would continue if you look at further down it it would just keep changing. It's just like here it here starts warming. Here you have a water. I don't even know in what basin this happens. You have like a warm ocean that You have like a warm ocean that makes it and then just go away, and it's you know, and this is for one specific climate model. It's from Nori SM CME5, and I'm not saying this is the truth or anything, just like how does changing these coefficients impact the results. So, it changes the med by 10% and then changes the syllable contribution. Actually, it's multiplied by like a factor of like five or six, something like that. But these remain small compared to the lights. So the shading is from the spread of model response. So this mean, it changes the mean, but this remains way within the spread in the dynamic response of the different models. If now you look at what happens when you take this, you compare this with the second calibration that's done with only high melts in Pylon region. Here the melt more than double, roughly doubles at the end of the simulation, and then the mean, both the And then both the mean change and the spread of the results changes drastically with up to 30 centimeters of sea level loss from Antarctica, while it was much smaller in the previous case. Finally, yes, so I talked about this non-local quadratic parameterization that many models implemented and adopted, but there were also models that used different parameterizations, these PICO-PICOP2 models. And so here we separate. Models. And so here we separate the results between this standard parameterization and whatever you want. So the first, so that's for six CMIP models, CMIP5 models, separated between West, East, Antarctica, and the peninsula. And you always have the first line, that's the open experiment, so people do whatever they want, and therefore you have a relatively large spread. And then the second case is the standard parameterization. So of course, you have the mean change in total. Change in total melt applying over the simulation period, and on the right, you have the sea level change. So, the spread in the melt, of course, is much larger when you do the open framework because people use vastly different parametrizations. But what you can see here, for example, if you take the first one, is that on average, the open parametrizations simulate less melt than the standard one. However, if you look at the sea level contribution from the ice sheet, See level contribution from the ice sheet, it's more than twice as much as what you have from the standard parameterization. And this is not something new. I mean, Olivia showed that like 10 years ago already on an idea simulization, but this is interesting to see how not just the amount of money that you have, but where and how you apply it can have large drastic consequences on the evolution of your and this is at continental scale. And so, Olga, to go back to your question, here you see the difference so assuming the Assuming the fixed eye shelf with no evolution geometry, how the Mel trait would evolve for these different models. So it's just random. Yeah, they aren't, yeah, exactly. It's a mess.
