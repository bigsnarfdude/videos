have liked to be there in Canada with all of you, but it was impossible this time. So as you can believe, I'm looking forward to see you all in person for the next occasion. And the second, before starting, I would like to say just a couple of words because this is a very sad moment for our community because as probably most of you know, we recently lost Luis Escaada. Luis Escaza was a great moment. Was a great mathematician as well as a beautiful friend and human being. So, I would like to remember him together with you. Okay, so this is the introduction of this talk. So, as you see in the title, the main topic is concerned with the sub-Laplacian on the Heisenberg group. As everyone knows, many physical systems evolve towards according with a According with a dynamics which is constrained, no, which is some constraint, some typically geometric constraint. And typically, it is settled in some ambience in which the motion is possible only in a prescribed direction of the tangent space, okay, of the manifold of settling the problem. This is the basic idea of the discipline, which is the so-called sub-Riemannian geometry. Okay, so the motion is not possible in all the directions. The motion is not possible in all the directions of the tangent space, but only in some of them. Okay, the crucial feature of subribane structures, subribanial manifolds, is that although you only have some vector fields which do not span all the tangent space, somehow you can recover the missing direction in the tangent space by taking a sufficiently large number of commutators. Of the vector fields you are using in your model, which are used in fact to describe the PDE you are interested in. And among this large amount of application, of course, I can mention quantum mechanics, of course, which is the ambient in which this kind of geometry has been built by Cartan in this famous paper by 1928. And maybe the best known example of application. known example of application of this kind of geometry is the so-called non-holonomic mechanics. Non-holonomics means that the motion cannot happen in every direction, just in one. And the typical example you have in mind is the motion of a robot. So if I unfortunately for you, if I were there, I could now start my Michael Jackson dance, but I will not, I cannot do it because I'm not there. So it's plenty, it's plenty of examples. It's plenty of examples in which motion is non-olonic, the mechanics of the motion is non-linomic, and due to this, the geometry which is behind the dynamical system is subriemannium in the above sense. Okay, we'll be more precise in the sequel. So the usual framework in which you set this kind of models, which are TVs, is the framework of the so-called Carnot groups, or you usually also tell the strategy. You usually also tell the stratified groups. So, these are, roughly speaking, this is not, I mean, a precise definition, but this is correct. These are Lie groups, G, not necessarily non-abelian in fact, but in our case, it will be this is the case. So, a Lie group is a group which is also a Riemannian manifold. And there is in our case a non-commutative group law on this. This is why non-Abelian. And the associated Lie algebra, the Lie. The associated Lie algebra, the Lie algebra is the tangent space at the group identity, is equipped with a structure which is layered, which is stratified. This is the background of the so-called Carnot groups. And the type of the stratification is suggested every time by the physical background. Okay, so this is the usual framework. And prototypical or prototypical maybe example of these Carnot groups is surely Carnot groups is surely the ubiquitous and well-known to the plus one-dimensional Heisenberg group Hd, which have been introduced by Weil once describing his theoretical approach to quantum mechanics based on group presentation theory. Okay, so this will be the ambient of this talk. So the group HD, in a while I will give you the precise definition as a group is also a group is also equipped with a very famous operator which is a conformal invariant second order operator which i will i will denote by delta h but maybe more frequently in the literature is denoted by l calligraphic or not and which is called the sub-laplacian this is the uh i mean the the the good denomination according with the terminology for for carnot groups you if i give you a carnot group and and a set of vectors And a set of vector fields, then there is a sub-Laplacian there. Or usually, in the case of the Heisenberg group, we also usually say horizontal Laplacian, and it will be clear why in a while, because when I will give you the precise definition of this object. Okay, so this is the geometric ambient. What's the Eisenberg group? The Eisenberg group is nothing else than the space R to the 2D plus 1, which can be, as always, identified. As always, identified by C to the D plus one. Okay, so you have two real variables and one real variable. And to define the group law, you just introduce the usual 2D times 2D symbol magnetics, which is here. And you can introduce this law. This is the composition of two elements of the group here, always. The variable Z is the variable which lives in C D, so it's a D complex vector. Complex vector or a 2D real vector, and T for me is the real variable in the isomber group here. I will usually call in the SQL Z the horizontal variable and T the vertical variable. This is the group law, which is non-abelian due to the fact that the symplectic matrix J is not symmetric, which is anti-symmetric. And the identity. And the identity group is of course 0, 0 and given an element of the group GZT. So the inverse is just given by G minus 1 minus Z minus T. This is obvious to C. So this is the group, and this is the group structure. What about the algebra? So the Eisenberg algebra, which I recall you in a Lie group, the algebra, the Lie algebra is the tangent space at the group identity. In this case, it is simple to see that it is generated by 2d plus 1 vector fields. By 2d plus one vector fields, and this is a kind of standard choice of these fields. So there are those fields x, j, y, j, and j goes from one up to d. Okay, so there are 2d vector fields, which I will call horizontal vector fields, the x and the y's. And then there is a last vector field, t, which is just the derivative with respect to the vertical variable t. Okay, this is the, I mean, the structure. The, I mean, the structure, the algebraic structure of the tangent space at the group identity, which is the Lie algebra. As I told you before, I wish to stress that those fields, the 2D vector fields, X and Y, which are the horizontal vector fields, and in the model, roughly speaking, they are describing the direction in which you can move. They are sufficient to span all the tangent space. But due to this very well-known Due to this very well-known Eisenberg commutation relations, in particular, this one, which tells you that when you commute a vertical field here with the homologous field Yj here with the same J, you obtain the T, the vertical vector field. Then, as I told you before, if you take just the vector field X and Y, then them together with this commutator here are sufficient to describe all. To describe all the tangent space, okay, and so all the possible directions of the motion all over the tangent space. This is the typical picture of a subri-mannion of a subri-mannion structure. Okay, so again, I stress that I will always refer to the x and the y as the horizontal vector fields and the t as the vertical vector field. Okay, and you have to think that in our models, the motion is described, the motion is just allowed. Is just allowed horizontally. Okay. So, what's the souble Laplacian? In fact, the soup Laplacian is now just the square of the sum of the square of the horizontal vector fields. Okay, this is the explicit expansion of the soup Laplacian. You see, it's a Laplacian with respect to the Z variable. Then there is this second-order derivative with this non-constant coefficient here, the derivative with respect to t, and then this kind of tweak. And then this kind of twisted differential operator structure, which is here. But I mean, this is the usual definition of Laplacian given any Carnot group and given any set of vector fields of the same type as before. Okay, so it's quite standard to see that this operator fails to be elliptic at every point of the ismber group. And on the other hand, thanks to the commutation relations I wrote down before. I wrote down before, which in fact are coming from quantum mechanics. And thanks to the very well-known Hermander theorem, it turns out that this is maybe the prototypical example of a hypoelleptic operator. It is quite relevant to see what's the behavior of this operator with respect to the suitable dilations given. Dilations given by the geometry. Here, the suitable dilations which are given by the geometry of this example of Carnot groups are of this type. So, you take homogeneous of degree one with respect to the horizontal variable and homogeneous of degree two with respect to the vertical variable. And it is easy to see that when you commute the sub laplacian with the dilation, then you lose a scaling factor which is lambda squared exactly in a similar exactly as. In a similar exactly as in the case of the Euclidean Laplacian, when you are when you commute it with isotropic dilation, of course. So, dilation which are the same with respect to all direction. And this is the layer, the stratified structure I was trying to describe you before, which is typical of the context of a Carnot group. Okay? And another fundamental number to introduce before starting then with the result is this number Q, which is 2D plus. Is this number q which is 2d plus plus 2? Remember that 2d plus 1 is the real dimension of the Eisenberg group. So, but this number turns out to be fundamental. In fact, when you introduce the big measure, the Z dt, which in this context is usually called the R measure, then you see that the interaction of this measure with the dilation is given by this scaling factor lambda to the Q. Okay, so if you compute the Lebesgue measure of a scaled domain. Domain, let's say you scale the ball, then you lose a factor lambda to the q. Of course, the scaling has to be taken with respect to the non-homogeneous dilations I was describing before. And this motivates the denomination homogeneous dimension for this number q. Okay, so it plays a role of a dimension with respect in the sense of the measure theory, in this case, the Lebesgue measure theory. The relevance of this number is also remarked by a very famous. This number is also remarked by a very famous result by Foland, in which he proved that if you take this function here, this is given Zt in H, then you can define this, which is a distance, which is usually called the Korani distance or Korani gauge. I stress that this is not the subrimanum distance. The subri-manned distance is the, if you want to compute, I mean, the sub-Riemannian distance between two points is just to minimize along all the possible admissible paths connecting the points. This is another object, but it's very, it's Object, but it's very relevant, and in particular, it's strongly related to the structure of the School Laplacian because Foland proved that there exists up to a dimensional constant, this function here to the power 2 minus Q, where Q is exactly the homogeneous dimension defined here, is the fundamental solution of the Sub-Laplacian. Okay, so this is clear that there is a resemblance with the Euclidean case, in which the Laplacian has a No, in which the Laplacian has a fundamental solution in Rd, the distance to the two minus d. Okay, so q is really playing a role, a dimensional role with respect to this operator, which we call the soup laplash. Okay, and this is an important number to keep in mind. So, next, it's natural to define a shredding evolution to the Heisenberg group, of course, for several reasons, and starting from quantum mechanical reasons. But maybe this is a quite natural example in harmonica. I will find in a while to convince you why. Please notice that with my choice of the variables here, T is always the vertical variable in the Eisenberg group, while the evolution variable I'm calling S. Okay, so here the evolution with respect to the variable S. This is the non-homogeneous Rödinger equation. And there is a quite well-known And there is a quite well-known paper 20 years ago by Bahouri, Gerard, and Shu, in which they prove that there is a total lack of dispersion in this case, in this geometric setting. More precisely, so in the homogeneous case F equals zero, they easily construct an initial datum u zero in the Schwartz class of the Heisenberg group, which is such that the solution u to the Schrodinger equation with datum initial datum mutual. Datum initial datum u zero is given by this translation of u zero. Okay, so you just take u zero at the same horizontal variable and you are just shifting the vertical variable depending on the time s. So you immediately see that there is a total lack of dispersion. You don't have the usual behavior of the free Schrodinger equation in Rd when when you start with L1, then the L infinity norm of your solution is decaying in time, which are precise decay. Time which are precise decay rate given by the scaling by the dimension, this then this phenomenon here does not occur. Okay, so this is the Schledinger equation on the Heisenberg group belongs to this quite interesting family of non-dispersive model in which you are losing the dispersion in the sense of the time decay estimate. And if you want to try to describe analytically, maybe some non-linear or even linear perturbation of this. Linear perturbation of this equation, and you have to try to recover some other kinds of dispersive inequalities, such as Strickard's estimate. Indeed, in this case, in HD, in the Heisenberg group, despite the total lack of dispersion, Strickard's estimates are known to be true. Isas Bill? Yes? Okay. Okay, this is a recent result by Isabel Garrett. By Isabel Gallagher, Bauri, and David Barillari, so, in which they prove that if under this admissibility condition, which you can immediately realize is exactly the analog of the admissibility of shredding and in this setting of the Heisenberg group, you have these three cards estimates. Of course, you have to somehow average in a suitable way. Notice that with respect to the T variable, which I remember, I recall you, is the vertical. Remember, I recall you is the vertical variable of the Eisenberg group. You are taking L infinity here. Okay? And then the Strickland estimates are L S, L Q, L P with respect to the time evolution and only to the horizontal variable in the isomber movement. Okay, of course, there can be further generalizations of this, but I will not enter the details. So again, this is an example of a Schrodinger evolution which you don't have. Of shredding a revolution in which you don't have time decay, but you do have streakers. It's plenty of these kinds of examples. One which I like a lot and which I want to recall here is the focusing inverse square acting on the Schrodinger operator. So when A here, the parameter of the inverse square is negative and it's less than this Hardy inequality constant, then it is well known that the flow, if you start in L1, intersect in L2, the flow is even not in L infinity. The flow is even not in L infinity, so there is not the usual time decay L1 L infinity, but strict usual Striker estimates, the full set of the usual Striker's estimates do hold. This is a quite similar result by Nicola Burke, Fabrice Planchon, John Stalker, and Hanishadi Takhvid Darsade of the 2000s of the Berinhi of the 2000s. So this is the same kind of philosophy, of course, completely different behavior of the flows. Okay? Okay, by the way, the result by Bahuri, Barilari, and Gala, very. Result by Bahuri, Barilari, and Galager is based on Fourier analysis. And what we would like to understand is how to obtain this kind of recovering of the dispersion without using Fourier analysis, for example, because we want to treat the non-constant coefficients perturbations of the operator. And this is a project we just started this year together with Nursh Ronkal here from Beckham and Nikos Kiabone, who's actually OSDOC in OSACA, which is a project. Which is a project which is totally analogy with what we have been doing in the recent years for the Euclidean case. And the natural starting point, of course, needs to be the spectral theory associated to the sublaplacium. And together to that, a complete understanding of the free resolvent operator sub laplacian plus lambda to the minus one, with lambda a complex number. Okay, so let me let me start. These are These are my notations. These are kind of usual notations. With nabla h, I will denote the horizontal gradient in which I only take the vector fields x and y. I don't take the t, while the full gradient will be the one involving the t. So with this definition, the soup laplacian is just the square of the horizontal gradient. It is well known that, as you can expect, the minus sub Laplacian is a positive and self-adjoint operator on L2 of Hd. And that the spectrum is purely continuous and coincides with the positive real line. Hence, you can implement all the standard machinery of the CATO perturbation theory, for example, to define differential operators given as perturbation of the sublapless and with a zero-order potential, provided the potential, for example, this is one way to define these operators. Is one way to define these operators, provided the potential is subordinated with respect to the three quadratic form in the sense that this inequality holds with a constant which is strictly less than one. Okay, this is really standard in the abstract secting of the Hilbert spaces. Okay, how to understand this inequality, of course? Of course, one has to understand this inequality as a Hardy inequality. Okay, so let me d say something about Hardy inequalities in the Eisenberg group. In the Eisenberg group. There is a very famous result of 1990 by Nico Garofalo and Hermann Lanconelli, in which they prove this RD inequality, in which the weight here is exactly the Korani norm I defined before. And here you have to lose this factor here, which is zero homogeneous degree with respect to the natural dilations. And for this weight here, you have what you expect. You have the Hadi inequality with this number here, two divided the homogeneous dimension minus two. Divided the homogeneous dimension minus two. But there is at least another relevant example of Hardy inequality proved by Lorenzo D'Ambrosio some years later at the beginning of the 2000s, in which instead of taking the Korani norm here as a weight, you take only the horizontal weight z square. And here you have at the right-hand side again the free quadratic form. So notice that one is one would like to think that this inequality is better than the previous one because, of course, this weight is less. Of course, this weight is less than this weight here, but on the other hand, notice that this constant here is worse than this constant here. So, the point is that these two inequalities are really different, and in fact, they are dimensionally different. So, this is an inequality in which the natural dimension you are working is 2D plus 1, which is the real dimension of Hd. While for this inequality, this is really a 2D dimensional inequality. A 2D dimensional inequality because you are only an horizontal weight here, and this is the numerology. So they are not comparable to each other. They are different inequalities. And the second one, it is natural to think that the second one is the most natural when you think to the sublapless, okay, which is defined only in terms of the horizontal vector fields. So related to this, I would like to go for a while back to the Euclidean case. To the Euclidean case, and there are those natural inequalities which are related to Rd, which is which are the so-called relic inequality: this one, f squared divided by x fourth, controlled by the Laplace of F square, and this other inequality which is in between, which is the so-called Hardy-Relic inequality, which is grad F square divided by X square controlled by Laplace. Of course, the second one, together with a Hardy inequality, implies the first one. So the second one is faster. The first one. So, the second one is a stronger information. Here, the constants are very, the best constants are very well known, and as in the case of the Hardy inequality, they are not attained on the domain of the inequality. And for the aim of this topic, it is quite interesting to consider some weighted version of these two inequalities in which I split the weight x to the four here in x to the two here and x to the two here, multiplying the delta. So, somehow I'm multiplying for by x squared. For by x squared, both right and left side of this inequality. And I obtain these two inequalities, okay, which are weighted versions respectively of the relic inequality and of the hardy-Relic inequality. Also, these constants here, I mean the sharp constants, are very well known. Equivalently, I can put the Laplacian here. I can write Laplace to the minus one in front of F here, in front of F here at the left-hand side. Left here at the left-hand side. And so these are the two inequalities I'm interested in because now that you see the Laplace and to the minus one, you see that those are inequalities for the resolvent at the frequency zero, lambda equals zero. Okay, so one wish to understand those inequalities as resolvent inequalities at the frequency lambda equals zero. And this is quite natural to wonder to ask whether those inequalities can be true for any lambda and possibly with some constant here, which Possibly with some constant here, which is uniform in lambda. Okay, so as for the first inequality, which is this weighted relic inequality, there is a famous paper by Kato and Yajima in 1989, in which they proved that it is the case. So the inequality, in fact, holds true for the resolvent at lambda, uniformly in lambda, with a constant here which does not depend on lambda. And as far as I know, the best constant of this inequality is not known. Okay? Is not known. Okay? And this is an important number for what I am interested in. I will call this the Katoyajima inequality. As probably you very well know, once you list this inequality to the shredding revolution flow by Kato's muting, then this inequality is the one which permitted, in fact, Book, Planchon, Stolker, and Takville-Darsade to prove Stricart's estimates for the flow associated to the inverse square potential. Okay, so this is the first. So this is the first one. Remember, weighted relic inequality, which is moving to the resolvent, is a Kato-Yajima inequality. So what about the other one? The other one, I recall you, is an inequality for the gradient of the resolvent, okay, in L2, which you want to control with xf in L2, where f is the non-hodomogeneous term of the resolvent equation. So it is clear when you write down the fundamental solution. When you write down the fundamental solution, for example, here in dimension three, the fundamental solution is this exponential e to the i x square root of lambda divided by x, that when you compute the gradient of the resolvent, so when you want to compute the gradient of this function here, so in particular you have to differentiate this fundamental solution, so when you differentiate this one over x, you gain one over x squared at infinity, which is telling you that, for example, at infinity you are gaining decay. At infinity, you are gaining dk, but at some point you have to differentiate also the numerator, and here you don't gain any k because the derivative of x is homogeneous of degree zero. So, this is telling you that the gradient of the fundamental solution at infinity is behaving exactly as the fundamental solution. So, there is no additional decay gained by the gradient. So, an inequality like this just cannot hold uniformly in lambda. This means that if you want to gain some additional decay, If you want to gain some additional decay for the gradient, you have at least two possibilities. The first one is to consider only the tangential gradient here, so that you don't see this numerator. Okay? And this is the argument Alamorave, somehow, which Moravecz introduced in the 60s to study the scattering for the Klein-Gordon equation. But there is another possibility to gain decay, which I should say maybe Alasommer first. I should say maybe Alasommerfeld, which is just to kill this direction here. So instead of compute the gradient of the solution, you just kill this direction, multiplying the solution by a suitable gauge factor, which is related to the somehow, to the so-called summer federalization condition for Helm also. And then you gain decay. There is a famous paper of the 70s by Ikebe and Saito, in which they do exactly this. And more precisely, in 10 years ago, In 10 years ago, Barcelona, Vega, and Siouve proved that for the Helmholtz equation, so when you study the resolvent, so you do have a uniform estimate for the gradient all over the complex plane, but I mean, if you are outside from a cone, here the cone is lambda depending on epsilon, okay, then you have this kind of elliptic estimate. But while when you are inside the cone, then you have to change the gauge, okay? And this The gauge okay, and this is something which is true, okay, and which is exactly in the style in the same style of what I was telling before. Unfortunately, those constants C1 and C2, I mean, they do not know the sharp value of those constants. They either are not interested in following the best constants in their argument. And the argument to prove these inequalities here is completely based on real analytical methods. Also, notice that now by hard inequality, you can go down with the You can go down with the gradient with u squared divided by x squared, and the same here because this is a complex number of modulus one, and you obtain the Katio-Yajima inequality as a consequence. Okay? A corollary of this is that if you now call F equals VU, you immediately have that if V is small with respect to the Laplacian in this sense here, then you are killing all the eigenvalues for the operator, minus delta plus V. And of course, the constant. Plus v. And of course, the constant has to be small with respect to the best constant of the previous inequality. Okay, and which is unknown at the best of our knowledge. So the quite natural question concerns with the validity of what I have been telling up to now, RELIF, RD-RELIC, Patoyazim, and Uniform Sobolev Estimate in the context of the Eisenberg. So, about RELLIF, there is some literature available, which is here, but not so clear because, for example, the best. So clear because, for example, the best constants are not written, at least as far as I understand. So, we recently proved some results concerning Relic and RD Relic with Biagio Cassan and Lucrezia Cossetti, who are there in the Euclidean setting, and we have a work in progress in which we want to do the same in the Heisenberg setting. And so, what about the uniform sobolev estimate? And so the cartoons. So, we have this result which we proved together with Lucas Roncal and Nicos Cabon. Roncal and Nicos Cabone, which is totally analogous to the one by Barcelona Bega and Sueldia was speaking about before. Here, the only difference is that we are just somehow we decided to follow this constant here in the argument and we even decided to work by changing the opening on this cone and maybe optimizing then the best constant with respect to the opening of the cones. So it's exactly the same. The codes. So it's exactly the same result. The constant here is somehow a mess, but it is an explicit number. If you give me delta, gamma, and the dimension of the Eisenberg group. Okay. And the fact that this is an explicit number is useful because, okay, this is the corollary which is Katoyazima once you apply the Hardy inequalities by the authors I was mentioning before. But when you apply this result to get the absence of eigenvalues, This result to get the absence of eigenvalues, then here, this A, we have a quantitative estimate. Okay, we can say that if A is smaller than a number, which is a number, a given number, quite likely not the sharp number, but we have a number, then if B is subordinated with respect to the free quadratic form in terms of this inequality here, then we don't have any eigenvalue. And of course, you have to understand this inequality, this subordination condition, in terms now of the other. In terms now of the Add inequality by Dambrosi, because if you think now that D is 1 over Z square, which is the inverse square horizontal potential on the Eisenberg group, then this inequality is exactly the other inequality proved by Lorenzudembros in 2004. Okay? Okay, so further questions, maybe the most relevant, at least in my opinion, questions related to these results are related with the value. Results are related with the values of the best constants. I wish to stress that even in the Euclidean case, the value of the Sharp constant of the Kato-Yajima inequality is unknown, as far as I know. And I think it's a very interesting problem from the point of view of harmonic analysis. If there is some justice, it should coincide with the value of the estimate, or the best constant of the estimate at frequency zero, which is that weighted relic inequality I was speaking about, but it's a I was speaking about, but it's unclear. Okay, I will not enter the details on the proof, and I think it's more or less what I wanted to tell you. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Luca. Is there any questions? Yeah. Hi, Luca. Just maybe I didn't understand. Maybe I didn't understand. Who is speaking? So you do not have results for d equal one, or do you? I don't know, because you're dividing. For d equal one, the inequality is critical. It's the analog of d equal two in the Euclidean case, for which the other inequality is critical. So here the critical dimension is d equal one for the Eisenberg group. Okay. So in dimension, in the Euclidean setting, in dimension two. setting in dimension two it is known that if you take minus delta plus v and v is a potential with positive mean okay as smooth as you want you always have eigenvalues in the spectrum okay and this is related to the fact that you don't have a hard inequality here the hard inequality by the ambrose you look to the constant you you realize it immediately is critical in dimension one okay this is the constant okay This is the constant, okay? So, for the dimension one, you don't expect these results. Okay, thank you. One question? Is there any questions online? Okay, so we thank you, Guy. Thank you. Can you share the screen? Okay, give me a minute.
