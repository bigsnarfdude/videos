This is my third or fourth time here, so I'm happy to be here again to give some talks. I tried to avoid getting into the fracton field for a long time because there's a lot of smart people working in that, and it's kind of intimidating, so I kind of stayed out. But through collaborators and through actually the sort of connections between high-order phases and fracton phases, I hope we have something that's interesting to say for most of the audience. Some of the stuff here will be site review, many of you are experts. Will be slightly review, many of your experts, so I'm going to go through it rather quickly. If you do see something that you want me to go over more slowly, certainly just stop and ask a question. So the right, so just as a summary for those, since we haven't had much discussion of this during this talk, we can talk about what are called higher-order topological insulators. And one kind of inclusive definition is that you have first-order topological insulators which are gapped in the bulk, but have gapless states on the surfaces, so boundaries of co-dimension one, and higher-order phases. One and higher-order phases are ones where you have protected states, or something interesting happening at, for example, corners in 2D or at hinges in 3D or corners in 3D. So these are places where multiple surfaces intersect or on defects which look like corners and things like that, like disclinations. So these are places where you can probe these high-order phases. Generically, the sort of regular surfaces are gapped, and the higher codimension surfaces or surface intersections are places where you look for interesting states or interesting fractional features. Fractional features. So let me start by thinking of my collaborators. This is sort of my work on higher TIs began with work with my student Vladimir, who's now at Penn State, and with Andre. And then the work I'm going to talk about today, the work I'm going to talk about today is in collaboration with EZ and Fiona, as well as my students, Oleg and Julian, and then Lucas Fagner and Will Wheeler, who are another set of. Lucas is a faculty member, computational faculty member at Illinois, and Will is a student. So I'm going to talk about some. Will as a student. So, I'm going to talk about some recent work related to this, the papers that I worked on with these collaborators. So, I'm going to begin by reviewing classical multipole moments and discuss how they're realized in crystals. I'm going to talk about quantized multipole moments and models of topological insulators in crystals, and then I'm going to talk about how to calculate these things, both in single-particle physics and mini-body physics. And then I'm going to talk about this new thing, which are these, what I'm going to call mini-body multiple insulators, which was where the connection to some kind of things related to fractons will appear. To some kind of things related to fractons will appear. So, first of all, for classical multiple moments, we sort of have these standard point-charged pictures. Each one of these different moments has sort of a standard intrinsic dimension, sort of the first place you can imagine defining these things, at least in the clearest sense. And something interesting happens, which is that if I try to calculate these dipole moments, or for example, this dipole moment, and I change my origin of coordinates, the value for the dipole moment changes, and it changes by something proportional to phi, which is the total monopole charge. If I do the same thing, Charge. If I do the same calculation for this QXY quadruple moment, I shift the origin of coordinates by R, and my quadruple moment changes by something proportional to the polarization and something proportional to the neutral, or the total charge in the system. So if I want the nth moment to be well defined, I need all the lower moments to vanish. And that doesn't mean you can't define a dipole moment in a system which isn't neutral. It just means that the result depends on your choice of origin. So it's not physically realized, it's not a physical observable in that case, in the same way that it would be if everything vanishes. So when I talk about a system which is polarized, I'm imagining a new Which is polarized, I'm imagining a neutral system. But talk about a system which has a quadrupole moment, I'm thinking about a system which is both neutral and unpolarized. That's the constraints I'm going to be applying throughout the entire talk. So what do we find if we have these moments in crystals or in solids, for example? So if I have a polarization, which is the dipole-1 period of volume, I can define this as a neutral material, and what it gives rise to is it gives rise to a surface charge. So you have this boundary charge where the polarization is changing from being P inside to being zero outside. P inside to being zero outside. And quadruple density for a neutral unpolarized material. I can have a slab of material with a QXY quadruple moment. Instead of giving you surface charge, it gives you surface polarization. So on the surfaces here, for example, the surface normal to X and normal to Y, you have these tangent edge polarizations. And you can kind of see pictorially that the polarizations on the edges are converging and diverging from the corners, which is why you'll have, in one case, you can have these corner charges. So where the polarizations converge and diverging is where you have this bound charge. And so the surface. Bound charge. And so the surface polarization and corner charge can be related to this sort of bulk quadruple moment. So they're surface properties, but their surface properties dictated by a bulk moment, just like this surface charge here density is dictated by the bulk moment. And just in case you see me adding up these moments later on, in their intrinsic dimensions, each multipole moment density has units of charge. So in 1D, polarization density is dipole divided by length, so charge, and quadrupole in 2D, it's quadrupole moment divided by area, it's units of charge. So if I'm adding up different moments, So, if I'm adding up different moments, I'm usually adding them up in some dimension where they have the same units. So, don't be concerned about that. So, that's sort of a, so I specified something about quadrupole moment by talking about surface polarization and corner charge, but I want to think about this as a bulk property. So, what's actually the bulk, what's a bulk operational definition for a quadruple moment? So, imagine I take an insulating sheet that's neutral in the bulk and unpolarized, and then imagine I just glue polarization to the surface. Polarization to the surface. This would be an edge effect, right? This is a surface effect. So I glue these 1D chains in the boundary. And now I can ask about the corner charge. Well, I have these two polarizations on the boundary. If I do some integral here to get the total charge in the corner, then these two edge polarizations just contribute linearly, and I get the corner charge as the sum of the two edge polarizations going into that corner in that case. If instead, instead of having polarizations glued on the boundary, if instead I have a bulk moment, you can also see on the edge, there's a diet. You can also see on the edge, there's a dipole, minus plus, minus plus, minus plus, and then minus plus. So they skin, you have this edge dipole moment. But the key feature here, compared to the surface case, is that now the corner charge is shared by the two edges. It's not contributed independently. And so this sort of operational definition, the bulk definition of the quadruple moment, is the failure of this equation to hold. So it's an obstruction for this equation holding. And essentially, what you can do is you can take the corner chart, subtract out the two edge polarizations, and if that's non-zero, you have a volt quadrical moment. So that's the sort of definition. Moment. So that's the sort of definition I'm using for the clinical moment. It's independent of what I glue to the surface in this case. I can glue polarization to the surface, I can glue charge to the surface type of thing. So this is one way to give some independent definition in this case. Okay, so now that we have some basics on classical multipole moments and some subtleties about them, let's now talk about how to get these multiple moments in crystals. So first let's talk about dipole moment, right? So I want to think about a system which has a quantized dipole moment. I'm thinking about a topological dipole system here. About a topological dipole system here. And so, what I want to do is to pick a symmetry under which the polarization is odd and enforce that symmetry. So, in this case, I have a collection of ions, a collection of electrons. If I, for example, enforce inverse a symmetry in 1D, the polarization is odd because it's a vector. And so then the polarization anomaly must vanish. But in a crystal system, as you know, the polarization is not well defined unambiguously. It's only well defined up to a quantum. And in 1D, this quantum is just an integer multiple of the charge. Is just an integer multiple of the charge. And so this equation of 2p equals 0 only has to hold mod integer in 1D systems, or mod integer multiples of the charge. And this gives actually two solutions, 0 and e over 2, which are compatible with these symmetries. And so, for example, if I pick inversion symmetry, this configuration where the electron is right on the ion is the case p equals 0. And then I can also have the case where they're right in between the ions. And if I have periodicity, this is also a configuration which preserves inversion symmetry, for example. And this is the case where I'd have polarization E over 2. Polarization E over 2, in this case. So the interesting thing is that this case of polarization E over 2 was noticed many years ago now to be in a top flux insulator phase protected by reflection symmetry, or what now would be called an obstructed atomic insulator phase protected by this symmetry in this case. And many of you know the simple realization of this type of system with a non-zero polarization, which is the SSH chain. This is an example of the SSH chain with some unit cell. I have a dimerized hopping between. Unit cell, I have a dimerized hopping between spinless orbitals, so strong, weak, strong, weak, and then weak, strong, weak, strong. And so these two different configurations put the electrons in the middle of the unit cell and electrons right in between the unit cells. And you can calculate the polarization of the system to find out by calculating the bary phase. And you find out in the system that the polarization is zero and one half, in this case, because the baryphase is quantized due to, say, the inversion symmetry to be zero or pi. And this gives you this structure. Now, you can also imagine how to connect the bulk polarization with. The bulk polarization with the surface charge in this case. I mentioned that if you have a bulk polarization, you get a surface charge. In this case, if I cut the system so I have a surface, you get these two sort of modes on the boundary. And what you can do now is have the system filled up to half filling. In the simple case, when the modes are in the gap somewhere, what you do is you fill up all the valence band plus one of these two modes. And depending on which one I pick, in this case at half filling, we'll sort of pick the direction of the polarization. In this case, if I put it in the right mode, I get some polarization over here and the charge. Polarization over here, and the charge localized near the surface in this case will be exactly plus or minus one-half. In this case, that's what you find for this SSH chain. And the one-half is not contributed by the zero-motor, the-gap, say the one-half is contributed by this bulk piece here. The thing that the zero motor contributes integer charge, so that's actually not crucial for the fractional charge. The fractional part is coming from the bulk background charge. Okay, so now if we want to make a quadrupole, we can imagine taking two dipoles and then separating them in real space. And then separating them in real space. That's the kind of way to imagine getting some quadrupole system by taking two dipoles and splitting them in real space. And so we're going to use that to go to quadrupolar model. So we expect the quadrupoles to form from two dipoles. So for a free fermion lattice model, we expect we need at least two occupied bands, right? One for each of these dipoles. And we want the system to have a vanishing polarization. And the way we're going to enforce it to be vanishing is to pick some symmetry into which it's quantized. And then tune the model so the quantized value is zero instead of one-half in this case. And so we need to choose symmetries. And so we need to choose symmetries if we want to quantize quadrupole moment, we need to choose symmetries under which the quadrupole is odd and under which the polarization is odd. The polarization is going to be odd as I said to enforce it to be zero, and we want the quadrupole to be odd because it's also only well defined up to a quantum, so that it's going to be quantized to be zero or half. So what we can do now is take four degrees of freedom per unit cell and then make dipoles in every unit cell. So I now have a pair of vertical dipoles for these SSH chains. And now I can imagine dragging them apart by adding couplings in the horizontal direction. Couplings in the horizontal direction. And this looks like a very simple generalization of the SSH chain. Unfortunately, it has a problem, which is that a half-filling gets gapless. And you can see that because each cluster is now just a four-side-time binding model. And so it has energies cosine of zero, cosine of plus or minus pi over two, and cosine of pi. And so at half filling, it's actually gapless in this case. We can fix this by just adding a phase shift around each plaquette. And so for this choice of spinless orbitals, you can just add some magnetic flux in each plaquette, which will twist the boundary conditions on this four-site system, which makes On this four-site system, which makes it you have this, in this case, at pi flux, have this double degeneracy. In principle, any flux will fix this degeneracy problem, but only pi flux is compatible with the mirror symmetries I'm going to enforce. And so that's why we've chosen pi in this case. And so we just choose a gauge where we have some minus signs now on some of these Hoppings. And for spinless fermions, this minus sign is some magnetic flux. If these were spinful fermions with orbitals, for example, this minus sign could be coming from some form of a coupling. But for now, I'm just going to treat it as spinless to make it simple. To make it simple. And we can now see if it has the same properties as the quadruple moment. So I can cut the system, and now I see that I have these sort of paired dipoles, except on the boundary where I have this detached dipole moment. So it has this sort of edge polarization in this case. If I cut it the other way, I can see that I get edge polarization on the top and bottom surfaces, which again matches the property of the quadruple moment. And if I cut it on the corners, you can see these characteristic detached modes, which indicates, but is not equivalent to some fractional charge in the corner. Some fractional charge in the corner, but this is actually going to give us some case where we have this fractional corner charge. And so it exhibits all the phenomenology of the quadrical moment. And in fact, this model has a quadruple moment density of E over 2, just like in the case of 1D, where I have the SSH chain with dipole density 1 half. So let's test this model a little bit more carefully by, for example, allowing myself to tune two parameters, gamma and lambda. So gamma is the intracell set of hoppings. So each one of these is some pairs of hoppings, and they're all So each one of these is some pairs of poppings and they're all the same strength. It also is pi flux within unit cell. We know that if a gamma equals lambda, the system is gapless, because with gamma equals lambda, it's a pi flux square lattice, which has two direct cones. That's a gapless system in this case. And so that's going to be the critical point between the quadrupolar phase when lambda dominates and the trivial vanishing quadrupolar phase when gamma dominates. And so what you can do is you can calculate the boundary spectrum of this model on a square open geometry. On a square open geometry as a function of gamma over lambda. And you can see there's four mid-gap states, these red lines for each value of gamma when gamma is smaller than lambda. When gamma equals lambda, there's a phase transition, and beyond, when gamma dominates, there's no more localized corner modes. You can actually calculate the corner charge as a background density of two electrons per cell, excepting the corners will just plus or minus E over 2 in the quarter border pattern. And you can also calculate the edge polarization, and you can find out in the zero correlation limit, there's exactly one half polarization. There's exactly one half polarization on the edge. As you tune the intracellul hopping stronger, you can see the polarization is still localized on the edge, but it's only exponentially localized there, which actually indicates that this edge polarization is a bulk property because it starts to decay into the bulk in its natural way. And eventually, if I go beyond the quadripolar phase, in this case, I find a system which has no edge polarization. So it sort of matches all the phenomenology we expect. Okay, you can do something similar in 3D with octopole moments. So octopole OXYZ has certain. So, octopole OXYZ has surface quadrupole, it's got hinge polarization, has corner charge. And you can make a model using two canceling quadrupole. So, I can have a cubic model with pi fluxes. This is a natural place you can see the sort of quadrupolar behavior. And for example, I can have a quantized quadrupole moment while keeping all three reflections, Mx, My, and Mz, as good symmetries. So, this model again has some octopole moment density in three dimensions of E over two. And so, it's an example of some kind of multipole insulator in this case. Okay, so so far. Insulator in this case. Okay, so so far what I've shown is that these are some models which exhibit the phenomenology of what we expect for multipole moments. They have surface densities, so multipole moments one lower dimension. They have corner charges and this type of thing. But how do we actually calculate these quadripole moments from a bulk wave function in this case? How do I actually calculate this thing besides just sort of looking and comparing the different boundaries? And it turns out that's actually not a simple thing. It's not obvious, at least it wasn't obvious to us when we first began on this. So the quadruple moment is just a product of So, the quadruple moment is just a product of two coordinates, x times y. But one problem is that the effective electron position operators in the lattice don't commute with each other, and they can't be simultaneously diagonalized for a generic wave function in this case. And so you can't just take the product of x times y in some simple way in this case by independently calculating x and y. What you could do is you could calculate this quantity I meant to define this operational definition, but this still requires worrying about things like surface termination, because I care about surface. Like surface termination, because I care about surface polarization and corner charge. There's still a bulk diagnostic, just a way to calculate this moment. So instead, we want to be able to diagnose multiple moments from the bulk. And for the quantized case, we can actually look for topological invariants to describe these things. You could also have systems with quadruple moments which aren't quantized, which is probably maybe also okay. But if the case were the quantized, we can look for topological invariants. So sometimes, so I guess we tried to do this and failed. We tried to do this and failed many times. We tried every topological invariant we knew about. And this idea of hidden topology, which is very simple, kind of eventually ended up providing the right idea. So sometimes the topological invariant is zero. It can be non-zero in some sub-sector of the occupied states. So an example is the quantum spin-hall effect with inversion symmetry. So if I keep inversion symmetry, or I have U1 spin conservation, I can think about dividing the system into spin up and spin down and calculating the churn number of each band separately in this case. I calculate the churn number for spin up, calculate the I calculate the term for spin up, calculate the term for spin down. What I'll find in the quantum spinall effect is the total term number is zero, but the spin up and spin down ones are both non-zero. They just cancel each other. This is something that this is sort of a very simple type of invariant you could write down for quantum spinall that was eventually replaced by the more precise Z2 invariant. So the thing is that here you have a quantum number to help resolve this topology in this case. You have spin in this case, right? Unfortunately, in our case, we don't have this nice quantum number like spin to resolve the topology. Resolve the topology. And so we had to use something a little bit different. And the key idea in this case was to resolve electrons in real space, where you sort of have what looks like some emergent quantum number or some emergent separation of states in this case. So what you do is you have your two occupied bands, so you have two clouds of electrons in real space, and you can resolve them in the x direction by calculating the Wanier functions of one direction. And what we find for this quadrupole phase is that when you do this, when you resolve the electrons in the x direction, these two overlapping energy bands. These two overlapping energy bands actually split into two separate electron clouds. The electron clouds don't talk to each other, they're separate, they're divided, they're separate in real space. They don't talk to each other. And what you can do now is that you can say, well, I have these two separate clouds. I can now ask, are these clouds polarized in this case? So I can say I can calculate the baryphase of each one of these clouds separately. And for the topological quadruple phase, you find each cloud separately has a baryphase of pi, which shows that each one of these is polarized in the direction. In the direction parallel to the cloud, and solace. So, this looks again like this quadruple moment where I have these two dipole moments which are separated in space in this case, right? So, it turns out it's not good enough that you should do this in the x direction. You have to do it in the x and y directions to avoid some subtlety. But essentially, what you can do is you can resolve them in x, resolve them in y, and you find these two clouds separate in both directions, and in both directions they have a non-trivial polarization in this case. And so this real space resolution allows you to separate the topology into these different electron sectors. Do these different electron sectors in this case. And so it turns out if both these sets are non-trivial, then the system with mirror symmetry has this top level of quadrupole moment. So what are we actually doing when I say resolving in real space? I have this system with energy bands. These are the energy bands of my quadrupole model. My low energy bands are doubly degenerate. I can now take my occupied states, and now I can perform a Wilson loop in one of the directions. Let's say along the X direction or the Y direction. And when I do that, what I find is I find what are called the hybrid. Find is I find what are called the hybrid Wagner functions, which are localized in one direction, so for example, localized in this case in the y direction, but extended plane waves in the transverse direction. And what we find for these occupied energy bands is that the Wagner bands in this case don't touch. These are now my two separate electron sectors, my two separate clouds, which are separated. So this axis here is Kx, which is a good quantum number, and the vertical axis is the Wanner center measured with respect to a unit cell. So the unit cell goes from zero to one. So the unit cell goes from 0 to 1, and these show the winer signatures of my electrons in the system, which sit inside the unit cell, but in separate locations. I can do the same calculation in the transverse direction, and again I find these sort of two separate clouds. And now what I can do is I can take, for example, one of these quasi-one-dimensional sets of states and calculate the bary phase. And for the quadrupole phase, the bary phase is pi. And in the shridial phase, it would be, for example, non-zero. So this. This is unusual. So, I didn't write a slide on this, but this is a little bit unusual because most topological insulators you're probably familiar with, if I draw the same plot, Kx versus unit cell between 0 and 1, most topological insulators you're used to dealing with have a spectral flow property in these Wanyer bands. So, for example, the Chern insider has a spectral flow property. The integer quantum Hall state, for example, its spectral flow property is just that the Wanyer center Xc is like Ky Lv squared. is like Kylv squared. So on this type of plot, the integral quantum optic would be a line, for example. It's just linear k. But anyways, the idea is that most topological insulators have gapless Wagner spectrum, because for free fermions, there's the Wagner spectrum where AD backly connected to the actual physical edge. So a turn insulator will have edge spectral flow. These systems instead have gapped edges. And so what this is doing is it's sort of looking at the topology of the gapped edge in this case, which is a 1D SSH chain, which is what we derive pictorially. And so what you find is Derived pictorially. And so, what you find in this case is this feature is sort of a bulk way to diagnose the surface topology or the surface dipoma in this case. One could do similar things with the entangled spectrum for free fermions at least, and it works out as well. So, what happens if you don't have this class, this mirror symmetry class I mentioned? Well, in some other symmetry classes, for example, if they use C4 symmetry, you can use symmetry indicators to indicate the quadruple moment, which is nice. The problem is that now if The problem is that now, if you don't have symmetry which quantizes the quadruple moment, it's not trivial to find a way to calculate the non-quantized quadruple moment. I just give you some generic non-topological quadrupole insulator and ask what's the quadruple moment. I can go back to this surface polarization corner charge business, but that's not very satisfying because it depends very detailed on the surface termination. And so we want to know how can we generally diagnose this from the bulk, and what about for many body systems where, for example, maybe symmetry indicators don't capture this result. Capture this result in as much detail as you need to get the quadrupole moment. So, what we worked on is to try to find a way to sort of calculate the quadrupole in a more generic sense based on earlier work that had been done in the late 1990s for how to do this for the dipole moment. So, if I want to calculate the mini-body, the electric polarization of the mini-body system, one thing I could do is I'm given some ground state, and I can imagine in 1D what I can do is I can twist the boundary conditions on my. What I can do is I can twist the boundary conditions on my system and recalculate the ground state of my Hamiltonian for a series of boundary condition twists. And I can integrate this baryon over these boundary condition twists to get the polarization. This is some twisted boundary condition you can try to calculate. And this is fine, but it requires you to sort of calculate the ground state on a grid. It was realized later that what you can do instead is a real space calculation. You can use a mini-body twist operator, which is an exponentiated position operator in this case, where this is the mini-body position operator. This is the mini-body position operator. And you can take the ground state expectation value of this operator. So, what you can show is that for insulators, when this operator acts on an insulating ground state, it gives you a phase factor times the original ground state plus something which vanishes in the thermodynamic limit. So in the thermodynamic limit, insulating ground states become eigenstates of this operator. And the eigenvalue, in this case, it turns out, is just the polarization. So what you can do is you can define this many-body expectation value Cx and take the log of that dynamic limit. That will effectively pull down the space factor. That will effectively pull down the space factor P, which is the charge polarization in this case. So, naively, you can think about this operator shifts the momentum of every single particle by 2 pi over L. And that, if you look at the overlap of one Slater determinant ground state with another one, that's like doing this Baryface calculation. It's like leaving a Wilson-lib overlap in that case. So there's a way to relate this back to the original Baryface formula if you assume the name by ground state is a Slater determinant. So our idea was to try to generalize this for quadrupole. Generalize this for quadrupole. So, one thing we could ask is there is sort of a baryphase calculation one can do by twisted battery positions. And it turns out there's actually not an obvious way to do this, and I'll come back, but I'll come back to this later. But what you can do instead is you can introduce some kind of many body twist operator where you replace the many body position operator by a quadrupole operator. And you can define similar quantities. You can take about the many body expectation value of this operator and the mini body ground state and take its imaginary part of the log to get a phase factor. And you can ask, does this reproduce the colorful moment or not? Chloeful moment, or not in this case. And so, what you find is it does work for free-fermi anti-binding models. You can parameterize a topological quadrupole pumping process where you tune the quadrupole model continuously from a phase which has quadrupole 1 half to quadruple 0. This is what I'm showing here. Theta is my pumping parameter. And so I've continuously changed the quadruple width from a half to zero. And these are showing the different measures. So for example, the blue dots, which are overlapping here, are my mini-body calculation. Here are my mini-body calculation, the triangles of the edge polarization, and the squares of the corner charge. For this model, they all match up, which is the right phenomenology for the quadratic moment here. And so the mini-body calculation reproduces the result we expect in space. But unfortunately, something unusual happens with this operator in the thermodynamic limit. For an insulator, as I mentioned, the usual position twist operator has this part which goes to zero in the thermodynamic limit. And what that means is that the magnitude of your expectation value goes to one in the the If your expectation value goes to one in the thermodynamic limit. This operator looks again like some kind of unitary operator in the thermodynamic limit, effectively. It becomes an eigenstate. But you find that if you take the mini-body expectation value, if you take the magnitude of the expectation value for the quadrupolement case, it actually vanishes in the theorematic limit. And so it turns out that sort of there's a question is that, so the phase factor, which is what's going to be defining the quadruple moment, doesn't seem to be well defined in the theoremic limit. So what's going on here? What's going on here? Okay. So we found out that there's an issue with this operator. And so the idea has to do the following thing. So the approach of the usual position towards operator unity in the thermodynamic limit has a physical interpretation. So the speed at which Zx goes to unity in the thermodynamic limit is determined by the charge localization length. Okay, so there is this nice beautiful formula written down by Resta and then also by Ortiz and others, which allows you to relate the magnitude of this twist. Allows you to relate the magnitude of this twist operator value to the charge localization length in this case, or the Wanner width, it's a free-fermion systems. And so, for finite-sized systems, the only time when this operator is exactly one is when the correlation length is exactly zero, which is a very trivial limit, right? The other key feature is that the magnitude of this localization length squared is actually proportional to the dipole fluctuation. So, it actually tells you how much the dipole moment is fluctuating the system. And for insulators, Moments fluctuating the system. And for insulators, the dipole has finite bounded fluctuations. And in metals, the fluctuations diverge in this case because charge can slosh around really easily. And so the point is that this 1 over L correction here is actually the dipole fluctuations, right? It's the part of the wave function which is not just an eigency of this operator, right? It's the part that actually has other pieces of dipole mixed in, which don't have just this average value in this case, right? And so it turns out that this actually leads to a criterion for metals or insulators that can be used for many body, which is that if That can be used for many body, which is that if this localization length diverges in thermodynamic limit, you have a metal, and if it's finite, you have an insulator. This is actually a mini-body characterization you can define for an insulator. And it was sort of pioneered by these authors in the late 2000s. Now, the problem is that for free-free-man systems, even if the dipole moment vanishes on average, the fluctuations are always non-zero, unless your Wannier functions are exact delta functions, which is an unrealistic limit. So, at any finite-sized Wannier functions, even in the SSH chain where they have a very small Even in the SSH chain, where they have a very small length in this case, the dipole fluctuations are non-zero. And what that means is that my mini-body expectation value of my quadrupole operator is going to have problems because there are configurations effectively where the dipole moment is non-zero. On average, it's zero. This is the issue. The expectation value of the quadrupole operator does end up having this issue because the free-free-man graph states have fluctuations of the dipole moment. So that's what drives the expectation value to be zero in this case. So you can still use the operator to work. So, you can still use the operator to work on free fermion systems or systems with finite charge localization length, but you have to be careful when taking a thermometric limit because it doesn't work out very well as far as we can tell. But there's still some open questions there. So, what we did instead is that we want to actually now study systems where this operator, quadruple operator, is well defined. So, I want a system where this thing is exactly zero. This charge localization length is exactly zero, right? And so, as I mentioned, for free-fermion systems, that only occurs when the one-year orbitals are exact delta functions, purely delta function localized, which is not very realistic. Purely delta function localized, which is not very realistic. But instead, what we can do is we can look at many body systems where we have both U1 charge and dipole conservation, because that will lock this charge fluctuation length to be zero in that case. So just as a reminder, if I have U1 charge conservation, global charge conservation, I can multiply my charge operators by some phase factors, and terms like, for example, this charge conserving hopping term are invariant in this operator. For dipole transformations, I imagine now changing my I imagine now changing my phase of my operators by something which is proportional to a linear function of the coordinates in this case. And so, what I can do now is I can have quartic terms, for example this ring exchange term, and I multiply them by the phase factors which have these coordinate dependence, and you can show that one example of a term which is invariant in this dipole symmetry is this quartic ring exchange term. But notably, no hopping terms which go between different sites are invariant, right? Only hopping terms within the same site or on the same site are invariant under this dipole. Site are invariant under this dipole symmetry in this case. So, if you're talking about these dipole systems, you're immediately going to want to talk about systems which have this sort of interactions. And a little bit later, we're going to look in more detail about this ring exchange model. So, one consequence of having this conserved dipole is that now the ground states of the system are going to be exact eigenstates of these twist operators with some fixed polarization values in this case. That's what it means now to have this correlation length zero. These are exact eigenstates. And what this also means now is I have a way I can couple my field using a pyro space factor. Can couple my field using a pyros phase factor. I can couple my rings change here into some kind of phase factor, which I'll label as this EAXY, where AXY is going to be some component of a rank II gauge field. And heuristically, we can think about for these charge operators that this gauge field is like a symmetric combination of a gradient of A in this case. And so now what I can do is I can try to now go back and reinvent 1960s physics now to click about twist using this rate 2 part of space factor in this case. So I can define what I'm calling. In this case, so I can define what I'm calling a dipole stiffness, which I take my system and I shift my gauge potential by a constant factor Q, and I ask, is my ground state energy sensitive to that shift or not? And what you can show is that if the system can have a non-zero dipole stiffness, which means it can have a dipole Drude weight, so it could be a dipole conductor, if the ground state is sensitive to this twist and thermometic limit. There's also a way you can define a dipole localization area in this case, which is proportional to the log of the magnitude. Which is proportional to the log of the magnitude of this operator. And this allows you now to relate this vocalization length to the quadrupole fluctuations. So you can just sort of follow what was done before to now give some criterion based on these quantities for dipole insulators and dipole metals, assuming that the system is already a charge insulator in this case, right? I'm assuming that the charge sector is gapped. And now I can ask questions about whether it conducts dipoles or insulates dipoles in this case. And this gives some criterion based on this twist operator, which will help isolate whether. Which will help isolate whether I have this or not. Furthermore, now I can go back and think about bary phases. So, in cases where I have the ground state, which are exact eigenstates with eigenvalue 1, then the polarization vanishes. And now when I act with uxy on this ground state, I now can show it's equal to a phase factor times something which vanishes in the thermometer limit. And what you can do now is you can define some kind of rank 2 vary phase where I imagine twisting my system with this pyrosphase factor Axy. And this allows you now to define the ground state twisted with this. Define the ground state twisted with this rank two twist, and you can show that that's going to be proportional to the quadruple moment in this case. So, in a case when the dipole moment is exactly conserved, this type of twist, this very phase twist, can give you a way to calculate the quadruple moment, but it requires that the dipole moment is conserved. Seriously. Yes? Sir, can you go by one slide? So I suppose all those cases you discussed, the dipole is the U1 charge, right? U1. Yeah. And if we take those discrete cases, If we take those discrete case, like a Zn, would you still have the dipole intricate or dipole natural type of phase? No, so I think you need U1. If I add terms to my Hamiltonian, like C dagger to the fourth power, so I have like a dipole superconductor, then you can use these things to actually determine whether it's a dipole superfluid or not, based on some other work by like, I think, Scallapino, White, and Zhang, which did it for the regular superfluid. But it's not obvious to me if you can reduce these things. I mean, I don't know what these criteria mean if I don't have a. I don't know what these criteria mean if I don't have a V1 symmetry in this case. In the superconnector case, when it's Z2, I have some way to connect it, but beyond that, I don't know of any other way. Okay, so other places you can use these twist operators, which I don't have time to discuss, is that you can use this type of quadruple twist operator to develop new types of Liebscheltz-Mattis theorems for multiple conserving systems. There are two papers that appeared recently, one by Hay, Easy, and Avanoff Prim, and one by my group at the end of last year and beginning this year. At the end of last year and beginning this year. And you can also use it to generalize other works that sort of relate Lender-type theorems and predictions for magnetic quadrupole moments, plateaus of these things. So there's ways to sort of generalize the work that was done, for example, by Al-Shakawa in the early 2000s to now these sort of quadrupole cases, which provides an interesting discussion. So in the last few minutes of my talk, let me now give an example model to show how this stuff works. And the example model I'm going to give is a dimerized ring exchange model. So I have terms which are coupled on these sort of pi-pi dimerized. Of pi-pi-dimerized ring exchange plaquettes. I have an inter-cell ring exchange lambda and an inter-cell ring exchange t in this case. And I'm going to imagine limits where lambda and t are tuned very far differently from each other, so it's going to be some gap limit. So if I let t equals zero, then the ground state of this lambda system here is just a set of decoupled plaquettes with some sort of simple entangled ground state here. I can now calculate the, I can use my mini body ground. I can use my many body ground state now to calculate the dipole localization length of the system using my many body operator. And we find it's finite and fixed to be the lattice constant squared over 2. So the system is a dipole insulator with a very small, a very short dipole localization area in this case. So then I can imagine twisting my system by doing this pyral phase twist by a factor Q, and I get a new ground state which has these phase shifts in it. And now if I calculate the mini body baryphase of the system, this has a baryphase of pi. Phase of the system, this has a baryphase of pi. And this indicates that the model, when lambda is dominant over t, this model will have a quantized quadruple moment of one-half in this case. This is what the baryphase is telling us. Okay, so in this case, I have two dipole insulator phases, one with t equals zero, a lambda dominant, and one with lambda equals zero and t dominant. They differ by this rank two berry phase, which indicates that these insulators have a either vanishing or finite value for the quadrical moment in this case. Waterpole moment in this case. Okay, so now I want to sort of at the last minute now connect this idea to now connect this dipole insulator case back to this higher order physics. So if I think about having some 1D charge insulator in this case, this sort of polarized case, the effective action which describes the polarization response of this is just the one-dimensional theta term. So theta times Ex, theta over 2π is the charge polarization. You can determine that by looking at the response equation, which are known as the Goldstone-Wilcheck response action, and you find there's a charge. Response action, and you find there's a charge density proportion to minus gradient to theta, which is this condition for bound charge, and a charge current proportion to time variants of theta. And so you can identify in this case that the dipole moment is just the theta parameter divided by 2 pi. What I showed, or what we showed Easy and Fiona and I looked at this last year, was actually a way to generalize this to these dipole insulators. So what you could find is you can write down an analogous term in 2 plus 1 dimensions, where I now have a theta term coupled to a rank 2 electric field. You can think about 2 electric field. You can think about this range 2 electric field as being electric field gradient. And so, indeed, this looks like the way a quadrature moment will couple. And so, if you work out the Goldstone-Wilcheck response equations for this type of term, you find out you get a charge density when you have a double derivative of theta, which is just the condition for a corner charge, and you find out you get a dipole current when tau is, oh, when theta is changing the function of time, which is basically giving rise to this time-dependent quadruple moment. So, you can define, or you can identify this theta term in this action as being the quadruple moment divided by 2 pi. And we expect for this. Divided by 2π. And we expect for this quadripole insular model that theta will be quantized to be 0 or pi. And in the topological phase or in the quadripolemoment phase, it will be theta is pi in this case. So you can now take this system, which has this rank 2 response action, and now you can imagine breaking the dipole U1 symmetry down to just charge conservation, but trying to preserve the total polarization zero by keeping some crystal symmetry. So imagine now taking the system, breaking dipole conservation. Breaking dipole conservation, but keeping crystal symmetry, like C4 symmetry, for example, which should freeze the dipole moment, still keep it locked in this case, at least in the ground state. And so, what you can do now is you can replace this rank 2 field, which loses its meaning because I've now broken dipole conservation. I can now replace it by the rank gradients of the rank 1 field. And what you find is you can reduce this ring exchange model. You can actually map it or adequately connect it to this two-dimensional quadrupole TI if you keep C4 symmetry in this case. So, for example, I can take this model. In this case, so for example, I can take this model, I can add to it some non-interacting hopping terms which break the dipole conservation, and I can tune them to show that the ground states are adiabatically connected in the presence of C4 symmetry. And I can simply replace this in the response action to show that the effective action here is going to be the quadratical moment dotted into the graded electric field, like we would expect in this case. So, the summary is that I can think about a refinement of charge insulators. If I have a charge insulator with conserved dipole moment, I can now ask if it's a dipole metal or a dipole. I can now ask if it's a dipole metal or a dipole insulator. If I furthermore have a dipole insulator and I can serve quadruple, I can ask if it's a quadruple metal, a quadruple insulator, and so forth. And so it gives a way to sort of organize some of these type of mini body insulators based on how they conduct or insulate multipole moments. So I'll stop there and ask for questions, and then I'm happy to answer anybody's thing. Thanks. So here you're talking about So here you're talking about just saying that it's a global type of conflict in symmetry, but like in these spectral models there is an interesting mode of gaze symmetry. Is it just the same ideas to apply a lot of the natural? So here we're really talking about the response theory to some kind of fields. I only need global conservation I'm missing. If I apply a background field, I'm asking how the system responds to that. I mean, I don't know. I mean, heuristically, what I'd like to say is something like these higher-order phases or something like the integer versions of fracton phases, right? In some sense, that's what we're seeing. There's some response. The higher-order phases have some interesting response. They even have some interesting response which looks higher rank, but they don't have like a dynamical higher rank field in this case, right? And so maybe in some sense, in some cases, maybe the fractum phases have these dynamical fields whereas the higher order phases are just like the integer versions of these with top voltage errors. But I don't know how precise that statement is. What we showed here is that there is some. Statement is. What we showed here is that there is some connection between certain types of dipole-conserving or subsystem-protected SPTs and certain high-order TIs. And they're linked by how they respond to background fields in this case. That's when we link them, whether they have quadruple modes or not. So, I mean, superficially, there's all these tantalizing connections between pictures you see for fractons and pictures you see for higher order. I think there's still a lot of open questions about how those things are precisely connected. But I would say in the hydrophase, there's certainly no background, there's certainly no dynamical rank, right? Certainly no dynamical higher rank fields. These are just responses to these background fields. Andre? Yeah. See, if I take the single, the mini-body operator for the dipole moment and do it on a slato determinant, right? I get a barrier phase, right? I get a Muslim group. What happens if I take your quadrupole operator and evaluate it on a Snater determinant? What expression? What expression would I get? And is it? So, if you do it on a slated term, it's horrible. You get something because it doesn't Fourier transform nicely. So, I don't know what, I mean, it's nasty in that case. It's just a nasty matrix. There's no simplifications from what I can tell. In a dipole conserving system, I think there's a chance that operator could simplify to something, and then maybe you could learn something about how to do it for free fermions better, but there's no simplifying. There's no simple, again, two-dimensional baryface formula for this operator. It doesn't give you something which reduces to a single integral. It depends on two momenta still. You can't kill a form of the Fourier transform. So there's not an obvious path forward with that type of analysis for dipole non-conserving systems. But maybe there is, if you took a dipole system, you can maybe learn something there. But I don't know. Can you found any operator that when you evaluate a single particle state will give you the listed one so? Will give you the listed one so we'll oh no no no no um what what I what I um one thing that one thing that I'm very interested to see if it's true or not is that you know these systems here I'm talking about dipole conservation what I'm wondering is if the condition for gapped wire bands is the same thing as saying you have a mergent dipole conservation in the ground state of the system right the different the difference between dipole conserving and not dipole conserving is actually with excitations right the ground state has a fixed dipole moment the issue is that for free Moment. The issue is that for free fermion systems, a single particle oxetation violates that. But in this quartic interaction, I have to violate a plaque, so I get two particle oxidations, which can conserve dipole, right? And so the ground state's not the issue, it's really the excited states. And so it could be that the condition for gap wire bands is equivalent to having some kind of way to define a dipole moment in the ground state in some way, which is served. But I don't know. I think there's still open questions there. All right. Sorry, sir. Sorry, sir. Yeah. Okay, sure. Oh. Just this just this picture. So if I have a charge insulator and if I change the symmetry on the earlier U12ZM, can you remind me again how all this would work? In the case, perhaps you have a supermarket. Oh, okay. So the trituner for metal or insulator requires the U1 symmetry, right? It requires the U1 symmetry, right? There is an analysis performed by Scalapino, White, and Zhang in the early 1990s that showed that if you have superconductivity, you can learn something from how you deal with these different correlation functions to define a superfluid stiffness in some similar way, right? And so there's some statement that if the system's conducting and gapped, it must have a superfluid density or something like that, right? But that's sort of some. Of some algebraic magic that works in this case with these analytic properties and functions. I don't know if there's a generic way to connect what I'm saying here to some Z in symmetric system, right? The case there works for some special reasons with the correlation functions. It's not obvious that there's a way to do that here. Yeah. Maybe we have the rest of the session off-wise. Let's thank Taylor and then we can meet for a second try at our picture. Yeah, right.
