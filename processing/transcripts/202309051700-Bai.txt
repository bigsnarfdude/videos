First of all, thank you for the invitation and offering this precious chance to talk. The title of the talk today will be Matters of Irrationality of Projective Picture Services. And I will start by talking about some matters of irrationality that appears in the literature. Let X be a smooth projective variety defined over the field of complex numbers, the posed of dimension D, dimension N, sorry. So in the lemma is that there must exist a dominant finite general finite. Finite general finite rational map from X to the project space where the dimension of the project space is the same as the dimension of X. To see this lemma, we can proceed by Proceed by first injecting X into a very big project space and then project it into a generic subspace or quotient. And the composition will give us such a domain direction map, or added briefly, it's nothing but the notor normalization. So, thanks to this lemma, we can define Lemma: We can define the so-called degree of irrationality. It is denoted by IRR of X defined by the minimum of all the degrees among such files. In twenty fifteen, um this environment is um studied by um by authors. Five authors Pastiani Dupoisetti and ULP They study this invariant for a hybrid surface, a very general hybrid service. Very general surface of very large degree. In the same paper, they propose a conjecture about the degree of irrationality for K-services surfaces. So suppose Sg, a KSU surface, projective KSO surface of pican number one and the genus G. Here, a genus means that the self-interception number of the generator of the group of SG. The generator of the PL group of Sg is 2G minus 2, and this G is defined to be the genus of this polarized case surface. And their conjecture is that the asymptotic behavior of irrationality degree of irrationality of such S G is expected to go to infinity as the genus go to infinity. In 2022, Wazam proposed two other measures of interruptionality called the fibrin gonality and the fibrin genus. So it's defined as follows. First, the fibring donality of a product variety X doted by PGONX is defined by the minimum number C, where C appears in the for the gonality of the fifth of a fiber. The first we make X fiber space into curves. Fiberspace into curves into curves and we consider the curity of the general favor of the fabrication. And then we take the minimum of all such numbers. This gives us an invariant of X called the fibrinality. Parallel, we can define the fibrin genus, which we will denote as V G N of X. It is defined similarly, but here in the definition, we just replace the gonality as the geometric genus. So, roughly speaking, it is the minimal, sorry, metric. So, it is the minimum of the geometric genus of the fibers for all possible fabrications into curves. Well, these two notations are quite similar, so I will maybe pay a little bit of attention. The notion of fibring genus has already been studied by N and a lot of the case of surfaces. So, in the case where X is the case or surface, the fibrin genus of X is the same thing as the so-called convariant, which is called in article of N-analysis. A lot of failed. They studied this invariant for very general caser surfaces, project caser surfaces. And one of their theorems is as follows. This is that suppose S G is a projective history surface. History surface of keypad number one and the DNS B. Then we have a very good estimation of the fabric genus of such case services. The result is that the fabric genus of such SG grows as fast as the square root of the size of the size of the square Grows as fast as the square root of g which is amazing. At the colory, we can see that you want to understand the similar phenomena as proposed in the conjecture that I just erased. We can see that the limit of the fibrin genus of SG is It's infinity. One of the reasons I think these two notions are proposed is that they have very close relation with the degree of irrationality with the restroom. Sorry. In the same article, where she proposed these two notions, one proves the following relations. For any projective variety X, we have the following two inequalities. The first one is that the fibrin galaxy of X is bounded above by the degree of rationality of X. And the second one is that the Fabrication of the Liberality of the And the second one is that the fibrinality is also bonded above by a combination of fibring genus of this form. So this is a general theorem that holds for any productivity. And in this talk, we will concentrate on t-shirt surfaces. So for inner So, in the case of Q3 surfaces, we can have a finer relationship between these three invariants. The statement as follows: So, suppose X S projective laser surface. Opica number one Then one of the following cases could say since that in fact we have the we have equality of the first inequality. Quality. And the other case is something like the other side of this equality. So we have fabric gonality of X is greater or equal to the Fabric genus of X, but up to some power. So here is 21 and here's 2. Uh X here is Sorry This theorem can help us to understand the subtotic behaviors of these three invariants. Let me record a little bit for the degree of irrationality. As we have discussed, we have the following conjecture by Bastian Nelly. The voice and other standards is that the limit. The limit soup of the debris irrationality of H is infinity. As far as I know, we don't really know much about this conjecture. One of the main results in this direction is the theorem of Stepliton, which states that the dual irrationality may be may group may it groove. may groom may it grew but it grew not that fast so it says that the degree of irrationality of f g is bounded above by something like square root of g but we don't know a lower bound for the fibrin genus We know the results of another set that we discussed just now. You see that the limit of the fibrin genus of Sg is infinity and it grew as fast as square root of G. And for the last one, the fabric. And for the last one, the fibrinality, we have the following equivalent, which says that the fact that the degree of irrationality tends to infinity is the same as saying that the fabric tends to infinity. So, since it is conjectured that the irrationality is tending to infinity, we should also expect that the fibrinality tends to infinity as well. Now, the proof of this equivalence is not that hard, admitting the first theorem, A. So, let's give, let me give. So let's give let me give a sketch of the proof here. First of all, this direction is more or less obvious since we know that the fibrin ingonality is smaller in any case. Smaller in any case. So if the fabric gonality tends to infinity, this forces the irrationality goes to infinity as well. And for this direction, we have two things. First, by the theorem of N-Laudefeld, we know that the fibrin genus tends to infinity. This is the theorem of n-laudfeld. And also, And also uh uh with my theory sorry and uh and and also um fair assumption we want we we know that the dual irrationality also tends to infinity. This is our assumption and in both cases combined with the theorem A there we find that Here, we find that we can conclude that the fibrinality should also tend to infinity. So, we can make this proof rigorous, a little big winning hunt. So, that is the proof of theorem B using theorem A. So, in the rest of the time, I think I have 10 minutes. Let me say some words about the proof of theorem A. Theorem Adams is a very good idea. So for um project case state surface of pickup number one, I want to prove um either of the two cases happen. Either of the two cases happen. So, right now, let me denote D, the fibrinality of the Q-certain surface X. This means we will have a rational map from X to a base curve, which is necessarily a rational curve, but it's not important for the moment. Important for the moment. Such that the fibers, the general fibers, let's note XB for the fiber curve over a point B. It has connected D, so that means that we have a map from XP to P1 of degree E to one. Let me note this map. One thing that I want to do is to make this map into family. This map into family that is since for every b in the base space, we have such a map. So, we can ask if we can make this into a family over B. But the problem is that we cannot do so essentially because that this type B of degree D is not unique. But we can prove that we can choose many such fabbies for each fabric. Let me note. Fabi is for each fiber. Let me note 5 B1, 5BN for large enough, which is we can have this map and it proves that for n large enough, this map can, well, it's not too precise. We can prove that for certain n and for certain chosen five such maps, we can make them into a family. To summarize, There is a factorization of the rational map S via another surface S cram. Surface S gram, which are called the factorization phi and G, satisfying the following conditions. First of all, this phi S degree dividing D, which was the fibring connective. And second, the fiber curve of this she has a geometric genus bounded above by I uh is that a number The next step is to analyze this surface S cram thank you the since the S cram is um is dominated by a it's dominated by a dominated by a QSR surface by the classification of data on surfaces we know that we don't have so much choice of S prime at least directionally so S prime is either irrational or it is birational to an inertial surface or it is birational to another case surface Another case surface. In the first case, consider the map phi. We have a phi from S to P2. So at the conclusion, we know that the degree of irrationality of S will be small or equal to the degree of phi, which by the first purpose, the The first proposition, the first point of the proposition is small or equal to d, which is the fabric of S. Where's my S? Sorry, I confused S and X here. And since OF has another way around, this implies that the degree of irregularity of S is the same as the favorite randomity of S. The denial of S and that is the case A So for the second case when S prime is biretinal to an irrecurrent surface so let's suppose S prime is an irrecurrent surface then in this case the pico rank of S prime is 10 so the pico rank of X is So the pica rama x is at least 10. Whereas we have supposed that x is of x is of picaracle 1. So we exclude this case. And for the case of K-Stary surface, by the Hart theory and the fact that S is of p pi rank 1, we can prove that the p pi rank of x prime. The p pa rank of S prime is the same as the letter of S, which is one. So, um, so now S prime is also a QSer surface generated by one-line bundle. So, we suppose the genus of S prime to be G prime and the genus of S to be G. By a pure lattice theoretic argument, we can find a relationship between g prime g and the degree of this phi, which is sorry, g minus one and g prime minus one is divided above by the degree of phi up to the power of 21. So now we have these two. So now we have these two inequalities. So with these two inequalities, that's the theorem of N. Ladder's field. We see that the fabric genus of Sg Of Sg grow as fast as square root of G. These three conditions together will imply the inequality in B and the case B is proved in this way. So let me stop here. Are there any questions?
