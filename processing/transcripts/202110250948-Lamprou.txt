Have years with a number of people in order to probe holographically the interior of black holes. The first paper was with Daniel Zaparis last year, last September, where we kind of laid out the basic framework of this work, the basic philosophy of the approach. And there are two papers currently in preparation, one with Daniel and Jan de Boer and one with Ping Yao. And one with Pingao. Both should appear fairly soon. And my goal for the next half an hour is to review the key ideas of all this work and explain to you at least an approach that I personally find promising for seeing behind the black holes. In fact, I will show you some evidence that it actually works the way we would like it to work. Work. So, the question we want to ask is a very simple one. Imagine that you're an observer in a mathematically ADS space. You live somewhere and you have a black hole at the center of your universe. And you live somewhere far away from this black hole until you decide to jump inside. What will you see after you cross the horizon? The particular question I would like to ask is if I have prepared the holographic dual of that ABS universe, That ABS universe, the conformal field theory in my lab, then what could I do from the outside? What CFT operator could I measure in order to predict your experience? And more precisely, I would like to know what CFT operators are dual to a local field in the interior. This could be just the value of a scalar field or it could be the energy density. This is the question that we will try to. That we will try to define. And there's two comments I want to make right off the bat, which I think are important for appreciating the perspective that we're taking here. The first is why this question is important, and the second is why this question is high. So this question is important because this is closely related to the information problem, in particular to the firewood version of the information problem. The question of whether a particular black hole Of whether a particular black hole microstate has an interior geometry, whether that is smooth or if it's excited or if you hit some structure at the horizon, can be answered by a measurement of that type. A measurement of, let's say, the local energy density seen by an unfalling observer. So, this is why it's important. However, it seems to be a particularly stubborn question and currently And currently, although there's many ideas out there, and you'll hear some of them in this workshop, currently, even if I give you full computational control over the conformal field theory, you can simulate it in your lab and you can perform arbitrarily complex measurements on it. You wouldn't know what operator to measure to answer this question. This operator in the interior is not defined in the CFD. Find in the CFD, at least not in the general case. Of course, there are specific contexts where we have some understanding of it. We're not completely in the dive. So, my goal and our goal has been to try to define that object so that we can reduce the puzzle of the structure of the interior to a technical question. And this is exactly what I'll try to illustrate in this talk. So, our approach will be very operational, and I want to review. Be very operational, and I want to review the basic setup because it may feel familiar to some, or maybe it will look a little contrived to some others. So, I want to spend a few moments explaining the setup. And that will be key for understanding the developments we have done. So, our approach will be to actually introduce a physical observer into the system, a probe subsystem that will throw inside the big black hole we want to explore. We want to explore. And our goal will be to then understand the rules for how to take an operator outside in the exterior of the big black hole, which we have fairly good and reliable tools for recovering it in the CFD, and then learn how to propagate that along the trajectory of this infalling observer. So in our setup, this infalling observer will be our This info zero will be another black hole. It will be a small black hole that we will prepare and we'll throw it in the big black hole. The choice of the probe is of course perhaps not it's it's a convenience it's a choice of convenience. There's lots of things about the physics of black holes that we will see how they play out in formulating the story and making it concrete. But this will be our probe and the But this will be our probe and the our uh our point will be to learn how to propagate an operator along this trajectory. Of course, you know, if you if you think of this problem in semi-classical gravity, you know what kind of operator you need to construct. If I give you the local bug stress tensor, you just have to contract it with the appropriate vector field and integrate over Causes flies and that will take you anywhere you like. But we do not want to do this. We want to define that operator directly in the CFD. We do not want to rely on semi-classical results. We did not want to rely on semi-classical reasoning. Okay, so I want to describe now how we introduce this black hole observer into the system. Here is a clean way of doing it. So I start with a CFD, which I will call the system, and this is the CFD that will describe my universe, the universe I want to explore. And I'll take a second copy of that CFT, and I'll call it the reference. And that's a convenient device for certain reasons. Convenient device for certain regions that we'll see soon. And I will initiate them in the thermal field double state. If I'm more precise, I want to initiate that in a micro-canonical version of the thermofield double state, but I will skip that detail here because there's only limited time. What does this do? What this does is describes, gravitationally describes the configuration of two black holes, static black holes in these two universes, connected by a wormhole. By a wormhole. This black hole here will be our observer. And our observer is entangled with an external subsystem, the reference. This is a means of tagging our observer, of marking the observer from the outside. Okay, so far we have introduced our little probe, but it lives in a boring universe. It's an empty universe. So let's make it interesting. We can do this in two steps. First, we can act with a translation. Let's say a translation acts with one of the conformal generators, conformal transformations to shift that black hole far out towards the asymptotic boundary before we act on the system with some unitary V that will create whatever configuration we want to explore. Could be a bunch of galaxies, or it could be in our setup a big black hole that we want to fall inside. Of course, everything I'll say from now on will be valid in the limit where the structural In the limit where the structure that I want to explore, the scale of the structure I want to explore is much larger than the scale of the object I'm using as a protocol. So this is the setup. This is kind of the initial condition. And then you want to evolve that system with Galen's equations. And the history, the space-time will look sort of like this. Here I'm drawing, this is not exactly Penrose diagram, since we have two black holes, but I'm drawing a cartoon of what the evolution would look like. Cartoon of what the evolution would look like. This is the horizon of the big black hole that I want to fall inside, and this is sort of the apparent horizon or approximation of the world length of the small black hole that falls inside. And of course, from the outside, all I see is, from the asymptotic reference frame, all I see is just a black hole merger. But if I was on a planet that rotates around my little black hole, in that frame, of course, nothing happens at the horizon. I just continue falling. On the horizon, I just continue falling inside. Okay, so it's exactly this is our setup. Two black holes, the big one that I want to explore, and the small one, which I call my observer, and I have entangled it with a reference. And the approach is very simple to describe in pictures. We go back to this initial state, and we just choose a bulk operator in a small neighborhood of my A small neighborhood of my probe. I call this neighborhood the atmosphere. Such operators we know how to describe holographically. We have reliable techniques that we trust to represent them as operators on the boundary. We just need to find some entanglement wedge and reconstruct it using one HKLL or entanglement wedge reconstruction in terms of operators on the boundary CFT. So we have an initial configuration. So we have an initial configuration and an operator at the initial moment in time, which I've expressed entirely in the CFD. So the next step, and this is essentially what I'm going to explain from this point on, is how to take now this operator, which we know in the CFD, and translate it along the proper time of the infalling probe. What do I mean by the proper time here? Since this is The proper time here, since this is not really a warline, it's a black hole that back reacts. What I mean by proper time is simply the Rielder time, the Schwarzschild time, in the neighborhood of the black hole. In the neighborhood, in the rest frame of my black hole, the geometry looks approximately Schwartzield, assuming it's not rotating. There is a time-like killing vector in that local atmosphere neighborhood, and translations along this killing vector is what... Along this Keeling vector is what I refer to here as a proper type. So, how do we do this? So, we can actually make progress if we first allow ourselves to make one more assumption, which we will remove later on, but first we will make it. If I make the assumption that in the setup, the state of the The state of the box in the neighborhood of my probe is in local thermal equilibrium, then we know what the generator of that Schwarz-Lu clock in the CFT is. And it's an object called the modular Hamiltonian, which I will describe. So the point is that what is special about this local thermal equilibrium condition I'm talking about, I'm defining this as essentially a Defining this as essentially the KMS condition. If I consider correlators in the near horizon region, then they satisfy this relation, which goes by the name the KMS. But this i beta here is a translation in Schwarzschild time by an imaginary amount equal to the inverse temperature of the black hole. If this condition is satisfied, then this is a condition of local thermal equilibrium. Equilibrium and we can use this in order to argue that for the holographic dual of the Schwarzenegger translations in that label. The holographic dual is very simple. Remember that we have initiated our system in this state, which is a system and a reference entangled to each other. All we have to do is trace out that reference and obtain a reduced state for my system. The logarithm of that reduced state is called the modulus. Of that reduced state is called the modular Hamiltonian, and it can be shown to precisely act like KMS transformation. There's a difference, of course, in these two relations. This is true for any operators, phi 1 and phi 2. This is only true near my black hole. But these two statements combined together tells us that the modular Hamiltonian, this operator defined in this way, will act in the near-horizon region like this fortune-time translation. And therefore, in this very restricted sense, And therefore in this very restricted setup, if we assume local thermal equilibrium, we have the answers to the question we're looking for. Okay, now clearly this is not satisfactory. All the interesting cases appear when you allow yourself to have things hidden in your problem. So we're going to have to work a little harder to solve the problem in a more general class of situations. But this is the first step and it's a key thing. This is the first step, and it's a key first step. Okay, before I explain how to remove this condition of local thermal equilibrium, I want to take one step back. I introduced a setup that may feel natural or contrived, depending on your inclinations, and I gave you a very formal argument for why this does the very simple job that I want you to do. So a question that you may have is, does it work? That you may have is: does it work? Can you actually compute something with it? This is the question that I also asked about 10 months ago in some conversations with Ping Gao, and we started trying to identify a setup where we can explicitly compute these things and show that it works. Let me first comment on that. I won't explain the details of the calculation. I'll just explain to you the setup and show you the results that we obtain. The setup in which we can explicitly use this tool is ADS2 JT. Is ADS2 JT gravity, which we understand now is related to a subsector of a pair of SYK models, two quantum mechanical systems. So here we can construct a very similar setup, which is however under computational control. What we have to do is take a pair of these SYK systems and initiate them in the Themofield double to create a bulk black hole. We can do this by approaching. We can do this by constructing the appropriate Euclidean path integral. This would be the big black hole we want to jump inside, in this case a black hole in ADS2. If I want to introduce a little particle that falls inside that black hole, I would simply insert an operator somewhere along this path in the global preparation of my state, and I would just simply introduce some little quantum that will fall inside. In our case, we want to do something more complicated. We want to do is something more complicated. We want to introduce an object with a large number of microstates, which we then entangle with an external reference. So instead of acting with an operator, we'll act with a unitary that entangles my system with an external system, the reference. This is the preparation of the state of interest, but it's explicit. And I can trace out the reference, construct. And I can trace out the reference, construct the loose density matrix, and ask the question: if I take a bulk field, phi, and flow it with this modular Hamiltonian, does it actually act like a translation? What do you expect if it does act like a translation? Well, here's something that is of great interest, and you do expect it will happen. Once you cross the light cone of some left-inserted operators, even though your initial operator phi was entirely exclusive, Operator phi was entirely expressed in terms of right SYK degrees of freedom, this flow should be able to sense the crossing of those light points. How will it? Through a commutator. Through this commutator. You modular flow your operator commuted with the left and you take an expectation value. What you expect from that is that you'll start from some value that is zero since at first you're space like separated, but it's going to be Your space lag separated, but it's going to spike at the moment when you cross that line. And this plot here is the result of an SYK computation. It's the result of a pretty long and complicated SYK computation, which is done within, of course, an appropriate series of approximations. But this, in the last beta J limit, for the experts, this is the way, this is the plot of. This is the plot of a modular flow field of the right with a left inserted operator at different boundary times. And you can be quantitative about this, the location of the peaks, it is computed analytically and it matches exactly the proper times at which you're crossing those light points. So this is an explicit construction that takes an operator behind a black operator. Operator behind the black hole horizon and it can diagnose collisions with left moving with operators inserted from the left. How much time do I have? Like 12 minutes. 12? Okay. Alright. Now, of course, this doesn't solve the greater problem, but this is a first step, a first indication that we're A first indication that we are onto something. And it's also an indication that this is not just a formal machinery, it's an actual useful tool that you can hope to use, to exploit, to explore the interior of black holes. Okay, but we were constrained by that assumption here I made. In the general situation, we only expect that relation, this modular flow correspondence with. Flow correspondence with the proper time flow. We only expect this if we have this local thermal equilibrium. And this is a very severe restriction to the zimovalidity. So what happens if you're not? What if you have citations in your initial state that are going to get absorbed by your probe? Well, you could imagine that if you had a way of somehow detecting those excitations and removing them. Those excitations and removing them. If you had a way of starting from your general state and identifying a nearby local thermal equilibrium state, then all you have to do is to use the modular Hamiltonian for that nearby local equilibrium state. All you need is a way of doing that, though, to kind of identify a nearby local equilibrium state. So here's, let me give you an example of how this idea works. I want to explain the key idea that Explain the key idea that Jan and Daniel and I developed within a toy example and then map it onto our problem. Say that you want to define Lorentz Bus. The situation, so if I give you of course the, if you have a, I'm sorry, you have a QFT on Minkowski space and you want to define Lorentz Bus. If I give you the local stress energy tension, of course the situation is trivial. You know how to do it. You just take the approach. How to do it. You just take the appropriate integral of the stress tensor with the appropriate contract with the appropriate vector field. But what if I give you the global Hamiltonian instead? Not the local stress energy tensor, but the global Hamiltonian. Can you still construct the boosts? And the answer is you can. What you have to do is first you look and search the Hilbert space till you find the state that minimizes the energy, the global energy. This is the Vacuum state. the global energy. This is the vacuum state. And then what you do is you split your space-time into two sub-regions, into two complementary regular edges, and compute the and obtain the modular Hamiltonian associated to this decomposition. This can be shown is precisely the boost generator. If you hadn't used the vacuum state, if you had used an excited state, of course the modular hurricane generator would not be the boost. Would not be the boost, but you could obtain the boost by simply minimizing, finding the state that minimizes the global energy and obtaining and using the modular Hamiltonian of that special state. This is kind of the idea that I said, that if you are in an excited state and you have a way of diagnosing this, then all you can still obtain the geometric operator you want as a modular Hamiltonian by simply finding the special state that has the property you like. The property you like. So, of course, to map this onto our problem, the QFT vacuum is a toy analogy, is the analog of the local equilibrium state that we were talking about, where we know that a modular Hamiltonian acts like a Schwartzen translation. But what we don't have is this condition that selects those local equilibrium states. Here we had a global Hamiltonian with Here we had a global Hamiltonian, we could minimize. What is the analog in our setup? What is special about local equilibrium states? So, I want to present the idea without details. Here's a comparison, and these are two cases. This is the case of the probe propagating in a space-time where nothing hits it, and here's the probe propagating in spacetime with some excitation, which is described by this unitary v of x. V of x. If I take a field phi and I'm modular flowing in this case, as I said, you're just going to translate it along this trajectory in Schwarzenegger time while keeping the relative location of phi, the black hole fixed. In this case, you get something much more complicated. What you get is this translated phi, but conjugated by that unitary that describes your excitations. This is clearly a very common. This is clearly a very complicated thing in general. And in fact, the larger this modular flow time tau here becomes, the more complicated this becomes. So this effect of the operator becoming more and more complicated as we evolve longer and longer, it has a technical name, it's called scrambling, and there's a very well understood way of diagnosing. Of diagnosing this. If you look at the overlap of this excitation with some local boundary operator here, this will just be a bulk to boundary two-point function. It will be an order one number. It won't be parametrically suppressed in the entropy of your probe. But if you do the same thing for this excitation with some local boundary operator here, what you would get is an out-of-time order correlation function. It's out of time. function. It's out-of-time order because phi of tau is over here, v of x is down here, and the boundary operator is somewhere over here. So what we know about this out-of-time order correlation function is that they decay exponentially and there is a parametrically small value at about a time scale that is called a scrambling time, which is logarithmic in the entropy of the probe, of this black hole. So no matter how benign my excitation is, No matter how benign my excitation here is, it will cause scrambling, and about the scrambling time, the overlap of this excitation with all boundary excitations will be suppressed in the entropy of the probe. So this is the key difference. The local equilibrium modular flow maximizes the overlap with simple boundary degrees of freedom over all the states that are not, over all the nearby states. The nearby states. This is the optimization problem one needs to solve in order to obtain the geometric operator that can do the job in more general situations. Okay. Yeah. So the key therefore is to general, to just summarize the general point of view, is there's a condition of whether a particular state I give you. Particular state I give you describes a probing local thermal equilibrium. You simply have to look at the overlap of a modular float operator, the maximum overlap of a modular float operator with simple boundary operators. When this is order one, this is a local equilibrium criterion that we define. If that is not satisfied, then you have excitations hidden in your probe. And then what you have to do is you have to search the little Hebrew. To search the little Hilbert space around your state, the code subspace around your state, till you identify the state that maximizes that thing to an order one value. And this is the prescription that we propose. There is, of course, to actually show that this maximization doesn't have spurious solutions, physical solutions, you have to work a little harder. Here I'm just giving you the big picture, but this is the proposal we're making for how to translate yourself Translate yourselves along the trajectory of an infalling observer. So there's lots of saddle things. I just want to end by connecting to the initial question I asked. What's the interior? And a question in fact that many of us are interested in. What is the structure of the interior of a typical black hole microstate? Well, the answer is I do not know. I did not do this computation. But I do think that with this formalism, the question becomes within reach. Because I do think that this tool that I developed with my collaborators allows you to express that question as a technical question. The question would be prepare your black hole, the microstate you like, introduce the probe the way I explained, and then ask the question of whether the Whether this local thermal equilibrium criterion is satisfied or not. I do not know how difficult this computation will be, but the fact that we were able to make progress on explicitly using this method in SYK gives me hope, so the future will tell. So I will just end by a very speculative comment, which is that I view what I described here. What I described here as a framework for emergent time. The notion, I used this, the whole approach was trying to identify the CFT generator of the local clock, the proper time of an internal observer. And there was nothing about the construction of that clock that relied on the existence of an asymptotic clock, some asymptotic Hamiltonian. So it may be a first step towards a general formalism for understanding time internally in quantum graph. And with that, I will end and thank you for your attention. So we have questions. I see Daniel has a question, so go ahead. Hi, Lambros. I was a little puzzled by what you said about typical stakes. You said about typical stakes. Okay, can you hear me now? I need to unmute the mics. Maybe there has to be some. Let me go find Brent. I can also pad my question. In the meantime, if anyone knows questions. Okay, Daniel says that he can tag his question. Okay, I'm ready. Would you once he types it, would you read it out so we can hear it? Unless I misunderstood, your construction relied on special properties of the TFD. So how can we learn about typical states? Okay, that's a point I should probably clarify. The TFD was not used for the TFD was not the description The description: I didn't use a TFD to prepare the black hole I want to jump inside. The TFD was used in order to prepare my observer, the small black hole that I'm gonna throw in. And just to comment here, it's actually a micro-canonical version of the TFD that we have to use to introduce the probe in order to make it sufficiently small, smaller than LEDS. But the TFD was all used for that. The black hole that you're gonna fall inside could be a TFS. Hollow that you're gonna fall inside could be a typical state. Just to show you a picture about this, here that's the idea. So the setup remember was you initiate your system and reference in this entangled state. This is your observer, the preparation of the observer. And then you act with that unitary V that creates the background you want to explore. That V has the role of preparation. That V has the role of preparing the black hole you want to jump inside. Now, what is the V that will create a black hole? Well, it's actually fairly easy to do that, because thermodynamics helps you. All you have to do is just act with a sufficiently random unitary that is of sufficient high energy and that has the right asymptotic charges, and then you guarantee that the wave function will be dominated by the black hole solution in the box. So the T of T. The block. So the TFD is only about the entanglement of this little guy with a reference, not about the structure of the typical black hole state. That's the question. Yes. In classical gravity, I'm going to get this off. In classical gravity, the interior of the black holes is expected to be very unstable even to the tiniest perturbations. So the singularity you drew might change completely even very small perturb under very small perturbations. Small perturbation, and a very small perturbation. Even a classical perception. Right. Does that affect your method? So the right. So the method, the way I presented it, contains information about the limits of its regime of validity. So when something, so if an infalling observer encounters either some high-energy excitation that could High energy excitation that could, or some high-curvature region of space, or anything that would alter the geometry in its neighborhood at scales comparable to the observer, the prescription breaks down. And I want to point out exactly the prescription, the part that breaks down, because we can diagnose it. It's the fact that you can a priori realize that it's happening. So, you can have observations, CFD, but you can observe from your observations that it's breaking down, my calculations. It's breaking down my calculations. So, yeah, we are not making any assumptions that nothing is happening. We want to have something that will tell us if something happens. And give me a moment to just comment on exactly where this we expect is to... Of course, we have not done this calculation, but let me tell you exactly the place where we expect this happens. It happens in this optimization step that I explained towards the end. The prescription there was that The description there was that you have to kind of search the Hilbert space around your initial state till you find the state whose modular flow maximizes that correlator to another one value. But if something dramatic happens, then we don't expect that to actually, we don't expect you will be able to find a state that will satisfy that criterion. Namely, you won't be able to find a state that will. A state that would yield an order one value for these overlaps, for this maximum overlap. And we would interpret this as a diagnostic of something dramatic happening. You hit a singularity or something of comparable mass hits you along the way or something else. Now, of course, this is the expectation. We have not explicitly tested in a place. Any more questions? Any more questions? And if there are questions from the virtual participants, I'll just try to use my laptop as a speaker and we'll see how the feedback goes. So either here or virtually. I have a question that's not terribly well formed, but maybe you can help me formulate it better. So in your picture where you've created the observing black hole that's entangled, it seems to me like you could create a It seems to me like you could create a variety of other things to probe besides the large black hole that you've chosen to create. I guess I'm particularly interested in what would happen if you created a rim of background for this observer to live in. But you could create a bunch of things. Which ones are interesting? Do you know? Well, so this is, okay, I chose the case of a big ambient black hole that you're going to fall inside simply because they're the other methods. The other methods for bulk reconstruction do not apply, or at least not in the general case. This is a general method for reconstruction along some observer's trajectory. You don't need to fall inside the black hole. It is try to consider the setup where our knowledge is least developed, our frameworks are least developed, in order to show that we can actually make progress to that. And yeah, yes. So if you take your setup and put it in. Yes. So if you take your setup and put it in a case that we do understand already, you get consistent results. Yes, you do get consistent results. In fact, we had in our paper from last year, we checked, of course, everything that was regularly kind of accessible, and we made many sense of description. I would say the most non-trivial test was this calculation that I briefly discussed that we completed with Pink. It reproduces exactly what you It it reproduces exactly the expensive where the modular flow reproduces exactly the expected correlator and concorrelator if it was acting like a translation. That was uh I would say this is the sadest. We know what happens in the situation and the fact that we can reproduce it is the good design side. How doable is that outside of session situation? Yeah, very good question. So, part of the reason of undertaking that the SYK computation was to identify the physics that make on the boundary. And we actually found some nice simple elements that you can do. We believe we can do it, we may be able to do it in higher dynamics on the spot. I'm not showing you any of the. As soon as possible. I'm not showing you any of the tools right now, and any comments I'll make probably won't make much sense unless I explain how that's done. But I think there's a known zero chance that it can be done in hard time. But time passes. Go ahead. Can you hear me now? Hi, Neta. Hi. So my head on the minute, so I pause, but I'm going to ask. So, the model comes to me in my understanding of the directory is when we're talking about the quantum directions to be accessible to now when two services are very far separated. So, I really understand how many enterprises are just about to trigger a little bit when you have a larger separation between economic classes and services. Can you comment on that? So, maybe I should lie with the question. Well, maybe I should apply with the question first. Which last difference between Quantum and Last Services that you can find that setup? Yeah, yeah, sorry. So it's my audio. It's not on my audio. Yeah, yeah, sorry. I'm moving around also. That doesn't help. So yeah, so in my second, I want to ask questions to clarify your question. Clarify your question. So in my setup, the multilateral journey I'm talking about is the multilateral journal of the entire system CFP trace cells that I reference. So what is the discrepancy between the classical and the one-on-one similar surface that you expect in that setup? So I'm talking about a situation where you have a very large, very large. A large, a very large black hole with multiple services in it. And I'm trying to understand your goal for construction, and you have like a paramount situation. How do we plan that? I think you might have mentioned something like that. So, yeah, so I think there's something inherently confusing to the setup time. Setup time. And that is because there are two black holes, and things can get quite messy. So the motor machine turn I'm using is not the motion of the turn of a black hole I want to jump jumps out. It's the remote machine turn of a little black hole I prepared as a pro. And this black hole I initiated in a state state that I like, in thermofield double state. So there we don't have any Python standard, high black black hole. And Python. And by the prescription that I described, we always make sure that we find the prescription in situations where the amount of matter that will be accreted by micro black hole is small compared to the mass of the probe. Otherwise, we are not talking about the same observation. So it's this guy using that translates us in swords of time and we could have, you know. an arbitrarily complicated structure. We don't care too much about this. I don't think that what I said failed in that situation. Okay, I think that's covered. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay, maybe I can ask a question. So is this possible in your setup where you have a thermofilm double for the background that you want to explore? I could imagine that, for example, the SYK setup that you have. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Yeah, so there you have the summer physical model, right? Yes, yes. Inserted some operator that you cannot put the reference system. That's right, that's right. Suppose that the inserted operator reacting with the dignity carrier on the right, right? Yeah, yeah. But the dignity carrier is acting on the right and that the references is so that you produce the necessary contaminant. Yeah, yeah. Then I would expect that it should be possible to receive a signal from the left side because we are reacting from the right. Right. Right, right. What would be the difference in what you discuss, in the setup that I'm discussing versus the setup that you are discussing? Yeah. Okay. So here, just to be explicit, the way we are introducing the observer is by acting somewhere in the Euclidean part of the preparation, which is stay state. Right, so it's not the same as the preparation? It's not the same way where you go forward in a hand and then you go back to the bigger way. But it seems that the level of pictures would be very similar to the background. Yes, at the level of picture, very similar. The I'm thinking because uh we did not do that calculation. And uh the calculation that I have in mind that we did do and worked uh uh is requires that at least for the reason in order to remain in the regime of validity of the approximation that amount of Euclidean translation has to be larger among the pair j. So I'm trying to kind of connect So I'm trying to kind of connect to yourself by state and take away away from the solution work. I think that it's necessary in order to have a low enough energy, so to take a unitary that creates some object which is not very energetic and it's far enough to become a good idea. That's, I think, where we're gonna go. I think you went to what I was saying discussion. Yeah, I don't have any sharp responses to whether I expect it will work there or not. I know of a particular example if I take the infinite temperature. Your setup does give you the battery that. Well, the resulting modular having done it for your probe is very simple. It's just the size of the battery. If you run it, you can use the temperature case. But it's of course a very simple sense. And there you can just add the communicate on the right. You don't need to do what I was saying here. But I wouldn't feel confident and tell you that it's going to work in worst case because I haven't had that. It was like having that impact. I would hope that that is just true. Let's thank Clumpus again. Now a week off poverty break. So I said the email everyone pointing out that I said I'm sitting on the email.
