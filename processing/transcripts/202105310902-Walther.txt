But we do the best if we heard to do it here online. Well, my talk will fall a bit in the spirit of the previous talk from Garvin that is given that they want to shine light with experiments on the interface of gravity and quantum physics. But before jumping there, I would like to recap a bit in this Kusl-Od experiment, because for the last five, six years, we did a few experiments using single photon or photonic content. Single photon or photonic quantum systems to build experiments that we have in the definite causal orders. And we basically took a look at different features. And looking back, I would say we can see there's two kinds of class of experiments. The first one is dedicated to the foundations, to the understanding of those indefinite causal order via experimental arrangements. And the thing that basically we've done in the past was if I calculate. Done in the past was if I get the laser point, we used photos to realize such structures that you superimpose first one operation, U1, and then U2 or vice versa in an optics table experiment as indicated here. And at some experience, we even replaced U to be a measurement operation. So instead of just changing polarization, we could even make a measurement where the measurement outcomes are coherently preserved until the very end. And instead, we could. Until the very end, and instead you could really, within the framework of quantum mechanics, verify such independent causality experiments with such a setup. However, in the past, you also went one step further, was it to investigate, sorry, I forgot to mention there were also follow-up work by our Australian colleagues and Rewitz group, who basically did the same experiment, just used different degrees of freedom for their photonic systems. Good. However, we wanted to go even However, we wanted to go even one step further and investigate indefinite causality even in a theory-independent manner. And that was done by the so-called Bell experiment, where the setup is shown here on the right. Now we had two photons, where the photons went through this indefinite causal order arrangement at one side, let's say Alice, and the other side, Bob. And only if here infinite causal arrangement was given or established, then we could at the end violate here at Alice and Bob's side at that inequality. Ellis and Bob cited by inequality. And this concept, basically from an experimental point of view, allows to test those indifferent causal structures by a theory-independent approach. It's still on archive because for the last couple of years, we had some issues in getting those things published, not by the experiment, because it's a thing that was done in a nice, it was a hard experiment, but also done in a nice manner. The challenge was more in the interpretation and getting those things well presented. Well, presented, and now hopefully, it should be out this year. That's the foundations. On the application side, we took those arrangements to demonstrate the even advantages possible for information tasks. And one was like quantum computing, where actually our first experiment now six years ago was used not only to demonstrate this indefinite causal order, but also to use this for making a computation faster. So by one shot only, Faster. So, by one shot only, where the photon is basically superimposed here, you could tell if these operations commute or anti-commute. And that cannot be done by any standard architecture for computers. And in spite of that, there was follow-up work from our Brazilian colleagues. I think this year, people published bigger systems with more unitaries in a smart arrangement to save expand resources, but it also showed speed up for computation. It came also the idea that communication also the idea that communication could be benefiting from those concepts where the quantum channels are indifferent causal structures and indeed a few groups jumped on on experimental realizations there was um there were groups from from from china jiang and woo who showed that quantum communication can be enhanced in the sense that that the noise um you can handle one noise in such setups there was also experiment with andrew weitz group to deal with classical communication that is also uh Communication that is also apparently benefits from such arrangements. However, we took a closer look, even though we are fans and we lost those experiments in different causal order, we took a closer look on the benefits and advantages and compared this to other arrangements. And it turned out that for communication tasks, we compared such indefinite causal structures with arrangements where channels are just in parallel, where the noise comes one of the other or other arrangements. So those setups So those setups, in fact, the causal order arrangement shows no benefit. So it does help, but not as good as more classical arrangements like this one, for example. We measured all different kinds of noises and compared these architectures. And you see that the incident was slightly below, which sometimes tell you that, well, sometimes it works, it's better, sometimes not, but that's life. And we learned that maybe for these tasks, we would not go for individual causal order. Go for individual causal order arrangements, but for computations, there would be a bad effect. Good. I will stop here because there are other talks later today, by particularly by Andrew White. Basically, we way better talk about those things in more detail. I would like to come back to the original plan of my talk, namely to talk about the experiments that are going on that aim to shine light on gravity-quantum interface. Just to recap briefly, as you note, that the big theories, GR explaining the big things and how massage is distributed in the universe. There's quantum physics that nicely explain the microcosmos with gauge fields and so on. And the question is, how are those theories interacting? Here, I nicely like to use the picture that Igor Pikovsky used in his thesis, where he shows that you have classical physics and quantum mechanics, and you see nicely how one. quantum mechanics you see nicely how one theory basically led to developments this in classic mechanics we had newtonian gravity and even special relativity and so on how here these black arrows indicate development but there are also dotted lines and dotted lines mean at the moment it's not clear how how these theories at the end that we're aiming for in particular the quantum theory of gravity should look like what are the the conditions and so on and the summary of this slide is just that in my eyes we need experiments as you have seen previously that As you've seen previously, that guide developments and that maybe falsify ideas or even verify at some point something, but we need experiments to basically get insights here. And coming from Austria and basically a German-speaking region here in Europe, the desire to shine light into that research direction can be nicely rephrased from Dr. Faust, who was written by John Wolfgang from Goethe, where this academic basically said because you would like to understand. Is said because you would like to understand that I recognize what holds the world together inside. And I think that's the spirit that everyone here at the conference has to understand better the concepts. And that's something that is our motivation. If I break this down to what does it mean for us in the lab in Vienna, it means we'd like to understand how gravity acts on quantum systems. That's the main question of our research platform, Tourist, here. And for us as a photonic group, we want to particularly look on how does gravity act on Look on how does gravity act on massless quantum systems, including photonic quantum entanglement and so on. Before reaching that, I'd like to summarize or recap the big experiments that tested GR, because hopefully, and that's visual thinking, at some point we will be able to our experiments to stand on the shoulders of those great experiments. And let me just recap briefly what in my eyes the phobic. Um, what in my eyes the photic experiments have been, I guess, you're all familiar with. That's the reason that's the reason why I could make it rather brief here. Um, it started with the so the first experiment to test GR was the Mercury perhelion precession, where it was assumed there should be an elliptic form of the Mercury because of Newton's laws. However, Ober-Levari measures there was a deviation due to GR effects, and the deviation of this precession was in the order of 38 arcseconds. 38 arcseconds, but they improved by Simon Newcombe to slightly different numbers. But that was the first experiment showing that there's an effective GR that can be observed. Then there was a jump of more than 100 years, sorry, more than 50 years, where people looked at light dancing. And it's no soul that Eddickson used the solar eclipse that basically the sun moves between the Earth and the star, where they look at the light coming from the star, that it could measure a deviation. That it could measure a deviation of the angles by this small number, 1.2 arc seconds, which is that's important, effective to different than what you would calculate, but just using the experience principle. And that's basically here the nice thing why you should experiment, basically to not, one might get in the wrong direction. And it was taken by two points, Africa and Brazil, and later on there were other experiments that basically did it. However, since then, many. However, since then, many measurements have done, as you probably all know, there are big telescopes built, looking now not at light, but rather at radio waves. And there's this very long baseline interferometry and the other names for that where they look also from two different spots on Earth at radio signals, some quasars, the other stars, and they also here see this deviation with very high precision due to GR. Also, this rotational lensing has been observed not that long ago. So, not that long ago, people basically with very high accuracy could confirm the basic deflection with a position that's very close to what you expect by considering GR effects. As you see, light is a main method here to see GR effects. This was the second kind of experiment. The third one, which I guess you're all familiar with, is just the gravitational redshift where when you look here to the right, you see on the Earth, you send light up from Earth, then due to the change of the Up from Earth, then due to the change of the expectation potentially receded, the light is redshifted when it goes higher. And that can also be explained and understood by just the equilibrium's principle. However, since almost the early days of the first Eddington experiment, people look at stars, in particular white dwarfs, where they have high mass. When they send light, basically it's redshifted because it basically escapes the mass of the Basically, it escapes the mass of this white harvest. And then you see, since the 1925 until these days, people look at those redshifts. And the redshift is measured by the Doppler shift that's needed to move the receiver. And you see, this is required to cognitive for the redshift. And that's one way to see this effect. For me, a big jump was in the late 50s when Paul and Lebanon looked at experiments done here on ground, really in the laboratory. That was done at Harvard building, at the Jefferson. was that at Harvard building with the Jefferson Tower, where they used iron and the Mersebauer spectroscopy to submit, so they emit a gamma ray, which is then at some different height received than the text is. And that's basically the building. So actually was placed, it's shown wrong here, but the concept was it was a source and here was the text on the ground. Here it's for artistic reasons the other way around. But it is the same. So if you put the source on ground, it tends light up to the first floor. Up to the first floor, and when you receive light here, then due to the redshift, the resonance energy is not anymore the same there. You have to compensate again the redshift by moving against the light with the stop the shift. Such an experiment. This was done at that time, even with very high precision of just 1% standard deviation, basically mismatch from what should be expected. And that was the beginning of. And that was the beginning of the cable to experiment. I've drawn your clocks because the same can also be understood by having different clocks and time at the ground and at the high level. It's basically equivalent and by understanding that the clock has a different clock speed there. So to say, they understand that the resonance conditions are given. And you also have to compensate then by moving, for example, by adopted shift to achieve the resonance. Good. I'm almost at the end. I just want to for hit. I'm almost at the end. I just want to, for historical reasons, to recap what was done later on. So, in terms of clocks and time delayation, as you know, in the early 70s, Hafrik Keating put clocks on planes that were sent around the Earth, and they could see a difference there to the time delayation with this almost 10% accuracy, 9% accuracy. Just a few years later, clocks were put on satellites with 10,000 kilometer high height to Earth, and that accuracy was already dramatically improved, and that also confirms GR effects. And that also confirms GR effect. It was not the end. Nowadays, people work with very precise quantum control in the labs, and they superimpose atoms, basically as a mass standard construction, and that it can really observe time deliverations as small as two to a 30 centimeter height difference or speeds of 10 meters per second by atomic interferometry in the lab. And that's basically done since 2010 with Chu and others in that field. In that field, the last class of classical tests, so now we move from redshift to the next one to the fourth one, is the Shapira effect, where people send lights from Earth back in the days, early 60s, to Venus and reflect it, they'll send it back. And due to the GR effect of the sun, they've seen a delation, sorry, a time delay of 200 microseconds by this measurement. That was done by a huge antenna, actually, here in Westwood, with almost... In Westwood with almost 40 meters diameter arrangement, and that was done back in the days here with 10% accuracy. Now, these people use satellites, there was the Viking and the Nicassini satellite missions, and they have achieved, well, recently, 10, 15 years ago, much higher accuracies. Also, where they measured the time delay due to the GR effect here, space-time of the time. Good. That's the classical. Good. That's the classical sector. I summarize briefly the experiments so far for classical physics testing GR. There were also quantum experiments. The first one was done by Colelo Oberhausen Werner, who used neutrons, took a single neutron, and then split the neutrons path into these two arms, like a Martien interferometry, and recombined them, the closed interfameter. And the point now was they were able to spin this plate. And dependent on the orientation of these holes being horizontal. On the orientation of these holes being horizontal or vertical aligned in the gravitational field of Earth, they could see different rotational potential. And therefore, when they spin the wheel, they could see those oscillations, which are really due to the gravitational potential affecting here the neutron when it's when it was basically interfering through a process through this machine. And now there's the other experiment, as mentioned before, of the atom atomic interfy metric concept, but in the same spirit, basically. But in the same spirit, basically. So, why do you bother with those, as my eyes, beautiful experience of the past? So, one is just I like those. I think that it's beautiful to see what has been done and would like to really see what else we can contribute to the field. And to understand it, I made this little matrix here to see what has been done in our eyes. So, since the early days, the last 300 years, classical physics was testing Newtonian gravity. Newtonian gravity, okay, in many ways, and that people actually learn in high school. So, with respect to GR, we mentioned the four classical tests in the last couple of minutes, that, for example, the time relation of clocks and other tests that confirm classical physical concepts, including next field equations, as a light concept, if GR, and that was done with extremely high precision accuracy and in many ways. With respect to quantum systems, there were a few experiments like. Systems, there are a few experiments like the cow experiments of neutrons or the atomic fountain experiments and so on. But all the results they've seen, or inferences they've seen, can be explained by Newtonian gravity affecting it a mass. So you can basically explain those things just by Newtonian concept. And it does not really provide yet a unique signature to the GR effect of things. So in essence, what I believe here, again, is that so far these experiments That so far, these experiments that I've shown basically do not show together the unique signatures of GR and quantum mechanics in one experiment. And here we see a particular point for photons. And I said before, there are other experiments right now on the way. So we think that the reason it's such exciting times to see so many quantum systems probing this interface and looking at unique signatures of GR and quantum mechanics. And in our case, we choose photons because that's easy to explain. That's easy to explain. Photons have no mass, okay? And that's intrinsically, they are a problem. GI effect, they cannot explain those by Newtonian gravity. So what in essence do you want to do? At the end, you would like to build a precise interferometry or interferometer with single photons and entangled light. And what do we, what's the main concept behind that? Just to recap quickly, we deal with light and frequency, how the frequency is changing with height. Frequency is changing with height. So, as shown before, when it's on the ground and you send the laser light, then that can measure the frequency F with very high precision. If you move the laser up, so basically in the ground of the Earth, that's shown here by this rotational field here. If I now go up in space and send another laser, switch it on, and measure here the frequency. It's the same frequency. However, when you be an external observer far away, then you will see that the frequencies are not the same due to the redshift. And that's the concept we like to use here. The concept we like to use here. So, actually, from the outside, you will see the redshift up here at the height that you're going to use for a quantum experiment. Quantum experiment means you take now single photons, not lasers anymore. And the plan is to send a single photon to a beam splitter, send it up one meter in height, or something like this, then a long time here on this path, and a long time also here on that path, and then recombine at the second beam splitter and measure the phase shift or the delay that's due to the GR effect. Due to the GR effect. So, what do we measure? The wave packages of light of the upper and the lower ones shown here are different. As you can see, the phase shift will be different with respect to the height. When you move smaller in height or reduce the height, then the phase shift is also smaller. That's something you can measure at the end. So, when you build such an interferometer, DIM split, team splitter, mirrors, mirrors, then you will look at the detectors essentially. And by changing the height or increasing the length, you will see that this detector You will see that this detector is more and more light, indicating there's a bigger phase shift accumulated due to GR. That's the plan. So what's the framework? It's hard. It's hard because you look at the numbers and you realize GR is a tiny effect and you have to build a big interfameter to collect some kind of phase shift or effects that you can measure at the end in your setup. So you put numbers together and as shown by other theoreticians, And as shown by other theoreticians, Justice Book and others, and Magdalena, it was pretty clear that the amount of phase shift is given by the length of the arm and the height. The height is limited basically by the building or just by a room height by a few meters or one meter. So the thing that can increase space is this arm. So you see these two parameters, the physique is proportional to length and height. The other ones are just constants. So we try to make the arm as long as possible. How do you do it? We take fibers. How do you do it? We take fibers. So we take the longest possible fiber you can imagine, that's 100 kilometers, because at that point losses become so dominant that no single photons would come out if you have longer fiber. But so the framework of 100 kilometer fibers and one meter height in our lab, we expect the phase shift of 10 to the minus 4 radians. That's less than a nanometer length difference for lines. That's measurable. That's not too hard in principle. It becomes hard when you keep in mind that the setup that you have is That the setup that you have is one meter height and 100 kilometer fiber. It means the change of length over the entire length of the end of the meter is 10 to the minus 16, which is in a lab framework extremely hard and really pushing the limits what can be done. We have four orders of magnitude away from what LIGO can resolve. So we're really, I see it's last five minutes. I'm quickly done. We basically really. We basically really hit the limit of what we can measure. Good. So for that particular reasons, that you, so for the reason that we can measure those things, we have to get a sensitivity, which is a frequency delta F over F 10 to the minus 17 to be one order thing better in the resolution that we can read out this phase shift. And that's really cutting edge on laser know-how, stability requirements, and so on. We worked for many years on all the noises that could... Worked for many years on all the noises that could show up. I will not bother you with that. I will just tell you how we do it. And we do it by having the privilege to have strong groups working with that together here in Vienna. One is the group from Nerges Mamarbala at MIT, who works also within the LIGO framework, and she helps us to stabilize such a setup. And they work with PTP the Causes Group to get the best atomic clock signals as a reference for our measurements. Reference for our measurement. And that's the plan. We will get the laser signals from PTP all the way from Braunschwing, Germany to Vienna, and then link our lasers with that and use now free coils for referencing different heights for experiment and that's the time. I will not bother you with that. So that's our experience within the sources, detectors. That's something that we know how to do. The last thing I'd like to bring up here is we don't want to show only single photons, but also entangled states. So we will use a quantum A quantum photonic technology to get two photon entanglements. Namely, we will send two photons here as input to the beam splitter. And if they interfere, then there's bosonic behavior, they bunch. That means I look at the coincidences here. Photons will never go out as coincidence. So this basically turns out to zero. So you see coincidences are, if the overlap go to zero, because two photons are coming out here and there. And this kind of two photon states, two position here and there, or superposed here and there, can be also drawn as this. And the nice feature. Be also drawn as this, and the nice feature is those states are known to enhance the resolution. They're used in quantum metrology because now we have such a supposition or anti-state of two photons here and there, write it like this, it's called noon state, n photons up or n photons down. Then the oscillation at the end is proportional to the number of photons, because each photon gives you a phase shift. And in such a case of two photons, we hope, or we hope, you will see an enhancement of effects of two in the oscillations and thus allowing to improve relationship. Oscillations and thus allowing to improve resolution on top of being a signature of a quantum feature. Good. I was too slow stop here because I had in mind to talk just 30 seconds to talk about what we're doing right now. We've built an experiment not as sensitive, but super sensitive to measure the Sangiac rotation of Earth by such inches of meter, also with entangled states. And we'll just show one slide here. That is that we that we That we basically just do one particular slide here, the last one. We have two coils, the add of one kilometer, one kilometer to see a Sagniak effect. And by the switch here, we can flip the coils to add one and one is two, or cancel one minus one to be zero. So we can turn on and off the Sagnak effect, and then we can really test the interfameter for precision measurements in the same spirit as for GR, which is happening. S4GR, which is happening right now, and that's the picture of the setup to conclude. It's something that we have built, not only talked about. That's such a San Jacinto meeting in the lab. We can orient to be perfectly aligned with the axis of the Earth. Otherwise, you don't see the Earth rotation that we're doing right now. Good. To summarize, and again, I apologize for being a little bit too slow and going to find time. We talked briefly about our experience in the Cosla experience in Vienna. That's all experience in Vienna for foundations and all the applications, and some it works better, others maybe not so much. Um, I briefly talked about the earth rotation right now, but we have rushed through that. We rather built this setup for measuring this by the Sendiac effect and earth rotation using single photons and two photon noon states as a precision measurement and talked about our vision and plan to really measure GR effects using single photons and entangled photon states. And entangled photon states. We think it's interesting and fits into the vision right now. The many groups have to test those gravity-quantity interfaces. They're having now really massless particles where the effects that you observe and see really requires a non-relativistic treatment and therefore allows to go beyond a stochastic tone and description when you look at the results. Good. With that, I want to thank the team in particular, those three gentlemen, Christopher Hilbert, Bob Peterson and Raphael. Thanks to Hilbik for Peterson and Rafael Silvestri, who work on those experiments and our collaboration with Piotrichuschil for theory on our journey here. Thank you. Okay, thank you. So I think we might have time for a short question or two. If there are any, please raise your hands virtually, of course. Dan Carney. Okay, sorry. Carney. Okay, sorry to clog the airwave. So, so thanks. I like this photon experiment, and I was wondering instead of using a 100-kilometer fiber, why not use a cavity? I mean, the issue is that you need a long integration time of the light of the Earth or whatever. So, I mean, just put it in a centimeter cavity and you need a Q of 10 to the 7 or something then to make up the same frame of time. I mean, is there a problem with doing it that way? Yes, what about this? Yes, we thought about this long-term cavities. There are a few issues. One is the cavity has this ring down, so it becomes probistic when it comes out, one over E. Okay, that's one thing. Second thing is impedance. So you have to use particular very narrow band single photon properties to get into the cavity. And those things, in particular, the narrow band restriction to get basically single photons tailored to enter those cavities that basically would correspond to such a big length. Length has been for us very hard to consider, and therefore, we stayed with fibers as the way to go. We also talked with other groups, comparing the numbers. And for us, fiber was the way more solid way to go. We believe it can be done. Okay. Is this answering your question? I think so. Yeah. Good luck. Thank you. Nice to see that result. Yes, Daniel Braun. Daniel Braun. Yes, thank you very much. Very interesting talk and very exciting perspectives. I think I definitely believe that this single photon experiment is a gravitational experiment, but it's not so clear in which sense it is really quantum, because I mean, if you send H bar to zero, you will still get the same phase shift, right? I agree. I agree. That's the reason why that to the first type of single photon where you end in a You end in a philosophic debate: is eight dagger single-photon measurement really different than just laser light and so on? But the point is, we also go to two-photon state. So, at the end, I've shown here, you will switch to two-photon switcher path entangles, and with that, you really have a quantum signature. I guess I would agree. There's certainly no quantum effect in there. And I guess more generally, you would look at the second-order correlation functions, right? If you want to go beyond just the classical non-quantum effects here, yeah. Yes, but the plan is, of course, we start with single photons. Once we have stability, we achieve the stability, the main experiment shoots on the two-photon noon state in there, and then we will have a quantum entanglement state being affected by GR. Okay, thank you very much. Good luck. Welcome. Okay, I think then what we will do to try and get back on schedule, we'll take a five-minute break and then we should regather. Break, and then we should regather for the group photo.
