So yeah, I'm going to be talking about a joint project with Credo, Lolara, and Negro Chum. And this is really going to be heavily a cluster talk. So I'll start off with what I need from clusters. So everything that I'm going to talk about is in skew symmetric type, but for the general things that come before Ross Manians, Come before Rossmanians, there will be versions of the statements that I make that are true in the excuse in a tricep type. So a cluster variety, it's defined in terms of some initial data. And the initial data really consists of four things. We'll start off with three. We have a lattice N that's equipped with a skew form, and then some saturated sub-lattice called N unfrozen of N. Called n unfrozen of n, and some index sets. One index set that corresponds to the last n. It will give us an indexing of a basis for n, and then a sub-index n for the unfrozen sub-levis. So this portion of the data is the fixed data. It's usually written with the letter gamma. And the additional piece of information is a seed. So seed here is just a label basis of n, such that when we restrict to the unfrozen part of our indexing set, we get a basis for the unfrozen sub-lattice. Okay, so given this information, what we can do is build a pair of tori. So if we let M be the dual to. We let M be the dual lattice to N, we'll get two tori: one whose co-character lattice is M, character lattice is N, and the other whose co-character lattice is N, and character lattice is M. So these will be a pair of tori. One of them will be in what will eventually be our A variety, the other will be a tori simple. A torus and what will eventually be our X variety, but to completely build up our cluster variety, we need a lot more tori. So there's also a notion of mutation. And in terms of seeds, it's a way of taking one seed, one of these order bases, and replacing it with a new one. And don't worry so much about the exact expression here. The important thing is that using thing is that using such a map, such a notion of mutation, we can build some birational maps between tori. So we'll have a torus for the first seed, a torus for the second seed, and we'll define birational maps in terms of pullbacks of functions between these two tora. Oh, and I should have, it's on the slide, but I should have, oh no, I should have said earlier. Oh no, I should have said earlier. This discussion is based on a paper of Flak Antrov and a paper of Grossakin Kiel. Yeah. That's exactly the thing that Sue wrote this morning, okay? The transformation results. I was collecting my wallet. I lost my wallet in a taxi earlier, and so I spent this morning tracking it down. Missed a couple of bucks. Sorry about that. Good job, Alexien. So I know you don't want to tell us more about this, but I'm going to press you a little bit. To know how to mutate, there must be some other information that I have just besides the last, right? It's coming from the skew form, too. The last in the SKU formplay. So last needs to do four until you have. Yeah, so that's there's the skew form. So yeah, we'll have a mutation direction for every A in our unfrozen indexing set. Yeah, so I guess what you should take out of this slide is that, well, there's some way that we could take one of these things that indexes our tori, replace it. That indexes are tori, replace it with a new one, and there's a way that we can write by rational mass between the associated tori. So from there, we can define a pair of cluster varieties of different types. So the first guy here is called the X variety, and it's what we get by gluing together all of these Tm tori. And when I say S prime is in here, it's is in here, S prime is in the mutation equivalence class of S. So we're unioning together all of the tori that can be obtained by this process through some usually infinite number of, well, okay, for any particular seed part, we're going to have a quite a number of steps, but yeah, usually there will be infinitely many of these seeds that are mutationally equivalent to our Mutation equivalent to our original one. So we can define a pair of cluster varieties in this way. What do you closure by? Oh, okay. Yeah, by these rational mass. Actually, no. This one, yes, this one is in general not separated. But when that happens, we usually We usually usually kind of start with this and say, well, that's not really the thing I should have been caring about. And we replace it with something else that's closely related, but better behavioral. In the cross-moding example, everything will be fine. Okay, so it might be tempting right now. You know, we've got dual tori here. It might be tempting to say, well, this is going to be some sort of mirror symmetry thing. Maybe these guys should be mirrors to each other. And I want to say that, okay, for a while I did think in those terms, and that's not the right way to think about things. Instead, you should think of. Instead, you should think of this pair as living on one side of a mirror. There will be some mirror thing that shows up on the other side, but you should think of both of these as living on one side of some mirror construction, and there will be maps between these guys. Okay, so the maps between these are something called cluster ensemble now. Or something called cluster ensemble maps. To define one of those, we start with a lattice map, a cluster ensemble lattice map. So that's going to be a map from N to M that satisfies certain properties. Roughly, it's going to be given by sending N to skew pairing with N. So if I have skew pairing with N, this is going to be an element of the dual lattice of N. So this is an element of M. This is an element of m but it's only roughly this because there could be there's a bit of ambiguity in the definition and the statement is that this p star is given by this plus possibly some element of n unfrozen curve. So there's some additional thing, some additional fudge factor, I guess. Fledge factor, I guess, that can appear here that isn't that makes it different from just skew herring. The key thing, reason we care about this, is this is exactly what you need to have one of these maps commute with mutation. So the cluster ensemble lattice map is a map from Ensemble lattice map is a map from n to m that commutes with mutation. And the reason that's nice is because, well, that gives us a map of schemes from A to X. And we'll just define that in terms of pullback of functions. So if we have some character on our torus Tm, that was a torus in X, we can pull it back to a character of a torus. Of a torus EN, which was a torus in A. Okay, so the next main ingredient comes from a paper of Gross Hack and Kiel and another paper of Gross Hacking Kiel Konsevich. And this ingredient is the theta basis. So a theta basis. So a theta basis is a canonical basis that shows up on the space of regular functions on some La Cla Bial variety, or if you prefer, on spaces of sections of line bundles over compactifications of those Labelabian albaries. The way to think about that in maybe more down-to-earth terms. In maybe work down to earth terms, is, well, this is something that's generalizing the characters of a torus. So the characters are a really nice basis for the regular functions on a torus. And if you think about a toric variety, maybe you have some line bundle over the torque variety. You can use subsets of those characters to give you a basis for that spatial sections of that line bundle, too. And it's going to be the same idea for. And it's going to be the same idea for theta functions on La Claudial varieties. Cluster varieties are a very special sort of La Claudial varieties. So when we talk about Laude Claude VL's, what we mean is that they're these smooth schemes that come and deal with some unique up-to-scaling volume form that has at worst a simple pull along any Any boundary divisor in any compactification of our scheme B. So this might sound a little bit odd, but there's an easy example, which is just a torus. So if we start with C start at the end, the volume in this case is just this usual log volume. And if you now think about your favorite torque variety, well, Well, if y, y is the torque variety with d the torque boundary divisor, a nice exercise is that this omega here has exactly a simple pole along each divisorial component of D. So in the Laglabel world, we'll be interested in compactifications that sort of mirror this picture here. Picture here. We'll still have one of these compact volume forms, and the interesting compactifications, the so-called partial minimal models, are those where this volume form actually has a pull along every divisorial component of the boundary. By definition, it has to have, at worst, a simple pull. And the interesting factions are the ones where it actually does have a pull. It actually does have the poll. Does that make sense? All right. So, given that, the next thing that we're really going to want to use to talk about the databases is something called the integral tropicalization of our variety. And for that, we need divisorial discrete valuations. So, a divisorial discrete valuation is a Is it's a discrete evaluation of the field of rational functions of our vari that's given by order of vanishing along some divisor. So we could have some compactification of A, and D could be some divisor in that compactification, some irreducible effective divisor, or a multiple of it. And if we can If we can describe our discrete valuation as order of value along V, that's one of these divisorial discrete valuations. And the integral tropicalization of V is a subset of the collection of divisorial discrete valuations. So we're going to have some devisoidal discrete valuation, and we'll say it's in V traps Z, the integral trap equalization of V. The integral tropicalization of V, if it evaluates negatively on our canonical volume form. So that just means that this volume form has a pull along the divisor table. So we do this, and then we'll throw in zero by hand. That also might look weird at first, but there's again a very simple example. If we start with the torus T sub. T sub n, so its co-character lattice is n, then the integral tropicalization of tn is just the co-character lattice itself. So if you think of, say, a fan for a torque variety, let's say it's a normal torque variety, so then the rays of the fan are going to go through co-characters, actual lattice elements, and And let's say we take a primitive co-character. If we want to know the order of vanishing of a character along the corresponding divisor in a rhetoric variety, the divisor corresponding to that ray, well, what we do is we take the co-character and pair it with the character. So they live in dual lattices, and that pairing tells us order of baggership. Pairing tells us order of value shape. So this co-character lattice really is the evisorial discrete valuations on our colour CN. Okay. So these will come up in a conjecture of gross hacking here. So if we start with So, if we start with some affine like Laude Al variety with maximal boundary, so this maximal boundary, so this means that there's some compactification, y, d of the first, such that omega has a pole along all the visoral components of d. That's just meaning that this is a partial minimal model. And the maximal boundary part is that d has a zero shape. Is that D has a zero straddle? So there's some way of intersecting irreducible components of our boundary to get something zero-dimensional. And this is essentially a degeneracy condition. So this is what you would expect to see in torque varieties, for example. It's essentially saying that the divisor that we've chosen here is very much. Chosen here is very much not generic. It's not irreducible, for example. It's about as far away from irreducible as possible. So given one of these things, there's an algebra, A sub V, that comes with a basis indexed by the tropical points, the integral tropical points of V. And the multiplication in this algebra. The multiplication in this algebra is given by broken line counts. Okay, so we have to make sense of that now. So I'm not going to go into too much detail on this, but what you should think about for these broken line counts, it's essentially a tropical version of log Grammar-Wooden invariance. So this is something that you shouldn't be that surprised to see coming up in some log Labiani or symmetry. A lot of neurosymmetry construction. Yeah, so. Finally, if we have this algebra and take spec of it, we'll get our mirror. So that's this conjecture of cross-second field concern, which is essentially, or cross-second field, sorry. There's essentially this way that you can start with some logical. Start with some logical Labial variety with maximum boundary and looking at the log geometry of your variety B, you can build some algebra and from that algebra directly construct the mirror to B. And this basis here is what's known as the theta basis. And I won't really get into that. I'll execute it directly. Okay. So in the cluster case, this is essentially a corrected form of the conjecture of Bachelor Ontra. And the conjecture is established for what Grossak and Kiel Konsevich call Fat Gajra dual cluster. Flat contrauv dual cluster varieties satisfying certain afflineness conditions. So the general conjecture of Flatkantra they disprove and then give certain conditions that would mean it holds in a particular case. And the conditions essentially amount a certain affinis assumption since your cluster variety is sufficiently close to being affine. When it does hold, they say that the full Fot-Gantrav conjecture holds for B. And turning to the example that we're going to care about for this talk, Marsh and Scott showed that the full Fot-Gantra conjecture holds for the cluster varieties associated to cross-monuments. Those would satisfy the affine discrimination? Those would satisfy the Those would satisfy the affineness condition. Those would satisfy the affineness condition. Oh, the press one? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, they do. Okay. So there's one last piece of information before getting into Crossmanians. Getting into Grassmannians. And that's using this conjecture: if we have a certain map between a pair of cluster varieties satisfying certain properties, it will actually give us an induced map between the mirrors of those cluster varieties, or labelabel varieties. And to talk about this, we need to say with the tropicalization. What the tropicalization of a rational map between La Clappy Alf means. And, well, we've got a perfectly nice set of divisorial discrete valuations here, another perfectly nice set of divisorial discrete valuations here. And there's a very clean way of taking one here and getting one here. And that's just composing with the pullback by f. So if we had some function. We have some function on v, and we pull it back using f to a function on u, we can then apply this device-oriented screen valuation to that pullback. So using this construction, ftrop takes in a device-oriented screen evaluation on utrop in in utrop and spits out a device-oriented discrete valuation in vtrop. It's just v composed with f star. Composed with f star. So assuming the conjecture holds, then if f from u to b is a map of f i log la maximal boundary, satisfying this condition here, so whenever we have a relation in our algebra a sub u by applying f trot to the indices down here, To the indices down here, we get a relation in AB. Well, when this holds, then we get, you know, if we're sending generators to generators and relations to relations, we get a map of algebras from A2 to AB. So again, assuming we conjecture, this gives us then a map of schemes from V track to U track. From V track to U track, just by taking the spec of these guys. Right. So the first result here is that if the full Fock-Entra conjecture holds for our cluster varieties A and X, and P is any cluster ensemble map, then exactly that property holds. So in other words, So, in other words, if we have a full control conjecture for A to X, then P induces a map between the mirror, from the mirror of X to the mirror of A. And the next nice thing is that, well, these mirrors, a priority, they're going to be some log body upright. You know, some black classy up varieties, you can equip them with different cluster structures. It so happens that there is a cluster structure for each of these such that this induced map of mirrors is again a cluster ensemble map. And if we're in skew symmetric type, then the relevant choice of cluster structure here is to just take. Here is to just take the chiral dual initial data to gamma s. So it's denoted gamma s. And this chiral dual initial data is something very simple. It's almost exactly the same as gamma, but there's this very minor change that we throw in a minus sign in front of the skew one. That's the only difference here. In skew synotrizable type, it's a little bit. In skews in a trisable type, it's a little bit more complicated. Instead of chiral both, it would be line lits and chiral both. But once we do this, we could take this X check as a scheme is isomorphic to A gamma O. And what that means is we could just endow this with the cluster structures associated to A gamma. Associated to A gamma. And similarly, we can do A check as X gamma. And once we do that, this, on the level of lattices, the induced map of mirrors, comes from the pullback of our original map, or of our original lattice map. So originally, P, or P star, was about from N to M. If we pull that back, If we pull that back, we get a map from n dual to n dual, which is again a map from n to m. This new cluster and solid lattice map is given just in this simple way. Okay, so now we're onto the Grassmannian stuff. And the Grassimanian cluster structure The Rossmanian cluster structure is originally due to Scott. The version that I'm going to talk about right now involves plated graphs. And that description comes from a paper of Ostakov with other developments by Region Williams. So we've seen a few playback graph things already, especially in. Especially in Melissa's talk. So we're going to start with a circle and n boundary vertices. And we'll have a graph, an undirected graph there, where all the internal vertices are either black or white. For these next things, let me just show an example. So this example is called GREC49. called GRAC49. So here what we can do is consider trips where the rule for a trip is we're going to start at some boundary vertex. Every time we hit a black vertex internal vertex will turn maximally right. Anytime we hit a white internal vertex, we'll turn maximally left. And we follow that along. Left, and we follow that along until we hit some other boundary vertex. So these trips give a permutation of the boundary vertices. And we can get a cluster by using these trips to label all of the faces of our Play-D graph. So here, every face to the left of this trip. Every face to the left of this trip is labeled by 3 because 3 is the source. If we do this for all of them, we get fluker indices that look like this. So what we wind up with in this example is a fluker, well, is a torus in terms of pluker coordinates. That's living inside of the Grossmani Gir 59. Okay, so while this isn't Scott's original description of it, this actually does correspond. You get the same cluster structure as Scott gave before. Port and great. So this gives a cluster structure on the complement of a certain divisor in the universal torsor for the Russian unit. And here, it's the same boundary divisor that we've seen in other talks. Here I'm using, when I write D some fluker indices, what I mean is the locus. What I mean is the locus in the universal Torcer where the corresponding pluker coordinate vanishes. So we've got the consecutive, the vanishing loci, the consecutive, cyclically consecutive plukers. Take the sum of all those, that's our anti-canonical boundary divisor that we're throwing out here to get so we can find the algorithm, which happens to have a nice cluster structure. So, in order to actually get the cluster structure, we have to get some skew form and label basis. And that's encoded in a quiver. So the equipper is associated to the skew form and label basis. In this way, if we have skew pairing of EI and EJ, well that's just going to be the signed count of hours from I to J, from the vertex I to the vertex j. From the vertex eye to the vertex chain. And in the example that we just looked at, you associate a quiver to a plated graph doing this. So for every face, we'll have some vertex of our quiver, and we draw arrows between vertices going through edges of the playback graph. So if we have a black vertex and a white vertex, And white vertex as the boundaries of an edge between two faces, we draw an arrow such that the black vertex is on the right, following the direction of the arrow. So the boundary vertices here all correspond to frozen directions. The internal ones correspond to mutable directions. Directions, and we don't really care about arrows between the frozen vertices. That part just gets ignored. Okay, so we started off with one play-bit graph. If we consider a new play-bit graph that we get by just swapping all colors of internal vertices, then if the permutation If the permutations, the trip permutations of G send I to I plus n minus k. Then for G up, the trip permutations will send I to I plus K. The first version said that the plated graph is of type pi Kn, the next one's it's of type pi n minus kn. So doing this, if before we had an A cluster in Grassmannian N minus K, and now we'll have a cluster in Grassmannian Kn. So the Kluker indices associated to a given face are related in a really simple way, too. It's just Way too. It's just take J, we send it to the permutation of J induced by the trim, and then take the complement. And we'll see why that is in a minute. And the next thing to observe is if we spot all the colors, then the quiver associated to GOP is the opposite of the quiver associated to J. So this is sending our initial data to the chiral tool initial data. So this is going to be where. Daph. So this is going to be where our mirrors show up. Okay, so here we take the same example as before, but now we swap all the colors. Before we had a trip from 3 down to 8. Now we'll get the same trip, but in the opposite direction, from 8 to 3. And the faces to the left of this trip are exactly the opposite. The opposite, the bases that were not to the left of the undertread. So that's why if before we had a face labeled by J, well, in the new playbook graph, we'll get something labeled by the complement of the permutation associated to J. So we'll. Um so now we wind up with the cross-binding cluster in GUR 49 instead of girv 59 and the quiver is in the opposite. It's the opposite of the previous quiver. The X picture can be a little bit more complicated. There's essentially two different X cluster structures that we can get from a Plevic graph. First of all, we've already got Liebit graph. First of all, we've already got an A variety and some initial data. We can use that data to define an X variety just completely abstractly. So we'll get one X variety this way, just abstractly defined. There's also a way that you can give an X variety that's explicitly embedded in the Grossmanium. Embedded in the cross money in terms of something called network parameters. And these will turn out to be not exactly the same thing. I might skip the network parameter thing for now and go back to it if I have time later. Let me just skip all of this for now. Yeah, I'll go back to it if I have time later. One thing I'll mention is that, yeah, these are not going to be naturally the same cluster variety, so we'll have to deal with that later on. And so all the constructions, so I've been using k for a lot of things. Everything works perfectly well for Everything works perfectly well for both GRKN and GRN minus Kn. And an important fact is that if we take the opposite of GRAC Kn, well, this will be mutation equivalent to GRACN minus Kn. We'll be related by a maximal train sequence for people who know what that means. Okay. So let's get into some land docking work stuff. So. So I'm going to describe the Land Al-Ginsburg mirror construction to these pairs. Really, it will be open positrate variety embedded in Grassvanian from this gross economic conceivage perspective. So if we have one of these boundary divisors, by definition, that gives us a point in the drop. A point in the tropicalization of this open pository variety. We can just ask for its the device order of this free valuation given by order of vanishing along that value of the device point. So by construction, that is a point in this tropical space. So it had better give us a function on the mirror. So we have this function, the state of function associated to To that boundary divisor. And it will really be a function of the mirror family, which will be a family over the torus whose co-character lattice is the class group of this cross-modula. And then the Landel-Ginsburg potential in this Grossecking-Hill disabled perspective is something very simple. We just take all of our boundary divisors. Take all of our boundary divisors and sum of the data functions associated to them. So, this is exactly what you would do in the torture case, using co-characters instead of tropical points. So, in the special case of universal torso of crust mining, we can view this as a partial minimal model of Partial minimal model of Scott's A variety by allowing poison variables to vanish. And if we use this description, so we've got some A variety here. The mirror family should be the mirror X variety. So X variety with the hydral dual vad. And there's actually, in this context, a pretty simple way of writing it out explicitly. Pretty simple way of writing down explicitly the theta functions after a sure heakness of the torus. There will be certain tori, certain seeds, in which the theta function restricted to that torus is just this very simple. If you know that, then you don't need to do all of the scattering diagram business to actually compute the data functions. Data functions. So the other perspective is the more Shreach perspective, and since Kanye is in the audience, I'll defer motivation and construction to Kanye. But their potential, on the other hand, is some simple expression in terms of fluker coordinates on the Drossman, the opposite Rossmode. And each summit reflects some quantum product. That's some quantum product of Schubert co-cycles in the original cross-model again. And explicitly, I guess we saw this in a lot of stuff, but explicitly the potential is given in this way. And the point that I want to get to is that this summoned here corresponds extremely. Corresponds precisely to this divisor here. You can notice the Plugger indices here and the indices here are complements of each other. So there's this very natural way of relating summons here to particular advisors. This was all done in Mark Reach. So the fluker coordinates are A variables. So in this setting, the potential is on an A variety. The compactification will be viewed as an X variety. So this theorem that we have is that there's a pair of cluster ensemble. A pair of cluster ensemble lattice maps. So these are induced by each other. Either one of these is pullback of the other with kernels k gamma and k gamma up such that kamma is naturally identified with the dual of the class group of crossbinding n minus kn. Kn. Kamma op is naturally identified with the dual of the class group of Russian Kn. The reason this is important is that these are exactly the groups that are acting on the universal torsor when the quotient by the action of up okay. If we take the tori, whose co-character lattice are lattices and these groups. Our lattices are these groups. Those tori act on universal torsor, and quotient by that torus action, you get your original space bit. So these kernels would be identified with essentially the co-character lattice of the torus that's acting. And in this picture, this P will descend on an isomorphism of a Of a quotient of A, a fiber of X. And similarly, the other P naught will descend to an isomorphism of potion of A, fiber of X. The one thing I want to point out is that here we have K gamma and K gamma R. This is because this guy here This guy here should be thought of as mirror-family to this guy. This guy here, well, better. This guy here is mirror-family to that there. There's this swapping of the K's. So both of these P-bars extend to automorphisms of their respective cross-monitorings, which Which will actually not be the trivial homomorphism. And if we pull back a theta function on x using this p-bar na, we'll get a particular summon of the Marsh reach potential with q equals 1. And the summon that we get is obtained by applying the other P map to Other P map to the divisor that we started with. So you have boundary divisor here. We pull back to some, we pull back our theta functions, we get some summand of the Marshreach potential, and the particular summint is the one that's associated with the other P applied to the original divisor. And that works both ways. So we could apply the other, pullback by the other p. P and yeah, the same thing happens. So moreover, if k, n isn't the simplest clustered case of R24, simplest non-trivial clustered case of PR24, and we're not dealing with just projective space, 1n mx1n, then this Then this pair of maps is unique. And the automorphisms are given in this very simple way in terms of pullbacks by just sending pj to pj minus carbon algorithm to j. This is just some cyclic shift of Pluto indices. But it's not actually negative. So So let's look at a simple example of how this works. So this is the GER25, GER3, 5 example. And if you recall, the potential on the open pository variety were 2, 5, well, it's the sum of theta punches associated to boundary divisors. To boundary divisors in your 3, 5. And I won't say exactly. All these can be computed with some simple sequence of mutations. And the order of, if we take the theta function associated to the visor D123 and restrict it to the torus associated to this. Into this plate of graph here, we get this simple binomial zero. The other ones look like this. They're all fairly simple, and there's an easy trick for writing them all down, but it doesn't matter. We can do this essentially the same thing for the Van Elginsburg potential on Potential on Russian 3, 5. Now it's indexed by now it's a sum of theta functions corresponding to the boundary visors in 0.25. And explicitly restricting to that torus, we get these things. And now let's try to compare to the Marcree potential. The more create potential. Alright, so we've got this expression for our first theta function. We know that if we apply, okay, I guess we don't, if you believe the theorem, then applying P gamma la to D 123 should give us D144. Should give us d145. So we have d145. To get the summon of the Marsh reach potential, we should take complements of 145. So that's 2,3, and the corresponding summon, that is P24 over P23. So if we want to work in the coordinates Coordinates shown in this playbit graph, then we want to replace P24 with an expression in terms of these guys here. And, well, that's P45 over P35 plus P2. We get this expression written in terms of exponentials of z. It has this work here, and with that amounts to say, What that amounts to saying then is we want the pullback of minus E23 has to be of this form. The pullback by P of minus E35 has to be exactly this guy. If we take P star of minus E23 to be given like this. So we've just added in something in animal frozen perk. This is in non-frozen perk, then we'll get exactly what we were after. The pullback this expression here is exactly this expression here. So, in other words, So in other words, the pullback of this eta function is exactly this summand of the Marsh reach potential. The other summands are similar, and we can do essentially the same calculation on the other side. And well, yeah, it works. I'm not going to have time to talk about it. I'm not going to have time to talk about the flow polynomial business, I think. But yeah, let me say that using this identification of on one side compactifications of minimal models. We've got cross-modding, we've got two different ways of saying. We've got two different ways essentially of embedding open positric variety into Grossmanian. The identification of those minimal models on one side and corresponding Land Al-Ginsburg mirrors on the other side lets us obviously identify the super potential polytopes that we would use in the gross hyking kilogen save picture with the super potential polytopes in Rich Williams. Post in Rich Williams. And it's kind of a simple description. Essentially, given a pair of these polytopes that are defined appropriately, if we just take p trots, give our trot of the reach-Williams polytope, we'll get our polytope here. The other sorts of polytopes that Reach-Williams deal with are the Newton and Kuka bodies. And that makes use of the XNet coordinates that I've skipped over. But let me just say that there is some way that we can incorporate the XNet stuff as well. It's just not a It's just not exactly what you would expect at first. And you sort of have to deal with two different playback graphs at the same time. Coordinates that wind up being monomials when you take. When you take flows, for a certain playback graph, they form a cluster, but it's not the A cluster associated to the same playback graph, it's associated to a different playback graph. So it's G rec n minus Kn, sorry, G rec Kn A would correspond to G rec N minus Kn, which are mutation equivalent. Mutation equivalent, but relayed by inductable principles and that actually the same thing. And well, what we wind up doing is giving an isomorphism of these two fibers of clusters of X varieties. That's a monomial transformation. And very simple when you restrict to To frozen variables, to mutable variables. There's just explicit identification between mutable network parameters and mutable x variables, and then something monomial when you involve frozen portions. But there is one of these isomorphisms. Okay, which makes this diagram commuted. The one thing that looks a little bit strange here is these, the quivers associated to these guys are opposites. That said, there is such an isomorphism that makes this diagram commute. And using that isomorphism, we can also get the Rich-Williams-Newton-Kuckoff bodies and associated torque degenerations. And we'll stop at that right now. Thank you very much.
