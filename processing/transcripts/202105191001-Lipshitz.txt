In front of everybody, thanks. Great. Thanks very much for inviting me, and thanks to all of you for coming. Nice to see many familiar names and some familiar faces, and many unfamiliar names and some unfamiliar faces. Maybe all the faces are familiar, except for the wolf. Okay, a couple of things before I start. Slides are posted. I'm going to, most of the talk, or two-thirds of the talk is going to be handwritten. To be handwritten, so you can either, if you want, you can get the non-handwritten part only, or you can get the whole thing handwritten. So, we, you know, mathematicians discovered time travel, so you can see the future this way. A couple apologies. I'm aiming at people who haven't been following what's going on with this stuff. So, if you have been following it, it's all going to be almost all going to be very familiar and probably somewhat boring. And I'm not going to be terribly comprehensive. I'm not going to be terribly comprehensive about who contributed to the subject. So, if I don't mention somebody who contributed significantly, well, I'm sure that's going to happen. And I apologize in advance. Oh, and feel free to interrupt with questions. I'll try to watch the chat, but I'm not great at that. So if somebody notices questions in the chat, shout at me. Well, just a reminder, what we told audience members is don't put something in the chat if you expect the speaker to stop and read it. If you want to interrupt the speaker, raise your hand. If you want to interrupt the speaker, raise your hand or just, you know, speak out. Perfect, especially the speak out. Thanks, Ben. The plan is: I want to tell, so this is about stable homotopy farming modifier. You want to tell you what that means concretely. So that's the first, actually the first half of the talk, really. And a little bit about analogs and other theories that might be more familiar. And then I want to talk about just one aspect of the construction, the part that's sort of common to several, though not all, of these refinements. Several, but not all of these refinements. And I'll just say a few words about the rest and what is known, and especially what we don't know. Okay, so the Kavanaugh stable homotopy type. So recall, what does Kavanaugh homology do? So to a knot diagram, Kavanaugh homology Associates a bigraded abelian group Khij of K. It's the homology of a chain complex that I'm going to denote CKH IJ of K. And I've already made my first mistake. And I've already made my first mistake, which is, of course, not should be link. And I'm just terrible about saying link. So every time I say not in the whole talk, I mean link. To a cobordism of knots, sigma from k1 to k2. So that's a surface embedded in R3 cross I with boundary k1 and k2, k1 cross 0 and k2 cross 1. There's an associated There's an associated homomorphism f sigma from khij of k1 to, okay, there's a grading shift khij minus chi of sigma of k2. And this is functorial, so the map associated identity coordinates with the identity, that's extremely unsurprising. And f sigma prime circle f sigma is f. F sigma is F sigma prime circle sigma. And here, if one cobordism sigma is isotopic to sigma prime, then f sigma is equal to f sigma prime. In particular, this functoriality means that you can apply that for just isotopies. You can take sigma to be the trace of an isotopy. Be the trace of an isotopy. So if so, different diagrams. If K1 is isotopic to K2, then Khij of K1 is isomorphic to Khij of K2. Okay, so what's a stable homotopy refinement of that? Stable homotopy refinement of that. So, this was the first part of this was in joint work with Shuchit Sharkar. I should have said this on slide one. This is joint work with Shuch Sharkar and or and joint work with Tyler Lawson and Shuchrit Sharkar. So, given a link diagram, okay, and integers check. Integers j and n with n large, so sufficiently large. There is a space xj of k n such that um a A. The reduced cohomology of XJ of Kn is isomorphic to the Kavanaugh homology of K canonically. B. The dependence on N is very simple. So XJ of K of k n plus one is homotopy equivalent to the suspension of x j of k n so sigma denotes suspension c it's an isotopic invariant of the knot so if k is isotopic to k prime then again for n sufficiently large n sufficiently large, xj of k n is homotopy equivalent to xj of k prime n. And finally, this is a recent result from this year given a Kabordism sigma from k one to k two and And okay, again, we need a sufficiently large n. There's a map from, so it's called x sigma from xj of k n to xj maybe plus chi of sigma of k prime and let's go the other way. Let's say from k prime to k. From K prime to K inducing the map F sigma on comology. Further, F sigma prime circle sigma is the not F X is Is X sigma circle X sigma prime. And if sigma is isotopic to sigma prime, then X sigma is homotopic to X sigma prime. In particular, D implies C, but fine. So in other words, let me say a couple of things. Ah, let me say a couple of, let me decorate the theorem a little bit before I go to the in other words. These are nice spaces. So here, space actually means finite cell complex, finite CW complex. And here, in fact, this is true at the chain level. So C star plus N, the co-chain complex of XJ of Kn. Of xj of k n is let's say is the Kavanov complex star j of k. So in other words, we had a map from knots by which I mean links and cobordisms. To graded abelian groups. This is Kh star J. And I have the category of finite CW spectra that spaces up to suspension, basically. Is up to suspension basically. There's a map taking homology there, and this xj is a lift of this. Also, you might notice that the different j's don't interact with each other. So this is just happening for each quantum grading one at a time. Okay. And everywhere in the talk, you can sort of insert an end, but I'm just going to. Can sort of insert an n, but I'm just going to formally not do that. So I'm going to write xj of k to be the n-fold desuspension of xj of k. And that's not an actual operation, that's just formal. It means we're keeping track of the n somehow buried in the xj of k. Okay. K prime is k2. Yeah, k prime is k2. And k was k1. And K was K1. I did look at the chat. It might be the last time of the talk. Thanks, Matt. What does this give you? Okay, so, well, covonophenomology inherits an action of stable cohomology operations. So let me tell you what that means by first giving you an unstable cohomology operation. The famous one is cup product. So a cup product. So cup product is a map from HI of a space F. From hi of a space x, tensor hj of x to h i plus j of x. But okay, if I think about how that behaves for suspensions, it doesn't behave well. So if you suspend h i of x tensor h j of x, that's isomorphic to h i plus one. Hi plus one of the suspension of X, tensor H J plus 1 of the suspension of X. And on the one hand, this by cup product maps to Hi plus J of X. Okay, and this maps by cup product to Hi plus J plus 1 of the suspension of X. And that's isomorphic to H To H, sorry, plus two. And this is Hi plus J plus one of the suspension of X. So those are not the same. And well, there's nothing here to commute, but it doesn't commute. I mean, there's no diagram there, and the diagram that isn't there doesn't commute. Okay. In fact, if you have a space that's a suspension of another space and the cup product van. Suspension of another space and the cup product vanishes on its cohomology. So, what else could it do given this horrible diagram? Okay, so you don't get, so since x j of k is only defined, only defined up to suspension, you don't get. Don't get a cut product on Kavanov homology. In fact, it's worse than that. You get no interesting new structure. I mean, no new structure. Havano homology with coefficients. With coefficients in Q or C or R or anything else of characteristic zero. So if you're only interested in characteristic zero behavior, you're not interested in torsion, dishomotopy refinements do nothing for you. That stable homotopy theory in general does nothing for you. So bad news. So again, if you're only interested in coefficients in C, for example, you may as well tune out for the rest of the talk and do something else. What you do get are stable homology operations, Eugene. Do you have an action of homology of unnod, on homology of any node? Yeah, you have an action of the space associated on nod on the space associated to any node. Is it interesting topologically? It is interesting topologically. Okay, yeah, it is interesting topologically. Yeah, in fact, more generally, we have an extension of tangles. So you have an action of the arc algebra on a knot that's been decomposed into, I mean, sorry, the spectrified arc algebra. Yeah. What you do get is, for example, an action of C naught squares or C naught operations. So C naught operations, the C naught operations. The first example are squares, so these are maps SQK from h i of x with z mod two coefficients to h i plus k of x with z mod two coefficients. And here the corresponding diagram does commute. So h i of x z two so there's a suspension map to h i plus one of x. Hi plus one of x z two. This maps by square k to h i plus k of x z two, which is isomorphic to h i plus k. Sorry, this should have been a suspension, of course. Good job, Robert. Sigma x z2 that maps by square k to h i plus k plus 1 of sigma x z. Sigma x z two and this diagram does commute so you get a well-defined operation square k from khij of k z two to k h i plus k j of k z two And in particular, the carbonism maps on Kavan horsemology have to commute with these steam-rod squares. So that gives you already some restriction on what carbonism maps can do. Okay, the first of these, SQ1 is the Boxteen from the coefficient sequence 0 to Z2 to Z4 to Z2 to 0. So that's determined by the Gavana homology. By the Kavanaugh homology with Z coefficients. So there's nothing new or interesting. Square one is not new and interesting, but square two and higher are new. Okay. For covertisms, you get hop-like invariants. So if you look at like com from S n plus one to Sn, this is Z mod two. These are spheres. On the other hand, if you just look at the map on cohomology, that would be trivial because there's no grading for the map on cohomology to be interesting. So that gives you some new information, potentially. Some new information potentially about covortisms. Another place that this has seen remarkable, you know, proved something remarkable, not due to us, is that if Z P acts on K by rotation, oh, I see I've got a typo in the notes I posted. Oh, well, you get an action of Z. Of Zp on the associated space XJ of K. So let me give you an example. I mean X by rotation. So here's the trefoil. There, there, and there. There, there, and there. And there's a rotation by pi around that point. Pi around that point takes this diagram to itself. And so there's a theorem due to Staffrig and Jang and also, okay, I'm going to butcher the pronunciation if I say this, Borjic, Politarchic, and Silvera with great apologies for the. With great apologies for the pronunciation, that the fixed set of this action is the space X associated to the quotient by the Z p action. So in particular, In particular, not true, is the annular Kavanov space associated with the fixed set of the action. So, in particular, there's a spectral sequence from the Kavanaugh formology of K with coefficients in Zp to the annular Kavanaugh formology of the quotient with coefficients in Zp, which there doesn't seem to be. There doesn't seem to be a combinatorial proof of, at least so far. So that seems to so far require this space-level technology. Okay. Computations. So I want to start by telling you the boring cases where this construction, in fact, any construction like this can't give you more information. So what does boring mean? Given Given Gn abelian group. There's a space M of G n. This is called the Moore space is the space. It's unique up to homotopy with H i of M of G n. Of m of g n equal to g if i is equal to n and zero otherwise. So it's got non-trivial homology in only one grading, grading n, and there the homology is g. So for example, m of c n is sn it's got non-trivial homology only in grading n and zero otherwise. M of c mod 2n C mod 2n is it's a suspension of RP2, so it's the n minus first suspension of rp2, etc. I mean, the construction for Z mod P is very similar to the construction for Z mod 2. You attach a disk by a degree P map to a sphere. Here's an algebraic topology exercise. Suppose I have a space X has reduced cohomology zero for I different from n and n plus one h n of x torsion free. And X simply connected. For example, all of our spaces are suspensions of other spaces, so all of our spaces are simply connected. So this last condition is always true for the Kavanaugh spaces. Then X is a wedge sum of more spaces. So it's M of Hn of X and wedge M of H n plus one of X. h n plus one of x n plus one. In particular, x is determined by its homology. So a corollary of that is that if the Kavanaugh homology of K is thin, for example, K is alternating, then the space associated with K The space associated to k is a wedge sum of more spaces. So this space x of k is determined by the colonophomology of k. This is nothing, this is not specific to the construction. This is true for any of these stable homotops. True for any of these stable homotopy refinements of cabanophomology, and this would be true for stable homotopy refinements of other related invariants. So if your invariant you're finding is too simple, you don't get anything more from the space. Okay, that's unfortunate. On the other hand, there are less boring examples. So here's a theorem from the 1950s due to 50s due to Whitehead and Chang, and they went on and proved more. This is actually, from a modern perspective, I mean, like the one above is an exercise you can give the graduate students who begin the algebraic topology class. This is maybe a little hard, but not, I mean, this is an exercise you can give yourself. If h of x is zero for x is zero for i not equal to n n plus one or n plus two um let's say that uh h star of x has no odd torsion that's sort of for convenience um and x is simply connected then um so it's got So it's got comology in three adjacent degrees. That's the part to focus on. The first part is the part to focus on. Comology in three adjacent degrees. Then X is determined. Is determined by its comology and the operations SQ1. And the operations SQ1 and SQ2. These first two C non-squares. So in fact, X is a wedge sum of more spaces. That's like spheres, suspensions are P2. Suspensions of CP2. That's a space which has the property that we just said. Suspensions of RP4 mod RP2. Suspensions of RP5 mod RP RP sorry, RP4 mod RP1, RP5 mod RP2 and suspensions. And suspensions of RP2 smash RP2. And the way you tell, you classify these is by the quiver of what square one and square two look like. So here there are two generators. This is a grading n, n plus one. There's nothing in n plus two and a square two relating them. Here there are three generators and the quiver looks like this. The quiver looks like this, SQ2. Here there are three generators, and the quiver looks sort of like the backwards version of that. So square one, square two. And here, one way to draw it is this diamond. So there are four square ones: SQ1, SQ1, SQ1, and an SQ1. One and an sq2. Okay, so for spaces where the homology is in three adjacent gradings, the comology in three adjacent gradings, computing these T naught squares actually tells you the whole space. It's convenient. So, okay, so I just said that, but I'm going to write that. So computing SQ1 and SQ1 and SQ2 determines the space X of K if the Kavanophomology of K has width 3. There's actually a somewhat analogous theorem for width 4, I think, but then it becomes much more complicated. There are infinitely many different model spaces and statement is therefore more complicated. Complicated. So we are down a formula for square two, which is not terribly complicated, but it's not terribly simple either. I mean, it's more complicated than I want to write on the slide. So using that, you can just plug it into a computer. See, for example, the first interesting not, there's some smaller links that are interesting. The first interesting not is T34 and has an RP4 mod RP1. Wedge sum end. So it's not just a wedge sum of more spaces. Cotton seed extended the computations further. So he showed that there are knots with isomorphic Cavanophomology, but different. Kavanov spaces. So, this really does have more interesting, more information. So, there's a pair of knots with that property. I don't know what's special about these knots. In fact, these two knots also have equal homflipped polynomials. I don't know whether their homflipped homologies are equal because I don't know a convenient way to compute that. And there are lots of other pairs, so ones with equal Homphipp polynomials are somewhat rarer. What about higher squares? So for any n, there's a knot k with square. With square n on kh of k nontrivial. Okay, we produced composite knots, which is maybe not so satisfying to just connect sums of simple knots. Holt-Bodish improved that to prime knots. And one last remark about computations. out computations, no CP2s have been seen. It's not clear whether that's just a coincidence of we only computing for fairly small knots or whether that means something. I have no idea why there would be no CP2s in this space, but nobody's found one. All the other, the other, we had these four model spaces, they come up in width. Model space is a come up in width three, and these things have all been seen. It's just the first one that hasn't been seen. Strange. I should say a few words about relations to other invariants that may be more familiar. I'm going to say them a little bit expeditiously. So there are two other places, at least, that similar refinements have happened. The first one where there was a mathematically precise refinement is for Zeiberg-Witten theories. Find this first Iber-Witten theory. So, and it's due to Chiprian, of course. So, in 2001, Chiprian produced an S1 equivariant spectrum whose equivariant homology is the monopole fluorhomology and Seymour-Witten fluorhomology. He was interested in extending the Bauer-Fruda invariance to four manifolds of boundary and computing them, gave a formula for doing that. Okay, he did a case that B. Case that B1 equals zero. Pretty quickly after that, he and Peter Kernheimer did the case B1 equals one. And then much more recently, a group of three authors did the general B1 case. So that's wonderful. The construction is pretty different from what I'm going to describe in the second half of the talk. So this is part of the acknowledging the construction I'll give you is not the same one that was used there. On the other hand, maybe there should be a relationship to what I'm talking about. There should be a relationship to what I'm talking about because there's a spectral sequence relating Kavanaugh homology and the non-equivariant homology of this space. So the ordinary homology of the space for the branch I will cover if they're not. And we don't know what that space level refinement of that statement is. Maybe there should be an action on the Kavanaugh space with a fixed set as the Sadu-Wittenfloor space, or maybe Or maybe something else. I mean, it's not even quite clear what the conjecture should be. The other place, and the fact that this thing existed was definitely motivation for our thinking about this question. The other place that there's been similar refinements is for in symplectic phlephomology. So if you have a symplectic manifold, Homology. So, if you have a symplectic manifold and two Lagrangian sub-manifolds, actually, this wasn't quite the case they were thinking about, but it's close enough. Then, there's this Lagrangianization Fermi homology group, which you take the area, that's the integral of omega, that gives you a functional on the path space, and you try to do Morse theory to it. Okay, it doesn't satisfy the Pele-Smail condition, so it's not really Morsemology, but you can still run the strategy that was one of the original problems considered by. Problems considered by FLUR. This space has a comes, this path space from L0 to L1 comes with a map-to-U model called the polarization that's easy to define and I'm happy to answer later if people want. We already see that that's relevant in Florimology. So the Fleurmology groups have a Z grading if and only if the polarization vanishes on pi one. Pi one of U mod O is C. See. So in the early 90s, Cohen-John Siegel conjectured that, okay, under some conditions that prevent bubbling. And if the polarization is null homotopic on the whole space, then there should be a stable homotopy refinement of this pleuromology group. And they can just conjecture that. They gave a proposed construction. Now, there's some analytic difficulties with the construction that haven't been overcome yet, though really they should be. The techniques are out there and it's sort of like. And it's sort of like really seems within grasp, but nobody's written it down, I believe. So there's a construction there, and that's part of that construction is what I'm going to try to talk about in the next half of the talk, a bit less than half of the talk. There's also a Lagrangian, as has been mentioned previously in the conference, the Lagrangian intersection Fleur interpretation of Kavantophomology due to Zeidel Smith. Rationally, that Rationally, that's known to be equal to cavanophomology. Of course, this whole talk is not about rational characteristic zero behavior. This whole talk is really only about torsion. The relationship between sort of the, so now that gives us a conjectural space-level refinement of symplectic cavanophomology, and we could conjecture that that's equivalent to the space-level refinement I'm talking about. Silver refinement, I'm talking about that we don't know. Finally, I thought I should point out that this line of reasoning was used really spectacularly by Abuzai-Blumberg this year to prove the Arnold conjecture and finite characteristic for general sympathetic manifolds. So they were considering Hamiltonian phlemology, not Lagogenous action pharmology, but basically the same thing. So this is still an active area of research and very useful. Okay. Okay, end of the friends. From flower categories to spectrum. So a dark and gloomy story. No, a bright and delightful story. I want to focus on a couple of simple examples rather than the general definition to try to give the flavor of what's going on. So, idea. Due to Cohen-Jones SQL. Due to Covan-Jones SQL. I'm just going to replace copies of Z in the construction of Kavanophomology with spheres. So build XKH or the Lagrangian case or whatever, just cell by cell, where cells correspond to generators of C. Of CKH. Well, I'm going to have this going to be an extra zero cell. So cells accept the zero cell. So I'm going to do reduced homology, reduced cohomology. So in other words, we're going to try to get the cellular chain complex of X to be CKH. Okay, so first example. Let's take a, I'm going to start with an example that's too small to see much interesting, so where everything is just happening in two adjacent degrees. So let's consider the following chain complex: A, B, C, D. For whatever reason, I like to draw my chain complexes as graphs with labels. Complexes as graphs with labels on the edges. What this actually means is the differential of A is C minus D, and that's also differential of B. This is the same as the Morse complex associated to a Morse function on the circle, so with four critical points, A, B, C, D. Okay, the prescription is we're going to attach. Going to attach a zero cell, an n cell for C, an n cell for D, and n plus one cell for A, and an N plus one cell for B. This part is no interesting way to attempt. Um, there's no interesting way to attach an n-cell to a zero cell. So the n-skeleton is just going to be a wedge sum of two spheres. That is SNC wedge SND, a wedge sum of two spheres. So then if I want to attach SN plus, sorry, DN plus one. One A, the cell associated to A, by a map from the boundary of dn plus one, which is Sn, to the N skeleton, which was Sn C wedge SND. Let's call this map something, say, phi. And I want to recover the cellular chain complex on the left. So I want to recover this chain complex. Okay. Okay. Phi should have degree one to SNC and minus one to SND in order to recover this chain complex that's on the left. I've just told you phi. There's only one homotopy class of maps that does that. But now I'm going to tell you phi in a more complicated way, because the more complicated way is going to generalize. More complicated way is going to generalize. Notice that there's these, if I think about this as coming from the Morse complex, the fact that C appears in the differential is coming from this flow line, and the fact that D appears in the differential is coming from that flow line. So let's call those flows something. Let's call them maybe, I don't know, let's call it gamma sub D and gamma. Gamma sub D and gamma sub C. Here's a way to produce the map phi, this map, using gamma C and gamma D. So one way to get phi embed gamma C and gamma D. Gamma C and gamma D into the boundary of the n plus one disk associated to A. And frame them. So frame gamma sub C positively because the coefficient there in the chain complex was positive and gamma sub D negatively. Do myself a tiny bit. Give ourselves a tiny bit more room. Let's actually do that. So, yeah. So, here is D2A, and its boundary is, sorry, S1A. I'm going to draw the one n equals 1 case. And I'm going to embed gamma sub. Gamma sub C and gamma sub D into the boundary there, and I'm going to frame them. That just means I choose a trivialization of the tangent bundle there. Okay, they're framed. That identifies a neighborhood of gamma C with a standard interval. So there's now a collapse map which collapses everything outside those two standard interval. Outside those two standard disks. So this map, here's, I've collapsed everything that's not shaded blue. So here's gamma sub C sitting in the middle of the blue and gamma sub D sitting in the middle of that blue. And we still have those arrows if we like. And then this comes with an obvious map to S. S1C wedge S1D. So here's S1C and S1D. Because I had a wedge sum of two spheres, two circles, and so I just do the match up the orientation. So these are both oriented, say, that way. So that's degree one on the neighborhood of gamma C and degree one on the neighborhood minus one neighborhood of gamma d. So this is. This is like the Pontryagin-Tom construction. So apply the Pontryagin Tom collapse map. Okay. As I said, it's a little bit silly. I'm trying to just produce a map which has degree one to this sphere and minus one to that sphere. And minus one to that sphere. So it's a little bit hard to see why one should do such a complicated construction in this simple case. Let's do a slightly more complicated example where the construction will be partly justified. So let's take this chain complex A, B, C, D, 1, 1, 0, which I'm going to think of as 1 minus 1. And that comes from a Morse function on S2, if we like. Two, if we like. So here's A, B, C, and D. And now, again, I'm going to replace every generator by a sphere. So instead of taking Z's, I'm going to have this generated by, sorry, by a disk. So this is going to be generated by. This is going to be generated by, okay, at the bottom I have a sphere, and then above that, I have disk, EN plus one C, because the bottom disk is attached to the base points. The whole boundary is collapsed there. Union E n plus two A and E N plus two B. Okay. Okay. This map from, so I'm going to first describe how we get this part, and then I'm going to describe how I attach the n plus 2 cells. So for this part, let's play the same game that we played above. So let's take D2C. Here I have two. Here I have two flow lines from C to D. So I'm going to embed those two flow lines in the boundary. And if I kept track of the orientations of the moduli spaces, they would have opposite orientations. So here in green is M of C D. And this gives me a map from the boundary of the disk to S1 by doing the collapse. So collapse. So collapsing takes me down to these neighborhoods mod boundary. Again, I have the flow line still sitting in the boundary. And then that folds together to just S1D. Okay. Now, what about this part? What about this part? So, here I'm going to build a map from Sn plus 1 to what I constructed before, E N plus 1, C union, SN D. Okay. And I need the map from Sn plus 1 to En plus 1 C to have degree 1 because of this 1 in the differential. Okay, so let's do that. I'm going to start by embedding A the moduli space from A to C into the boundary of my into my S n plus one, just S2. So here is M of A C. There's one point. And I'm going to frame it. Okay, it's framed. And then identifies a neighborhood of this point with a standard disk. With a standard disk. That's what the framing does. Now, I would like to say just collapse everything outside this disk to a point and map this disk to EN plus 1C, but that's not continuous because the boundary of the N plus 1 cell was itself attached to the N cell D. Okay, so I can't just collapse everything outside this neighborhood. The problem is. The problem is neighborhoods of these two points were already being identified with the n-sphere associated to D. Okay, so I have to do something different on those two neighborhoods that was drawn in blue above. Let's connect up those neighborhoods. Ah, this looks like I should consider the Like, I should consider the moduli space from A to D. That's a one-dimensional manifold. It's an interval. So embed that moduli space with boundary. These two points, what are those two points? Those are M of A C times M of C D. And frame it. Okay, it's framed. It's framed. And now that gives me a collapse map where this part maps to EN plus 1C, and this part maps to SND by each of these normal directions, each of those maps by a homeomorphism to SND. S and D. Okay, um, and now in this dimension, the dimension I drew, there's only one way to frame this arc I drew. But if I drawn a picture one dimension up, there would be two ways to frame it. Actually, there'd be Z's worth of ways. If I drew it two dimensions up, there'd be two ways to frame it corresponding to pi one of SO4, SO3, whatever, SO3. And depending And depending on the framing of this arc and the other one corresponding to B, you get either SN wedge SN plus 2 or CP2. Remember, I'm not supposed to get this, I'm not supposed to get S2 back. I'm just getting the reduced cohomology, the same as the homology of my. The same as the homology of my complex. So I wasn't expecting an S2. So these are either of these has the right cohomology. Time is nipping in our heels. So the data needed. We needed the generators for the complex. For the complex. So what is that? Well, it's just a set of, I'm going to call them objects ob C, that's just the generators of the complex. And then for each generator, it has a grading. The grading of x, that's an integer. And then for every pair. And then for every pair of generators x, y in objects of C, we need a space of flows to embed. So that's a compact manifold with corners of a slightly special form, manifold with corners of dimension grading of x minus grading of y minus one. It needs to be a manifold with corners that admits an embedding into R plus, sorry, R plus to the grading X minus grading Y minus 1 cross R N. I need these inclusions Um for the broken flow cxy times cyz to C of XZ, sorry, the boundary of C of XZ. And again, those have to satisfy some compatibility condition. And finally, you need the framings of the stable normal bundles or the tangent bundles to. To V CXY. And from this, this gives you a space. So this current John Siegel construction. It's very, I'll write it down in the next slide. I'm not going to go through that. I'm going to just flash through that. And that space, the cellular chain complex of it has. Has the degree n part generated by the set of x in ob C such that the gradient of x is n. And the boundary of x is the sum over objects y with grading n minus 1 of the number of flows from x to y times y. And this number sign uses the framing. Which, when the space is just points, is just a plus sign or a minus sign. Roughly, this data here, so this is called a flow category, and it's just a version of what you'd mean by a chain complex of topological spaces. So, if you think of not chain cobbles or abelian groups, but chain cobalt spaces, you point out what that means, you come to this definition. Definition. Okay, I want to spell this out in more detail for time reasons, but it's spelled, it's very simple, it's spelled out in the literature. So, in particular, you might have this in lots of other floor-type theories or places perhaps in physics that you see flows. This is a basically complete description of how you get a space from it, which I'm going to skip. But I just wanted to point out that it's not very complicated to say how you get a space, some simple topological construction. Simple topological construction. So, for the rest of the construction, how do we build this homotopy type? We just have to build a flow category of finding Kavanaugh. It turns out that the interesting stuff there is for generators with grading difference two. And we make some. So the data you need in this flow category is sort of a rule that explains y is d squared equals zero. So it's some extra data that specifies y is d squared equals zero. is d squared equal to zero. Okay, and then it's not very hard to, it turns out to be in this case easy to construct the higher-dimensional moduli spaces, and then invariance is also easy. I'm going to skip that completely. Well, I'll say one word. If you didn't have framings, you get something, you might get something in between a space and a chain complex. So if you have something weaker than a framing, you can still get something out of it. Fine. What do we know about this? What do we know about this invariant? Okay, we know the theorem I told you at the beginning, so it's a functor link invariant. We know some basic properties like how it be has unconnected sums and its extension of tangles related to Eugene's question from earlier. We have some computations of it and some little applications due to, well, both due to a bunch of people. We know it behaves under some stabilization operations. How it behaves with periodic knots, I mentioned that earlier. There's a version for annihilating Kavanaugh. There's a version for anniolectivanophomology that I think Mike will probably talk about tomorrow. There's a, actually, I don't remember if that's true at all. There's a version for odd Kavanophomology, and there are a few other conjectural extensions, special cases of extensions, but not much else. What we don't know is practically everything. We don't know an analog of the Lie deformation or other equivariant versions of Cavanophomology. We don't know analogs for SL. Homology. We don't know analogs for SLN or Hamflit. We don't know a definition. There are a bunch of definitions of anohmology. You can do it what you know combinatory. We also do it the algebraic geometry or categorified representation theory. And we don't know space-level versions of those things. We don't know a mathematically precise version for not flur homology so far. We have that sketched due to Cohen-Jones-Siegel. We don't know the relationship to Sari-Witten flurry. To Sawigwooden for homotopy type, I mentioned that earlier. And there, we don't even have a precise conjecture. We can't prove the relationship to Seidel-Smith's theory. And finally, people tend to ask, well, for example, can you give an intrinsic definition of the space? There are lots of other questions that we don't know the answer to for Kavanophomology. Anything I don't know about Kavanaugh formology, I also don't know about this space. So anything that we don't know about Kavanaugh, we don't know here. You don't know here. Okay, I thought I would end with: here's a Kvanov homotopy from a little Kvanov to the Kavanaugh that we have today. Thanks very much for listening. Thanks, Robert. Other questions? Okay, Jake? I'm sorry, Jake, I think you're muted. Sorry. The naive definition of functoriality for Kovanov is only projectively well defined. So can you say what? I should have said that. Yeah, this was also up to a sign. I meant to say that. Up to a sign. I meant to say that and then I didn't. Yeah, so that's way back here. Thanks. So it's like this and that are up to sine. Okay, what the hell does up to sine mean? There's a map, roughly, there's a map from Sn to Sn of degree minus. To Sn of degree minus one, just reflect the first coordinate and smash with that map. So I should have set up a sign here. There are lots of techniques for dealing with that sign for Kavanaugh homology, and presumably one of them, or more work here with some extra work. But for example, the simplest ways to do it use a lead affirmation, which we don't have. Don't have and um I don't know the tangling variance a little more complicated than so on, so I'm not sure. I don't know whether the, I mean, I don't know whether that size is fixable. Presumably, I would guess it is. But okay, yeah. Thanks. Thank you, Melissa. Hi, thanks. I was just thinking about your question about how you can. How you can spacify a spectral sequence. And I think my first impression would be: okay, let's try it, not try to do the actual relationship between Kavanov and Fleur theories, but let's try using Savo's geometric spectral sequence. So knowing the maps from there, would the Q category be sufficient, or like what sort of structure would you expect to be able to capture longer arrows? Since any spectral sequence is going to have, you know, Sequence is going to have, like, you know, possibly very, very long arrows? I don't know. That's a good question. So you're both there and for the least spectral sequence and for this one, they all mix the different quantum grading. So maybe you have, I mean, I can, I could speculate that you have. I could speculate that you have a, it sort of lives over a bunch of different cubes connected by arrows where you would have longer differentials. So you've got different cubes for different quantum gradings. But I don't know when I think it's unlikely that I hate making predictions. I think it's unlikely that, you know. Likely that, you know, it's easy to make predictions about anything except the future, whatever Yogi Bera said. It's hard to make predictions about the future. I don't know. I think it's unlikely that it's going to be as simple as just the strong unions of permutahedra. So, and I don't know whether the structure of it, sort of the fact that the font of complex lived over the cube is going to help you a lot there or not. I just don't know. Yeah, looking at the Zabo spectrum seems to be interesting. Here's a simpler question. Seems to be interesting. Here's a simpler question that somebody could work out that should be answerable. We have these Steenrod squares on Kavanaugh homology coming from this space. If there's a homotopy refinement of these spectral sequences, probably those T-naught squares should commute with all the differentials in the spectral sequence. So, like, we give a not very complicated formula for square two. Does it or does it not commute with the differentials in the spectral sequence? Thanks, Ben. Predictions are hard. Ah, thanks, Ben. Predictions are hard, especially about the future. Yes. Yeah, so, like, and okay, one could compute some examples. One could try to prove that the C-node operation, just the first few maybe, are commuted with a differential inspective sequence. And they are the two or they don't. Probably want to use the odd Kavanaugh-hamotopy type for these things because, you know, square one is the box gene, and I'm sure that, you know, since. I'm sure that, you know, since the special signals comes from odd Kubanophology, surely you need to use the odd Kubanophology proxy. Yeah, somebody should do that. And we haven't, I don't think. And it shouldn't be that hard to just compute some examples and see to the sequence, spectrospectal sequence. Thank you. My pleasure. Sorry. Robert, when you say a stable combined refinement of a spectral sequence, could it be something like a vibration or what do you mean by that? Yeah, I don't know what I mean by that. Yeah, I don't know what I mean by that. That's why I keep hedging. It could be something like a vibration special sequence. It could be something like, I mean, all special sequences are the same. It could be, you could have an action and have something like what long string of people, what Melissa and others did here. So you had a Z2 action. I mean, there's a way to see, especially goes from covariophonology to Orphology to from symplectic Kavanaugh, HF had a branch of recovery via Z2 action. So maybe something like a Z2 action. Maybe it's something else, filtered space, but that doesn't seem to be quite right. I think Eugene was next. Yeah, thanks. I have a naive question. So if you have an exact triangle, so you have a skin relation and all three spaces are related by some. And all three spaces are related by some cobordisms. So do you expect that cobordism maps fit some kind of exact triangle of spaces or something like that? Yes. Yeah. The obvious guess there is that, and I think it's true, is that you have a just a co-fibration sequence. So you have, yeah, we have a blank page sitting somewhere here. So like Here. So, like, if I have an inclusion A into X to X mod A or X uni the conon A, then that gives you a Long Sec sequence in homology. And I think that, so for the unoriented skein relation, whatever it is like that, that does give a cofibration sequence like this for the Kavanaugh spaces. And probably that's true for other skein relations. Probably that's true for other scan relations. I mean, whatever other sort of exact sequences, our long sequence can covano homology. So, in particular, this thing on the left is actually a sub-space of the thing in the middle. That's right. Although everything's sort of up to homotopy. So, optohomotopy, every map is an inclusion and every map is a vibration. So, that's a somewhat semi-vacuous statement. But you can see what I'm really saying is you can build the space associated to. Build the space associated to this so that the space on the left is a subspace and this is a quotient, so for some choice. And the other scan relation when you have this and that. I guess you can build it from this. So we haven't thought about it. We haven't thought about it. But that would be my guess would be a co-fibration sequence, but like, but somebody should check that. I don't know. That would be interesting. Somebody should do that. Somebody should do that. That's a great idea. Somebody should definitely do that. Okay. Chibram? I was curious about your examples of the two nuts with the different spectra, but the same Kovanov and the same Hamstead polynomial. Are they mutant? Yeah, I knew you were going to ask that. Not according to Cotton. Cotton says he checked the table of all mutant pairs and. mutant pairs and none of the things he found that had were distinguished by this were mutants they sure look like they could be right like they're lots of i don't know they're like lots of fortangles not that i've actually tried but like i don't know i i i i cotton says not and i'm sure he's right but it wouldn't hurt for us or somebody else to check that again you can check the hyperbolic volume that's this yeah i should check the hyperbolic volume okay i haven't done that so is anything known about Okay, I haven't done that. So, is anything known about mutation invariance? Nothing is known about mutation invariance. That's a good question. It's, yeah, it's mod two homology is invariant under mutation. Okay. Maybe I should mention just one thing. So in my work with Lisa, we had like this 21 knots, and some pairs of those have this property, like they have the same Hovano homology and the same knot flow homology and the same home-flight polynomial, but they are not mute. Out, but they are not mutants, and we don't know why. That's really interesting. Yeah, I mean, probably these are not mutants either, and I don't know what's going on. Yeah, that's interesting. Okay, Matt? Yeah, so I have a question about eigenmaps. So if you if I have So, if I have a map between Kavanov homology complexes, how can I recognize if that map is realized at the level of spaces or not? I mean, I guess, so specifically, like if you have like the full twist complex in the Kvanov world, it emits lots of maps either to or from the identity, depending on how you're going to get full twist. Yes, and I guess my And I guess my question is: Are these realized by space level maps? I should defer to other audience members who know better than me, like Slava, for instance, or Mike if he's here, though. Maybe he isn't. Oh, yeah. Oh, he is. Oops, sorry. The camera is. There it goes. Yeah, I mean, certainly, like, the kind of Like the kind of simplest map where you know, just sort of the identity complex kind of either includes at the end or is the quotient because it's at the top. That one is definitely fine. But yeah, the other maps seem more.
