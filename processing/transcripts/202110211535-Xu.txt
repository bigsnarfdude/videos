So, Xiaoi, are you in Khofei now? Yeah. So, okay. And I was in Khofe from the August. August okay, so now uh if we go anyway, you have to to get uh in 40 hours in 48 hours. And just recently, okay, uh, from yesterday and today, uh, we heard from news many provinces found some The summer seven. So, so I don't know how maybe this is not the best sign, you know, it's not a good, not a good news, not a bad sign. I think it's compared to we have the 14 billion people, you know, that's very, very small. Yes. Will you attend the conference in Nankai? Yes, I will go. I am to go. Me too. Okay. We can see in Nankai. We can meet in Nanka. Yeah, sure, sure. We see each other very much. At least, okay, it's almost as time. Okay, the next. Okay, the next speaker is Xiao Weishui, Professor Xiao Weishui from Chinese University of Science and Technology. And he will speak on pseudo-holomorphic map between almost Harmitian manifolds. And please, shall we? Thank you, Professor. Professor Zhou for introduction. And also thank the organizer Ning Zhang and De Ping Ye for invitation. My talk is on solid holomorphic map between almost the Hermitian manifolds. This is a joint work with Professor Peng Cha Gui. My talk divided in five sections. The first section I will recall some non-result or almost Hermitian geometry. The second and third section, I will introduce Liou-Wear-type theorems and the soda holomorphic city or plural harmonic map, which based on Which based on the theory of harmonic map. The fourth section, I will introduce some results on the pseudo-holomorphic isometry, which based on the minimal, the theory of minimal submarine force. At last, in the end, I will introduce a problem. Problem which I like. Let's begin. Recall the colouric connection. And Armstrong is a triple. M, G, and G. M is a two-dimensional small manifold. J is a almost complex structure. Acts on the tangent bundle. The G is a remanu metric which is invariant and the almost complex structure. So by this the last identity, we can define a two-form called the fundamental two-form. The fundamental two-form associated Ohm's Hemission metric. If we extend the Ohmster complex structure to the complexification of the tangent bundle, we have a decomposition which divides into one zero part and there one part And there is one part. Similarly, we can by use this different decomposition, we can extend the G to the forms for K forms, which can be splitted into PQ form, some summation of PQ forms. Arfen connection lambda on tangent bundle. It's well called almost condition. If we preserve the two structure, the almost complex structure and the metric G. By this two condition, we choose a unitary frame almost. Uh almost a missing connection preserve the type of frame the first the first and second structure from equations can be written by where the largest seed i is the torsion and Tossing and omega i is the curved form. Since the connection is not remaining, so usually this term is a always exist. Is that when is a long result that on the arms commission may be a majority of the m Omstehmission manifold emission geometry. There exists a unique omstermission connection. Host one part of the torsion is zero. It's called coloric connection on Omsteich machine manifold. When j is interval, this is just the chain connection. In the following, we always focus. In the following, we always focus on the collateral connection. As before, if always splitting the torsion into two zero part and zero two part, we can write as follows. And also for the curvature, I miss index J here. here uh for the curvature part uh curvature we can split into uh two zero part and zero zero part and uh one one part and zero two part they have this the curved tensor have this properties euro will have four important curves The first is a holomorphic section curvature giving one zero vector field. By using the one one part of the curvature, we can define a holomorphic sectional curvature. Give two one value tangent field, we can define Tangent field: we can define a holomorphic bisection curvature. The bisection means we use two one-zero vector. We can by contracting on different place, we got two rich curvature. If we contract on these two place, we got the first rich curvature. The first reach curvature and the three four part position, we got the second rich curvature usually. These two reach curves are not equal. They are equal when the manifold when M is calorie. There are four important almost commission manifold. The first, if the fundamental The first, if the fundamental two form is closed, it's called ohms commission calorie ohms calorie if the one two part of d omega is equal to zero is called quasi calorie the semicolon is d star omega equal to zero where the d star is a codifferential of d And the daily calorie means that d x j acts on x is equal to zero for any small vector field on n, where d is not the canonical connection, it is the levy servicer connection we're familiar with. By using By using the torsion of the caloric connection, we can character this two Ohm's commission manifold as follows. For example, if the if it's almost coloring is the one to zero part is equal to zero and does the and does the zero two parts of the torsion satisfy this property circling the and circling the indexes uh summarization of uh um n i j and circling the indexes and is equal to there seemingly for uh for the remaining two case two cases uh we need two uh important uh operates uh on manifolds. The fourth most function we got the caloric cohesion which is defined by lambda du and taking the trace we got the caloric Laplacing which is different from the urea Laplace defined by the levitical connection A function is called strictly pluralistub harmonic if the one one part of the Hessian is positive definite similarly giving a record field we can define the we can define the the clarital divergence by using Divergence by using the connection. This proposition tells the difference between Laplace and the colonic divergence and the ural lablashing and the ural divergence. The uralizing of a function u is equal to bulk leveling of u. And the minus two gradient u take in product with X L. Well, X L is a vector field defined by the to the part of the clinical the torsion of the kinetic connection by the By the same proposition before, allow all these in these four cases, the LG is equal to Z. So in these two special almost the Hermitian manifold, the URL Lablation are equal to the box Lablazing and also the divergence. The divergence. When we study smooth map between manifolds, we always study the second fundamental form giving two almost commission manifolds, M, M tilde, M tilde, with dimension 2M, 2N respectively. To n respectively. Then let F be a smooth map from M into M tilde. We have the differential. Then taking the covariant differential of DF, we got the second fundamental form. We call the claric second fundamental form. If we choose a unitary frame, the differential can be expressed as follows. And also, the second fundamental form can be divided into eight part. We can define the partial energy density, the holomorphic part is. The holomorphic part is defined by AIF, the square of the loam of the AIF and the anti-holomorphic part. Then the allergy density is the holomorphic allergy density plus some anti-holomorphic allergy density. Anti-colomorphic energy density and the half-lum of the color second time for is given by this formula. Let F be a smooth map between two ohms commission manifolds. What we call F is a pseudo-holomorphic means that the tangent map DF is commute. DF is commutes with two G, the almost complex structures. It's called coloric geodesic if the signal mental form is vanishing. And it's called the plural harmonic if the one one part of the second fundamental form is zero. In local form, f is a soda holomic means that the uh the power the knockoff functions with uh bar on the indexes uh is equal to zero or in the anti-holomorphic electric density is equal to zero the uh pluralistabah mark is equivalent to the uh To the indexes with one is euro and the other with a bar is equal to zero. The second part will introduce some neural type theorem. Let F be a pseudo-holomorphic map from a homeshimming manifold into another one, into another one. And another one. If M is in open set, nice in open set of M tilde, and there is a strict plural subharmonic functions U on V, then M is a constant. The sketch of Provision, since the map is pseudo-holomorphic, then Is a pseudo-holomorphic, then we have Ai bar F equal to zero, and hence the Ai G bar F is equal to zero. Then we calculate the collective laboratory of U circle F. Then we obtain a very brief formula since U is uh since uh u is a strictly pluralist this this this matrix is a uh positive uh positive definite so the term this is uh is a great equal to zero so by the maximum principle implies e f is equal to zero and hence zero and hence f is a constant since ui of bar is positive. Suppose F is a third holomark map from a closed almost commission manifold into another one with the first was the the The second rich pencil is non-negative and the holomorphic bisechnature curvature of the target manufacture is negative. Then f is two. Then f is totally geodesic. If the second risk curve of the for the domain manifolds is positive at one point, then f is a constant. We sketch our proof, we have the Bochlo formula. This buckler formula belongs to buffalo formula it belongs to a study who study a the short level uh or almost uh between almost commission manifold the curved conviction implies box e greater equal to zero so the maximum principle implies e is a constant and hence the second fundamental form is equal to zero if f If the second rich curvature of M is positive at a point, then the term in the below, this is quite zero. This term is equal to zero. And hence this equal to zero. Now we know which M is positive, so we get the tangent map. Get the tangent map or F is function. So E is equal to zero. We can notice the condition of the curvature as follow. If the domain manifold is the second rate of domain manifold is greater than equal to A, and the holomorphic biosignal curvature of the target manifold. Of the target manifold is not equal to B. If the LG of a solid holomorphic map is small enough, is not great to A over B, then F is totally geodesic and the EF equals zero or A over B. Furthermore, if F is Furthermore, if F is constant, if EF is low equal, strictly low equal to A over B. The idea of the proof is similar by using the Bok formula and the maximum principle. So I omitted the next theme with that is the universal time efforts. is the universal time effort theorem from the when the domain manifold is uh complete one suppose m is m is a complete low compact almost emission manifold with in finite volume and the second reach is greater equal to zero and the target manifold with permission by second curvature Commission by second curvature not equal to zero not equal to zero if uh the and there is a lot of conditioning on the uh domain manifold that's uh how uh in phylate volume if uh a pseudo holomorphic map with a phylate allergy uh we and the uh And integral equality curves, then f is a constant. Here, XL is defined as before. So when M is the four special oms Hermitian manifold, this equality is always heard. Schedule the this is schedule of the proof by the bottle formula. The curse the under the cushion-schwarz inequality implies these two inequality. We construct an auxiliary function defined by squared of EF plus epsilon, where epsilon is a positive. A positive number do calculations directly. We can prove that both u epsilon great equal to zero. Then we do some integral estimate. We choose. We choose a point at a we fix a point at Ying N and two geodesical center at X with the radius R to R respectively. Then we choose a cutoff function which are which the gradient The gradient is controlled by R over C, where C is a positive constant, is absolutely constant. Then, well, the integration of these two functions are all negative. So it's integration is greater. It's integration is great equal to value. Then integration by path, we got a quadratic polynomial with respect to this term. So we got we got this inequality and if we And if we uh if we um substituting this term into the inequality above, we add this estimate where this integration is over sigma, where the points that Ef is not equal to zero or low is. Not equal to zero. Although Ef is always non-negative, then well, we that's epsilon goes to zero and R goes to infinity. We got this, which means that the gradient of F is equal to Z is equal to zero, which means that E. Which means that Ef is a constant. Hence, is a constant. So it's it must be to zero since f have finite energy and the volume of mg is infinite. This is a proof. The remark I mentioned before. before uh the second part the second part uh was the third part was uh introduced some relat on the sodo holomorphic city or pluralist subharmonic well no a pseudo holomorphic map is always pluralist homologic map so the inverse problem or question is that give Our question is that giving us a polari harmonic map under which condition that it is pseudo-holomorphic. The first one is let M be a closed almost commission manifold with the secondary risk curve equal to A. A and the target ohms target manifold has the with the holomorphic bisection curve lower equal to B and the two-zero part of the curvature bounded by C. Then if the polari harmonic map satisfies this inequality then F Inequality, then F is a sodoholomorphic map. This equality means that L or this the polyhomorphic map is small enough, then F is pseudoholomorphic. For the time, I omit the detailed proof. Proof. Next, if that is a complete almost mission manifold with secondary squared equal to zero, and the thousand part and the curvature part of curved bounded by C, which means that M has the bounded geometry. Has the bounded geometry. Let M Qt be almost Hermitian with a holomorphic bisignal curvature bounded by with low bounded B1 and up bound B2. If the holomo then then if a polar harmonic map From M to M tilde, it's anti-holomorphic energy density controlled by the holomorphic holomorphic energy density with a uniform constant. Then F is pseudo-holomorphic. The probe also needs to integration estimate. One needs to construct oxygen function and the bulk formula and also need the generalized maximum principle which the original is due. Original is due to yao for the remaining case, and it will it is generalized to the both labeling by Tosati when he studies the short label between almost the commission manifold. I omit the details. The fourth part is the pseudo-holomorphic isometry, which based on some knowledges, I studied the minimal submarine force. Net F be a pseudo-holomorphic isometric from M into M tota. We can choose adapt. Adapt unitary frame E alpha tutor, which means that the EI tutor tangent to F M and the E alpha namela are normal to F m. Then we got the Gauss equation, Rich equation, and the Kadazi equation. I just write down the one one part of this three equation. This three equation. They are also have two zero parts and there are two part which is not used in our proof. So I doesn't miss here. The first proposition is let F is a solid holomorphic isomatic between two Holomorphic isometric between two omstegmission manifolds with the target manifold with the holomorphic bisectional curvature or target manifold lower equal to b then the first reach minus m b m is the dimension of m and second which minus m minus m b g is negative semi-definite. The secular curvature is lower equal to m square b. The holomorphic second curve, bisechner holomorphic section curvature is lower equal to b this proposition and explains the equality hearts in the in the in proposition In propositions 4.1, if the all for all case, if the identity hurts, then F is geodesic. The next the proposing 4.3 give a massive estimate of the Estimate of the sum of scalar curvature and the low-morph scalar curvature by the holomorphic bisignal curvature of the target manifold. It's uh it's a well known that the same uh science integral equality is very important in the theory of minimal sub manifold in unit sphere. When Jim Sams gives a proof of Bernstein problem in 1969, this theorem is corresponding to that case. That case, in real case, let M be a semi-color manifold and the M tilde is an almost Hermitian manifold. Pause colomorphic bi-signature bounded by Ax and Bx, where A and B are continuous functions. Uh continuous functions on m two time. If m is a pseudo-holomorphic asymmetric emission, then this integral inequality is hard. The most interesting case is b is large and b minus a is small enough, small enough, where p and the p m n are M n are some constant depend on the dimension of these two manifolds, only different depend on the dimension. The proof is similar to the Jim Sam's proof by using the estimate. Estimate by using the Bopla formula below to and to estimate every terms in these identities by using the curvature condition and integration by path. The last theorem will determine the The square, the lump of the second mental second fundamental form. Let M be a pseudo-holomorphic isometric emerging from almost the commission manifold into another with parallel second fundamental form. As before, suppose the holomorphic bisonal curvature of the target manifold bounce. Of the target manifold bounds by x and bx, then the length of the second fundamental form is equal to zero or in or between these two constants. This tenth constant can be expressed explicitly. Yes, where A zero is the informal of Ax and the B zero is supermum of B X on M tilde. The last section, I introduce a problem which I like and proposed by. and uh proposed by year uh and uh proposed by years and then the mere uh the which is uh is every harmonic map from the complex project map with a large uh dimension to a low dimension project uh complex project the space is a constant map for constant map for uh for the dimension m is great strictly uh strictly greater than n that's our thanks to for your attention
