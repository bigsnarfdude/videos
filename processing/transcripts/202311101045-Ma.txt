So, today I was going to talk about weak as a packets or actually weak unipotent other packets of a real classical group. So I would like to start from the very basic which is Jordan Chevrolet decomposition to say why this unipotent packet. This unipotent packets are important. So, as we all know, that if you have a matrix, you will have this Jordan decomposition, which write an arbitrary element as the multiplication of a semi-simple element and a unit total element, such that this S and the U are commute with each chart. So, this is a Jordan Shaveling. So, this is Jordan Chauvelin, and basically, it tells you that the conjugated class of the group can be decomposed as direct unions, disjoint unions over the semi-simple conjugacy class of a collection of unipotent elements inside the centralizer of S, unipotent. Unipotent conjugacy classes. Okay, so therefore, the unipotent part will be a model of so that kind of you can reduce understanding of the conjugacy class of the whole group to understanding to the unique protein case. So this is the gene, and this gene. Okay, this is. Okay, this is a real case. Okay, so we can understand the conjugate class in this way, but we also can do this for group representation. The first successful case of this story is a finite group of lead types, okay, which is done by the linestic and the loose stick. Loose stick and a loose stick. So basically, what they said is you have a short Chevrolet Shortown decomposition of representations. Basically, you will replace the group by its due group, and then the set of irreducible representations of G, which is a finite group of Li-type, will be can be decomposed as a disjoint union of. A distraught union of something called a LUSIC series, which the distorted union is running over the semi-simple conjugated classes. Okay, rational semi-simple conjugated classes of the view group. Okay, so then, of course, only this decomposition is not it's a consequence of the Derlin-Lussiq theory. Uh the Lin Lucig series character, okay, some properties from the properties of the Lin Lucig character, but uh more strikingly is that you will have a bijection between this between this so-called Lusik series with semi-simple element S or semi-simple conjugacy class S to the so this is called actually the Is called actually the Lusik series for the centralizer of this S in the dual group with the semi-simple part, which is the trivial identity, okay, identity element. So this is understand as the unipotent representations of Z-check S. And this map LS is not only a bijection, actually, it also satisfies certain character identity. By certain character identity, characterized by character identity, more or less, if the group G has connected center. Okay. If it does not have connected center, then you have to be careful, but essentially you have this kind of m okay. So this is the way we understand. I think this is very educational that tells us how to understand the set of irreducible. And the set of irreducible representations. Okay, so I'm going to talk about the similar case for the real Lie groups, so which includes like GLNR, UPQ, and the OPQ and SP2NR, or even include a metapathic group. So as we know that So, as we know that, of course, we will be interested in understanding the set of irreducible, admissible representations of G, but not all the representation inside this set is unitary, actually. So, but I think it's clear that unitary representations are a subclass of irreducible representations, which has its fundamental. Presentations, which has its fundamental interest and it's very important. But, okay, so inside this unitary due, you actually have something called a discrete series, which are discrete in the field topology of this irreducible G. And you also have something called the temporary representation, which occurred in the decomposition of L2 of G. Of L2 of G. Okay, so then I think the classification of discrete series and temporary representation are fundamental and relatively okay, they are still also very hard, but relatively easy to unit read. And so which the results are known. Okay, so I think one of the most important questions. One of the most important questions still open is to understand the unitary dual of real reductive V2. Okay, so this is a picture of unitary dual for SL2R. So we will see that there's discrete spectrums and there will be okay, so this is actually in the plane of real infinitesimal character. Character. Okay, plane. Okay, so you will have something. Okay, so actually, it's not the whole possible infinitesimal character is a complex plane quotient of some relation. Okay, but so this is the horizontal line is the axis of real infinitesimal character, and the vertical line will be the The imaginary part. So you will have two lines which are principal series, non-strict principal series, and spherical principal series. And as a real infinitesimal character part, you will have discrete series. And the most important part is this V1 and V1 check minus one, V bar minus one. These are limits. Bar minus one, this limit of this grid series, and then you have a trivial representation. And between this one, you will have complementary series. Okay, so this is a picture. Right, so this is one of the case we fully understand the unitary due. And among this, you see that so. So the red part, circled part, these three, actually, four representations. Okay, these four representations are the trivial representation, the limit of discrete series, and another ends of the complementary series are the set of unipotent representations, special unipotent representations. So it's clearly from this picture. It's clearly from this picture that you see these unipotent representations serve as a bound of the complementary series. So the original idea by Vogue is that to understand the unitary due, you should know something, some representations which are very special, which are unipotent representations, so that you can find the unitary due. Okay, so, but is there some other? So, but there are some other ideas from Longlands and ASA, which looks like this. I think Mason Brown already, Lucas already talked about this in his talk, that you take the way group of the real number, which is basically the union of complex number with generated by the number. By the non-zero complex numbers, and with an element j such that it's on the complex numbers by complex conjugation, and its square is negative one. Okay, so okay, so the long length dual group will be the so the group given the same. So the group given the semi-product of the weight group given by the algebraic group given by the during during the root system and with additional J action. So for example, if you have a split group sp2 and R, then the L U group will be just a direct product of its U group and the J. Du group and J. Okay, so long lens tells us that you should have a finite to one map from the set of irreducible representation to the long lens parameter. Okay, but also tells us that you should have, okay, so somehow you should also consider the finite to finite finite to finite map from a certain subset of Subset of representations called the representations of other type to other parameter, which is the equivalent conjugacy class of the V group cross SL2C to the L group. Okay, so right, so then if in this case, you somehow can do this drawdown decomposition. So that the most important, I guess, the most complicated and serve as the model of other class of representations will be the unipotent representation, which is defined a unipotent parameter, which is defined in the following way: that you have W R and it is so the way group of real number, it is C cross. It is C cross generated by C cross and J. So you require that the parameter when restricted on C cross is trivial. Okay, so this type of parameters are called a unipotent parameter. So notice that actually we have a somehow we have a J action here. Okay, so therefore So, a unipotent parameter is somehow can be understood as the unipotent object of certain real form of this G-check. Okay, so the Arthur conjecture that so there actually exists, of course, is this the Arthur page. Of course, it exists the other packets, but he also in the very early time he conjectured that there should be some kind of unipotent other packets, which is in the 80s. Okay. This is from the study of trace formula. Okay, so then for the real group case, Moglin and Rena said. Mogling and Rena say that if you want to understand the arbitrary aspect, if you don't like the picture, I can change. So actually, you can to understand other package, you can reduce the question to the you know the answer. Okay, so this is of course much more since. More things contained in this big paper, but one of the crucial results I think is that kind of you can reduce the question to the unipotent. Okay, so to me, unipotent representation defined by trace formula is not very easy to understand because I don't understand trace formula. So, luckily, So, luckily, Babash and Vogan give another definition of unipotent representation. Okay, which says that, so for their idea is that the set of unipotent representations should be certain representations with the smallest possible size. So, what's the meaning of smallest possible size? Uh out of uh battery, I guess. Okay. Okay, okay, let's see. Uh, so basically, what you have is how to first of all, how to measure the size of the representation. So you have Representation. So you have something called a wavefront cycle or a social cycle. Wayfront cycle is coming from the character expansion near the identity of a representation. And associate cycle can be defined in a purely algebraic way. Okay. But there's a big theorem by Schmidt-Vironte, which tells you that wavefront cycle and the social cycle are actually. Cycle and associate cycle are actually the same. Okay, so analysis and algebra are actually the same for at least for the real reductive group. Anyway, we will prefer to use a social cycle, which is a map from the irreducible set of irreducible representations to some kind of equivariant shifts on the new cone of T. Okay, so this is the new cone of SL2R, which has basically three pieces. One is the middle, this origin, and the upper cone and the lower. So then I think I have showed this SL2 are the unitary due of SL2 are the so that's irreducible representation will have a social cycle which supports Have a social cycle which supports on the origin and other representations for the other representation. This limit of this gray series will support on the upper kung and another one, another anti-holomorphic discrete limit of discrete series we are supporting on the lower cone. And then there is one more unipotent representation whose social cycle. A social cycle will be the whole new. So, this is the picture. So, okay, so then we can come to the Baba-Schwogen's definition of special unipotent representation or which defines in this way. Suppose G is a real reductive group, then you take a new potent orbit in the du of G. Du of G and this new potent orbit from the so the theory of new SL2 triple, it will give you an H hat in the algebra of G check, which will in the end give you an infinitesimal character of the representation of G. Okay, same for this infinitesimal character. Thanks to Flow's early work, that for actually for any infinitesimal character, there will be a maximal primitive ideal in the universal emuloping algebra with such kind of infinitesimal character. So there will be an inclusion relation on the primitive ideals. And when you fix an infinitesimal character, there's only finite many possible primitive ideals. Possible primitive ideals with this implication character. And among the inclusion relation, there's a maximum one, which, yeah, this let me denote it as IO check. Okay, so the definition will be we call an irreducible representation is spatial unipotent if the annihilator Ideal of this representation is exactly this maximum protein idea. Okay, so you can somehow change, so this another idea maybe is still a little bit abstract. So you can change the definition to a more concrete one, which says that you basically require that pi has infinitesimal character. Chi has infinitesimal character, which is chi o chat, and it has okay. Okay, so it has associ variety, complex associated variety of this representation is the closure of O bar and of O and O is the blue six buttons then Baba Schwogen due of this orbit. This orbit, okay, and so the collection of okay. For suppose you have a dual orbit, we will say that unipotent O check G, which is a collection of all special unipotent orbit attached to unipotent representation attached to this O check. Okay, why we call it special unipotent, this is because O this orbit O is a special new potential orbit. Defined by loose thing, I think, in the smartness. Okay, so open question, of course, is a major open question for people in the real group is to understand classify the unit tree due. The philosophy is that, as I just mentioned, the building block of the unitary due should be the set of unipotential sensors. I would like to say. I would like to say, okay, sorry, it's just spatial unipotent representation are not enough in general, actually. So there's an example that recent example by Daniel Wang and Zhang Hongfeng, they classify the unitary due of spring complex spring group. So you need a little bit more, which are kind of quadrupedi unipotent. So I think Mason. Quote. So I think Mason Brown, I expect he was going to talk this, but no, but he has defined with maybe Lose and other people on the general notion of unit hotification. Hopefully our method will also use for to prove the unitarity of such kind of this kind of generalization of unicorn representation. Generalization of unique quote representation. Okay, anyway, the big conjecture in the 80s was to show that, as Lucas has mentioned, is to show that the unitarity of the unipotent representations. Okay, so to address this question, you can ask three more questions. First one is that what is the size? Is that what's the size of the unipotent representations? How many representations, unipotent representations inside this object? And another one is how do you construct the representation. The third one is more delicate, which is about the character formula. Okay, all the question one, two, three was all addressed in Barbara Bash and Vogan's paper in 18. Paper in 1985 on the classification of complex groups for the complex group case. So the size of unipotent representations in G will be same as size of Lucy C non-equal quotient of O-Check, actually, in this case. So, for the integrity of this one, for GLN. One for GLN, integrity is actually clear, and for the complex classical group, it was done by Babash later, actually. So, I think Lucas has claimed that it's also known nowadays for other complex groups. So, what we have shown is that, okay, so it's not a single paper, but it's a combination of our It's a combination of our recent series of works where show that Fg is a simply connected real classical group, which means it's one of the following groups, SUPQ, spin UPQ, which is the double cover of SOPQ, and the spin over the quaternions, and the real symplectic group, metic group. And this And this is the quaternic orthogonal group, basically. SGPQ as a Baba-Schwogan's conjecture on the unitarity of spatial unipotent representation codes, which says that all special unipotent representations are unit triad. Okay, so for other cases, maybe you need this atlas as a method. Okay, so I would like to. Okay, so I would like to first address this question. How do you count the representation? Okay, so basically we have this following setting. I would like to introduce you a formula to counter represent a G module with specific annihilator variety. Suppose you fix the infinitesimal character mu. You fix the infinitesimal character μ, which is understand as an element in H star, okay, up to W conjugacy. You can define something called the integral wow group, which is the group such that mu minus W mu is pairing with the core root will be contained in say. Okay, so then this will be a subgroup of the abstract. Of the abstract wild group of the whole group, and you can have a theory of cells developed by Lustig. And I think also there's a lot of work by Babash and Vogan on this. So you can define some notion called double cell, and in each double cell, it will have a special representation of this integral. Of this integral y group called tau zero, each double cell will correspond to a unique spatial representation. And the first spatial representation, you can do something called a truncate induction. I should put small j actually. So then this trunque induction always has a Springer type, which means that it will correspond to a trivial local system on certain new proton orbits under the spring correspondence. Okay, so we have this ob O. Now, so we need one more ingredient, which is you have this mu, so we can consider the fixed point stabilizer of mu in the big wild group. So this W subscript mu is a subset, a subgroup of W bracket mu. And we have one more ingredient. Need one more ingredient, which is it's actually a module of the integral wire group, which is called a coherent continuation representation. So this representation has a basis, which are irreducible representations of okay, so of infinitesimal character. I think. Uh, I think mu class something else which such that you require that uh this infinitesimal character to be integral. But anyway, so you you can this this this is a this is a representation of W mu and the structure of this one is computable by using the standard by understanding the action of the Of the integral wire group on the standard modules. Okay, and then you can have the following counting formula. So suppose, I'm sorry, I think I should delete this GK. So for any representation with infinitesimal character mu, if we require its social variety is equal to O bar, then it is equal to the summation over summation over the multiplicity of trivial representation of W occurs in tau times the multiplicity of tau occurs in the coherent continuation representation. We're tau running over all irreducible representations of W mu such that under this reduction, which means that you take a double cell and it will give you A double cell and it will give you an orbit. So, suppose this double cell gives you the orbit O, and suppose that tau is the element inside the double cell, then you're summing over all the possible choices, you will get the number of representations. Okay, I would like to say that in the non-integral, so if mu is not an integral infinitesimal character, you may have several different double cells. Mapped to the same orbit. So, this truncated induction is in general not an injective procedure. Okay. But with a condition that, so somehow I should current stage, I would like to exclude G to having a E8 factor. This is because. So, actually, this kind of counting method was already appeared in Barbara Schwogen's 1985 paper. The idea is already there, but there are some tricky part is about the structure of hygiene cell and the double cell, which further can be reduced to some structure of the double cell. Structure of the double cell. So I'm able to verify all the things we need up to E8. And because E8 is too large for my computer to do the check, but I believe this is not essential. You can just delete. Okay. Okay, so next one is that so how do you use this kind of This kind of theorem is that you can prove something like this. So to us, actually, general linear group is more natural to the special linear group. So it's natural to ask whether the representation of general linear, the unipotal representations of special linear groups is a restriction of representations of general linear groups. And you just buy. And then you just by sub in the coherent continuation representation of these two groups, you can see that the number match. So it says a restriction will give you the unipotent representations of this SL and H. Okay, so similar result you can start to discuss. Can start to discuss the unipotent representation of GL and SL, and the unipotent representations of UPQ and SUPQ. Okay, so somehow you can show that all the unipotent representation of SUPQ will be obtained by the restriction of determinant double cover of UPQ. Then using CTA correspondence and the Correspondence and the parabolic induction, actually, you can construct all the represent unipotent representations of the double cover of determinant double cover of UTQ. So, and you also can show that the genuine, if you want to consider the spin group, the genuine special unipotent representations are not very much, they are just some obvious parabolic. Are just some obvious parabolically induced modules, irreducible-induced modules. Okay, so these are some kind of maybe not very difficult applications of this formula. Okay, now I'm going to talk about some to me is some more difficult applications, much more difficult applications of the formula. So one of the case is that we would like to. The case is that we would like to reduce the problem to something which has integral infinitesimal character, actually much more than integral. So we will talk about some reduced to the good parity case. So suppose you have a new potential orbit for the classical group. So G-Check is also a classical group. Then if G-Check is type B or type D, then you know the newpotent orbit. Then you know the new proton orbit. In the Young diagram classification of Newport orbit, the even rows must be occurred with even multiplicity. And for type B C and B D, for type C, odd rows must occur with even multiplicity. So these are the so-called bad parity. And the good parities are those parities, you do not have any restrictions of number of rows. Any restrictions of number of rows. Okay. So if O check has good parity, then the infinitesimal character chi O check is will be integral, actually. So this is an example of good parity in a proton or whose dual, Babashwogan due is this or okay. Okay. So reduction is look like this because for the bed parity, the multiplicity of rows will always be even. So let's just list the rows with fair parities, which is R1, R1, R2, R2, to RK, RK. Then the homeopotene orbit O check can be seen as a union of two times of Of two times of a new proton orbit of GL, we throw R1, R2, R3 to RK. And using the counting formula, you actually can show that at first, the number of unit proton representations of G L of this orbit with so you also collect the row of all good parities from a Good parity is from a new potent orbit of a smaller sympletic group, say, the number of unipotent representations of the original orbit will be the product of number of unipotent representations of GL with a smaller sp. Okay, so this is very similar to the reduction Lucas has discussed before. Discussed before. And moreover, you can show that actually using the same idea of David has speak. So you can show that this kind of parabolic induction is actually irreducible. Okay, so therefore, okay, so of course you would like to know what are the unipotent representations of GL. Of GL, maybe M prime R. These are just the parabolically induced representation of the sign character of a smaller geo blocks of a certain parabolic. Okay, so by this reduction result, it tells us that we can reduce the question, we will actually. Reduce the question. We like to study to reduce the problem to the O-Check G case, the good parity case. So now we want to use theta correspondence to study this problem. So let's give some hints on how to achieve this. So let's consider the case that OCHEC has good parity. In this case, for SP, the O For SP, the chi O check will be inside the row shift of the row shift by weight lattice. So the integral wow group will just be the semi-direct product of the symmetric group with n letters and plus minus one. So this is the wow group of type B C and the coherent continuation representation has this form. Continuation representation has this form. So it looks quite complicated, but actually, each number has a meaning. So this term is basically corresponded to the maximum torus inside sp2 and rational maximum torus has a form that it has B copies of C cross, it should be C cross, and R copies of U1 and C plus D. One and the C plus D copies of real R cross actually. So why you want to break this C and D, this is because on R cross you can put either trivial character or sign character. So therefore, you would like to break it. So this is a coherent continuation representation. And And so, for the O check, you will have a special representation, which is given by the Springer correspondence of the Babaschwogen dual of O check. And there will be a specific letter cell satisfy the condition, let's say cell in the double cell of containing tau, such that the size of the cell is two to a power. the size of the cell is two to the power of L okay where L is the size of the is L is the basically the size of component group two to the power L is the size of component group okay of the old check actually we say canonical quotient of the of O check okay so anyway Okay, so anyway, so this only for the representations in this particular left cell, it's pairing with the stabilizer of WO check will be equal to one. For other representations in the cell, it's equal to zero, actually. Moreover, you can show, this is a difficult part, that you can show that the multiplicity of all these different representations occurs. Representations occur in the coherent continuations are equal to the multiplicity of the spatial representation occurs. Okay, to prove this, you need the conveyorics of painted by partition. Okay, and it's totally not clear, unclear that how you why this kind of formula holds. So the only So, the only proof I know is, so which is we use is we use some hint from the zeta correspondence actually. Okay. And then, as a consequence of the formula, so is that because all the different representations, the multiplicity is the same as a spatial representation occurs in the coherent. Occurs in the coherent continuation representation. And because this multiplicity is equal to exactly one for this two to the power L number of representations, so we know that the number of unipotent representations of this particular orbit, O check will be two to the power of something times this one. And then this multiplicity can be counted by painted by partition. By painted by partitions. And the counting is, so basically, you will put, so the bipartitions are the class will give you the classification of irreducible representations of this group. This is classical. And we paint it to denote that the multiplicity. So it basically is because you have something called a period rule, which have something called a period rule which which helps you to count the multi help you to count the multiplicity of of of tau inside each piece so if we have a c we can't just we just put c number of six so here's an example so if you have a old check like this Okay, we have all check like this. Then you will have a painted by partition like this. This dots, or maybe I should call it a bullets, correspond to this V inside the coherent continuation representation. C and D correspond to W C component and W D component. R plus R and S correspond to this A. So, okay. So, okay, so this are the this is the source of the reason we use printed bipartition to for our combatorics parametrization. So the reason is that we use a peri rule to count. Okay, so it was, I think, used by Babash for a long time, but so we learned it from him. And then And then so you okay, so the idea is, so from this one, we somehow can also associate some associate characters, okay, which in our settings, this kind of painted by partition with additional data will map to a representation whose social variety has actually. Whose associate variety has actually two pieces, like this, and the star indicates the non-trivial local system on the component. So I will explain it more. So one of the idea in CETA correspondence to construct small representation is that you can somehow use iterated lifting to construct. So, construct small representation. The reason is that you actually have some kind of inductive structure of new potential orbits. So, alcohol battery. So, as a dual side, you have an operation by deleting the rows. So, if you have a new photon orbit of SO15, Orbit of SO15, then you delete the first row, it will give you a new potential orbit of O, and then you delete another, it will give you a new potent of again an orthogonal group. You can do it and eventually reduce to the this is the regular new potent orbit of O. Okay, so on the other hand, you can do the Baba Schwogen due. So the operation is almost the The operation is almost due to deleting the row, is that you delete the column. So, for example, the OI, which is a Barbashvogan due of O check I, you just delete the first column, okay, from SP14 to SO10, and then you can delete the second column from SP6, from O to SP. Uh, from O to S P, and then so here, somehow, if you delete it, you only left three boxes, then you are you have to put one more box back. This will give you all. Okay, so right, this is related to the resolution of singularities of new proton orbit closure. And actually, for the rational orbit, you can do the same thing, then this will give you some kind of. This will give you some kind of so you know that the new potential orbit of this classical groups, rational new potential orbit of these classical groups, are given by signed partitions. So you can do the same thing by keep tracking, so keeping the sign basically. So this is related to order resolution of singularity of new quote-orbit closure in symphonic symmetric pairs. Okay, so the construction. Okay, so the construction will be. So, because you see from the new proton orbit point of view, if you have such kind of descending sequence of groups, somehow you can try to lift the representation from trivial representation of O22 to sp26 and then to O46 and to SP410. Okay, so but Okay, so but each step, if you arrive, you have an orthogonal group, you are allowed to twist the sign character determined the trivial, either trivial determined or for the OPQ, you have two more exotic character, which is trivial on OP and non-trivial on OQ. Maybe another is trivial on OQ, non-trivial on OP. Anyway, you are allowed to twist the characters. The characters of orthogonal group so that you can construct a representation which is just the you twist the you do the iterative zeta lift and each step you twist the character. Okay, so you will get a representation called kin x. So this representation may not be non-zero. So what we can show is that it's either non-zero Is that it's either non-zero either zero or irreducible, and it's irre if it's irreducible, then it's also unitrizable. Furthermore, it is also contained in the unipotent represent unipotent, it is a unipotent representation of O ch. Okay, so moreover, we are be able to prove is that the whole unipotent packet is given by the non-zero representations. Zero presentations to construct it in this way. Okay. So one of the difficult and amazing part of this project is that actually CETA lift is not so different route of from CTA lift may give you same representations. For this is a typical example which you lift a representation of OPQ. Representation of OPQ to sp6. Well, okay, where you are able to lift a trivial representation. Okay, so the trivial representations of so somehow this O40. So somehow this O40 is also a trivial representation here, but I prefer to write it with as sine plus minus. But anyway, so you see that the lift of representation of O40 will be equal to the lift of representation of O31 SP6. Okay, so this diagram, this is the most simple case, but actually this is almost Actually, this is almost dominates all possible collisions of cetae lifts. So somehow the key point of the proof, the combinatorics part of the proof is that you have to match the unipotent representations with the painted bypass. Presentations with the painted by partition. The painted by partition itself is complicated. And so the possible associate varieties or associate cycles of the constructed representations are also complicated. So, proof of the exhaustion mainly is by counting, but the key idea is to But the key idea is to define some kind of descent algorithm from the painted by partition. So you should extend with, you have additional two to the power L somehow. So we call it extended painted by partition, which records the two to the power L information to so suppose this is a sympathetic group to a smaller orthogonal group for a smaller Organic group for a smaller orbit. So, this will be the descent of painted by partition. And we somehow wish this kind of cometorics were compatible with something called a geometric zeta lift of the associate cycle. Okay, and here, so this geometric zeta lift of the associate cycle. Lift of a social cycle, a social character is additional information to help you to pin down this descent match. Okay, then somehow you can, as far as you get this part, you can try to match this painted by partition with the unipotent representations of G where G. Where G running over all real forms of the complex group, fixed complex group. And from, okay, in particular, so this parametrization is defined in the way that inductively, suppose you have a tau which is the extended parameter, then the pi tau is given by the theta limit. Tau is given by the zeta lift of the descent of tau twist by certain character of determined by this parameter if it's a orthogonal group and twist the further character. Okay, so all the information, so the twisting also can the information on how do you twist this representation is also contained in the comment or experiment. Okay, so I would like to. Okay, so I would like to say something about the how do you match this. I would like to say a little bit more about the geometric side. So basically, we need some kind of double vibration of the moment maps. So let's again consider the sympletic orthogonal. Uh, the sympletic orthogonal group case. Suppose you have so basically, we want to match the neopotent, certain we will have some kind of double vibration in the setting that this P prime is a non-compact part of the Lie algebra of G prime and the P is a non-compact part of Lie algebra of. Lie algebra of sp under the carton decomposition and it it has a very concrete matrix form if you have something which is p by m matrix plus q by m matrix i denote it by a and b so the the moment map relevant will be a times b transpose and another side is a transpose times a and b transpose times b which map to symmetric matrices of correct size So basically, this is a general theorem which established by Hong Yin Lok and me that for any CTA correspondence, if you have a representation actually inside O prime, you can bound somehow. Somehow using this kind of moment maps. Okay. Anyway, so we somehow can define a so-called geometric zeta lift for local systems on P prime instead O prime, which is K prime C equivari local system to the local system. To the local system, Kc local system on P in ZO, such that the associate cycle of the theta lift is bounded by this geometric lift. So let's have a little bit more close look at this map, which basically you have a vibration, you have two, you will have two points, x and x prime, and then you have. X and X prime, and you have a W mapped to X and X prime. And basically, you have an operation that pulls back the fiber and takes certain invariant and then push down. And somehow in the formula, there's a determinant half twist of the local system, and it is somehow crucial for the reason. The reason is that it will map some. The reason is that it will map something called admissible orbit data to admissible orbit data. This is related to the quantization of this new quote orbit O and maybe quantization, geometric quantization, which is another question proposed by Vogon, which is asking whether you can always quantize a new potential orbit, which means that you can define a unitary representation. A unitary representation such that it's under the association cycle map, it will give you the new potential orbit, desired new proton orbit data. And one of the conditions can be quantized is that this data should be admissible. Okay, so from this formula, it will be clear that the support of this kind of geometric lifting. Geometric lifting can be reducible because sometimes you will have two objects on the pullback, push forward, it will give you the same object. Okay, so purely from the geometry, you only get the inequality somehow, a bound. But if you want to get the sharp bound equality, which is crucial for us, is that you For us, is that you need to use double theta lift. Okay, somehow we need the fact that in our setting, the double theta lift is more or less similar to is kind of parabolic induction. And so in other words, you can think theta lift as a square root of parabolic induction. This, I think, is a very interesting view of parabolic, theta lift. And in this And in this, to prove this, we need the structure of the germ principle theories was developed by Chen Boju and Su Teg Bi and other people like 30 years ago. Okay, so we also need the estimation of matrix coefficient integrals, which will give you the unitarity of unipotent representation. Unipotent representation. Okay, to get the sharp bound, basically you use double fibration, it will give you upper bound. But if you use a double theta lift, it will give you the lower bound because somehow we can compute the associate cycle of pair bone induction. So the association cycle is behaved well under the pair bone induction. This was an old result by Babash. Okay, for the Okay, for the for the absorption, which shows that our construction gives you all unipotent representations, it's again a lower bound equal to upper bound type of proof. So, first of all, the character series, the counting formula, I give it to you is give you the upper bound. Okay, so the reason it only gives you the upper bound is that it's coming from the problem of orthogonal groups. Coming from the problem of orthogonal group versus spatial orthogonal group. So the whole theory only works for groups of Harishana class. So if you have additional group is not connected, then it will be problem. So you always need some kind of cliffholder theory. Okay, so luckily we can show. So, luckily, we can show that we exactly get two kinds of the unipotent representation of spatial orthodox group. Okay, as a consequence is that all the spatial unipotent representation of orthodox group is not stable under the determinant twist. Okay, so and the lower bound is you count the you somehow the social variety or the social character. Social variety or the social character, these bundles it's not enough to help you to distinguish all the unipotent representation, but plus the injectivity of zeta correspondence, it will tell you that you have all exactly number of the lower bound of number of so the number of unipotent representations you want. Okay, that gives you the exhaustion. Okay, I think that's all for my this talk. Thank you. That's all for my this talk. Thank you.
