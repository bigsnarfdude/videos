Who will talk about representation theory and Poisson geometry of root of unity quantum cluster algebra? Thank you, Alfredo. So, I want to start by saying that the work of Bernard has been a tremendous inspiration for me. And I just want to mention a few things before I go to the talk. So, when we were undergraduates back in Bulgaria in the 90s, we had a library with some Western journals. With some Western journals. And we very often went to the library to read those journals. And of course, we were undergraduates, so we didn't understand anything. But at the time, one of the journals that the Bulgarian library had was Advances. And Bernard had a very long and very influential paper in the 90s on non-commutative symmetric functions there. So we were very inspired by that paper. Then I did my graduate work on quantum. Graduate work on quantum groups. And I grew up with the papers of Bernard on the canonical basis and the crystal basis. And then after that, he inspired us all with his work with Christophe and Jan on cluster algebras, lead theory, and categorification. So we all were inspired by this for many, many years. So I'm very excited to be here today. And this is the last talk for the conference. I will try to keep every. For the conference, I'll try to keep everything very without any technical details and very elementary. So I want to report on two different papers. One is with Shenan Huang, who is a PhD student at Northeastern, and Tang Lei. This is a paper from a year ago. And the other paper is a paper that we just posted at the beginning of this week. That is with Greg Muller, who is right there with Right there with Bart Nguyen and Kurt Trampel. And I want to start with basically quickly saying exactly what will be the goal of the questions that I want to address. And here's the thing. So if we start with an any exchange matrix B Tilda with some additional conditions, we can associate first the upper cluster algebra structure with the Gemma and Shapiro. With the Getman-Shapiro-Beinstein Poisson structure. It gives rise to this affine Poisson variety, which is usually singular with that singular Poisson structure. And we can also associate another object, which looks like the quantum cluster algebra, but it's a quantum cluster algebra at the root of unity. And I'm going to define that in a very explicit way. So there are two questions that come up very naturally. First, Very naturally. First, classify the symplectic formulation of this singular Poisson manifold over there. And second, classify the irreducible representations of these algebras. And these are questions that people care a lot in different areas of mathematics. If you look at very concrete cases of this root of unity upper cluster algebras, you're going to get quantized coordinate rings at roots of unity. You can get quantum sugar cells at roots of unity. Cells at roots of unity. You can get scan algebras at roots of unity. And topologists have been very recently very interested in scan algebras at roots of unity because their representations give you a way to construct representations of the mapping, finite dimensional representations of the mapping class group of the surface. So understanding in general, this question has been something that people were quite interested over the years. For instance, the irreducible representations of quantum. Irreducible representations of quantum groups at roots of unity is something that was driving quantum groups in the 90s quite a bit in the works of Dekoncini Kazaproce on the big quantum groups at roots of unity. So all these things are basically generalizations of big quantum groups at roots of unity. Right, so now let me go to the Poisson side first. So I want to say quickly what is the symplectic fulation. I know everybody is familiar, but I I know everybody is familiar, but I just want to give some simple examples and say a few words about the symplectic volation. So, let me take any non-singular Poisson manifold. It is known that it decomposes into disjoint union of connected symplectic submanifolds, those are called the symplectic leaves. So, altogether, this is called the symplectic foliation. There are many different ways to define this. One of them is to say that the symplectic leaves Say that the symplectic leaves are simply the phase spaces of all possible Hamiltonian systems on your manifold. So that's from a dynamical point of view. So let's look at one example. So you take an affine space of dimension two with this Poisson structure over here. The Poisson structure vanishes along the hyperbola. So there are two kinds of symplectic leaves. So first of all, every symplectic leaf is a symplectic manifold. So it has to be even-dimensional. So there is one that's the complement. So, there is one that's the complement to the hyperbola. Hyperbola itself is one-dimensional, so it cannot be, it's one-dimensional, so it cannot be a symplectic leaf. So, all the points on the hyperbola, infinitely many points, are symplectic leaves. So, from this perspective, we have infinitely many symplectic leaves. But wait a minute, we have a c-star action on this manifold, which rescales x in that way and y in that way. Why in that way? And if you think from the perspective of toric varieties, and if you just take this as the general thing that symplectic leaves for a Poisson manifold are exactly the same thing as what points are for a regular manifold, for a usual manifold. Then, from the point of view of Tauric varieties, you wouldn't really care about the simple, the usual simplicity. The simple, the usual symplectic leaves here, but you would care about the C-star orbits of symplectic leaves. And there are finitely many C-star orbits of symplectic leaves here. So first you have this one that's a single symplectic leaf, and then everything else is a single C-star orbit of symplectic leaves. This is on the non-singular part. If you're on the singular part, in the case when you're in a singular affine variety, you could even work with a non-reduced. You could even work with a non-radio scheme and do the Poisson geometry there. So, there is an important theorem of Paulis Chuk, which is just formulated as a lemma or something in his paper, that says that if you take a singular alpha and Poisson variety, then the singular part is always a Poisson sub-variety. So this gives us a geometric way to define symplectic leaves by saying that the symplectic leads of this generally singular variety would be those of the smooth part union dose of the. Smooth part union does of the singular part, and then you can proceed this in a recursive fashion. So, this is how you do the symplectic Fourier in general for a singular one. And the next thing that I wanted to go over is quickly define the cluster star that we'll be using. So, most importantly, we never want to invert coefficients. So, when you want to apply cluster algebras to Lee theory or other areas, the moment you invert coefficients, The moment you invert coefficients, you basically lose the most interesting thing. So, for instance, take a cluster algebra on a Schubert cell. The moment you invert the coefficients, you throw out the most interesting part of the Schubert cell, and you simply work with just the generic part. So we don't want to invert coefficients. So B tilde is going to be our mutation, our exchange matrix. The cluster algebra is going to be the subring of this that's generated by all cluster variables in all seeds. Cluster variables in all seeds. The upper cluster algebra, we're not going to intersect Laurent polynomial rings, we're going to intersect the mixtures of Laurent polynomial rings and polynomial rings in order to achieve this to be sufficiently close to that. Right. So now quickly to go over the definition of the Gechmar-Shapiro-Weinstein Poisson structure. So if we have an exchange matrix B tilde, a skill Exchange matrix B tilde, a skew symmetric integer matrix lambda. They're called compatible if we have this condition where D is supposed to be a non-zero diagonal matrix, positive integers. If we're in that situation, the GSV Poisson structure on the upper cluster algebra is simply given by writing down this commutation brackets, extending to the filter fractions of this, and restricting to the upper cluster algebra. So this came up in other talks. Algebra. So, this came up in other talks. So, we've seen this a lot. Now, we have the Poisson structure on the complex affine Poisson variety, which is the maximum spectrum of the upper cluster algebra. And just a quick remark that lots of interesting Poisson varieties in Li-theory are very special cases of this. So, if we somehow, if we understand this in general, how it behaves, we will understand all these. Behaves, we will understand all these things uniformly. So, this includes Schubert cells with what are called standard Drinfeld structures, open-Richardson varieties, which are Poisson sub-manifolds of these Schubert cells, double Bruh cells, as well as coordinate links of simple groups with the so-called standard structure that came up in Mischer's talk. Double both Samuelson's varieties, they came yesterday. Varieties they came yesterday, they came up yesterday in the talk of Jose. They're also like there have been a lot of papers in Poisson geometry, how you uh, yeah, how you treat this from the point of view of Poisson geometry, but also like related to like what he was describing in his talk, these are also examples of spectra of cluster algebras. And finally, you can take the simple Lie groups: there is the Bilavin-Drinfold classification, and the Bilavin-Drinfeld Poisson. And the beloved Drenfeld-Poisson structures, in many cases, were proven by Misha and Alec that they have cluster structures. So, this somehow this class captures a lot. For instance, yeah, here I'm assuming the theorem. So, yes, yes, that's a good point. And in this case, you also want the frozen variables to be invertible? The the paper is written with any mixture of inverted and not inverted frozen variables. So here I just wanted to somehow mention like in general, but I agree, I totally agree that in each particular situation, you invert something and don't invert something. And this is how the paper is written. So here I didn't want to have like a bunch of sets of indices, but I totally agree. So yeah, that's precisely. Yeah, that's precisely true. It's true over here, for instance. If you work with SLN, you would invert one frozen variable, keeps everything else precise. So the next thing I want to quickly define root of unity cluster algebras, totally no rocket science here, like what you would do like for usual quantum cluster algebras, you just repeat here. So you start with a primitive L-throot of unity. It's this guy. Then you take a skew symmetric matrix. You take a skew symmetric matrix, but now the entries are going to be z slash l rather than z. Then you look at this quantum torus, algebra generated by this module or this relation. You want that to be in here because you're going to raise epsilon to that power. Then you do mutation. I didn't write this in terms of toric frames, just so that it will be more explicit. You do mutation in the same way. You do mutation in the same way like Berenstein and Zelwinski are going to do mutation. Here, you need to throw some powers of epsilon in order to pick up the correct ordering there. And exactly the same powers that you would pick for a usual quantum toric frame, you pick them over there. Now, a very small thing here. In order for this variable yk prime to quasi-commute with everything else up to a power of epsilon, we still have to have a compatibility relation. Have a compatibility relation, but this compatibility relation is going to be modulo L, obviously. And then we define the root of unity quantum cluster algebra to be the C-sub algebra of the skew filter functions of this quantum torus. They're generated by the cluster variables. Same thing for the root of unity upper quantum cluster algebra. You intersect these mixtures of a quantum torus here, quantum affine space there. Quantum affine space there. You intersect this, and like you do the most natural thing that you would do anyway. So, small definition now. Everything here, the compatibility was modulo L. We would say that one of these algebras is strict if the compatibility holds in Z. And then you just reduce your L mod, your lambda mod L when you define all these commutations over there. So, one example. So, one example: if you look at usual cluster algebras, just usual cluster algebras, there would be a special case over here. You could have taken your root of unity to be the first root of unity. Epsilon would be just one. This formula here would produce all possible cluster algebras of geometric type. So, we are not losing anything in this definition right now. We even covered the usual cluster algebras without Poisson structures. Without Poisson structures, if you say that it's strict, then these are precisely the ones that have a Poisson structure. So the strictness is something that is a non-commutative version of the Poisson condition. And it actually can make this precise. There is a structure that's called Poisson order. That Poisson order structure exists when it's strict, doesn't exist otherwise. It is a generalization of Poisson. Of Poisson structures. All right, so we have the two objects: the commutative upper cluster algebras and the non-commutative root of unity quantum cluster algebras. What's the relationship between the two? So if you work in the world where instead of epsilon, you have a Q, you would have to do a specialization, like some sort of Q mod one. If you're in the world where epsilon is a root of unity, there's a much Root of unity, there's a much better direct relation, and this much better direct relation is just like we defined our clusters now inside those cluster algebras pick up all L powers of those cluster variables. Now, these guys are going to be in the center of our non-commutative algebra, so they're going to commute with each other. So, this will be a mixture of a Laurent polynomial ring and polynomial algebra. We can intersect. Polynomial algebra, we can intersect this and we can cook out that. So that is a central sub-algebra of our non-commutative algebra. And the theorem is this is a very standard condition if you're doing quantum groups. If you take your L, the order of the root of unity, to be out in co-prime to the skillsymmetrizing integers of the principal part of B tilde. And by the way, these are exactly the conditions that would appear in the Kuncini-Katzprochesi. The Kunchine-Katz Procees. That would be odd and co-prime to whatever, some integers for the Cartan matrix. Then the center of sub-algebra is isomorphic to the classical upper cluster algebra. So the upper cluster algebra is canonically. First thing it says it is sub-algebra. And the second thing it says that it's isomorphic to this. So this thing here, the classical object, is sitting inside. Classical object is sitting inside the center in here, and it's precisely this algebra that's over there. So, this is a unique phenomenon, like so that for for, so there is certain unique thing for this phenomenon. So, first, when people were doing big quantum groups at roots of unity, they had a center of sub-algebra, but they couldn't really say in what sense the center of sub-algebra was exactly the classical analog of your quantum group. There are some things that you. Group. There are some things that you can argue. But here, the center of sub-algebra is precisely the classical object in the cluster world. And let me just stop here with the general thing. It's isomorphic in the sense of algebra. Actually, you have a bijection between the seeds. And you can use this in order to prove that the exchange. This, in order to prove that the exchange graphs here and here are exactly the same. So, the exchange graphs for this intersection, you can prove that it's precisely the exchange graph for here, precisely using this sub-algebra. So, it's a completely different proof, for instance, from Berenstein and Zelvinsky, who used specialization to prove isomorphism of exchange graphs. So, here you would use that this algebra is isomorphic to this. Therefore, you have the two exchange graphs being equal. All right, so now the next thing that I want to say is what kind of representation theory we really want to consider. So somehow I wanted to address two questions. One is Poisson geometry and the second is representation theory. So in what world is this representation theory? So this is what people would call representations of PI algebras, but once Raoul said, like, what are PI algebras? So I'm hiding PI algebras using So I'm hiding PI algebras use the other name orders, orders in central simple algebras. So there has been like a long activity in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. So there's been a long direction of works by Artin, Kaplansky, Pozner, Procesi, who developed like what will be the general framework of representations of orders, how you study their irreducible representations. So the setting here is that A is a non-cummutative, finite. Is that A is a non-commutative, finitely generated, complex algebra without zero divisors? Usually, you wouldn't ask without zero divisors, you would say that your algebra is prime, which is a little bit more general, which is module finite over central sub-algebra C. So if you're in the world that you have your non-commutative algebra to be module finite over the commutative algebra, using a theorem of Kaplansky, you can prove that all finite-dimensional representations, all irreducible representations are finite-dimensional. Irreducible representations are finite dimensional. So, this is the classical trick that's being used for big quantum groups. So, therefore, we can apply Schur's lemma and we have a character map that goes from the irreducible representations to the spectrum, the maximum spectrum of this central sub-algebra. So, we can visualize this geometrically like this. So, on the bottom, we have our maximum spectrum of C. Usually, it's some sort of singular variety. Some sort of singular variety. On the top, we have the fibers for this map C, which picks up the irreducible representation, the character of an irreducible representation. And classically, these people cared about what can you prove about the fibers and use this in order to classify the points. This will be the classifications of the irreducible representations. And just to open one thing here, even if you're doing, for instance, modular. If you're doing, for instance, modular representation theory, so you take a restricted Lie algebra in positive characteristic, then the universal enveloping algebra will have big center, and you can interpret that picture also in exactly the same way. So even modular representation theory fits to this picture, except that here we will work in characteristic zero. So now the first question that you want to classify is all irreducible representations here. All irreducible representations here of maximal dimension, like classify all of them that are of maximal dimension, then after that is classify all of them that are not of maximal dimension. So this goes under the name of Azumaya locus of A. So Azumaya, so first the fully Azumaya locus, so that's a notion that was introduced by Kenny Brown and Ian Gordon. So the fully Azumaya locus of an algebra A with respect to the center of subalgebra is, you can prove that it's a Zariski. Is you can prove that it's a Zariski open subset of those maximal ideals with the property that if you look at these fibers, all of them will have maximal dimension. That maximal dimension is a certain invariant of the algebra. It's called the PI degree of the algebra. So that's a relatively newer notion. It was introduced around 2000. And the older notion from the 50s and 60s is if you look at the If you look at the full centrum of the algebra, then and you run the whole thing with the full center, then this will be the definition of an azumar locus of the algebra. And in that case, you would have only one irreducible representation of maximal dimension in each fiber. I should say like each fiber is going to have at least one, at most one irreducible representation of maximal dimension. So the big thing here in this, the big like thing that you have. This is the big thing that you have to resolve in this area is to first of all to classify this fully asomyel locus of the algebra. So then you understand where your algebra behaves generically and then to proceed with the rest. For instance, Kenny Brown and Ian Gordon introduced this notion in 2000 because they wanted to classify the fully asomy locus of a quantized coordinate ring at roots of unity. So that problem was solved about 20 years ago. Problem was solved about 20 years ago, and that's where they introduced this notion. No questions. Okay, so to come back, in order to run this whole, to live in this world, we need to have two conditions. So the two conditions are that our non-commutative algebra should be finitely generated. We can impose that condition. Lara had a condition like that on the classical level. Like that on the classical level, that is a condition that we will need in order to run usual algebraic geometry without going to whatever infinite schemes of infinite type. All right, so that we definitely need that here. The second condition, though, is a condition that looks like we shouldn't be imposing this condition all the time. The second condition is that our non-commutative algebra should be module finite over the center of sub-algebra. So, we definitely don't want to stick this. So we definitely don't want to stick this condition around in our theorems because how on earth are we going to check? So let's come back to this previous slide. How on earth are we going to check that this is finitely generated over that? So we definitely don't want to have that condition around. And that is the first theorem that I will state is how we actually resolve this. And to resolve this, we're going to use the method of This we're going to use the method of Cayley-Hamilton algebras of Pruchesi. So, here is what's a Cayley-Hamilton algebra. So, we start with a non-commutative algebra A and commutative subalgebra C, define trace in the usual way. And now, Procesi wants to define characteristic polynomial of an element of the algebra A. So you pick up an element of the algebra A, and just like you have a matrix, you want to define Like you have a matrix, you want to define a characteristic polynomial for your element of the algebra A. Yes, I said that Bernard's paper was about non-commutative symmetric functions. So I will say something here about symmetric functions, but it will be all hidden in a very elementary way. So look at the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of y, which are the elementary symmetric functions. You can write down, you can write them by universal expressions in terms of. Universal expressions in terms of those ones, which are the Newton power sum symmetric functions. There is a small point there. You need to introduce denominators from one to n in order to do that. So that's a restriction on the characteristic of the field. And then if you have an algebra with trace, take exactly those expressions, plug in them not trace of the matrix, but trace of the actual element. The actual element and back in the characteristic polynomial for the matrix. And this will be your characteristic polynomial of an element of an algebra with trace. I could have said that much more easily, like just take the elementary symmetric functions, express them in terms of Newton power some symmetric functions, plug this in, plug back in there. All right, definition of Prochesi. A Kayleigh-Hamilton algebra of degree n is an algebra A. Of degree n is an algebra A with trace such that every element satisfies its n characteristic polynomial, just like matrices, and the trace of one is equal to n. So the thing that we should be thinking about is n-bynth matrices. This is a generalization of n-bin matrices over commutative algebra. This is what Procesi says. However, if you are in this world, Procese creates a very nice geometric picture to actually treat the reduced. To actually treat the irreducible representations of this algebra. So he says that actually you can cook up a vector bundle over the maximum spectrum width of C, such that the fibers of this vector bundle are direct sums of the irreducible representations that appeared as dots on the previous picture. So what before was just dots on the previous picture, in the picture of Pruchesi using invariant theorem, invariant theory, this will be precisely This will be precisely the fibers of a vector bundle over Max Pack of C. And the theorem with Wang and Le is that if we assume again that L is a root of unity, blah, blah, blah, the usual assumptions. So these are the assumptions that we need in order to define the center of sub-algebra. Then the first statement is that this has a canonical structure of Kelly-Hamilton algebra of the degree L to the n. An algebra of that degree L to the n. And what is upshot now? Now we can use a theorem of Procesi. And the theorem of Procesi tells us that that algebra is affine, finitely generated, if and only if this is module finite over that, and this is also finitely generated. So I want to say that one of the two directions in this if and only if is totally trivial. The direction that If this is a finitely generated module over this, and this is a finitely generated algebra, obviously this will be finitely generated algebra. So the point is going this direction. The point is going this direction. You assume very little. You assume that your non-commutative algebra is finitely generated. And all of a sudden, just from knowing that this thing here was generated by the traces, you would immediately know that this. You would immediately know that this is a finitely generated module over the centers of algebra. So, there are two things that come from this theorem. First, just like in Ben's talk, it will be very interesting to know what kind of properties can be transferred between two different objects, between classical cluster algebras, root of unity cluster algebras, and quantum cluster algebras. And the theorem says that actually there is one property that you can transfer in between. That you can transfer in between. If you know finite generation on the root of unity quantum level, you know finite generation on the classical level totally for free without any assumptions. Like there are practically no assumptions here whatsoever. So that's one. And second, in order to run that machinery of representations of orders, we needed this condition and that condition. And that condition. And in our world, the second condition is a consequence of the first condition, so we can skip it from all theorems and just work under that condition. So that's basically the upshot of this first Kayleigh-Hamilton business that is actually helping us to deal with finite generation. All right. So the next thing is: I mentioned at the beginning that we don't want to care about symplectic leaves, but we want to care about torus orbits of symplectic leaves. They're natural toric actions on cluster algebra. So I wanted on two slides to quickly review these actions. They did come up in previous talks already. So if we take an element in the kernel of the transpose of the exchange matrix B tilde. Exchange matrix B tilde, then it gives a sister action on the root of unity upper quantum cluster algebra by that formula. On the upper cluster algebra by that formula, this is by Poisson automorphisms. And the isomorphism canonical central subalgebra with the classical upper cluster algebra actually intertwines the two actions up to a power of t. Up to a power of t. Okay, so this is kind of very obvious. Again, no rocket science here. So then we can define the torus that is C star raised to the dimension of this kernel. If we choose a bunch of elements that span the kernel, a transpose is missing here. Then we can package the system. We can package the C-star actions into an action of the torus on the quantum object, an action of the torus on the Poisson object, and the isomorphism between the center of the quantum object and the Poisson object intertwines the two actions. So now we can think about where we started at the beginning. We had dash. We had DAF in space C2 with a Poisson structure. It had a C-star action, and we wanted to understand not just symplectic leaves, but we wanted to understand torus orbits of symplectic leaves. So now this will be the question that the first question that I want to address. It would be Poisson geometry of cluster algebras. So here's the general question. We have the spectrum of the upper cluster algebra with the Poisson. Of the upper cluster algebra with the Poisson structure, we have the torus that acts on this. What are the T orbits of symplectic leaves? How much you can say about the global behavior of this? And from what I've seen in the papers, the previous results were all local. So Misha, Misha, and Alec in their first paper, they restricted pi to the cluster subtori and they said they're regular Poisson, which means that the Poisson, the symplectic leaf foliation, is. The symplectic leaf foliation is a content constant truncation. So it's a foliation in a usual geometric sense. So that's the definition of regular Poisson. But those are just toro is sitting in the whole spectrum. So what can we say in general? And our theorem, that's the paper that we just posted, is you can prove the following thing. So you take any finitely generated uppercase. Take any finitely generated upper cluster algebra admitting compatible skew symmetric matrix. You look at the GSV Poisson structure, and the statement is that it always, only under these assumptions, it always has a Zariski open and therefore dense. It's going to be dense because this variety here is irreducible. It's the spectrum of an integral domain. So it's going to be, there is always a Zariski open density orbit of simple activity leaves, and it's given very explicitly. And it's given very explicitly. It's the smooth part of our spectrum without the zero lock of all frozen variables. So this is a single symplectic leaf. And I'll give an example to show you how exactly it plays out in a concrete example. So the point of this theorem is that this basically gives something that's about the global structure of this Poisson manifolds, not concrete. Concrete Poisson tori, not by codimension arguments in this and this, but it basically says in general, this is what happens. So first of all, I want to say that this result is basically without any assumptions. The assumptions that B tilde admits are a compatible oscillator matrix is the definition of Poisson structure. So you cannot run your Poisson structure without that assumption. Poisson structure without that assumption. The assumption that it's finitely generated, you need in order to define symplectic leaf. There is no definition of a Poisson scheme of infinite type and how you do symplectic foliation of a Poisson scheme of infinite type. So you need to be like in a finite type in order to actually define symplectic foliation. All right, so that's that. Then corollary. So I was arguing that if you have Was arguing that if you have a Poisson manifold and you look at a symplectic leaf, so there is this, these people would call that a singular foliation because it's a non-constant run foliation. So the leaves are representing what are points for usual manifolds. So you have a manifold or a variety, what you dare consider as a point. In the Poisson world, the symplectic leaf plays the role of a point. So then you ask yourself. So then you ask yourself, what will be the definition of a Poisson version of a toric variety? So the Poisson version of a toric variety would be an affine variety with an action of a torus that has the property that has a dense t-orbit of symplectic leaves. So that would be the same as saying a dense t-orbit of points. So basically, this theorem proves in a very explicit way that Very explicit way that these cluster varieties are actually Poisson versions of toric varieties in a very explicit way. Like there is a dense torus orbit of synthetic leaves. And just in general, like what are the arguments for the theorem? So basically we work a lot with the sections of the anti-canonical bundle of this manifold. It's a smooth manifold. And we basically cook up enough sections that are checking. Sections that are checking whether something belongs to this T orbit of symplectic cleaves or it doesn't, and then use normality arguments in order to prove that this whole thing here is a single T orbit of symplectic cleaves. So the key part of the theorem is not that the symplectic cleavage is going to go beyond this, so that's easier to prove, but the part is to prove that this is a single T orbit of symplectic cleaves, that it's not several T orbits of symplectic cleaves. Orbits of symplices. And we will see this in one example how exactly that plays out. Okay. Any questions? All right. So at this point, if you've seen stuff on quantum groups and Poisson groups, it's very tempting. Like people there are super eager to deal with Poisson varieties that have finitely many T orbits of symplectic leaves. And everything that I showed. And everything that I showed before for special cases, like Richardson varieties, Schubert varieties, double Bruker cells, those double bots-Samuelsons, they all have this special property that they have finitely many key orbits of synthetic leaves. So one can say like, oh, you actually proved a very weak version of a theorem that should have been, you should have proved that theorem. That will be much better theorem because you would hand. Because it would handle even beyond that the orbital symplectic list. But that's actually false. And one can cook up examples of this. So when I was a graduate student and working on quantum groups and reading Bernard's papers on canonical basis, so my thesis was on Poisson leaf groups. And there I classified the symplectic folations of these beloved reinforced Poisson structures. And there the symplectic leaves are The symplectic leaves are not classified by discrete datum, like pairs of vowel group elements, minimal length representatives, but to each of them, you also need to associate a certain reductive subgroup. And there is a third part of the datum, which is a twisted conjugacy class of certain reductive subgroup. And that is sitting inside the levy of some parabolic. But then with the vowel group elements, you somehow decrease the levy factor of the parabolic, and you look. Parabolic, and you look at the twisted conjugacy classes of that levy factor. And very rarely, that levy factor is the maximal torus. Usually it's bigger. And then Misha, Misha, and Alec constructed cluster algebra structures, not on all of them, but on some of them. And that's already enough to cook up an example where this is smooth and still you don't have finitely many T orbits of symplectic cleaves. So that's basically from the point of view of Basically, from the point of view of general cluster variety, that's basically the best that you can do. So, my conjecture is that the cluster algebras for which this gadget has finitely many T orbits of symplectic leaves are in some way the most well-behaved cluster algebras. Like, for instance, the ones from Belavin Dreamshot would not qualify for well-behaved in this framework. Well-behaved will be like the ones that we saw yesterday. Will be like the ones that we saw yesterday in the talks of Jose and Melissa. They have this property. Well, behalf will be the ones that appeared in the work of Bernard, Christophe, and Jan. They will have finitely many T orbits of symplectic leaves. Now I want to give a motivation of where everything came from. So take a complex simple Lie group G, and now put this Poisson structure. Put this Poisson structure on the full flag variety G mod B plus. So here chi stands for the infinitesimal action that's coming from the left action of G on this flag variety. So you take just the left action. The infinitesimal action will be a map from the Lie algebra of G to vector fields on G mod B plus. That's denoted like that. These are the usual root vectors. These are the positive roots. So this is called the standard Poisson structure. This is called the standard Poisson structure on the flag variety. The sugar cell is a Poisson submanifold there. And in this Poisson submanifold, we have a Zariski open T orbit of leaves. P is the maximum torus of G that's sitting inside B plus. And this maximum T orbit, maximum T orbit of symplectic leaves, or the risky open T orbits of symplectic leaves is precisely the Eclipse is precisely the complement of the Richardson divisor. So let's go very quickly over this. So this is the open Richardson variety that corresponds to a pair of biogroup elements W U. W must be greater or equal than U. We pick up the ones that come from U equal to a single reflection. The sum here is over the support of W, the simple reflections that appear in one and therefore any word of W. So we take this gadget. This is the closure of this inside here. We throw away from the sugar cell that. So the picture would be that this thing looks like. So the Richardson, perfect. So the Richardson divisor would look like that. So this is your Your open Sugar cell. And then the Richardson divisor will have several irreducible components. So this will be the irreducible components like that. Like that. And this whole thing will be a single T orbit of symplectic leaf. So T leaf. So people in Poisson geometry usually would say just a T leaf. Would say just a T leaf for short of T orbit of a leaf. But now, if you think about this picture, so this picture is somehow kind of quite a bit used in representation theory, Poisson geometry, Schubert calculus. So these pictures somehow appear very naturally there. But now, if you think about what exactly this is, then take the guys Leclerc Schroer cluster algebra structure on the Cluster algebra structure on the Schubert cell in the simply layers case, and then we did it in general. Take that Poisson structure, then you have a bunch of frozen variables. These are precisely the zero sets of the frozen variables. So what we had on the previous slide, this gadget over here is precisely generalizing the Richardson divisor in the Schubert. In the Schubert case. Yeah, the Schubert cell case. So it's kind of remarkable that one simple thing about Schubert cells actually is true for any cluster algebra. So this is precisely the open T orbital symplectic leaves. And it's true just plain in general. So let me give now one example. So consider the AC. So, consider the acyclic cluster algebra of type A11. So, the exchange matrix is there, the Lambda matrix is there, the kernel of B tilde is zero, so therefore the corresponding torus is trivial. The corresponding presentation for the cluster algebra, which you call the upper cluster algebra, is that module of that. So, we've seen that many times. So, we've seen that many times. Now, there is a nicer presentation. You can introduce an element in this algebra, which is given by this expression. In terms of this new element, the algebra is generated by x1, x2, and z, modulo one relation like this. So, in other words, our yb tilde in this case, which was the spectrum of this, is a surface in C3. And it's easy. And it's easy to check using calculus that this is a smooth surface. Now, the Poisson structure is what people in Poisson geometry call a Poisson structure that's coming from a potential. So if you have three variables, x1, x2, x3, a Poisson structure coming from a potential is one that has the property that xi, xi plus one, is equal. plus one is equal to partial x i plus two of f and this is taken modulus equity permutations so these are very well behaved Poisson structures and f is the potential for this Poisson structure so our first theorem says that since we have no frozen variables we have no singular part this must be a symplectic manifold you can check this and sec so so in other word And sec, so, in other words, there is only one single symplectic leaf. So, this is what the theorem says. Now, this is sort of the global picture. Now, let's think about geometrically what this object is. So, you take the cross sections of this cluster variety with z equal to a constant. Then you recover all possible conics through these four points. So, these are conics in C2 through those points. Two through those points, and then if you take the projectivization for all these conics and you throw the conic at z equal to infinity, so remember that the equation was, this is the equation, this is equal to zero. You treat this as an equation in CP3, and then you compactify everything. This is called the pencil of conics, and what actually we're getting is What actually we're getting is that this variety is actually the affine part of the pencil of conics. All right, so these are the pictures there. Now, let's continue with the cluster variables. They were studied by Zelovinsky and Sherman. So these are precisely the corresponding clusters, so precisely pairs like this, given by this recursively defined like that. And you can ask what is the union of the And you can ask what is the union of the cluster Tori. You're missing precisely four points from your pencil of conics. You're missing those two points. So before when somehow we when people studied what is the Poisson geometry of this cluster toroid, it was missing those four points in this picture. So of course here we are in dimension two. So when we go to higher dimension, that's more and more. Go to higher dimension, that's more and more that's missing from the global picture to the local picture. Okay, great. So now finally we come to the theorem about irreps. So we're going to have exactly the same conditions like before, but we need one condition here, which I wish we could throw out. I wish we could throw out the condition: is we it you this is finitely generated, so we're happy with that condition. We have to have that condition. We don't have to impose that this is finitely generated over the central sub-algebra, because by the previous theorem, that's a redundant condition. So this that that finite module finiteness we don't need. The odd coprime blah blah blah, none of them is needed, but we need this condition in. We need this condition in order to make everything work in the root of unity case. So, in this root of unity case, the theorem is that the fully azumaya locus now contains this part that was in the previous theorem, and it's contained in this part. And this part over here simply runs over the proton variables that are not central. Right. Right. Now, if you think about these pictures, they're only like you, it's very hard to cook up an example where you have a frozen variable that is central. So if you throw away pathological examples that you sort of never see in the real world, all frozen variables will not be central. And it means that this product here is precisely the same as this product there. So without like taking away Without like taking away the pathological examples, this is the same as this. The only difference from here to there is that we can't put the regular part over there. So in this sense, this basically provides a very general way of handling the fully azumayal locus. And this is not something that you can basically just do like that. For instance, in the case of Skane algebras, there was what is called quantum unicity conjecture. Quantum unicity conjecture of Bonahon and Weng that said that in the case of scane algebras of surfaces, the fully the Zumaya locus contains the non-singular part. So it sort of contains that. So in that case, you throw away these guys. So that quantum unicity conjecture was sort of a big conjecture, was resolved about several years ago. So I want to say basically in general, this is not like, I mean, it's Is not like, I mean, it's it's it's it would be great to put the same thing here and there, but but that's that's not something that you can do in general. Like, even for a concrete cluster algebra, this is not an easy fact to deal with. So to say a few things, so the only essential assumption in the theorem is that A is equal to U on the root of unity quantum level. But there has been recently, and before recently, there have been. And before recently, there have been so many results that prove u equals a and u equals a that now somehow we are used to everything that's well behaved has the property equal to u. And well-behaved, I know it's a subjective definition. But that property is so far somehow the major one that I know is the Bellov and Drinfeld star. So yeah, so that's that. And then the that and then uh the the the results so we we need to the the proofs so we need to use something that's called a Poisson order structure so Poisson order basically very quickly means that if this is a Poisson algebra every Hamiltonian derivation here can be extended to a derivation of the non-conductive algebra so if we're in the world of that Poisson order structure we can apply theorems of these people use the previous theorem plus some representation Theorem plus some representation theoretic results, and that proves the theorem. And just to finish everything, so let's return to the acyclic cluster algebra. So there's the exchange matrix, that's the lambda. On the quantum level, this is acyclic. So same theorem like Berenstein Fominze-Levinsky works on the root of unitic quantum level. If you are acyclic and there are no frozen variables, then A cyclic. No frozen variables, then a is equal to u equals lower bound. This is what's written over here. So that the theorem for this like an illustration for this concrete algebra, the theorem proves that all irreducible representations should have maximal dimension, they can be obtained from each other in an explicit way from representations of quantum tori. So the theorem gives like a full classification of the irreducible representations. There is an extra Equations. There is an extra result. If you know that all of them have the same dimension L, that by some results implies that your algebra is an Azumaya algebra. So that's one of the consequences. This was actually an Azumaya algebra. It's an analog of central simple algebras when you work not over fields, but over commutative algebras. Yeah, I wanted to say happy birthday, Bernard, and thank you for being inspiration for. Thank you for being inspiration for many generations of mathematicians. Thank you very much for this very wonderful talk. Are there any questions from the virtual audience? So, if you are a virtual participant that would like to ask a question, please just Would you like to ask a question, please? Just unmute yourself. Well, it doesn't seem to be the case. So, is there any question from the audience here in Oaxaca? Thank you. So, in the case when you do have well-behaved cluster algebra, is it correct that you can then almost immediately kind of go from cluster structure on this big. structure on on this big uh regular locus to deeper tea leaves if you have if you do have that's still that is still difficult even yeah even for well-behaved ones it's very hard to say what are the signatures in general so your question is if you assume assumption can you classify all signature cues Also integrate the keywords. This is very fun. Okay, I wish there was someone. Okay, no, no, it's just, yeah, okay. All right, okay, thank you. Are there any more questions? Yeah, sure. You mentioned these examples where there is some action of mapping class group application to topology. Application to topology. So, are there? Can you say a bit more about it? And are there some special results you can in these cases that follow from your pictures? So, this was a paper of Bonaparte and Monk. This paper in Sony's like they basically drove the following inklight to get a representation of the scan algebra of a surface model dimension, which is Which is the PI degree of the algebra, then you automatically have an action of the mapping class group of the surface on this representation. And somehow they had to conjecture about the fact that these representations of maximal dimension, those myelocas, they contain the singular part, they contain the smooth part of the center, the full center of the algebra. And this was the conjecture. And this was the conjecture. So, somehow it would be interesting in this situation to somehow understand you have canonical analogs of mapping class groups in the world of cluster algebra. So, it's a natural question then to ask, if you have a representation of the root of unity quantum cluster algebra of maximal dimension, do you actually have an action of some like modular group or something associated to the cluster algebra on this representation? To the cluster algebra on this representation. So that would be basically a way to create funny dimensional representations, which in this business is sort of very interesting because these are very infinite groups. So that would be really great if I can do. Any more questions? Well, if not, let's thanks me in again. All the speakers of the
