What I would call Kelvin-Boyd model, I'll explain what it is. And this is joint work that we have completed very recently, actually, with Costas Cumatos, who is from the University of Sussex, Corrado Latancio and Stefano Spirito, who are in L'Aquila. And all right, so let me Let me well, I guess certain people talk about these things, but I want to go through that to establish notation. So I want to think of this relativity in Lagrangian coordinate. And we all like to splint the elastic part. Okay, comparison with the tight side. All right, good. All right, there is an elastic part which is given by the gradient of a stored energy function and the viscous part, which has to satisfy viscous dissipation as usual, why is the motion. And I will be working with the variables velocity and deformation gradient. Okay, so There is a lot of results in dimension d equal to one about existence theory of this system. And there are some results for models of this form, actually, which are proliferating in the more recent years. The most relevant one for the one that I will be talking about is the result of Friseke Doltzmann, which I will tell you. Frieseke and Doltzmann, which I will tell you a little bit in some detail what they did. And this result here of Frieseke and Doltzmann concerns this case, where the strain energy is given by an elastic part and the viscous part, which is linear. And this is what I will call Kelvin-Voigt model, right? Because of the plus and the linearity in a problem. That is my professional for my analysis. I will explain what it means. Now, we saw several things at this conference about non-linear strain rate dependence and implicit stress theories and etc. Which are you know people like Josef Malek The organizer Miroslav and Rajakopal started this, and there are very follow-up results in this direction. The model I will be considering, one deficiency that it has, of course consistent with entropy dissipation, but it's not framing different. And if I have time at the end, I will talk a little bit about that. I will comment. But okay, but this is a mathematical model in the sense that. In the sense that it's not framing different, and but yet I will stick with this and want to tell you a little bit what we know about the existence theory of such a model. So I'm coming from the theory of elasticity, so I want to think of that a little bit about the issue of regularization of elasticity with these kinds of terms. And you will see that this kind of perspective plays some role in. Plays some role in what we're doing. So we write that as a system of conservation laws with the usual form. This is a system of elasticity. Remember that tests always come from a density, a stored energy function. And there is a constraint that says that f is the gradient of y, which gets propagated from the data and will not be considered. And we will not be considering that here. And we put initial data on that, where f is a gradient, as I said, and periodic boundary conditions. This is our result. So we're interested really on the issues of PDEs here. And well, as everybody knows, this has an energy identity, a kinetic and potential energy, which has dissipation from the viscous. All right. Uh let me the energy identity of course gives you these estimates here which I want to place some hypotheses. There is some hypothesis that that the elastic energy looks like an L P norm for large P, like coercivity and bounce. And there are some hypotheses that I didn't write some hypotheses that I didn't write and it was a mistake that because they they play some role that the derivatives they they are bounded like powers of uh you know like power derivatives of powers so the first derivative will be like f to the p minus one the second derivative will be like f to the p minus two and somehow the the focus of this work is to understand what is the effect of the What is the effect of the growth in various issues like existence, uniqueness, and regularity for this kind of problem? This is what we wanted to achieve, and I will tell you what we did as we go on. So the bounds of the first and second derivatives are important here, and they are the natural bounds of the power, of a power that behaves like that. Okay, and it's easy to see. Okay, and it's easy to see that, you know, with techniques that people here in this conference know very well, that for this kind of energy structure, you can deduce that Vn converges, if you have a sequence of approximate solutions for this problem, you can deduce that Vn converges to V strongly, but Fn converges to F only weakly in the corresponding. In the corresponding spaces. So the issue is how to improve on that. And I will try to say a little bit what one can do in this direction. So there is one more assumption, except for the assumptions that I call age, which is the coercivity and the growth. The coercivity and the growth. There is the assumption, what is called the Andrews-Ball condition, which was introduced by Andrews and Boll, and which says that, well, it can be written in various ways, but actually, I don't like the way it's written here. One second. Okay, the Andrews Bohr condition, as it yeah, as it was introduced, it's here. I should not put that. This is a mistake. I should have put on the right-hand side zero. Okay, and what it is, it's a monotonicity of the stress function far away. Okay, so you allow So you allow to have non-convexity of W in compact sets, but when you are far away, you want your W to be convex and the corresponding S to be monotone. So I should have put a zero here for large values of F. So this is the Andrews Bolt condition. It was introduced in the context of the theory with dimension for dimension equal to one. And then Dorothy. And then Doltsman and Frizeke exploited that for dimension, and in ways that I want to explain. Okay, so the existence theory that I want to explain, which is a combination of the result that presented by Doltzmann and what we did, is that under hypothesis H and A B, if you have initial data V0 in L2 and F0 in Lp, P bigger or equal than 2 every P bigger or equal than two everywhere here, then you have the solution in the energy space and it decreases the energy. That's first part. Second part, if you assume a little bit more, you assume that F0 is in H1, then you have that the solution is in L infinity with values in H1. And here, you know, this is a weak solution, which is almost like a strong solution. Is almost like a strong solution, except that we don't know uniqueness for this problem. You would call strong solution if we knew uniqueness. And also, there are some conditions that are easy to work out under what conditions you have conservation of energy. And energy is conserved in dimension two for all p's and in dimension three for p between two and four. All right, so let me explain a little bit, you know, the A little bit, you know, this direction, and then I will go to the next thing. So, Doltvan and Frizeke, one thing that they did is that they tried to approach this problem from the perspective of methods of elasticity, you know, trying to make contact with minimization methods. And they wrote down a minimization problem, which is a time-step type of problem. Type of problem. You know, you start with your data and then you update the data by solving an immunizimization problem. And you get iterates that are continuous in X and discrete in T. And then you interpolate between these integrals. So what they solve is this problem here, which of course you have to make sure that you can solve that already. And this provides a minimization procedure to construct solutions for this problem. The constraint is a function. The constraint is affine, so what you need is convexity here of this function. And this turns out to be convex for a reason that I will say in a moment. Then you build approximate solutions. And then the main thing is that they prove the propagation of compactness result, which says that if in the initial data you have that F0 converges at the approximate. The approximate solution converges to F0, then this property propagates in time. And from strong convergence of the initial data, you get strong convergence later. Okay, now the reason that, okay, I will not explain how they did that, but there is some kind of estimate for difference of solutions that they had to work out. But one thing I want to say is that the hypothesis. Is that the hypothesis of Andrews and Ball is equivalent to saying that the function w, if you add a quadratic, it becomes convex. Although the function is non-convex, if you add the quadratic, it becomes convex. So, okay, so this is what is called sometimes semi-convexity. Now, our perspective was to do Galetkin approximation and Lurking approximation and estimates, and the main thing is that there is an estimate on the gradient, which you could have guessed because of the result of Doltzmann and Frieseke. There is an identity that looks like that, which I will explain in the next slide, which under the condition of convexity, this identity here, W hat, which is the original. W hat, which is the original W plus K times identity, is positive, so that gives you a global inequality and it gives you an H1 estimate, let's say, all times. Okay, so how can you see that? One way to think of that is to think of the following problem, that is a classical problem in the theory of conservation laws. Namely, if you consider a viscosity approximation of conservation law, Of conservation law. Of course, you get the energy identity. And it is known since the work of Diperna in 1983, the work where he did the existence for the 1D case of P system or the equations of elasticity, if you want, that one part of his proof was to transfer the dissipation from the velocity to the strain. Okay, and And something similar to that occurs in relaxation approximations. You can transfer dissipation and get positive dissipation under the sub-characteristic condition there. And it can be done also in this multi-decase by coming up with this kind of estimate, which is an exact estimate for the problem, and which you obtain by combining the energy estimate by another estimate, which is again has negative. Which is again has negative, has indefinite dissipation. But if you add them together, you can make the dissipation positive for problems that are hyperbolic, which means that the stored energy is convex, right? So for these problems, this is what happens. And for the case that we are interested here, which corresponds to the case epsilon equal to one, You don't quite get that, but what it tells you is that since you have the Andrews-Boll condition, you can put a grad F on the right-hand side and then get something positive and get the global inequality that I mentioned and then conclude. All right, so this is the main thing here in order to do this part, this kind of festival. Let me, okay, I wanted to talk about. Me, okay. I wanted to talk about that about diffusion dispersion, but let me skip that. And I want to talk about an example. You know, this tells you to consider what happens if you don't have strong convergence of the initial data. And it is possible to construct an example in one space dimension that if you don't have positive initial data, then you can have solutions. Then you can have solutions that are oscillatory. And this example is easy to construct if you use two ingredients. One is that the uniform CR solution, which is known that they are what is called a universal solution in elasticity, namely no matter what sigma of u is, this will be a solution for any k. And you mix it together with the following Following observation that exists for this kind of system, which goes back to the work of Peggo and Hoff, that these kinds of systems can have discontinuous solutions of the following type. If you write down Raiki-Cogniot conditions, you see that if you set V equal to zero, which means that the velocity is continuous, you want to have a discontinuity in V sub X, then necessarily, if you want to have a discontinuity in U, you. Want to have a discontinuity in u, you have to pick s to be equal to zero, and then you can have solutions where u is discontinuous, and then the total stress is continuous, but with u and v sub x having discontinuity. So if you do that and you combine with the uniform serial solutions, it's easy to construct oscillatory solutions that oscillate between A and B two states. states and u would be a times t you and u would be b times t and this is in the interval from zero to theta and from theta to one and then you extend periodically as usual in these examples and you construct by rescaling the additional solution in order to achieve that you need to have a special stress which you can uh devise and uh this construction is achieved for s sma some times. It for some times, but sigma has to be non-monotone. Okay, that's the catch. So, this has to do if you want this kind of example, is an example that it would appear on phase transitions. But then, by rescaling this solution, then you get that Vn goes in the average to Cr strongly, but UN only converges weakly at all times. So, the initial weak convergence propagates in time. All right. All right. Now, let me just mention very briefly the uniqueness regulator, and I will cut it there. So in dimension two, under F0 being in H1, and using a strengthened variant of the Andrews Boll condition, which essentially is equivalent to saying that the stress W tilde, which Tilde, which you add to the quadratic, is bounded from below by a power f to the p minus 2, then there exists a unique weak solution. You can prove your uniqueness, and this is a result like which is similar in pattern to the Judovich result for the Euler equations with bounded porticity. And okay, then there is some regularity results for this kind of system. You know, this kind of system has some, you can take derivatives and estimate the terms together. Let me not see to that, but in any case, there are regularity estimates in H3 for under the Andrews-Bohr condition or the modified Andrews-Bohr condition for various values of P. All right, so I think I'm running out of time, so I will not talk about that, but Talk about that. But since I happen to be the last speaker before the speaker organizer, I would like on behalf of everybody here to express our thanks to Mira Bulicek and Anjeska, Sverceska Guazda for putting together this conference and providing us for an outlet of scientific exchange.
