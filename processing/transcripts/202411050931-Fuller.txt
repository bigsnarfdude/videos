To talk about the recurrent elements of group-wide system algebras from their supports. So, thank Dillian and all the organizers for this wonderful week and giving me the opportunity to speak here. I say here, this is joint work with Pratyu Karmaker, who's a student of mine at Ohio University. The second half of the talk will be joint with him. Be joint with him, and there'll be other stuff along the way. I kind of wanted to advertise my student a bit. So the starting point for a lot of my recent work is a paper that I wrote with John Brown, Sarah Rezenkoff, and David Hitts, and Ruby Self, where we were studying carton inclusions and trying. Carton inclusions and trying to use the group point description of Carton inclusions to understand the finer details within the algebra. So quickly, if I have a Carton sub-algebra of C-star algebra, then this is given by twist. So the larger C-star algebra is the reduced C-star algebra of this group by twist, and the abelian is just a C-zero functions on the unit space. This is Renault and Tungen's. Yeah, Renault and Tungence construction that David talked about yesterday. For me, coming to this result, one of the things I wanted to know about this is, I mean, so this is kind of advertised, rightfully so. Sounds like I'm criticizing it, but I'm not. It's a good result. It's very important. Probably wouldn't be here without it. But it advertises a Caesar alternation of the. A C-star algebraic version of the Veneumann algebra theory. And so there's lots of stuff you can do with the Feldman-Moore description of Carton inclusions in Veneumann algebras. And it's natural to ask, well, can we use this description to do the same in C-Star algebra? And as is always the, well, always is often the case with trying to look at Venezuelan algebra results and then translate them to C-star algebra results, the answer is yes. Those the answer is yes, if you put in the right and sufficiently many adjectives at the start. So, this talk is going to be mostly about those adjectives. So, main result from this paper is if we have a C star diagonal inside a nuclear C star algebra. So, C star diagonal, again, this was something Dave talked about yesterday, but just remind this was a Carton inclusion where we have the unique extension property of pure states from D to A. states from D to A. If we have this inside a nuclear C-star algebra, then whenever I have an intermediate C-star algebra, then D is also a C-star diagonal of C. So if we're a C-star diagonal of A, then we are a C-star diagonal diagonal of C. And relating this to the group boy structure, we have this correspondence that if I look at my group boy G for my twist, for my inclusion. For my inclusion here, I take that there's one-to-one correspondence between the wide-open subgroup wide here, meaning we have the same unit space, and the intermediate C structures. My question, does A have a D sub at all? I believe not. But I think that's probably due to as long as we can do this twist stuff, then it doesn't have to resist. So, this is known in the Leumann algebra case that there's never intermediate inclusion in the Neumann algebras, then the intermediate algebra will be a carton without algebra. So, kind of two main things here that are kind of branches of results that I've been working on since this are Do we need C star diagonal and do we need nuclear? Now, in this paper, we give examples of a nuclear C star algebra and a Carton inclusion where this result fails. So, to some extent, yes, but to what extent? The example in the paper we give here, we have a rational rotation of the A rational rotation of the disk. So the point zero is fixed. So we have a copy isotropy of the entire integer z at zero, and you can use this to construct something that goes awry. So we have a large piece of isotropy in our counterexample here. Yeah, I think I'm going to read up the new part of the case. That's going to be the whole section. That's going to be the whole second half of the talk, but yes. Yes. Yeah, I've got to talk about this first and then I'll talk about this. The C-side idle condition is that's if and only if G's principle, meaning there's no isotropy, there's no groupwide elements whose source is the same as its range, except for the units. This is Kunjin's original result. So the question is: well, can there be any isotropy and still get? Can there be any isotropy and still get this sort of result? In ongoing, soon-to-be published, fingers crossed, work with John Brown and Lisa Clark, we have that we can have a small bit of isotropy. So if I have two points, two units, x and y, if there's two points, or more than one point, More than one point going from y to x, so two group one elements whose source is x and range is y, then we don't have that. Then we actually have one point and just one loop. If this is the case for our group void, then and we have that it's just a single loop, then we can have this one-to-one correspondence. This one-to-one card spottes. So the C-star diagonal condition can be replaced with has this smidgen of isotropy of order two. And you actually can't get better than that. If there's any more isotropy, then you can make this not work. I should point out this has been simultaneously, independently, similarly. Independently, similarly, results due to Kendi and Ursu with group actions and cross-products, which I think Matt's going to talk about tomorrow. So, really we can get past C-star diagonal, we can't get very far past C-star diagonal, is the point here. I would say this work, I mean, I'm presenting it here as if we were trying to get rid of the C-star diagonal position. Of the C-star diagonal position. Really, this work came out of a study of intermediate algebras in Steinberg algebras and studying analogs of the result on the previous slide for Steinberg algebras. And in that setting, this kind of condition kind of fell out. And then we decided, oh, this works in the C-structure alpha case also. Let's show that at the end of the paper. Which is probably one of the reasons that this is not yet out because. Which is probably one of the reasons that this is not yet out because the paper is broken. I think it's reached maturely. Okay, back to the nuclearity condition. So I addressed C-stra agglication and I showed that we can make it looser and we can't do any better. I'm going to go from the nuclearity condition to a related question and then not return to nuclearity conditions. I don't actually have an answer. Actually, I have analysis. So maybe I should have structured my talk differently. I want to, at least for myself, kind of let myself know how we got up to where I am now and started with that original result. So in our correspondence result, when we have intermediate algebras, we said it corresponds to an open subgroupoid of our groupoid G. This is just given by the support of the elements. So So well known that if we have a reduced C star algebra of a group void, then each element of the group void via this map J can be viewed as a continuous function on the groupoid. And so from the C star algebra to a continuous one with the groupoid. And if we just look at the elements of the groupoid, which are in the support of some element of C. This is how we get our open subgroupoid. If and only if we're a minimum. If and only if we're amenable. And for twist, I think it's due to Takaishi was known earlier too for just for a group. On the way to the result on my first slide, we proved this result here. Well, we didn't state it like this, but this is heavily implied by what we did prove. That if we have an amenable groupoid, An amenable groupoid, if we take anything in the reduced C-star algebra and look at its support, then we can get back our original element by looking at CC functions on the support. I have two dates here because the proof of this result in the original paper is very wrong, and there's a cover gandal where you can find the correct results. So the result is true there, but don't look in the proof because it's embarrassing. So, this should be viewed, or at least I like to view this, as we can recover the element from its Fourier, from its Fourier coefficients. This map here, evaluating an element, the reduced C-star algebra on G should be viewed as the gamma Fourier coefficient. And explicitly, if we have a cross-product, this is really what's happening. If you have a Have an element in reduced cross product that has a Fourier series, and the support is exactly the disjoint union of the support of the functions. Now, this may set off alarm bells or things like, oh, I know what to do here. Yes, there are cases in cross-products where we know that we can recover elements from its Fourier series even if it's not amenable, and even if the action is not amenable. So, the approximation property for Property for groups. If you have an action of a group with approximation property, then you can recover the element from his Fourier coefficients. If that's a free action, then you can apply our theorem. That's also in the original paper with Excel and everyone else in this room. Yes, yes, sorry. Yes, I should have said that. Yes, always a tall and always hashtag. So So, this is where my student project came in. I gave him some stuff to read, and he was curious about the amenability or the nuclearity condition and asked, well, what other conditions on our groupoid can we recover the element from its Fourier series? And this, I mean, he asked me this question, I said, I don't know, but here's a bunch of papers to read, which. Don't know, but here's a bunch of papers to read which you might be able to get the answer from. And it's led us through many different iterations of approximation properties. And one where we've found some luck is rapid decay and Hagrow property. So for this, want to say a length function on a group void is defined very similar to a length function on a group. It's a function on a positive positive. Into the positive reals, zero on the unit space, symmetric, and subadditive when the multiplication is defined. Once you have a length function, you can define a Schwartz space, where things are smooth with these norms for each integer p. We look at these two norms and take the biggest of looking at the source or the range of these sums. And again, because we're at all, these are just sums and that's fine. All these are just these are just sums, and that's fine. And this gives us a norm, the short space will be closing up in all these norms and the infinity norm. We have rapid decay if there's some p where we have a bound for the reduced norm for the constant p on here. If this means that the short space will be inside the reduced C star altogether, if L is continuous, it'll be a dense. If L is continuous, it'll be a dense star fresh A algebra. And this is due to Vegand and Howe. I mentioned, yes. So Howe looked at rapid decay properties and group voids, et al. group voids, and Vegand looked at twists. And one thing Vegand noticed that, so this definition here I have the twist and these functions are, you know, on the twist, but the rapid decay property actually really only d depends on on L and G, not on the actual twist. And G, not on the actual twist. Another type of function we can look at on a group point is this locally proper negative definite type function. So we want it, again, zero unit space symmetric. Properness is this last condition that we have. This map is proper. And then we have our negative type condition that whenever I have integers summing up to zero, then this quantity is negative or less than or equal to zero. And again, we're gamma i, gamma j. Where gamma i, gamma, j are chosen so that this multiplication makes sense. This is related to the Hagru property for groupoids. Kozniewski, Lee, and Skalski looked at a Hagruck property for one goes over groupoids. In there, they show that if the groupoid has this type of function, it satisfies their definition of Hagrid property, and there are times when they are the same, in particular for a The same, in particular, for an ample group height, and this is the same as their hyper property. I think in a groups, they all clash to be the same, but group-wise was more complicated. Sorry, if the connect function assumed to be continuous then? Oh, yes, yes. Ratio between these two types of functions is if I have a locally proper negative type function, so if I'm almost this high-growth type property, then I can create. Type property, then I can create a length function because just by taking the square root, that will give me a length function. And our result here is that if we have a twist with a locally proper negative type function, and if we're rapid decay with respect to that length function, then we are recovering elements from their 4ases. Then we have this same condition that we had for amenable group points. This is known for groups and group actions. Group actions work with Better Conti, well, they have a whole series of papers on these types of results, and this is in there for groups. This is a generalization of that to group rights. There are a lot of groups which satisfy these conditions. I've written down a few of them. I was going to write down more, but I was running out of things I understood. Even the things on the slide I don't well understand. Don't well understand, so I don't want to talk to them much. But there are groups which satisfy these things. One thing I don't have an abundance of is examples which aren't groups but are group close. So there's still stuff to know that I want to know in relation to this. But that's where we are right now. So leave it there. Any questions? Is it clear that amenable group points satisfy this property from the previous slide? Not all amenable groups satisfy rapid decay. Okay, so notice. So groups can be separated into rapid decay and exponential growth, I believe. Rapid decay and exponential growth, I believe, or at least finally generated capital growth. Rivers is not even his headline spits at the right time. So all you need is just any old locally proper negative type function. You don't care. Rapid decay don't really depend upon the choice. Well, I mean, we won't have rapid decay with respect to the square. We don't have any result then. Oh, yeah, so if we have. Oh, yeah, so if we have this, then we just have a result by deceased to our algebra. And that's, I mean, that's common for rapid decay. Like, if you can show you can have a function which does this, then you can state stuff where the statement doesn't have the L in it at all. Back to, like, I mean, Jocelyn's work on replicated groups and hygiene even. So essentially this kind of magic, where if if you have a nice Schwartz face inside it, you can use that to prove stuff about your larger hygiene. Stuff from a larger larger larger
