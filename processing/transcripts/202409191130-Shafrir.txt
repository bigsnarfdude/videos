So, this is part of it is a joint work either with Brazilian Mironesco or with Mironesco. It's a little bit related to the previous talk by Chikora two days ago. So, let me give you the setting. So, let's start first with, in any case, I will. First, with, in any case, I will always consider maps from S1 to S1 and look at maps in some sober spaces. Let's start with the classical setting of W1P. So if you look at W1P, maps are continuous, or more precisely as a continuous representative. So we can decompose the space according to the The space according to the degree of the maps. So, right, the space is a union of disjoint classes E D, where E D contains all the maps whose degree is D. Okay, now you can do it actually also for fractional spaces, W S P, as long as S P is greater than one. Then MEPs are continuous and it is the same thing. But if you go. thing but if you go down so w1pp is critical in the sense that one p times p equals one maps that are not necessarily continuous for p greater than one of course p equals one is special then you find yourself here because maps are continuous uh so maps are not necessarily continuous so it's not clear whether you have a degree however by the v mode By the VMO degree theory developed by Brasice and Inberg, following works of some other people, there is a notion of VMO degree. So we can still do the same thing and decompose the space according to the degree. Now, in the previous talk of Shikora, a special case was in this A special case was in this setting was find the map of minimal energy in each class E D, and he told us that it's not known actually in many cases it's not known whether a minimizer exists. We are not interested in this question, but rather with another question, which is the distance between different classes. So you consider D1 difference in D2, and you consider Difference than B2. And you consider the distance between the two classes. And of course, it's the minimal distance between any map from the first class to a map from the second class using the actually W1P semi-norm. So it's the LP norm of the difference of the derivative. And the first And the first time that this problem was considered, it was with the joint work of Kobe Rubenschen and myself. And in the classical setting, we were able to explicitly compute the distance. It turns out it's a constant times the difference of degrees, the difference between the degrees and the constants, you have an explicit expression for it. And one of the conclusions from this formula is that you have a you such that whenever you take two maps, U and V, such that the difference between them is less than Cp, they have the same degree. So it's you are studying continuity for. Continuity for maps with integer values. So it's a very simple notation notion. And the question is: this is actually uniform continuity for this map that sends you from you to its degree. And I claim this is true. Why? Because you just take the CP from the previous. Previous slides. So, since the distance is Cp between the classes is Cp times the difference of the degrees, so if you have two maps for which the distance is less than this constant, they must have the same degree. If you go even earlier in time and look at even a more basic notion, when you look Basic notion when you look at the in the in the space of continuous maps and you just use the L infinity distance, we know that if the distance is equal to two, sorry, if the degrees are different, then the distance, the L infinity distance between the maps must be equal to two because you must have two antipodic a point where two antipodic. A point where two antipodic values are achieved, and then you get two. And this tells you also that this uniform continuity. So if the distance is less than, L infinity norm is less than two, the degrees must be the same. So we can say now that the degree is uniform continuous in both cases, either in these sobular spaces. Either in these sobular spaces or in even the more classical class of continuous maps. Now let's ask the same question in this functional limiting case, W1PP, when maps, the maps of samples are not continuous, as we know. But we have a notion of degree, and we have, and so we consider a And so we consider now the distance in this space between different classes. Again, it's the infinite of the distance between any two maps according to this W and P seminorm. Maybe I write it here. So for a map F, this is the expression to the power P of this of its norm or semi-norm. And you just plug. know and you just plug u minus v instead of f in this formula and and there we have a surprise well i was surprised when i learned about it many years ago from the work of positions and jernberg which was a special case the distance between in the w1p seminal the distance between different classes is actually zero Different classes is actually zero. It's not positive, it's zero. So it was discovered in the work of Bosis and Nimberg. I think it was only for p equals two, but in more recent work of with Berzis-Mirsko, we just generalized the same idea to other values of p. What it actually tells you is that you can find two. You can find two sequences, one in the first class with the grid D1, another one with the grid D2, such the distance between the elements of these two sub-sequences goes to zero. This means that the degree is not uniformly continuous. It is continuous pointwise around the HMAT, but it's not uniformly continuous. Uniformly continuous. This is the point I made: that it's continuous at each point. So if you just take a sequence with the grid D that converges to U, then you will also have the grid D. But this is point-wise continuous that holds, while uniform continuity doesn't hold. Okay, so. Okay, so this seems to be a bad idea, a bad situation, but it's not the end of the story. When one looks at the particular sequences that are constructed in the proof, you notice, okay, so that satisfies this that the norms themselves go. That the norms themselves go to infinity, so it's unbounded sequences that allow you to find the limit, the distance going to zero. And Heinrasis, that unfortunately passed away about two months ago, was a really great mathematician and he had a vision. And he looked at this and he said, okay, so this doesn't work. Okay, so this doesn't work. Okay, there is a problem here, but there's no uniform continuity. But if we restrict ourselves to U and Vn that belong to some bounded set, maybe we can have uniform continuity on just on bounded sets? And the answer to this question is yes. And this is the result obtained. Obtained by Pet Omirnescu and myself. Tell you what I told you, but the precise formation is as follows. So you fix P, you fix some M. This will be essentially the bound for the norms. There exists a delta such that if you take two maps, one of them is less than M and the distance is less than delta, which means essentially that also the norm of V is bounded by M plus delta. M plus delta, then the degrees must be the same. Okay, so you have uniform continuity on bounded sets. Although most of the talk is in dimension N, A1, there is an analog question in dimension n when you consider maps from Sn to Sn, say for n greater than or equal to 2, and then the relevant space, solar space is. A space solar space is the WNP, P, which means you see the product is P, it's the critical case. It is not known whether this result of about uniform continuity on band set or we don't know how to prove it. We know the result only for P less than n plus one, but not for P bigger than N plus one. But I think it's one of the nicest open questions in this. Questions in this topic. Okay, now let's move to a second type of distance, and I will explain in a moment why I put it between ports. For the two settings we considered before, so classical sobular space and the limiting case of a functional space, we considered this with capital D. What is the difference? What is the difference that instead of taking inf inf, we take sup inf. See? So you look, what is the this expression inside, this is actually when you fix u, this is tell you what is the distance of u to the other class, to the class ED2. So you ask what is the worst case for this distance? What is the map, or essentially the map in ED2, ED1 that is badly approximate? Is badly approximated by maps in ED2. I think this expression might look familiar to you because it's related to the ASOS distance between two maps. In the definition of ASOS distance between two sets, you do this, but then you switch between them and you take the maximum. The problem is that, and this is the experimenting deport, it's not clear that this is symmetric, so it's not clear it's really a distance. Symmetric, so it's not clear, it's really a distance. In all cases where we know how to compute in this setting of classes of degrees, it turns out to be symmetric. It's not obvious, but it tends to be. So, we conjecture it's true in all cases, but we don't know it. Okay. And this is our remark: that we don't know whether this also. We don't know whether this holds. Let's say first what we do know. So if in W1P, if P is bigger than one, actually this is infinity. So it's not really interesting to, it's not relevant to this quantity is not very interesting. But if for p equals one, in the w11 case, it is finite and it can be computed. It can be computed, and this is the result of in joint with MUNESCO and Brazil. Let me just say, oh, I don't have time to consider proofs, but in order to prove the first result, we use a sequence that really oscillates in a very wild way. So, on any un that you take, that it's better. The UN that you take, that it's badly approximated in some sense, the UN that you want to take here. So it covers the whole circle in the image on any arc of legs one over n. It means that it's really going wild. And it turns out indeed that this gives you the infinity here. For the proof of two, there are two issues: the upper bound and the lower bound. The upper bound is rather classical in this setting. It's kind of the fact that for any F, you can change it a little bit in order to find if F is the grid D1 and you want to have a map of the grid D2, you can find such G satisfying this bound so the cost. Bound so the cost will be essentially 2 p 2 pi d 1 minus d 2. This is using bubble insertion, which is a non simple technique in this setting. The lower bound is more complicated. So what in order to find such u n that will give you the 2 pi d. That will give you the two pi d1 minus d2 that you need. You fix some u, whatever you want. You can take EID1 theta, the classical, the simplest map in this class. And what you do, you compose on it another map of degree one, a very special one, which is a zigzag function. So it So it goes from 0 to pi to 0 to pi. So the ends 0 goes to 0, 2 pi goes to 2 pi. But what is most important is that the t n prime, the tau n prime, sorry, it will be always big, either very positive n or very negative 2 minus n. But on a small interval, many intervals around n square intervals. n square intervals and this this is seems turns out to be it's not obvious to prove it but it it it gives you what you want so the limit of the distance between u n and the other class ed2 is the requested value 2 pi d2 minus d1 set coincide with what you get from the upper bound just to give you an idea of this how a Tau n. So this is the phase of Tn, which is a degree one map from S1 to S1. This is its phase when you look on it as a map from 0 to pi to 0 to pi. So essentially, it doesn't go too far from the identity map, from the map F theta theta, but here, here on this sub-interval, the derivative is L, and on this is 2 minus 8. n and on this is two minus n n two minus n and and so you have this zigzag constructions that tell us to be what you you need so this so recall so far this capital B distance in W1P if p is bigger than slightly bigger than one infinity if it one so it's w11 we computed it w11 we computed it is 2π absolute value of d2 minus d1 what happens in this functional space so this is a result of mine so it is it's actually computed so this is the but what is sigma so it's some function of d2 minus it's some function of d2 minus d1 sigma or sigma is the minimal energy sigma of d is the minimal energy of the class in the class e d so so it's actually in shikora lecture the issue was whether there is a minimizer realizing this minimal energy but we don't care about existence of minimizer just the quantity the quantity exists the minimal Exists, the minimal energy of a map of the grid D. And then you compute it for D2 minus D1, and this turns out to be the formula. If you want to know what is the order of magnitude of this quantity, so is there is a lower bound for it given by the degree due to Burgundy, Brazil, and Mironescu. So thanks to this, we So, thanks to this, we can actually get an estimate for the behavior of the distance between two classes when d2 and d1 say are big. So, it's of the order d2 minus d1 to the power 1p in both ends. So, this is the right, this is the order of magnitude of this quantity. Now, this is a general result for any p, but for p equals 2. For any p, but for p equals two, it's a special situation where you can use Fourier, etc. So you can state the result in a much more nicer way, I could say. Using Fourier, you can get expressions for both the degree and the w one half two, h one half, say. H1R say seminal. You see, they are very similar. The only difference that here you have four pi squared. In front of you have absolute value, while here you don't have absolute value. But of course, it gives you an inequality. I think this is an equality. It was mentioned also by Chicorin. You have this inequality, and actually, it's optimal because equality holds for z to the power d. So you get, so you know exactly. So you know exactly what is the minimal energy of a map of degree D. It's 4 pi square D, but you have to take square root because here it's all the square. So I think it's in the next formula. So you have a very explicit and simple expression for sigma of d for p equals 2. So in this case, we can write really the We can write really the result in a very clear way. So the distance for h1 half case is just 2 pi the difference of degrees to the power 1 half. Okay, now we are close to the end of the talk, but let's be in the last transparency just tell you what's going on for n greater than 1, for n greater or equal to 2. Than one for any great or equal to two, these are things we know, and there are things that are different, and there are things we don't know. So, first, um, maybe this is a surprise. Yeah, so you remember what was the W1P distance for S1 to S1. It was D2 minus D1 absolute value times some constant, strange constant. Here, you know, it's just a constant, it's independence of the degrees, it's just a positive constant. So, this is a just a positive constant so this result that i obtained with my former it was a master thesis actually sha-levy this is strange it looks surprising in the beginning but the extra dimension and allows you to use the this direction of the rotation to to to insert the degree there and you don't feel it really in the in the distance. In the distance. Another result, so this is, you remember the Brazil-Nirrenberry results that we extended for other values of p. So this works in the critical case for any dimension, the usual distance between two clusters is always zero. So this is the same thing. You have two sequences, and of course, they must blow up, but the distance between them goes to zero from different classes. Go to zero from different classes. And what about the other distance? So here we have only an upper bound. Probably it should be also the right behavior for the lower bound, but we don't have a proof for capital N greater than one. So for capital N equals one, this was my last result that I showed you. My last result that I showed you a moment ago, but for p greater than greater or equal to two, we don't know. As I said, upper bound known, lower bound is open. Okay, so thank you for your attention.
