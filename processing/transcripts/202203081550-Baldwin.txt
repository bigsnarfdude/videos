Okay, well, I'm sort of of the mind that we should all just go home and enjoy the afternoon, after Josh's masterclass there, now to give a talk. But since I'm standing up here and Lee's already introduced me, so I'll be talking about fixed points in Gavana phonology, and everything I'll say is join with Ying-Hu and Steven Subek. Apologies if you've seen this talk before. Okay, so a question that's received a lot of interest. A question that's received a lot of interest over the last couple decades has to do with what Kavanophthomology tells us about topology. And I think a big part of the fascination with this question is that it's not evident from the definition of Kavanophthomology in terms of planar link diagrams that it should really see anything about the topology of knot complements. And a version of this question asks which knot scavonophthalmology detects. So the first result along those lines, as Josh mentioned, is Kahnheimer and Ruthbus. Mentioned is Kahnheimer and Rufkus proof that Kavanophomology detects the unknown. Several years after that, it was shown that Kavanophomology detects the figure eight and the trepole knots. And we now know that Kavanophthomology also detects several links, whose components are one of these three kinds of knots. So the goal of the talk is to give a detailed sketch of a proof of a new detection result for Cavanophomology. And the starting point for that is actually not political. Point for that is actually not float homology. So by contrast, not phloed homology really sees in a much more transparent way the topology of the knot complement. So as Matt told us yesterday, not photomology detects, it's known to detect the genus. So this is due to Boyshbath and Sabel in 2005. In 2004. And knot fluorohomology also detects fibridiness. That is to say, whether the knot is fibrid. And so this is due to Gejini for genus 1 knots and Ni for general fibridna, 2006. And an immediate consequence of the genus and fibridness detection is that not fluoromic. Is that not flow homology? It detects the unknot, the trefoils, and the figure eight knot. And so this is where things stood in 2006, and it's been a long-standing open question since then, whether not flow hormonology detects any other knots. And in particular, does not flow hormonology detect the next simplest knot? You detect the next simplest knot, which is the 25 torus knot, also known as the sink foil knot. So it's always fun to see if I remember how to draw this. So T25 is, it's a genus 2 fibered, strongly quasi-positive knot. And what Or not. And what makes this question really difficult is: well, why does knot phlemology detect the unknot? Well, because it detects genus. Why does it detect the trophylum figure eight? Because these are the only two genus I fibrid knots. What makes this problem difficult is that there are actually infinitely many genus II fibrid knots. And even worse than that, there are infinitely many genus II fibered strongly quasi-positive knots with the same Alexander polynomial as T25. So what I'd like to talk about is some partial progress we made toward this question. And some of that is what I've written down here in the RMA. So we want to show that T25 is the only knot with its not photomology. But let's suppose that there is a knot K which is not T25. Which is not T25, whose not floor homology agrees with that of T25. So then, okay, a lot of things are true. This is a little bit hard to parse. What it says is there is a pseudo-Anosov, this stands for, five-braid beta, so that's this braid I've drawn here, with braid axis A, such that the knot K is the lift of A in the branch double cover of S3 along the braid closure. The braid closure. So one thing that implies is that the braid closure B is an unknot, since its branch double cover is the three-sphere. So this is some partial characterization of knots with the same knot flow homology as T25. They're lifts of axes like this in the branch double covers of such five braids. And one thing this shows is that the knot has to be doubly periodic. Has to be doubly periodic with quotient an unknown. And why is that? Well, B is an unknown, and so you can sort of isotope this picture a little bit so that B looks like the standard unknown. And you see A running through the standard unknown. And I've drawn it with a circle rather than a square to indicate that this is not necessarily braided. A is not necessarily braided with respect to B. Nevertheless, I can isotope this picture into this. And then it's Into this. And then it's easy to picture K diagrammatically. K is the lift of this not A in the branch double cover of B, right? And when you actually perform that lift, you just get this picture. And so here you see really transparently the double periodicity of the knot K. So this is some partial characterization of knots with the same knot flow homology as T25. Yeah. Yeah. Um okay. So what I want to say, what's sort of surprising is that we realized that even though this wasn't enough to answer the question about not flare detection, this was enough, this is enough, with a lot of other work, to show, to answer the Kibana. To show, to answer the Cabano detection, so what we proved is that Cabano phomology detects T25 over the two-element field. So there are a few things I could say about this. One is that For the other knots that Kavanaugh Mology is known to detect, so the unknown, the figure eight, and the trefoil, it's unknown, and it's really a famous question whether the Jones polynomial detects those knots. By contrast, the Jones polynomial is known not to detect T25. So the Jones polynomial of T25 is equal to the Jones polynomial of the not 10, 132. Okay. So the goal of the talk is. Okay. So the goal of the talk is, again, to give a detailed sketch of the proofs of both of these theorems. But before I do that, I have to point out some important and exciting recent work by Ethan Farber, Rayden Reynoso, and Lu Ya Wong. Um, I guess a couple weeks ago. I guess a couple weeks ago, if that, which uses theorem A and other partial results that go into the proof of that theorem to answer this question in the affirmative. So they actually prove that the answer is yes, non-philomology detects the sink foil. And that has a lot of other interesting consequences. In particular, they can improve this Cavanov detection results slightly. So they can show that. Results slightly. So they can show that it also detects T25 over the rational numbers, which is a stronger result a priori. Okay, so I won't say anything more about that. Well, maybe I'll say that they use that theorem and things that go into it combined with a detailed analysis of train tracks and train track maps on the Genus 2 surface. And if you want to know more, Brayden's here, and I'm sure we'll be happy to tell you about it. All right. So. So, yeah, so I'm just going to try to jump into the proof of theorem A. So let's suppose that K satisfies the hypotheses of the theorem. So it's not equal to T25, but it's not fluorohomology, it's isomorphic. But its not-flow hormology is isomorphic to that of T25. So, since not-flow hormology detects genus and fiberedness, one thing that tells us immediately is that K is genus 2 and fibered, just like T25. Moreover, it tells us that K is also strongly quasi-positive. So more about that in a second. That's the first thing we know. And because K is fibered, we can encode the vibration and therefore the NOT K in terms of the corresponding open book. So we can encode the NOT K by recording the fiber of the vibration, S, I'll call it, so S is a cipher. It. So S is a Ceifert surface. It's a compact genus 2 surface with boundary, a middle genus Ceifert surface for K, together with the monodromy, H of the vibration. So H is a diffeomorphism of S, which it restricts to the identity on the boundary of S. So together, this data includes the vibration and therefore the NOT. And this is what's called an open book. And you might know that open books And you might know that open books correspond with contact structures on three manifolds. And the fact that k is strongly quasi-positive is equivalent to the statement that this is an open book for not just any context structure on the three sphere, but the type context structure. Okay. And so the goal So, the goal is really to try and understand as best we can things about the monodrome EH of the fibrin. So, remember we're assuming that K is not actually the torus knot T25. Well, we know it's Alexander polynomial because we know it's not phlemology. And so you can actually show that it's not any other torus knot as well. Yeah. I'm a bit confused about something, about the content structure. So in Genuswan, there is this phenomenon that we have the right-handed and the left-handed tri-for you, which support one the tied control structure and the other one and another physical control structure. And they have, I mean, unless you go into the mass of the Go into the muscle brain, they have the same flavor knowledge. Yeah. This phenomenon doesn't happen for the T25 now. No, it does. Yeah, I mean, I'm assuming that these groups are isomorphic as bi-graded amelian groups. Oh, okay. Yeah. If you ignored the Mausla grading, then you'd know that it's either strongly quasi-positive or it's mirror or strongly quasi-positive. Okay. Okay. So King is not a Taurus nod at all. Okay, so K is not a torus knot at all. So by Thurston's classification, it has to be either a satellite knot or a hyperbolic knot. And an Alexander polynomial argument can be used to show that it can't be a satellite knot. So in fact, what we know is that K is hyperbolic. So then another result of Thurston tells us that the monodroming Monodromy, if k is hyperbolic, so its complement has a hyperbolic structure. Well, its complement is the mapping torus of H, and Thurston tells us in that case that the monodromy H is of a special type, namely it's freely isotopic to a pseudo-anophilic. To a pseudo-ANASAV map. To a pseudo-ANASAV homeomorphism. I'll call it psi of S. So what is this of Pseudo-Anasov map? Well, you might be familiar with the Nielsen-Thurston classification of surface homeomorphisms, which tells you that a homeomorphism of a surface is freely isolated. Of the surface is freely isotopic to one that's either periodic, meaning that some power of it is the identity, or reducible, meaning that it fixes some multi-curve on the surface, or one that's pseudo-Nosov. So we know that this map is not periodic or reducible, but there's a more intrinsic definition of pseudo-Nosov maps, namely pseudo-Nosov maps are those which fix a special pair Special pair of transverse singular measured foliations on the surface. So let me tell you a bit about that. So, i.e., psi fixes two transverse singular foliations of S Meeting, and these foliations, the leaves of the foliations meet the boundary of S in some number, n greater than or equal to 1, of what are called prongs. So, let me try to draw a picture of what these invariant foliations look like near the boundary. So, this circle, so S. So this circle, so S, this is S. This circle is meant to represent the boundary of S. And let me draw the case N equals 3. So this is one of the two singular foliations fixed by psi. And here's the other in blue, which is transverse to the foliation. Which is transverse to the foliation in orange. So here I've drawn an example of what these foliations look like in the case that each has n equals three prongs on the boundary. And, well, they have interior singularities too, and the interior singularities are modeled also by prongs. So in the interior So in the interior, you have these pronged singularities, and they look basically the same. Might be too small for the people on Zoom to see. But in the interior, the singularities must have at least three prongs. On the boundary, they're allowed to have as little as few as one. In the interior, they must have at least three. And I said, but I didn't write, that these foliations are equipped. But I didn't write that these foliations are equipped with measures, and the Sudanosov map expands the measure on one of the foliations by some constant factor, and contracts the measure on the other by the same constant factor. So that's what these things look like locally. Okay. Now we said that not K is strongly quasi-positive, and we said that means that. In it, and we said that means that this is an open book for the Thai context structure. And so the tightness actually helps us out. The tightness tells us that n, the number of boundary prongs, is actually greater than or equal to 2. And I think maybe I'll skip the explanation of that. I think maybe I'll skip the explanation of that for now, but I'm happy to explain it to anyone after the talk. And that in itself tells us something nice. What that tells us is that we can cap off S, this genus 2 surface with one boundary component. We can cap it off to To a closed genus 2 surface. I'll call it S hat. And we can extend this pseudo-ino-submap psi to a pseudo-ino-submapi hat of So I have a disclosed genus2 surface. And so what's the point there? So the idea is that we're going to, you know, here's a picture of S. We're going to cap off the boundary with a disc, get this closed surface S hat. And because there are at least two prongs on the boundary, what we can do is we can. What we can do is we can ex on each for each of the foliations, we can extend these prongs over the disk so as to get foliations with, well, when n equals 2, a regular point, and when n equals 3, a 3 prong, or n equals bigger than 3, you know, a singularity with greater than or equal to 3 prongs, which is an allowable singular. Prongs, which is an allowable singularity for the pseudo-Nasov map in the interior of the surface. And that's what tells us that we can, by capping off, we can extend psi to a pseudo-Nasov map of the closed Genus2 surface. If there were only one prong on the boundary, things could go horribly awry. When we cap off, the resulting map doesn't even have to be Sudar-Nasov. Nielsen-Thurston type could completely change. So, this is going to be an important but subtle point in a little bit. And the other thing that I want to point out is that when we cap off the surface and extend the map, we get this point, P in the middle of the capping off disk, which is now fixed by the map psi-hat. Psi hat. So this map psi hat has a fixed point at this point P in the middle of the capping off disk. Okay, so we've already learned a decent amount about the monogamy of our vibrant knot. To get more information about For more information about psi, we are going to use our relationship between Hagar floor homology and the symplectic floor homology of surface diffeomorphisms, which has been sitting there for a long time, but has been sort of underexploited, basically unexploited for the last 10 years or so. So the result that we'll use is a combination of the results. Is a combination of results due to Lee Taubs and Kootlihan Lee Taubs, which says the following. So suppose sigma is a closed surface of genus greater than or equal to three. Greater than or equal to 3. And let's suppose that we have some diffeomorphism of the surface. Okay, to a surface diffeomorphism, we can associate its mapping torus. So let me denote its mapping torus by m phi. And the theorem is a relationship between the Hagard flow homology of this closed 3-manifold, the HF plus of the mapping torus, and we'll consider a particular expensive sum end of the Hagar flow homology. So the sort of top, the next to top non-zero sum end. And what the theorem says is that this Hagar flow homology group is isomorphic to the so-called sum. To the so-called symplectic floor homology of this surface diffeomorphism. And I don't want to say too much about what symplectic floor homology is, but roughly speaking, it's the homology of a chain complex where the chain complex is generated by fixed points of, well, some representative of phi. So, roughly speaking, at least it's the homology of a chain complex generated by Complex generated by fixed points of this map. So this relates the floor homology of the mapping torus to something about the dynamics of this surface diffimorphism. So we'd like to apply this to the situation at hand to better understand fixed points of these maps. So one obvious Maps. So, one obvious thing to look at is this map C hat, since that's the homeomorphism of a closed genus II surface. We can look at its mapping torus. That mapping torus is the same topologically as just zero surgery on K. The problem is that surface has genus 2, and for various monotonicity reasons, this theorem applies in genus 3 or bigger. That's not such an issue. One can use a trick, which is Use the trick, which is to instead of considering this mapping torus, which is zero surgery on the map K, let's consider instead zero surgery. There are many ways of doing this, but we looked at zero surgery on the connected sum of k with its mirror. And the point there, it's a nice exercise. You can convince yourself that this That this zero surgery is the mapping torus of a map we get by gluing one copy of S to its reverse, where the homeomorphism is given by just the monodromy H on one side and well the induced map, we'll call it H on the one side. Well, the induced map, we'll call it H bar on the other. Okay? And this is a genus 4 surface, and now we can apply this theorem. And so it turns out, so we know that the floor homology of zero surgery on K connected some connected sun with K bar, and the next to stop spin C sub n is supposed to record the symplectic floor homology of H union H bar. Homology of H union H bar by this theorem. On the other hand, the not-floor homology of K is simple enough that it's all we need to actually compute this group. And by the zero surgery formula, if you want, or even simpler things. And in particular, what happens is that this group is isomorphic to the group you'd get if k were actually T25, and that turns out to just be zero. So this tells us. So, this tells us that the symplectic flow homology of this reducible homeomorphism of this genus for a surface is trivial. And now there's this really nice paper of Andy Cotton Clay from 13 or 14 years ago. Enclave from 13 or 14 years ago, which gives a very concrete way of computing the symplectic floor homology of any mapping class. Basically, you can find some sort of standard representative of the mapping class, which has the property that the symplectic floor chain complex of that standard representative has trivial differential. So the symplectic floor homology is really, in that case, just generated. In that case, just generated by the fixed points of the standard representative of the mapping class. And so, when you look carefully at that, you can use that in conjunction with this flooromology calculation to show that the pseudo-Nasov map psi has no fixed points. Okay. And I should point out that like a week after we wrote this paper or posted this paper, Yeni realized that a similar argument could be used to show that for an arbitrary fibered knot, the next to top term in knot phlemology provides a lower bound on the number of fixed points of some standard representative. And Gigini and Spano. Gigini and Spano also proved that independently. And I mean, they actually, you know, I think knew, understood how to do a lot of this several years ago, but recently wrote it up. So, so we've learned that this pseudonyms of representative psi has no fixed points. And, well, that implies that. Well, that implies that the Kaptoff map, psi-hat, right, we know that it has this one fixed point at the middle of the disk. And so this implies that that's the unique fixed point. Oh, psych. So we've learned a good deal about the dynamics of the The canonical representative of the monodromy of K. And the question is what to do from here. And so at some point, we realized that this could be used. The fact that psi-hat has a unique fixed point can be used to say something rather special about the monitoring VH. John? Yes. John? Yes. I have a. I realized I wasn't paying too much attention, but why are you doubling your S? Well, I mean, just because this theorem sort of naively works when genus is greater than or equal to 3 and our surface has genus 2. I mean, you don't have to double it. You could cap it off in another way. For example, I could. Okay, so if you wanted to use the Gijini spinal strategy, then you can just stay on this. If you want to use the Gijini spinal, If you wanted to use the Gagini spot on strategy, you can stay on S. That wasn't written up when we were trying to prove this. So we found a way of basically proving, I think, well, that result without having to do what they did. Yeah. I mean, but would it be harder to see from that perspective? I mean, somehow the fact that you're doubling the triviality, I mean, you wouldn't have triviality for the for the capped off. Or they're capped off for the zero surgery on the lower cancer surface. I think, so what they prove is that what they prove in this case is that the fact that the not-flow homology has rank one in the next top grading implies essentially this. Yeah, so somehow, that there's some like sort of harder, I mean, some hard stuff to do kind of near the boundary, I guess, with that data issue. But they do the work for you, I suppose, in what you're saying. But it's still essentially copyright naming. It's not so hard. Yeah, I think that's not so hard. I mean, there's something harder that they're doing, right? They're trying to prove this relative ECH, not floor isomorphism, and that isn't done yet. And I think that's a little bit harder, the analysis of things near the boundary, if I understood what Pavel's told me. I mean, there are actually some other advantages of this approach, I think, which Which I have other applications that I won't talk about today, but if you come to my iCERN talk in April, I'll tell you. But yeah, for this result, one could use Gejini and Spano. That just wasn't around at the time. All right, so what can you do with this knowledge that psi-hat has a unique fixed point? So recall that the mapping class group of the closed genus. The mapping class group of the closed genus II surface is rather special in that it has non-trivial center. The center is generated by the so-called hyperliptic involution of the surface. So, you know, maybe more concretely, there exists an involution, this hyperliptic involution, which I'll call tau hat, of the closed genus II surface, which commutes up to isotopy with every other homeomorphism. With every other homeomorphism of the closed surface. And pseudonyms of representatives of a mapping class are fairly rigid in a precise sense. And you can use that rigidity to show that actually there's a representative of this involution which commutes on the nose with this pseudonym submap sci-hat. Pseudonaut submap, psi hat. Okay. And then how does that help? Well, let's consider what this involution does to the fixed point P. So tau hat of P, well, P is the same thing as psi hat of P, right? And then commutativity tells you this is the same as psi hat of tau hat of p. And so if I look at the left and right, what I see is that. Left and right, what I see is that psi-hat fixes tau hat of P. But we've shown that psi hat has a unique fixed point, right? P. And so this implies that tau hat of p is equal to p. So tau hat fixes p. So let me draw the picture of what's going on then. Here's the genus, the closed genus to surface S. You can think of tau ha as being the involution of the surface which rotates it 180 degrees around this axis. And we know this fixes p, so this axis. Fixes P, so this axis punctures the surface at P, along with several other points. And so what you can do then is you can look at the punctured surface and the induced involution on that. The punctured surface is essentially just the same as the surface S, the original fibrous surface. We have this induced evolution, which I'll call tau on S. And here, you know, tau hat, we said, commutes with psi hat. Well, the induced evolution on the punctured surface is going to commute On the punctured surface is going to commute with the induced map on the punctured surface, which is essentially just H. So here we have that tau mutes with H, the monodrome of the fiber not. And this is very special because the mapping class of the genus II surface with one boundary component has trivial center. So you don't expect in general any monodomy to have. In general, any monodromy to have the property that it commutes with some involution of this form. This is something special about the monodromy H that we've deduced. Okay, well, since H commutes with the involution, well, what I can do is I can try to look at the quotient of S by this involution tau. And the quotient is just the quotient of this surface by the involution of tau is just a disk. Of tau is just the disk, and the quotient map is a branched double cover. The quotient map realizes the genus2 surface with one boundary component as the branched double cover of the disk branched along five points. And because h commutes with tau, h descends to a homeomorphism of Homeomorphism of the disc with five mark points. In other words, a fibrade. Okay? And so you can extend this branch double covering to a branch double covering of open books. The open book specified by SNH for S3 is now the branch double cover of the open book specified by this disk, which is an open book for S3, branched along the link that's swept out by this branch. The link that's swept out by this grid. Okay? And so in the theorem on the right, the binding of this open book, this unknot, is just what I'm calling A. It's the axis of the braid. And the lift of that is precisely the boundary, the binding of this open book, which is the not K. So that's the proof. So that's the proof that K is the lift of the braid axis A in the branch level cover of S3 along a five braid representative of the unknown. So that proves theorem one. Is that a breakdown for like T27 or is it breakdown for T27? Like I maybe I missed it, but was there a partner proof of the D2? Oh, where? Well, so okay. I mean, one crucial thing is that we're working with the genus2 service. We use the fact that, you know, the mapping class group of the genus closed genus2 service has non-trivial center. So that doesn't work in genus bigger than two. Yeah. That's why you can't go beyond with these methods. Okay. Maybe I'll, you know, we. Maybe I'll, you know, we actually say a lot more about the monodromy than what I've written here. So we actually tell you that there are exactly four boundary prongs, the fractional dangerous coefficient is 1/4, there are two interior three-pronged singularities which are swapped by the monodromy, and this extra data is part of what goes into Farbrainoso-Long's proof and analysis of train tracks that leads to either a theorem that not philomology attacks G25. But I mean, like everything up until this last step where you get the braid goes through for arbitrary tg lin, right? Yeah, that's right. That's right. And you know, Paolo, you know, when he was talking about the work with Wispano a while ago, already knew of and talked about the fact that L-space knots, their monodromies have have no fixed points. Okay. So I want to explain. So, I want to explain how to prove the Skovanov detection result from DRMA because I think it's independently interesting. Okay, so proof of theorem V. So let's suppose that the Kavanaugh homology of K over the two element field is isomorphic to the Kavanaugh homology of T25. Right. Then Then one can show using Nate Dahlin's spectral sequence relating to banohomology and not photomology that the not phlohomologies agree over Q. This is a result by myself. By myself, Levine, Lidman, I forgot Dallin, so he's out of order. And Rodmila Sazlanovich. And it's in this paper where we show that Gavanofomology detects the figure 8-0. So it turns out that you can actually do this whole thing without using Dalin spectral sequence. You can do it using the Instanton 4 machinery and chronometer spectral. Spectral signets. So Steven and I are writing that up and should post it soon as well. Anyway. Okay, so while the NFL homologies agree, and let's assume for a contradiction that k is not equal to T25. And so in this case, the conclusion of theorem one holds, or theorem A. And so we know that k is of this form. If the lift of a rate axis like this, it's doubly periodic with unautic quotient. And the problem is, you know, this doesn't help you that much because, well, there are infinitely many, you know, pseudonasov five-grade representatives of the unnot. Okay. So remember when I talked about this picture originally, I emphasized the point that A is not necessarily braided with respect to B. But the key insight, the key idea that we had was to try and show that in fact A is rated with respect to B. Alright, we know that B is braided with respect to A. Let's try to prove that A is braided with respect to B. Why did we want to do that? Well, we remembered that, you know, so if that's the case, then A and B are what are called mutually braided unknowns. And that's a very restricted class of links. So, how do we prove that A is rated? A is rated with respect to B. Well, one approach is to use a variant of Cavanohomology called annular Cavanohomology. So annular Cavanohomology is an invariant of links in the solid torus. And you can think of A here as a link in the solid torus, namely the solid torus complement of a neighborhood of B. And so to show that A is And so to show that A is braided with respect to B, it turns out that it's enough to prove that the annular Kavanaugh homology of this quotient not A in some top grading is one-dimensional. Let's say, is isomorphic to C. Let's say, is isomorphic to C, I guess with complex coefficients. So annular hubonophomology comes with an extra K grading or annular grading, which in each complete resolution roughly records the number of times circles wrap around the torus. So that's what this refers to. And this top here is meant to refer to the top grading in which annular Cavana phonology is non-zero. And actually, for a variety of reasons, we know that this is equal to grading. Variety of reasons, we know that this is equal to creating phi, essentially the linking number of A and B. And so this result is due to Ji and Zhang. And so yeah, they proved that if the annular Cavano homology in the top grading is one-dimensional, then A is a braid. And they did so using spectral sequences relating annular Cavano homology to versions of instant plan homology. So the converse of that doesn't necessarily hold though, right? It's only for the key infinity page where you have a characterization? Well, if it's braided, I mean, this definitely holds. Yeah. Okay. Oh. Oh, it does? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. This is an if and only if. Rated if and only if the top group is rank one. Okay. So we want to prove. We want to prove something about the annular Cabano homology of the quotient knot A. We know something, we're assuming something about the annular Cabano homology of the knot K, or the, sorry, the regular Cabano homology of the knot K. But it turns out that we can relate this two, the two. There's this beautiful work of Stauffergen and Melissa Jung, where they proved a Smith-like inequality. A Smith-like inequality. Relating the dimension over the two-element field of the Kavanaugh homology of a doubly periodic knot and the dimension of the Kavanaugh homology, the handial. The anti-leck of homology of its quotient. And the proof uses the Lipschitz-Sharkar Kavanov-stable homotopy type. The rough idea is that if this not K is doubly periodic, the involution induces some kind of involution on the Kvanov homotopy type of K. The fixed point set of that involution is like the annular Kvanov homotopy type of A. And so Smith theory. And so Smith theory just gives you this inequality of dimensions. And we're assuming that the Guan homology of k agrees with that of T25. So in particular, we know that this dimension is equal to 10. So 10 is an upper bound for the dimension, the total dimension of the angular Devonoff homology of A. And well, by the universal coefficient theorem, this tells us that the dimension over the complex numbers of Over the complex numbers of the angular Kobano homology of A is less than or equal to 10 as well. Okay. So we know something about the dimension of the total annular covatophology. We're trying to understand the dimension of the top group. So here's where we think about other tools in covonophomology and pull out something that's sort of orthogonal to this one. And this is this result of Grigsby Verley Locata. Grigsby Verley Licata, who showed that there is a natural action of SL2C on annular chubonophomology. So there exists an SL2C action on the annular commono homology of any link in the solitaurus, in particular A. So this is Rigsby, Fairley, and Lakata, in which the SL2C weight space grading corresponds with the annular K grading in annular Gavana homology. And one thing this implies, and this is a sort of nice exercise, is that we have a So, the dimensions of annular Cavano homology and the different K-gradings are unimodal. So, first let me say that in this case, annular Cavano homology is supported in odd annular gradings. And the unimodality is the statement that as the K grading increases in absolute value, the dimensions of the annular groups. Dimensions of the annular groups stay the same or decrease. Okay. And so we're trying to prove that this is the top group, or at least this is five, right? When this is 5, right? And we're trying to prove that that's one-dimensional. And, well, we know it's non-zero. And what we see is that if it's more than one-dimensional, if it were two-dimensional, for example, then each of these would also have rank two, and the total Kavanaugh momology would have rank at least 12. But we know that it has rank less than or equal to 10. So that's what does it. So the dimension of the angular cobony homology of K and great. And grading 5 is 1, and that implies by G and John that A is braided with respect to B. Okay. So we've shown that A and B are mutually braided unknowns. And these things have been studied, were studied a while ago by people like Morton. Ago, by people like Morton. So since A and B are mutually radio non-knots, it turns out that tells you by Morton that beta has to be of a special form. So that tells us that beta Us that beta is a product of four generators, Berman co-lead generators, sigma ij, so this is Duna Morton. I'll tell you what these are. So, for example, let's look at Let's look at sigma, I don't know, 2, 4. Oops. Sigma 2, 4 is the braid, which is just a positive band between strands 2 and 4 of the braid. Okay? So Morton tells us that the braid beta is a product of four generators of this form. How many generators are there? Well, we're picking two strands. This five choose two, which is ten. Which is 10, right? We have four of them, so they're 10 to the fourth possible rays, just naively. We ask Sage to look at these. And what Sage tells us is that up to conjugation, only one is Sudhanasov whose left Whose lift, oh, or the lift of the axis has the right Alexander Ponamu. So then we look at this one grade and we just see that in this case, A and B are not mutually graded. Contradiction. Under proof. So I'll stop there. There are more questions for John? How did you check that they're not mutually breeded? Yeah. Let's see. So it turns out that so here's a nice little Little exercise. So if A and B mutually braided, then and you look at any power of beta and you look at its closure, then this has to be fibered. Fibered. So I can explain how to do that, but maybe, you know, it's kind of a fun exercise. And so we just look at this braid, we look at beta squared, look at its closure. The Alexander polynomial isn't monic. It's not fibrillate. That strong quasi-positivity just from looking at Tau. TAL? Well, yeah, so you can kind of understand. So, if you know the not photology looks like that of T25, so it has these five generators and Alexander gratings minus two, minus one, zero, one, two. Yeah, you can argue, and you know the Maslow gratings are as well. You can argue that the differentials have to look like this, just by grading considerations. And so tau is two. And so tau is two, and so if tau is the genus and you're fibered, then that's true if no, you're strongly positive, positive by Matt and Rudolph and other people. Questions on Zoom? To conclude that the monodrome is pseudonasov. Okay. And that just gives us this, you know, maybe that's not, you know, so actually this theorem, I could just, this theorem is true if I do this. Right, because T25 also has this property that it's the lift of rate axis and Rate axis and uh vibrate representatively on uh right. It's just vibrate. John? Yes. Can I ask a question? So from your sort of analysis leading up to theorem A, what can you say again about the monochromati? Yeah, okay, so. Yeah, okay, so um let me try it. Maybe. So each let me say this the pseudonyms of representative has four boundary prompts. And the fractional date is coefficient of h is 1/4. And the invariant, so there are two interior three-pronged singularities that are swapped. Swapped by side, because if they weren't swapped, then each of them would have to be a fixed point, right? So it would give you fixed points. And there are no regular fixed points. And did you did you guys actually do some sort of uh preliminary uh sort of analysis of uh period two orbits? Um no? Okay. Yeah, I mean, you know, there's sort of a very rather small finite list of prong structures and singularity structures. Structures and singularity structures. Like, there's only like, you know, maybe four strata, something like that. And some you can rule out by Alexander polynomial considerations, some you can rule out by fixed point considerations. And that's basically how you get this. And I mean, I said that, you know, the tightness allowed us to conclude that there was more than one boundary prompt. And the reason for that is because, let's say there's only one boundary prong. Well, kindness implies that the monogramy is right-veering. That the monogramy is right-veering. And so if there's one boundary prong and you know that it's right-veering, then the fractional dangerous coefficient is bigger than or equal to 1. But then it's not S3. That was that. I mean, it'd be interesting to know whether the other terms in not flow homology can somehow inspection. Can somehow, in special cases perhaps, tell you things about fixed points of powers of the monogramy. I mean, I, you know, they're related to various periodic photomology groups that are not so amenable to calculations, the degree one part of periodic phloemology. Maybe there's something you could use them to say, which could potentially help detect other um T two N. I keep asking Paolo this in different ways in the same email thread. In different ways, in the same email thread. There is some kind of bound, right? For those, I mean like
