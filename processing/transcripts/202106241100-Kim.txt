Which fiber of the circle? Ah, okay. So let U be a harmonic map from a closed Riemannian dream manifold to the unit circle. So S1 is parametrized by the Parametrized by the angle. So d theta is just a natural one from there. And you pull back this d theta. So denote it by H. Then I want to choose an orthonormal frame on N such that forced two vectors are tangent to the Tangent to the fiber, the pre-image for a regular value of theta. And the third one is orthogonal to these pre-images. So just that's the gradient vector field divided by the norm of it. And R sub ij, it's just a sectional curvature of this three manifold. Of this three manifold spanned by EI and EJ. So it's important to know a sectional cover to study the geometry of a Riemannian manifold. And actually, if you know a sectional covature, then you know everything about the cover. Also for the pre-images, because it is a surface. Because it is a surface for a regular value, it's embedded or immersed or whatever in three manifold. We can measure the second fundamental form like that. So, this A is a second fundamental form of this fiber. Okay, and actually. And actually, you can write it down this second fundamental form as a normalized Hessian and restricted to the surface. This is a symmetric quadratic tensor. Then probably you learned this in a graduate course. So, because this surface is inside these three manifolds, there's induced. Manifold, there's an induced metric, and so you can measure the coverature, the sectional cover of this surface. So this is intrinsic coverature. So it's related to some curvature of the three manifold, and the correction term is coming from this second fundamental form. And if this surface is And if this surface is happen to be totally geodesic, then this second fundamental vanish, right? And there is another quantity, scalar curvature. So in three-dimensional case, just the scalar curvature of this three-manifold is just two times the sum of these possible sectional curvatures. Curvatures there are one, two direction, one three direction, two three directions, and you just sum it up. So the scalar curvature is some kind of average of this, the sectional coverage. So because it is an average, sometimes it's hard to tell. I mean, even though the sign is negative or positive, you know, some. Positive, some direction is negative and some direction is positive, some could be either negative and positive. So this scalar curvature is hard to deal with, actually. But today we'll talk about how to use this scalar curvature to attack some problems. And the rich curvature of E3E3 can be written out like this. Because this is a hypersurface, again, we can talk about mean coverature. It's just the trace of the second fundamental form, so H11 and H22. And the scalar cover of the surface is just the two times of this Gaussian coverage. Okay? So just remember this kind of basic stuff. This kind of basic stuff. And you can easily work out that which cover term E3E3 can be written out this form. And then using harmonicity of U, you can verify this and rewrite the rich of E3E3 using this scalar cover. Scalar cover of the surface, and mean cover, and second fundamental forms, and so on. And there's a famous Bachner identity, and because this U is harmonic, a Bachner identity is like this. This is just a Laplacian. This is just a Laplacian. Laplacian of half of the square of the norm of the gradient vector field can be written out this way. Okay. There's a rich of this EU, DU, and the square of the norm of the Hessian things. Then Stern, he related the scalar coverage of the three manifold. To the average of the Euler number of these fibers. Okay. So this is a formula proved by Stern. And to prove this formula, you need all this kind of some simple calculations. So just so four paths. So 4π times the integral, integral of all these fibers along the circle. So for each point in the circle, if it is a regular point, the pre-image is a surface. So you can measure the Euler number of the surface and just integrate along the circle. The average of this Euler number. The average of this Euler number is greater than or equal to the something like integral of the scalar coverage of three manifolds and multiplied by the norm of this gradient vector field. So here you have to use some coare formula and then Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Gauss-Bonnet theorem. You see, two times this scalar cover is just, you have some sectional coverage there, and you integrate along the surface, then you get a Euler numbers and so on. Okay, so this is the formula I'm going to use later. So why do I care about scalar coverage? I care about scalar covert today. As I told you, to know some geometry of a Riemannian manifold, it's important to know the sectional curvatures. So people generalize this concept to some geodesic metric spaces using comparison theorem, like ket minus one, what is ket minus one? One, what is ket minus one space? You draw a geodesic triangle and you compare corresponding triangle in H2 hyperbolic plane and compare. So if this triangle in the space is thin, then that is like delta thin. And so if you compare with the minus. If you compare with the minus one space, it is cat minus one. If you compare with the Euclidean space, it is called at zero space and so on. So it's a very successful story. Can we do the same thing for a scalar cover? And it's a little bit harder. So what Gromov suggested is that because scalar cover is an average Coverage an average of these sectional coverts, you have to look at all these possible different directions. Then, geometrically, you look at some polyhedron in three manifolds. You have a polyhedron, then you can kind of capture different directions along these phases. So he He suggested if we look at the polyhedron in three manifold, and if the 3-manifold has a non-negative scalar curvature, and the mean convex phase, mean convex phase mean, the mean cover long phases is non-negative. Then, if you look at the dihedral angle of this polyhedron, so you have a polyhedron. So, you have a polyhedron here, and you have a comparing polyhedron in Euclidean space. Then, all this dihedral angle cannot be everywhere smaller than those of the corresponding Euclidean polyhedra, unless they are isometric. So, it's a natural kind of question, right? So, for example, if you look at fear and if you draw Here, and if you draw a triangle there, it's a little bit fat. So the sum of these angles is strictly bigger than pi, right? So now instead of looking at triangle, you look at polyhedron and you have a comparison polyhedron Euclidean space, like zero comparison things. And you look at the angles, dihedral angles, then it should be. Then it should be somewhere, it should be kind of fatter than the polyhedron in Euclidean space. That was his question. And Li, I think he used free boundary minimal surface and so on to answer his question. Now, if you have a polyhedron, you can sort of If you have a polyhedron, you can sort of glue them along faces and you can make it into actually a cube, cube type things. So you can reduce some problem into the problem comparing the dihedral angles in cubes. So here Q3 is just topologically cube. So it's a diffeomorphic step. So, it's a diffeomorphic standard unit cube in R3. So, it has some metric on the cube. Then, Gromov he conjectured or asked question. People call it dihedral rigidity. Suppose the scalar curvature is positive and every phase is mean convex, mean curvature is positive, then dihedral angle. Dihedral angle, suppose all the dihedral angle is pi over two, right angle, then what can you expect? It should be a Euclidean cube, isometric to Euclidean cube up to scaling. So that was his question. And we can sort of answer this thing using this scalar cover thing. This is a work with the Chai. This is a work with the chi. And for simplicity, I'll assume the metric is like C to the two alpha, okay? Because you have to deal with like partial differential equations and worry about the existence of solutions and so on. So because this is a topology seminar, what is going on? Suppose N is a green manifold with n is a three manifold with a boundary and a non-trivial second homology. Then by Poincaré left set duality, this is isomorphic. Second homology is the first relative homology. And this is equal to the homotopy classes of maps from three manifold to the circle. Uh, three manifold to the circle tending the boundary to a point. Okay, so if you, because this is non-zero by the assumption, if you give me an element here, then it corresponds to a map from three manifold to the circle, sending a boundary to a point. And what you want to do is that you sort of minimize the energy and you find some kind of hard. You find some kind of harmonic map among these homotopy classes, and then you carry on some theory. And in our case, actually, for cube case, so there are two kinds of boundary here we are considering. We have a top and bottom faces, and then four vertical faces F. Vertical faces app. So, this is again Brancarel appsets dualery, and this is actually a Z. This is generated by just, you know, this, what is rectangle something? So it is generated by the map from cube to the circle and the pre-image is just rectangles. And because if we take a harmonic map, the energy minimizing harmonic map, then this is the condition by given by a harmonic map. And P and B should And T and B should be mapped to a point in the circle. And actually, this is a mixed boundary condition. Top and bottom, this is a Dirioid condition. And along the side faces, this is a Neumann condition. And you can argue that minimizing energy minimizing harmony might exist as usual in this case using someone else. Using some analysis. Then you sort of apply some Stern's idea and tricks. And finally, one can obtain this inequality. One can obtain this inequality. So there is a normal square of Hessian, and there is a scalar cover terms. Scalar cover terms, and there is a mean coverture. In Stern's formula, there was a little bit different, but the similar spirit. And you can, by the assumption of all these things, scalar curvature is non-narrative, and so on, so on, we can prove this inequality. Then here. Then here the integrand everything is positive by assumption and it's less than equal to zero. So everything must vanish. Hessian must vanish, scalar cover must vanish, and mean coverture must vanish, right? This is all positive by assumption. And the integral of the positive function is less than. Function with less than or equal to zero, what can you say? Everything should be zero. Then you take some regular level set. That will be a disk intersecting the vertical edges at right angles. And this map, this map is a localized symmetry. So you take a level set cross interval and you send the And you send it into the cube, and you sort of normalize the speed of this R direction by this gradient flow things. Because Hessian is zero, so Hessian is d du. That means this gradient vector field is kind of a constant. Gradient vector Gradient vector field d du is zero. So du is dual to the gradient vector field. So du zero means if you have this s then this vertical direction gradient vector field that they are constant along this so this is a total So this is a totally geodesic actually. S is a totally geodesic. It's just a product of structure. So you just move this level set with a constant speed. So this map is a localized symmetry, and this level set S is totally geodesic. Then, because it's totally geodesic. Then, because it's totally zero, this then the second fundamental form will vanish, right? All this HI is a zero. Then, what is the curvature of this S? This is just a Gauss equation. So everything is a zero here. So sectional curvature of one, two directions survive. But because this is a product, the surface. Product, the surface cross real, the other scalar cover, the other sectional cover of the three manifold vanish also. So, oh no, no, no, this is the one, three, two, three. I'm sorry, R1, three, and two, three, they all vanish. Okay, so that is R12 is just equal to equal to scalar curvature divided by two. But scalar curvature is a zero. That means this level surface is just flat. So we proved a Q is the level set cross the real line and this cross section, the level set itself is also flat. So that is just But that is just Euclidean cube. So if you have to scaling the metric, you show under the assumption, this cube must be isometric to the Euclidean cube. Okay, so this is just one sort of way of understanding the geometry of a manifold. A manifold using a scalar curvature. So the next topic is about maybe there's some more application to a dream manifold. Yes. Sorry, I have a question. Just sort of the philosophy, if I understand, I mean, my geometry is a little shaky, but is Geometry is a little shaky, but it seems like your harmonic map to S1 helps you pick out the sort of locally Euclidean structure. Is that the right picture? Sort of, because you're sort of getting these cubes sort of locally, and they're kind of coming from the harmonic map. Is that right, or is this completely wrong? So you, you, you've you. You you there is a projection map, right? Naturally, topologically, you have a cube mapping into the unit interval. And so you have just a height map. Actually, zero and one is kind of glued together. There is a natural height map. And then you choose a harmonic representative of this projection map because the metric here in Because the metric here in Q is we don't know what kind of metric is. So this projection map may not be harmonic. So, but the theory tells you there's always a harmonic map within a homotopy class. Using this harmonic map, you prove this inequality, this inequality. Then, Then this inequality tells you Hessian, scalar cover, mean cover, everything vanish. That gives you that this cube, topological cube, should be Euclidean cube metrically. So that's just, yeah, it's globally, that's what's going on. Kind of start with a projection map, but then you sort of change the. map but then you sort of change the the yeah then you you find a harmonic map and then you find the this equations these inequalities using harmonic maps okay thanks yeah the next topic is about high public three manifold because Thurston he conjectured Often he conjectured around late 70s or early 80s, I do not know. Any finite volume high public tree manifold has a virtual cover, which fibers over circle. Sounds very dubious, actually. When I was a student, he was giving a lecture about this. And so many people doubted it couldn't be. Typically double-caden couldn't be possible. How could it be possible? Every high-power three manifold covered by this wivering of a circle manifold, but it's solved. It's solved by Hegel or by his proved virtual Hawking conjecture and so on. But if you read their proof, But if you read their proofs, they use these cube complexes and geometric group theories and so on. And it's not clear how far you should go upward to get this fibring three manifold. So I was wondering, maybe there, I mean, I do not know how effective it is to give a lower bound. To give a lower bound, but maybe try to find some kind of a lower bound using a known kind of invariant of the three manifold. So, this is a small kind of gesture. I'm trying to sort of get some kind of information. It reminds you again: so, this is now a high public 3-manifold, okay? High public 3 manifold. Okay, hypothetically manifold, and you choose a harmonic map from some given some kind of a map within homotopy class, you find a harmonic map. Then there's a stone inequality like so here Rn R sub n is a scalar cover because the sectional cover is minor. Because the sectional coverage is minus one here, scalar coverage is just constant minus six every point. And if this is a regular point, then the pre-image is some kind of a surface, surface in three manifold. Then I just remind you because if you think about topology too much, you forget about Riemannian structure. Structure. Du is just a map from tangent bundle of n to the tangent bundle of the circle. So it should be written out like this. Du is this one. Then the norm of norm square of the du is given by this. So g i j is inverse matrix of this metric. Sub ij is a metric. is sub ij is a metric, super ij is the inverse metric. Okay, so this is the norm of the one form. And if I choose an orthonormal basis, then this gij is the chronic delta ij. So this inverse matrix is the same. So you can just write it down the normal. Down the norm of this D is actually equal to the norm of the gradient vector. Okay. So suppose I have a covering M phi, M phi is a finite cover, which fiber of a circle. Then you can say you have some fiber S and glue the And glue the S cross interval by some pseudo-Arasov map. Then this guy always admits a complete public metric by Thurston's geometric equations. And the fundamental group of this mapping plus is just a fundamental group of the surface. And you just add one more generator T. One more generator t, and the relation is given by like this. So immediately you can notice that the first homology of this fibring manifold is less than forced homology of this surface plus one, right? Because this just introduces more relations. Relations. And the phi is so in a cyclic, infinite cyclic cover of M phi, it's just a surface cross a real line. And this pseudo-analysis map phi acts like a translation. Okay, so you glow this side to the other, and that gives you this MP. And I will denote this thing as. This thing as a translation length, high public translation length of the okay. So here what I'm doing is this picture. Topological, this is an infinite cyclic cover, the surface curls real line. Action of a fees, this way you glue this thing to here. Then now. Then now, this is actually a high public three-manifold of infinite volume. Then I can measure a distance, minimum distance between these two side fibers. And I will denote it by a W. Actually, if I Actually, if I take a projection map, projection map from this fundamental domain to the unit circle, and this is a gradient vector field orthogonal to each fiber. And if you flow along this gradient vector field, so they are orthogonal always. Okay, so you just measure measure. So you just measure the length of this flow, this gradient flow, and you pick the shortest one, the shortest one. I will denote it by W. And W is called width of the fundamental domain. Then the axis, axis of this of phi might not be the this. The this gradient flow could be somewhere like this, and but if the w, the length of w is large enough, this thing and this thing is comparable if the diameter of the fiber is kind of this is the picture that I have in mind. So, again, I choose an orthonormal basis. On orthonormal basis, and E1, E2 tangent to the fiber, and E3 is just the normalized gradient vector field. Then along the gradient flow, starting from any point, and then you flow, then it will hit the other fiber. Then, if you look at the projection map along this. map along this gradient flow it is just a projection from zero to the the length of the gradient flow to the unit interval so the the norm of the du this one form is less than one over the length of the gradient flow okay so how do you measure the du so du e1 du e2 du e3 you plug in these three vectors also normal These three vectors, also normal vectors, and they take the sum of those. But E1, E2, they are tangent to the fiber, so the image is zero. Only E3 survive, but E3 direction is along this gradient flow. So the norm of the EU is less than one over the length of this gradient flow. And you choose the shortest gradient flow. Great than flow length. And now you choose the harmonic map. Okay, so we have originally again a projection map, but you choose a harmonic map, then the energy decrease, right? Energy decrease. And then the fiber here, the preimage, has a bigger genus than the surface S, right? It follows. It follows from this mapping torus. Like, you know, like Higgard genus, you can add a small kind of genus. So you cannot decrease. It could increase the genus. So the genus of the fiber of this harmonic map should be bigger than the genus of five. genus of fiber S. Then all this inequality, all this inequality gives you using this thing. So if you integrate one side, you get this four pi times for the projection. For the projection map, this is just Euler number of fiber. And this is a unicircle. So you get a 4π times Euler number of the surface. This is less than minus 4 pi times Euler number of the sigma theta, because sigma theta has a bigger genus. And then now you apply harmonic map to this. Harmonic map to this equation. I put minus here to reverse the inequality here. And now you apply the short inequality to this integral. Then short inequality gives you this things. And this thing. And we know the norm of the du is less than one of our W things. W is the width of the fundamental. Of their fundamental. So, what I'm saying is that Mphi mapping torus is a k-fold covering of the original hypolyde manifold M. The volume is naturally the K times the volume of the downstairs. Then, plugging in just here, you get this inequality. Okay, so it's just a two pi times with. 2 pi times width times absolute value of the Euler number of the fiber divided by a volume. So if the fiber is large, then you should go more, you should take more coverings. But this inequality kind of is mysterious. So oh, before that, for finite volume case with a cusp, one can truncate three manifolds along horospheres deeper and deeper. And then there's an inequality also given by Stern. There's some correction term here. But you can make the area of the cross section smaller and smaller by cutting a cross. Smaller by cutting a cost far deeper and deeper. So the second term also vanishes. So you can apply the same inequality actually for a finite volume case. You are wondering about what happens for the finite volume case. What I'm saying is that I want to replace this W by different kind of quantity of a three manifold. three manifold so if this w is large enough large enough uh the diameter the diameter so so this is the fundamental domain of the m phi then the diameter of this fundamental domain is less than w plus the diameter of the surface. Diameter of the surface, right? Obviously. Then, if the manifold has an injectivity radius lower bound, this fiber has a finite diameter delta, right? Because if you have a hypovalic surface with the inductivity lower bound, then the diameter Then the diameter of this hypobolic surface is bounded above by delta, depending on injected with the radius and the genus of the surface. So the diameter is less than W plus delta, the M phi, but the diameter of M is less than diameter of M phi. So you get this inequality, and I can replace W by I can replace W by the diameter minus some uniform constant here if there is an injectivity radius lower bound to the three manifold. But still, I want to replace this Euler number of the fiber. So how do you do that? You just define it. How do you define it? I define the genus of the I define the genus of the hypoplic three manifold as a minimum genus of incompressible immersed surfaces like this. Then such thing, you know, there are plenty of immersed incompressible surfaces due to Khan and Markovich. So this quantity is greater than or equal to Quantity is greater than or equal to two at least. There are all these, you know, so this is kind of, if you have M phi and fiber here, fiber into mapping to us and down to the manifold. This is an immersed, immersed, immersed, incompressible surface, right? Surface, right? So the genus of this fiber is bigger than the genus of the three manifold. So I can replace the, this was the Euler number of the fiber. And now I can replace the 2gn minus 2 by just introducing the genus of the hypothetical degree manifold. Okay. Okay, then it's hard to tell, probably hard to calculate given high public 3 manifold, what is the genus of the high public 3 manifold. I want to replace it by some known quantity. What's the battery number? It's just easy. You just introduce five genus of the hypoly manifold. This is a minimal genus. This is the minimal genus of a fiber in covering. Then, fiber genus of three manifold three manifold is always bigger than or equal to the genus of the three manifold. I wonder whether they are equal. I doubt. I think in most of the cases, you know, you have a kind of immersed incompressible surface. Can you always lift and embed it? And embedded and become a fiber, I doubt it. So I think this is, in most of the cases, a strict inequality, but this is just a question, when do they agree? So all these previous arguments go through using this fiber genus, right? But fiber genus is bigger than this one, as I told you, because the forced battery number of the The forced baryon of the mapping cross is less than the forced baryon number of the surface plus one, right? This is just aberrationization of the fundamental group. So you get a natural lower bound of the five, as you know, so hypothetically three manifold, and you can write it down the degree should be at least bigger than this kind of. Okay. And if this And if this you either you replace like the width of the fundamental domain by the diameter, or if you want to use the translation length of the this pseudo-analys of map, and if w is large enough, large enough, you can sort of multiply some constant c depending on genus and On genus and this W and injectivity radius. So C is less than one. But, you know, for a fibering three manifold, there are infinitely many different fibrings once the host battery number is larger than greater than or equal to two. So if you choose a different fibring, so the genus of the fiber. So, the genus of the five grows, I think, this width can actually go to zero, I think. Okay. So, I want to choose a minimum possible fiber. And then, in that case, if this is large enough, you can compare with the syscall. Okay, because this is a translation length of some hypovolt isometry. This is always. Symmetry. This is always bigger than the sister of the downstairs manifold. So you can plug in some different kinds of quantity here. So even hypothetical manifold, a volume, you can probably calculate the volume. I don't know, put it in snappy or somewhere that you give a volume, but it's hard to calculate the width. So maybe. So maybe if you know the width or diameter is big enough, diameter is big enough, you calculate the diameter. And probably you could calculate the first battery number or something. So this is just the oy kind of theorems that I'm working on. But I'll stop here. Okay, let's thank N Kang for his talk. Thank NKang for his talk. Are there any questions? I have a question. Is Gramov's conjecture true for any poly for any polyhedron in R3? Yeah, convex polyhedron. Yeah, so it's solved by Li for general polyhedron in three manifold with non-yeah, it is true for general polyhedron in three manifold. Thank you. I think so.
