 It is my pleasure to introduce my colleague, David El-Khai Benezra from University of California, San Diego. He will tell us about the congruence of group problem for automorphism groups. Thank you, Alireza. Thank you for inviting me to talk in the con in the Talk in the workshop and giving me the opportunity to wish Andr√© another fruitful mathematical decade. I will start with some introduction. So I will start with describing the classical congruence subgroup problem. And so let G be the general linear group over Z, all invertible matrices, n by n invertible matrices over Z. n by n vertiable matrices over z and consider the map from gln z to gln z mod m z yeah just the map that you get by projecting any entry from z mod m so gln z mod m z is a finite group so the kernel of the map is of finite index in g and the congruence subgroup problem asks whether um the opposite in some sense is In some sense, is also right. Does every finite index subgroup of G contain such a congruent subgroup for some M? In some sense, the question is whether every finite index subgroup of G L and Z comes from a finite index subgroup of Z. It was known already in the 90th century that for N equals B, the answer is no, and Gl2Z contains many finite. Z contains many finite index subgroups that do not come from congruence considerations. And quite surprisingly, in the 60s, it was approved by Manique and by Bas, Lazard, and SERT that for n bigger or equal to 3, the answer is yes. And this is surprising that somehow, when the dimension grows, things get better. Using the terminology of profinite groups, Of profinite groups, the problem can be reformulated as follows. Consider the map from the inverse limit of G mod U when U ranges over all finite index normal subgroups of G to the inverse limit of G mod G M when M ranges over all natural numbers. So depends on how you feel comfortable with these notions. It's obvious that we have such a map. It's obvious that we have such a map, a natural map, and it's not difficult to show that this map is injective if and only if GLNZ has an affirmative answer to the congruence subgroup problem. What do we have here? So in the left side, by definition, you have the profinite completion of GLNC. In the right side, you have Right side, you have each ingredient here is just a subgroup of J and Z model Z. So the whole thing, the whole inverse limit, is just a subgroup of the inverse limit here, which is equal to the general linear group of the inverse limit of Z mod in Z, which is just the general linear group of Z, the profinite completion of Z. So an equivalent way to ask the congruence subgroup problem is whether the congruence map from the profinite completion of the construction of the constant map from the profinite completion of Z of G L and Z to the general linear group of the profinite completion of Z injected. And this difficult, more difficult reformulation has the advantage that when the answer is no, we can ask more generally what is the congruence kernel. And this is kind of a tool, kind of a way to measure how far we are from having the congruence, how far having the congruence how far j and z for having from having the congruence subgroup property so just by what we wrote here by the result of many kn by slash dot denser we can say that the congruence scanner for n bigger or equal to 3 is trivial and later Alex and Melnikov and later Alex also proved that when n is equal to q the congruence kernel is isomorphic to a free profinite group on counter To a free profinite group on countable number of generators. So there is a big dichotomy between n equals 2 and n bigger or equal to 3. Now, let's say the next generalization of the problem was to replace G by a subgroup, let's say of G L and Z. You can replace G by a subgroup, and then you can, let's say, arithmetic subgroup, and then you can put here, you can define. You can define kernel, congruence subgroups, and then you can define the congruence map and congruence kernel. And you can ask how far this group from having the congruence sub-property. There are some people in the audience that can say much more than me in general and Andrei in particular. But today I would like to address a different generalization, which is due to the observation that JLNZ can be viewed. The j and z can be viewed as the automorphism group of z to the n. Having this observation, one can generalize the problem as follows. Let gamma be a finitely generated group. And the node for a finite index characteristic subgroup, which is a subgroup that is invariant under odomorphism gamma, the node by gm the kernel from ode gamma to ode gamma mod m. To odd gamma mod m. So again, odd gamma mod m is a finite group. So the kernel is of finite index in odd gamma. And then we can ask, does every finite index subgroup of old gamma contain GM for some m? And we can ask equivalently whether the congruence map from the profinite completion of old gamma to the automorphism group of the profinite completion of gamma injective. And then A conjective, and then, if the answer is no, then more generally we can ask what is the congruence canal of this map. And last thing in this slide is that we can already state, yeah, we already know what happens in the abelian case. In the abelian case, we already in this, let's say, regarding this notation, yeah, we can say that. We can say that the congruence kernel for z to the n when n is bigger or equal to 3 is trivial, and the congruence kernel for z square is just the free omega hat, the free profine group and countable number of generators. So we know what happens when the group is a billion. We have a description. What I would like to address today is to give a Address today is to give a kind of a survey of what happens in certain cases where the group is non-obel. So let's say that the chronological order would be to start from three groups because the first results, I would say, arise from three groups, then to talk about free metabolian groups. To talk about free metabelian groups, and then to talk about nilpotent groups. But I will follow a different order, which is more, I think, more methodological. I will start from nilpotent groups, then I will say a few words about three-metabelian groups, and as time permits, I will elaborate also a bit about free groups. So, let's start to describe, to give a description of what happens. Description of what happens for nilpotent groups. So let's gamma be finitely generated nilpotent group denote by gamma bar, the abilization of gamma and by gamma star denote factor out the torsion of gamma bar. So gamma star, gamma star is isomorphic to z to the d. Isomorphic to z to the d for some d. Now, so we have in some sense gamma star is just a, let's say, the biggest finitely generated abelian quotient of gamma. So we have a map from gamma to gamma star, and this map induces a map from the automorphism group of gamma to the automorphism group of gamma star. Now, I just said that gamma star is equal to the d, so I can replace. Star is z to the d. So I can replace this by the automorphism group of z to the d and as I said this can be viewed as just G L D Z. So we have a map from Od gamma to G L D Z so now we denote the image of Ode gamma in G L T Z by O star of gamma. This is just a subgroup of G L T Z and it's a nice result by Bryant and some other Told by Brian and some other co-authors that this group is always arithmetic for any finitely generated important group gamma. And you see in the slide that it's written if and only if. And the meaning is that he also proved that any arithmetic group of GLDZ can be obtained by taking a fine. By taking a finitely generated equal group gamma and taking its old star of gamma. So it's if and only if. And with this notation, I can describe in some sense in full way what happens in this case. This is the theorem. The theorem states here that the congruence kernel for odd gamma is canonically isomorphic to the congruence kernel from the profinite completion of the arithmetic group odd. The arithmetic group O star of gamma to G L D Z. In other words, the congruence scanner is canonically isomorphic to the congruence scanner of the aristocratic group O star of gamma. So it's the Nilipodian case is completely determined by the classical congruence subgroup problem for arithmetic groups. Now, how did we How did we obtain this result? This is what we have in the next slides. What is the idea of the proof? So, this is the theorem. And let me describe how we get it. So, we have old gamma that we are interested to know. And by definition, we have its rejective map to old star of gamma. Just the image of old gamma in G. Image of odd gamma in GLDC. And we denote, it's just a notation, we denote the kernel of the map by IA star of gamma. Next, now in the bottom we have old gamma hat hat. Now you remember that we have a map from gamma to gamma star. So this map induces a map from gamma hat to gamma star hat, which induces a map from old gamma hat to old gamma star. Gamma star hat. I remind you again that gamma star is isomorphic to Z to the D. So actually, we can replace this by the automorphism group of Z hat to the D, which is isomorphic to G L D Z hat. So we have a map from old gamma hat to G L D Z hat, and we denote the kernel by IA star of gamma hat. Moving to the profinite completion of the upper Of the upper row, we get the following commutative diagram. And what do we have in this diagram? So, this map is the congruence map. This map describes the congruence subgroup problem for old gamma. This map, the map here, is the congruent subgroup problem for the arithmetic group O star of gamma. And in some sense, there is a rich theory that describes what is going on. Theory that describes what is going on here. By the way, there are some, still some open problems there as well. So it remains to understand in some sense what is going on here. And the real theorem is that what is going on here is that the map is, this map is an isomorphism. After you get that this is an isomorphism, then by diagram casing, you get that actually this theorem is just a corollary of Of this theorem. How do we get that this map is an isomorphism? So in some sense, IA star of gamma is close to be a nilpotent group. The key here is that it's close to be a nilpotent arithmetic group. And what do I mean when I say close to be a nilpotent arithmetic group? So, So every finitely generated Newport group has a finite torsion subgroup. So after you factor it out, you get a finitely generated torsion-free report and group, which can be, it is known that it can be embedded in what called Maltzev completion, which can be Which can be identified, kind of identified with a Lie algebra. In this Lie algebra, you find a lattice that contains gamma, and when you take this lattice, then IA star of gamma is actually a new potent arithmetic rule. Then what happens is that this, I mean, we say that this is in general. I mean, we say that this is injective and surjective. So, to say that this is injective is just the congruent subgroup property for nilpotent arithmetic groups. And to say that this is injective is by the strong approximation for nilpotent arithmetic groups. So, this is basically the structure of the proof of this theorem. So, this is one thing. So, in some sense, we have a full description. So, in some sense, we have a full description of the nilipotent case. In the freemitable, already in the freemitabelian case, the situation changes. What do we have for free metabelian groups? Then, let's say that denote the free metabelian group by phi of n. This is by definition, it's just fn divided by the second derivative of fn. And here is a kind of a description of what is going on with pre-mutabelian groups. So for two generators, the situation is like in abelian cases, like abelian case and important case, the congruence kernel is anonically isomorphic to the congruence kernel for abelian groups. Already for n equals 3, the situation is different. Here, Is different. Here, the congruence kernel is very far from being trivial and it contains a free profinite group on countable number. And then, for, I mean, and to you, and to prove this, we used a theory that developed by Krunewald and Alex to produce arithmetic quotients of all differing. Then, what happens is that when What happens is that when n is bigger or equal to 4, something gets stabilized, and the congruence kernel is, we can say that the congruence kernel is a billion. We cannot say that it is, at least not now, we cannot say that it is not trivial, but at least we can say that there is a dichotomy. Yeah, so in the abelian case, we have a dichotomy between n equals 2 and n bigger or equal to 3. In the metabelian case, we have a dichotomy between n equals 2. Dichotomy between n equals 2 and 3 and n bigger or equal to 4. Here, for this theorem, to show this, I needed to use some heavy computations and some tools from algebraic theory, and the proof is quite long. I wouldn't like to go into details of the proofs. I would like to give you the intuition behind this picture, I would say. So here is a kind of a description about the intuition behind the proof behind the picture. So again, consider this exact sequence. We have a map from phi n to z to the n, which induces a map from the automorphism group of phi n to the automorphism group of z to the n. And the automorphism group of z to the n is GLNC. So we have a map from So we have a map from here to here. Again, the note the kernel by IA of phi n. In the bottom, we have something similar. The note, we have a map from the Auron Friesen group of phi hat to the N to G L in C hat, and again the node, the kernel by A of phi hat N. Moving to the profile. And moving to the profinite completion, there is a delicate issue that we might lose the intuitivity here. This is something interesting, what is going on here, but what do we get? So again, we are interested in this map. This map describes the congruence subgroup problem for Alt Phi N. This map, we know there is a dichotomy between n equals 2 and n bigger or equal to 3. So it remains in some sense to understand what is going. means in some sense to understand what is going on here. Here, there is a theorem that describes the group IA of phi n. What is this group? This group can be represented and can be viewed as a subgroup of G L N R N. When Rn is a Lorraine series on n variables over G, and this group is This group contains all the matrices in G L and Rn that satisfy this restriction that A times this vector x1 minus 1, x2 minus 1, etc., is equal to fix this vector. So this is the group. So if we compare it to Dabelian case, in Dabelian case, we deal with GL and Z, and in the metabelian case, we need to metabelian case we need to consider also IA phi n which is glnrn with a kind of a restriction and this restriction makes i n phi n behave like gl n minus 1 rn so if it behaves like gl n minus 1 rn then and let's say that in gl and rn the dichotomy is again between two Dichotomy is again between two and n bigger or equal to three, then this dichotomy makes Ia phi n have a dichotomy between n equals three and n bigger or equal to four. When you combine the dichotomy that you have here and the dichotomy that you have here, you get a dichotomy between n equals two and three and n bigger or equal to four. And this is basically the intuition. And this is basically the intuition behind the proof. The last thing that I would like, so I don't have that much time, so maybe I will just say a few words about what is going on in the free case. So, in the free case, and the main theorem that I would like to mention is a theorem. Like to mention is a theorem basically was proved that was basically proved by Asada in 2001, stating that the congruence kernel for F2 and the free group on two generators is trivial. Asada addressed this problem by viewing oltafan, which is isomorphic to Gl2Z, as the mapping. Is the mapping class group of the prunor torus? He used terminology of algebraic geometry. Then, so he basically attacked it from this point of view. Then in 2011, Pax Archov and Rapinchuk, they translated Asada's argument to the group theoretic language, so people like me can read it. And later, myself. And later, myself and Alex, we published and kind of, I would say, improvement. The idea is basically the same, but the proof is shorter and easier to follow. So, and another, I would say, maybe another two remarks. One remark is that there are other results of, I would say, similar flavor for more mapping class groups, but still the congruence subgroup problem for old F. For alt Fn for n bigger or equal to 3 and for mapping class groups of genus bigger or equal to 3 is are these problems are still unsettled. I mean, the situation changes and you don't have a good and easier description of an easy description of the automorphism group. And this makes this problem more difficult. So, I have another slide, but I had two minutes will not five. So, maybe I will maybe I will stop here and just thank you for the attention. Let's thank our speaker. Are there any questions or comments? Any questions or comments? I have a question, probably just a quick question. So you mentioned a new potent case and then also worked out the free metabelian case, but I'm wondering about something, let's say, simpler. What if you take, say, a Boreal subgroup of a reductive group? Group, is the converse subgroup problem solved for the S-arithematic subgroups of those guys? Can you ask it again? So is the congruence subgroup problem solved for s-arithemetic subgroups of boreal or more generally solvable subgroups of reductive groups? I don't know. I don't have a good answer. Okay. Thanks. Maybe other participants have a good answer. Yeah, I can say that, you know, in characteristic zero, the congruence of problem is always true for solvable groups. In characteristic P, there are some situations with really important groups. Situation with really important groups, but again it can be described what happens. But introducing zero, the answer is always yes. Okay. And is it the case that in positive characteristic, we can just exclude some primes and be done with it? It's not about primes, it's about, you know, for the important group, for the one-dimensional group. The answer is no. Ah, right. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay, thanks. More questions or comments? I have a question. So do you have any intuition or guesses about what happens for OTF and for n at least three? You know, the intuition is that when the dimension correlates. The dimension coral thing to get better, so it's already good in for n equals 2. Maybe that would be the intuition also for n bigger or equal to 3, but nothing very particular. Not more than that. So you don't have any specific approaches in mind how you could prove? Proof congress of the process I have a I have an idea how maybe one can approach, but not something that I really feel very comfortable that to say very specific, but something that I didn't check and I believe that might. That's answered. I think I didn't say that. Or questions or comments? If not, let's thank our speaker again. I want to also thank the organizers for all their effort, especially in these unprecedented times. Running a conference is not that easy. That busy. And I also want to say happy birthday to Andre. I want to thank him for all the things that I've learned from his mathematics, especially from his book. All my students should study his book. Yeah, so I think that's it.
