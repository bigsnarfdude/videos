How seven systems can be seen as teaching one of those goals and how that relates to torque generation. And today, I'm going to talk about the third main goal. Main goal is three is classified as much variable. Oh, I think five people And so there's three main parts of this construct so if you want to understand them you can list all examples Pi moving variants so this mechanism Invariants. So this can either mean defining invariants or computing them or your supplement variable. And construct supplemental systems. And the part where I think horse generation is discovery. I won't really be telling you about it, but secrets, but. Of course, there's a main problem with this. That's hard. That's a lot of fun, I guess. So, let me give you an example of what is known in this. Um, so let M be a C M and this is going to be a promo, or we can let M be a ruled surface. So what I mean by this is an oriented test two bundle. Over oriental space. So some sort of scene, and this is the line of walls. And there we have a really great seat. This is the same state. This is the same statement, but it puts it separate, right? So if omega 1, omega 2 are cohomologous sympathetic forms. This is the input thing for all the plus there's the plus 1. Yeah. Yeah, if the validation system is coming to the model. Oh, I'm sorry. And both in the pools are like big pools. Well, not real. In a way where there's just like no way it's expensive. I mean, I'm not that boat will ever do it, but it's not anything like the current technology. And even for all poor bands, it's just not good. There's some things going on about blow-ups of these guys, but beyond that, But beyond that, no, I mean, I need I wanted this to take things in this, not that. So, yep. I think that they're the one who needs to conveniently see. Right. So, what I said is they're cohomologous. I did not claim that they're isotopic. That's the theory that we can do. So, very isotopic seems to be. Right, right. So, how do you prove? Right, right. So how do you prove this? So I said this was hard, but there's an easy part. It's hard, hard, hard, hard, easy. And the easy part is you prove that there's a one parameter family of simplex forms and single volume. And these are supposed to be, that is a step here. And so it's although, in this case, it's, yeah, but they don't prove that this implectomorphism, they don't prove it as a health. Dusa has a theorem of deformation to isotopy, but there's some assumptions there. I'm not going to say too much about more about this as one sort of indication this is not for the demo. Okay, are there any questions about this? Okay. So, what now I'm going to claim is that targeted generations are going to be useful in answering this question. So, of course, we'll be looking at special cases. So, I would start out by introducing the notion of homological distinction, let us be a family. Let's have to expand marriage. Fix M and M prime in F. And obviously, if M and M prime are diffeomorphic, then the homology of M Of M is isomorphic to the cohomology of M. And I'll always be looking at isomorphism as greater grades. And you can question, does the fact that the internal chromologies are the same suppose that you know Are the same? Suppose ego homologies are the same. Does this imply that there is more? And of course, this is not true for all examples, obviously many counterexamples. But if so, F is co-homological function. Okay, so let me give an example. So oriented wood surfaces. Our surfaces are always orientable. Or cohomologically. And why is this true? Probably reflecting the something recognized. Is it okay for this to be fine? I'll try it first. Yeah, cool. Jokes made exactly. Okay, so why is this true? So, well, first of all, we have a deformation retract from dip S of the oriented difficulty of S2 to SO3. And then we have pi naught of SO3 is trivial. is trivial and I1 and SO3 is equal to C2. What this tells us is there's two S2 bundles oriented over sigma G. Right, so because pi naught is trivial, there's a unique way of building on a complementary point. And then if we do a little more point, we get an element of pi one. And you can check with the difference. Once you know that, you can compute your cohomology and you can just see they have different cohomology. Um I will say, picture I like a lot. So the simplest example, which we'll care about the most, is buckles over S2. So these are the two parts of those sentences, like the even and odd parts of the sentences. Other E2. No? Now I like this picture. In this case, you can also, if you want to see why the Hertzberg to the surface is diffeomorphic, so S2 plus S2, you can actually write it out into the order. You can actually write it out into the orbits very easily, which I think is very lovely. I always love maps in the orbit. SO3 is a bundle over S2 with turn class 2. So this is Hertzberg 2 surface. Map it to S2 plus S3. Matrix A and the vector B, equivalence class of the matrix A and the dis left. A under this map. And it's just the map, SO3 to S2. But this very explicitly. And the reason why this is cool is because you can see the other two torus. So there's obviously one two torus in S2 plus S2, right, which I rotate in several. But there's another one where one of, so one of the circles, one of the circles in cyclotics and both. is one of the circles is I rotate them both at the same speed. Whereas the other one is I fix a point on my first S2 and if I rotate the other S2 around my XS2. That's cool. And as a graduate student, somehow it's kind of blew my mind. I was like, ah, that's crazy, but this works in play with it. So that was by discipline of the other mistresses. Because why does it run at the other mistress? Oh. Is it easy to do four or six or seven? I can't draw pictures of that. No, but you guys got it. I don't. I don't. Okay. Um, okay. So, great. So So what we're going to look at, we're going to look at, of course, not all manifolds, but a special family. And the family I want to look at is the family of smooth torque manifolds. Sorry, smooth torque varieties is what I should say. Or if you like symplectic torque manifolds without the symplectic form. And the question And our symplectic toric, not symplectic, are smooth or varieties homologically based. So in some sense, this is a very strong request, right? Because colon does not have that much information, and there's a lot of smooth torque deliverance. And so an example what to give you of a smooth torque. So this is a question purely topological, without words in black. Right. No smooth math. I'm asking if it's smooth category, you can also ask it like a... Smooth category, you can also ask anything with this category. We're on time bot manifolds and the other people talked about these under possibly other names. So let x1 to 1 to be a very holomorphic line bundle L over xn minus 1, so I'm defining it inductively. find an inductive way for me. Xm is vectorization of L plus C is one bundle over. Have you seen these before? The rated towers of two spheres. So I and Masona proved And Ms. Soda proved that what worked on proving these are simple acted home allowed to be visited and proved it in some case, which I'll explain. So this is the theorem on Troy Suda. Let X, X prime be bot nanopolds, but I need to put on an additional restriction. I need the rational cohomology to be trivial. Again, not the total cohomology, this is the rational cohomology. Trivial in the sense of being the same as just implied that. This implies that M and M prime are digeomorphic if and only if their integral homologs. So this should be done. What ah yes, yes, yes, this is just going to beores. Though Choy and Suda Park other special cases. So we've worked in other special cases. Pretty much all of them are some sort of flat manifold with some restriction, or maybe you allow PNs instead of just P1s. But it's all within this general world. The important thing to notice is there's no counter. The important thing to notice is there's no counterexamples. This is completely ultimate. We don't have any examples. We think it might be a quantum example of it. Because no one generic that the quantity of classes could be used to prove they're not really important, right? They're easy to compute in this case. But we're having really an idea how to those examples that we're looking at. So that was a brief aside into the squeeze case. I wanted to talk about the supplex case. Go to your question, right? That the motivation is to go to the supplexing case. So we have everything exactly analogous, which should be a family of syntactic manifolds. And pick omega, m prime, omega prime in G. So we have a very similar statement. If m and m prime are sort of flatomorphic, Then we have an isomorphism again of the cohomology rings. But now we know we can take the cohomology class of omega to the cohomology. Obviously true. Then we have the question does an isomorphism H star plus M do we suppose we have the map of cohomology rings that is omega the cohomology class of omega to the cohomology class is omega plus you can ask does this You can ask, does this imply that M and M prime are synthetic ones? What do you mean by family here? Any set, say. Uh-huh, this is not like a calculator. No. I mean, usually I guess I'm just saying this because it's not just some random stuff, right? You're not going to say anybody self-structured to you. And if so, G is practically a whole lot of structures. And so we want to look for examples of this. And the example, not surprisingly, but this is already known, is some klectic surfaces or some plectic leaves formal outcomes. And this follows, because it worked on the differentiable category, this follows from McDonald's lawn. Or there's another option, follows from another work, which actually precedes McDonald's lawn, which is Karchan. Which is Karchan, where he classifies four-dimensional symplectic chemicals with circle functions. Back to this case, so the circle helps with strip the symphlectic form, so you don't have such a huge block of mass to do. Okay, this is thorough. So, what you can do right here. So, which gives you a hint that maybe we should look for symphalactic torque manifolds. Solve it there. So, now of course, symphlactic torque manifolds, again, are easy to classify equivariance, some platomorphism. So, you can translate the polytopes. If you want weak equivariants, you can act on the polytope by SLNC. You know, that's fine, that's all easy. But they're hard to classify, we're just simplified. I'll redraw polytope, it's hard. It's hard. We do have Ethereum due to Groscham Kessler dashes here. Pencila. Also later by myself, extended this. But there's no infinite step. Some placomorphic please. Which means it may be possible. I think these are handlers. I'm hoping. Let me say. At least you might have a finite number of times where yours will not one, but it won't. Square years with all one, but it won't be an infinite number, so that's like summary short. And in fact, if you look at other techniques, if you can get some ideas of what I'm planning, I already know what I probably want to say non-equivalent. Obviously, you can take Obviously you can take you can take the product with a singleton. Any singletons. Okay. So we have the next question, which we're looking at, is are some flight victory patterns? It's implectably cool out of the table. So there's not too much known in this case. There is a theorem by the south. Which is yes if the coh is so we need to look at CPI models the syncretic rule services. Did you evaluate roll-ups when you saying When you claim logical disruptivity, when you say symplectic code circles, so you allow any mods as one thing or another. One can maybe do something. Yeah, I mean, there's. I mean, we talked about that there does not exist to prove that we allow water transfer loss. Of what? Oh, so that's public what we did together. We spat like eight hours trying to prove it. Of allots. Oh, okay. Yeah, because there exists relevant ideas for the rest of the middle. Okay, thank you. Thank you for reminding me. And the cohomology of M is either more to the cohomology of CPI plus CPJ. So she proves that the cohomologically different. She proved yes in this very special case, but she didn't have to prove some platomorphisms, because she proved there is no other example. One way to prove it is just prove that there we don't have any potential models, so we're done. Oh, for, well, except for the one one case of real time. Yeah, right, so you see. But from around when is this? Do you have the approximate the no, the higher dimensional CP1 or CPJ? It's the one with Tor topology and the title. Do you remember the print 9? Oh, okay, so this is all. Yeah, I think. All right, so. Um so my goal is to prove this theorem in a special case and to use target generation to do so. I need to introduce a little bit of notation. Example of symplectic bot methods. And so, did you remind us the meaning of symplectically homologically symplectically? Right, so this is that two, you have a family, right? And two elements in your family are symplectomorphic if and only if there's an isomorphism of the family. An isomorphism of a cohomology ring that takes the cohomology class, at least in fact it's one, to the coherenl class. One as well? Nope. I do not add it, but I'm not more added. I still think that would be very, very interesting. Yeah. Okay, thank you. Okay, so I'm saying all you get is the cohomology. You could say, wow, that's just greedy. Wow, that's just greedy. What if you're allowed the co-mode class of the symplectic form and the first turn class? So, symplectic manifolds have natural, almost complex structures, so they have natural characteristics of the turn classes. So you could certainly throw in the turn classes, and I think in some ways that would be just as interesting a result. But at this point, it doesn't help me, so why use it? Um so So then there exists an upper triangular matrix A, L and N Z and lambda and R n such that I want to look at the moment polytope equal to the static point in Rn. I'm getting out. I'm giving the outward colour models. Pj is squared root equal to 0, and Ej plus the sum over i, Aji Bi is less than or equal to that, which is all j. Right, so this is it, this is formula for the polytope. It's combinatorily equivalent to a hypercube, since I'm just giving the angles of the faces. And remember, And we know the homology, we divide it as z of x1 to xn over xi squared plus the sum over j aj by xaxj and omega is the sum over i of lambda i xi where xch. where xj is the quadray dual to the inverse of the facets of the jth facet I know sometimes we equations like this one that really off equations but the point is we have a very explicit formula for the whole Very explicit formula for the topology. And the facets sort of come into it. And it's just right off from the top. So these information is the landing book. That's the key. Otherwise, it's just details. Okay. Right. So basically, it's the analog, the symplectic analog of the theorem I had before. So let m prime integral symplectic plot matter. Symplectoplot manifolds. So now I'm assuming by integral, I mean that the symplectopol is integral. That's because I'm going to need it to be the t1 of a line bundle, my variant of a line bundle. Integrals simplify to manifolds. Again, I need the rational cohomology. Rational cohomology to be trivial, meaning that it's the same as 21 to the end. This is a moderately strong assumption, but it's a lot of possibilities. And M and M prime are selected more quick if and only If and only if there exists an isomorphism H star of M Z H star of M prime Z taking the homology class of negative nice complete classification in terms of the simplest regards you could possibly Guidance to the possibility. Okay, this is a good place to stop. Okay, there everything else is going to be proof of it, and then further thoughts. Okay. So first I'm going to give you a two-line pool. Then I will expound on part two. I can trick my proof here. Here's the proof. So one means target generations to construct So you'll have to mortgage those ones. And two, so that's the main thing to spell that do that. And two is apply arguments similar to sneakers. Those are two regressions, right? Showing that some guys are simplexomorphic, and then showing that some guys have different cohomology, right? And the different cohomology, I mean, you can't just quote results from them, but it's fine. Of course, you have the cohomology class changing from the mega changes a little bit, but it all works fine. But the main thing is construct. Okay. Okay. So how do we do this? So of course, the key part is chabadi chabat. I'm going to remind you in part, I'll briefly remind you of that. I won't go into as much detail as I did last time, but where this work degenerate has come in. So recall, I'm going to add a few more words to act. X into NKN into A smooth project your variety fix a local coordinate system on X because they insist on it they want a valuation that this is how I'm getting my valuation fun um so this I know is talk about So, this is, I know I was talking to the flyer, but I need to set my notation. So, there's an associated study group S, which I'm going to write as union over M S M contain in M, sorry, sorry, sorry. Equals the union over M greater than equals the union over m greater than 0 of m cross s m contained in z. So I'm just setting this notation as it was. Okay, the delta meaning the convex take the convex whole, I think we will give one over one S and Or um four media controls. What did they prove? Again, I'm going to review that. They prove this using the flow that I talked about last time, but I don't want to say too much about that. So assume S is finitely generated. is finitely generated, then X naught could be defined V as fudge of C of S is a injected torque variety with moment polytope. Delta and there's a continuous subjective map psi from x to x naught of a symplectomorphism on an open net step. And worthy of the And worthless is much more ribbon on the interior. In fact, it's much more written on the smooth side. But we have one key observation, key fact. If x naught is smooth, x is a plus. So when Shall told me last time I actually felt upset that this is always going to be smooth, obviously that's not true. Shall I think it's terrible? I shouldn't even say terrible. I kind of feel like, I shouldn't say this so confidently to work in generations. It's kind of like you drop your red fold on the floor and you step out of the back because you're like, oh shoot, it's broken. Yeah, terrible luck. But if you're very, very lucky, it will be. So, and what we want to add is one case whereby you're just stepping on it very gently. Okay. So I need to introduce an operator which I'm calling the slide operator. Very simple operator. So we want to fix some W and ZM that you don't want all the coordinates to be one negative. That means you have at least, sorry, yeah, you need to have at least one negative. Yeah, these have at least one negative for you. And you construct a slide of some subset. You're going to have some subset that lies in the positive quadrant. So you're going to construct the slide of Q along W by sliding every Every point in W, in Q, sorry, as far as possible within this positive optive, sorry, positive. Orthodox, but that's isn't that yeah, okay, that's not a configuration. In the direction of how can we optimize that lesson but okay, right? So this is, I'm going to draw a picture of this lecture. It's really simple. I didn't do this quite formally here, but it can do formally, but I think it's easier. I really think of this as you have to have sound effects here, because you can't make sound effects are the little clicking balls, little metal balls, and what you do is you'll What you do is you put little traps in. So this is going to be, this is an example. W equals minus E1 plus E2. So I start with the point in this rectangle. So those are my points. Actually, we're not going to give them colors. Now I want to slide them along these dotted lines as far as I can. Let me do that. So I can't slide the first point. I can't slide these two points. I can't slide those two points either. But now this point is when we just does that everyone understand what I'm using and cheese is slightly. Kind of like he is like this guy goes here. Okay, I can put a lot of things to move. So I have to take a look at that. So, of course, this is S2 cross S2. This is the heart space. I can get to one to the other by sliding. Can you tell that the game gets sliding? I'm sorry. Yeah, so I'm sorry to go. So you have your lab as your inner lab. So you're not allowing the points to collide. No, they can't collide. That's why these guys couldn't pull, because that was already taken. Yeah, yeah. And they're not allowed to collide. Like, they have to live on the lattice. And each one can only move in the direction you've prescribed. And they can't cross out of the organ. They go as far as they can otherwise. Go as far as they can otherwise. So you see here, he has no place to move. And all of these, in these rows, they can't move in this direction because they're already filling up all the possible holes in the ordinate. So this guy has one hole that you can go to. Do you have some polygons? Is there a polygon there? Okay, this is a completely general definition, right? I could do this in any set. The cases I would be interested in are all polygons. It will always be, I take a polygon, I intersect it with my lattice, that will be my Q. And then I apply this, and the answer I get will always be some other polygon setup. But at this point, there's no, like, this definition doesn't do this polygon. This definition organism is positive. That is a positive orphans, but the non-negative orphanage. So it's not the rational market. But like I said, like this is not a very, I was defining some way, but that's not so. So a combined part has something we call shifting. And this is like that there's got lexographic direction. Yeah, that, I would say, that doesn't surprise me at all. It's definitely not much of a, oh my god. Definitely not that. Oh my god, this is amazing. Didn't I create it? I've learned everything. Oh, that's very interesting. It's quite related. That's very interesting. I didn't know that. Let me know more about that. There you had the polygon for P1 plus P1. So there was two ways of setting them. To start out with, I just said, hey, take these six points. Hey, take these six points and perform the shift. That's sort of step one to just see the slide. And then I'm saying, like, oh, weird. Huh. If this happened to me, if I happen to get, these six points happen to come from the moment poly to P1 plus P1. And these six points happen to come from the moment poly of parts of root two surface. Third to root two surface. of the part of a two surface. Yeah, so so but that's P1 plus P1 but the the color the sorry the symplectric one is not is one two so to speak. Right. At this point I haven't made any claims about symplectic things. Well if you have a moment Pauline so that's right. I will say there is an isomorphism isomorphism of homology. This is one two Right, this is one too, and this one is something else. The width is the same, and the average height of these edges is the same. So that is the picture. The type of points in the interior here is a little bit different. You see, so I just wonder: this thing is the thing that other people in the room call a mutation? That I do not know. Well, because. I do not know. Well, because it wouldn't be consistent with lots that's been going on in here this week. But mutation should be reversible, right? Definitely this one generates that and one twice first. Yeah, this is definitely one way. No, no, but no, no, you see, it's what Nathan will tell you. There is a family LP1. And they both, you can, and on that, there are two fibers, and one is one fiber, and the other is one fiber. There is no direction. Yeah, right. Generalization is also generalized. So soon. Okay, I do want to finish. Sorry, let me get jobs. Well, I mean. Okay, you finished. I love conversations. So they look at the thing, but I have no idea. And I think I understand. Maybe you do. Well, yeah, I think I did that. If you draw the coordinates. If you draw the coordinates elsewhere, like would you be able to do that if you change the meaning or puzzle or thing? No, it's getting squishier. Okay, that's not. So there's a progression towards squishiness, which I'll make the second statement. Every time you step on it, it gets squishier, right? You can't step on it in gasoline. If you move the floor. Of course, you can do a month which trivial do nothing. That's easy to see. So sideways, you're like, surprise, nothing, right, whatever. And then I can do nothing again and come back to where I started. But otherwise, it's irresponsible. Okay. So I think this is a key proposition. Let XP B. We have XPB, the syntactic for example this polytope. So this is your initial polytope. And you're starting with, assume P looks like R version 0. R version 0 to the and near 0. This takes on vertex and stuff it into the positive. You can always do that. Move right manifold. And then I'm going to let Z1 to ZM be torrent coordinates near zero. So I think something else mentioned this. I can't remember if I did this. Much of this, I can't remember. If I did this for my polarization, I guess I think that's good, that's good. So I'm going to fix the natural number M, so that's my M. And also A and L between 1 and M, not remember they're between 1 and N. And I'm going to let u i f i if i is not equal to k that's okay, z i and z i z k minus z l c equals I just change these words very, very, very slightly and carefully only things. And carefully only think it's what's sort of one dimension and what's affected. One dimension is great, because like connected some manifolds of R and classify. Inhales. Can you read, can you read the whole thing? Yes, sorry, this is. That's a mutation, Sue. Okay, so this is the other mutation. Excellent. That's what it is. Fucking about that's that's interesting. I I shall learn more about mutations then. I should learn more about mutations then. And you can just start playing around with the different things. Right, this is a small change of an SM, and this is somewhat unhappy in terms of the semi group. The M level semi group is just I get and I shift along this direction. Oops, So my injuttness is sliding up to the control. So that tells me, so what does that tell me? Right, so now I apply this back. And basically, this, so you saw this picture, I did this picture, well, you saw what happened with the slides, it just transferred one to the other. And the fact is that you can put that exactly what happens with this morning glass, just the color soil bricks. So we got composition. So we've got L and L prime. And L drawing, the integral plastic botany mold with moment polytopes delta and delta prime assume. Assume there exists Knothing L and an isomorphism. This is a little bit technical, but from the cohomology of M to the cohomology of M prime, we're taking omega to omega prime. This is my general thing, but I can only allow. I can only allow certain kinds of isomorphisms such that xk plus xk prime minus gamma xl was some gamma in z and xi is xi prime draw i not equal k. Just very much like that settlement. And then if A prime LK is greater than or equal to A L K, so this is where we're getting more squishy. These things tell you how angular you are. Then there exists a symptomorphism coming from towards the... Coming from torque degeneration. And the proof is very easy because I just need to prove. I know what the polytopes look like. I just have to prove I combine the C. So I get from one polytope to the other value in this slide. That's the end of the whole.
