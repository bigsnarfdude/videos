Here is French Myers talking about PLARMA conjectured centrally semantic section. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the For the great opportunity to be here in this beautiful place and to be part of this nice and interesting conference. In this talk, we are going to speak about geometric tomography problems and results in the Euclidean space, in which we are given information about the symmetries. About the symmetries of sections or projections of a convex body, and we want to obtain from them information about the symmetries of the convex body. Here you have the main question is: what can we say about the convex body with the property that there exists a point P such that all the hyperplane section of K passing? Section of K passing through P possesses a certain type of symmetry. A simple case of question occurs when all the hyperplane sections passing through P are sphere. In this case, K must be an sphere, and we notice that in this case, the section has all the possible symmetries. First of all, First of all, I would like to give you some results which can be considered as a classical characterization of the ellipsoid. Characterization given in terms of section and projections, the Vlaske characterization in terms of shadow boundaries, the Brun characterization, and the Olojanish-Nikov characterization, the file central theory. The false central theorem, and finally the Luis Montejano characterization of the sphere in terms of section of constant width. As an example, let me mention that if all the orthogonal projections of a convex body are ellipsoid, then the body must be an ellipsoid. In this case, the body is inscribed. The body is inscribed in a cylinder, and we have information about this cylinder. And later, we will replace the cylinder by a cone. In order to give you the next characterization, let me give you the next definition. Let K be a convex body and let L be a line. The shadow boundary. The shadow boundary of k with respect to the direction L is the set of points in the boundary sigma k L such that the point X is in sigma if there is a supporting line of the convex body through X parallel to the line L. The Blasque characterization affirms that a convex body is an ellipsoid. Convex body is an ellipsoid if and only if every shadow boundary is planar. On the other hand, in order to give the Brune characterization, I need the following definition. Suppose that we have a convex body and a unit vector u with denote by omega k u, the locus of the midpoints of the charge of k parallel to u. Parallel to you. In this picture, this red curve is omega k u. And if a convex body is such that for every unit vector, the set omega k u is contained in a hyperplane, then the body must be an ellipsoid. On the other hand, we have here the ologenes-Nikov characterization. Hologanist-Nikov characterization. Here we have a family of planes with the property that divides the volume in a given radio mu different than one. And each of these planes has the property that is the section given by them is centrally symmetric. And then the body must be again an ellipsoid. It's important to observe that. To observe that we require that the parameter mu is different than one. Here, with this condition, we guarantee that the locus of the centers of the section is not a point. Suppose that we have, on the other hand, we have a convex body which is centrally symmetric, then every plane passing through the center Passing through the center divides the body into parts of equal volume, and all the sections are centrally symmetric with respect to the center. On the other hand, we have the false central theorem. Ambrose Rogers in 1969 proved that if we have a convex body K and a point P, such that every section passing through the point. Section passing through the point is centrally symmetric. Then the body is centrally symmetric as well. But he conjectured if the Poi P is not the center of symmetry, then the body must be an ellipsoid. And the conjecture was confirmed by Etson, Petty, and Rogers in 1971. 71 and a few years later, when the point P is an interior point, and a few years later, the general case was proved by David Larman. Such theorem is known as the four-central theorem. And here also it's important to notice that here.  Here it's important to notice that default set. The false center is when we guarantee that the locus of the center of the section is not a point. So finally, we have here the Montejano's characterization of the sphere. We have a convex body and a point P, and if all the n minus one dimensional sections of K passing through P are bodies of constant width. Through P are bodies of constant width, then the body must be an sphere. Now, here we have at least some result which can be considered as a new characterization of the ellipsoid. There is a quick proof of the false central theorem given by Montejano and myself in 2007, but I will not talk about it today. Did today. On the other hand, we have characterization of central symmetry of a convex body in terms of cones which circumscribe the body. Characterization by mean of central projections. Characterization in terms of section given by families of hyperplanes not necessarily concurrent, for example, given by two cycles or hyperplanes or characteristics. Or characterization in terms of section given by hyperplanes tangent to a convex body. In particular, some cases of the Baker-Larman conjecture are considered. Gerodi Mocastro and one of my students, Diana Berdusco, in 2020 proved the following result. Let K be a strictly convex body in. Be a strictly convex body in Rn, and let L be a hipper surface, which is the image of an embedded of the sphere such that K is contained in the interior of L. Suppose that for every point X in L, there exists another point Y in L such that the two supporting points differ by a central differ by a central symmetry, then the body is centrally symmetric. So let's again suppose that we have a convex body such that there is a surface L, such that for every point X in L, there exists a point Y in L such that these two supporting cones differ by a central symmetry. Then the body is centrally symmetric. Body is centrally symmetric. In order to give you the next result, I need the following definition. Suppose that we have a convex body and a point X in this complement. We consider the support cone. And with a note by Delta me salida la Perome salida la. Perome is a little presentation. Sorry? Sorry. Then the intersection of this cone with the boundary of the convex body is denoted by delta Kx and will it is will be called the grace. Will be called the grace of K with respect to X. And in 2001, Ivan González, Casúzque Rodimo, Diana Verdusco, and myself proved the following. Suppose that we have two convex bodies, K and L. K is contained in L and suppose that for every point X in L. In L, the grace is an ellipsoid, then the body is an ellipsoid. Then, for one hand, this grace is planar, but even more is an ellipsoid. Then the body must be an ellipsoid. But we were able to improve this result in the following way. Again, for every Again, for every point in the body L, the grace is contained in the hyperplane. But we need an additional condition that essentially means that the body L is not close to L. It's not close to K, sorry. And that in this case, the body K is an ellipsoid. Sorry, almost pre means the intuitively that the ball, the convex body, that this convex body L is not close to the boundary of the convex body K. In order to give you In order to give you the next result, I need the following definition. A convex body satisfies the Berkele-Larman condition if there exists a sphere in the interior of this body such that every supporting hyperplane pi of B, the section is centrally symmetric. Baker and Larman proposed the following conjecture. Larman proposed the following conjecture. Let K be a convex body. If K satisfies the Berkele-Larman condition, then K is an ellipsoid. There is an S here in the interior of K such that every section given by A section given by a supporting plane is centrally symmetric. And finally, if we have a convex body, we say that K satisfies the Montecano condition if there exists an sphere in the interior such that for every supported hyperplane, the section is a body of constant width. Body of constant width. Then we prove the following results. Let K be a centrally symmetric and strictly convex body. And suppose that K satisfies the Verkel-Larman condition for a ball which does not contain the center of symmetry, then K is an ellipsoid. And on the other hand, And on the other hand, if we have a convex body centrally symmetric, and this body satisfies the Montejano condition for a wall which does not contain the center of symmetry, then the body must be an sphere. Let me give you the sketch of the proof of the theorem one in dimension three. So we take a system of coordinates such that the center of symmetry is the origin and let P be a plane through the center of the convex body. And now we take gamma a supporting plane of B parallel to pi. Then in this picture, this section by hypothesis. A section by hypothesis has center of symmetry. Since the body is centrally symmetric, we consider the negative section and it also has center of symmetry. This implies that these two sections are translated by a vector u. Well, now I consider the projection on the plane pi parallel to the direction u. And then if the plane gamma is such that the vector u are such that the origin is not in the projection of the ball, then the shadow boundary with respect to the direction u is contained in a plane. Is contained in a plane. Well, let me give you some notation. We denote by omega the family of planes which strictly separate the ball B from the center of the symmetry and let sigma be a supporting plane of the ball in. In omega, we have sigma. And now we consider the two supporting planes parallel to sigma, sigma one and sigma two. And we consider a point in the intersection of this plane with the convex body x1. And on the other hand, in a similar way, we have here x2. And then these two points. And then these two points generate a line which I will call L of sigma. Then for all sigma in omega, the line L of sigma is an affine axis of symmetry of K, and all the sections of K parallel to sigma are similar and similarly situated. The idea of the proof of lemma 2 is to show. proof of lemma two is to show using lemma one that for every sigma in omega the family of all sections of k given by plane in planes containing l sigma are shadow boundaries and finally in this family of planes sigma in the family omega there is a very special one such that Such that the corresponding affine axis of symmetry is even an affine axis of revolution. Finally, the body K has enough affine symmetries to guarantee that it is an ellipsoid. Well, I would like to give you a sketch of the proof of the lemma one. Of the proof of the lemma one, since because it seems to me that this is nice. So suppose that we have a convex figure, centrally symmetric convex figure in the plane, and we have a circle which does not sorry. It's important this condition that the origin is not in the projection of the ball B. Remember that this vector is the vector who gives us the translation with the section given by gamma and minus gamma. By gamma and minus gamma. Okay, then again I have a comics figure centrally symmetric and we have a circle which does not contain the center of symmetry. And then given a point in the boundary, we construct two sequence in the following way. We consider the supporting line through the point omega, and this supporting line intersects the figure in another point. There are two supporting lines. I will take one in such a way that if I move from W to the second point, the circle is in the left-hand side. Hand side. So if we start with this point, we consider the supporting line to the circle B and the supporting line determine the point B1. And now we consider the supporting line passing through the point B1 to the circumstances. To the circle minus B, in which generate the point A2, and so on. Then it's not difficult to prove that these families of charge converge to the church in this picture AB, which is a tangent to both circles. So now I would like to prove. So now I would like to prove that we have the direction U and we have the corresponding shadow boundary. And I would like to prove that this shadow boundary is planar. And who is the candidate? The plane, I start with the plane pi. Okay, now we take a point in the intersection of this plane and the shadow boundary with respect to the direction u. Suppose that we have the point x here. Now we project in the direction u. Remember that this body is centrally symmetric and we have two poles. We have two poles B and minus B and the origin that does not belong to the sphere B. And we project, we get one figure in two circles, and the projection of the center is not, does not belong to the projection of the ball. And now we project this point. Now we project this point. With this point as W, we generate the sequence charts given previously. Then we have a family of charts which converge to a to a church which is a very good change. Which is contained in a supporting common plane of the two circles. Okay, now each of these chords determine a section as the inverse image of the projection. So we have here a sequence of sections, and it's not difficult to prove that. Not difficult to prove that each of these sections, since the charts are tangent to the circles, these planes are tangent to the sphere. And by hypothesis, they are centrally symmetric. And it's not difficult to prove that all these centers are contained in this plane pi. So, since I assuming that this point is in the shadow boundary and the center are in this plane, all the image of this of this Of this point with respect to the center of the section are in the plane pi. And finally, this chart, which is the core, which is common to the two circles, will be a plane, which is common to the two spheres. And the limit of these reflections will be in this plane. Be in this plane. All the reflection will be in the same plane since the center are in the plane P. The reflection of this point with respect to the center will be always in this plane. And at the end, the limit of this sequence of points will be in the plane P. Okay, I think this. Okay, I think this is this is the the idea of this uh the proof of this lemma Thank you. Then you can see
