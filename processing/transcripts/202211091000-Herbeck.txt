Great. Well, thank you very much for having me. I wish I was there in Mexico, but I'm not. I'm in Seattle. And this talk is going to be quite different than Kelly's, and I hope that it is okay. It's a very different approach and questions. Today I'm going to be talking about HIV clusters and transmission. And just to back up a little bit and give some background and context, we're going to talk about clusters, genetic clusters. Of course, these are identified almost always based on, of course, genetic similarity or phylogenic relationship or node support. They represent groups of individuals who are likely sharing some type of epidemiological relationship, whether transitional partnerships. Relationship, whether transmission partnerships or within the same risk network. And they have been widely used across pathogens, not just within HIV, to infer patterns of transmission or identify outbreaks. Within HIV, however, there is a really long history of using clusters to understand transmission. This history is quite limited, almost exclusively used in MSM, men with hijacked with men, HIV epidemics in the global north, so Western. In the global north, so Western Europe and North America. But within the United States, they've been really popular over the last 20 years, so much so that the CDC actually promotes, I think, mandates, but this is a bit unclear recently, but they have done a lot of promotion of the use of genetic clustering by local public health offices with the goals of identifying outbreaks, understanding transmission, and they term these activities molecular HIV surveillance. Activities molecular HIV surveillance. So, first, I just want to go through some really basic methods that people have used in the analysis of these clusters. And then I'll move from there into my questions for this talk. So a typical analysis within HIV using clusters is simply to identify clusters and then with the assumption that each sequence is linked to some epidemiological data. So age, sex. Data. So age, sex, gender, risk group, location. And the driving assumption that is most often unstated are that these cluster sequences are transmitters and the singletons or non-clustering sequences are non-transmitters on average. And this follows from the, again, unstated assumption that all viral lineages in a phylogy are infections, but only clustered. Infections, but only clustered lineages are infections followed by transmission. So we all know that microepidemiology, genomic epidemiology is a great tool to understand transmission. It's not a great tool to understand infection or acquisition because we can use diagnoses and standard public health surveillance data for that. But the phylogenies and the gene sequences are supposed to give us information on transmission. And clusters are one way to partition phylogenies or sequence data sets. Phylogenes or sequencer sites into informative or non-informative pieces of data with the assumption that clusters represent transmitters or are enriched with transmitters. And so the next step in these typical analyses after identifying clusters is to use basic regression to identify some traits that are enriched in these clusters and then identify these traits as important or associated with elevated rates of transmission. Rates of transmission. So, this basic framework has been used dozens of times over the last 20 or more years. This is just simply a snapshot starting in the early 2000s, going up until last year. There are still some being published in 2022, in which basically individuals, scientists collect gene sequences, one sequence per individual, most often, and these sequences are linked to individual traits. Individual traits, and we identify traits associated with increased rates of transmission. As you can see here, they're almost all one gene, this polymerase gene. This is because, at least in North America and Western Europe, it is quite common to get your HIV gene sequence, your HIV lineage sequenced in order to prescribe individualized ART or anti-retroval therapy regimens to avoid resistance. Regimens to avoid resistance. So, this is a really popular basic method of using clusters to identify traits associated with transmission. Now, along the way, there have been some really key papers by Eric Bolds and later by Art Poon showing that while clusters are not always the best way to understand transmission, because clusters don't always just represent transmission rates, I'm going to quote here from Art's paper. Clustering methods. Clustering methods are systematically biased through detect variation among some populations in sampling rates, that is, the waiting time until diagnosis of a new HIV infection. And genet clusters will tend to collect individuals sampled soon after infection, irrespective of whether those infections resulted from high rates of transmission. So this has been a really, these papers provided a really good check on the use of clusters to identify traits associated with transmission. And so what happened was. And so, what happened was these papers, you know, and I'm not faulting them because these are good information from clusters, but these papers then just basically adjusted their analyses for time after infection that the individual were sampled. But still, they were using clusters to identify transmission dynamics. One more thing that I want to note about clusters is that as you increase the sampling. Increase the sampling rate of your population, the clustering rate also increases. So the more sequences you collect from your population, the more clusters you will recover from your data set. So I'm going to switch now to why clusters are potentially important in the analysis of sequences from Africa and how we can use these analyses to help end the To help end the HIV epidemic. It's a big transition, I guess. So far, even with the widespread rollout of ART, so therapy, we see incidence declines in Africa that have been unprecedented. So HIV is, the incidence rates are decreasing across most countries in Africa. However, instance is not decreasing as we produce. Is not decreasing as we predicted, and we see a lot of heterogeneities in risk, acquisition, and transmission among subgroups or what we call core groups or key populations. And so this has led prevention programs to target HIV prevention effectively and efficiently. So basically, if we can't afford to apply ART or PrEP or other prevention methods to everybody in a population, perhaps it is best to identify the core groups that are driving. Identify the core groups that are driving the epidemic and focus on those populations for prevention and treatment. In order to do that, we have to understand HIV transmission. So because clusters have been so widely used in the West with some fair results, identifying groups associated with transmission risk, the question was: well, why don't we apply these analyses to African populations? To African populations. So, what happened was clustering patterns in these primarily heterosexual epidemics of Southern Africa appeared to be quite different than the patterns we see in MSM epidemics of Western Europe and North America. Notably, we see fewer clusters overall and very few large clusters. And most of this work has come out of the PANG HIV Consortium. HIV consortium. There's been two iterations of this consortium, and the goal of this consortium was to collect upwards of 20,000 HIV-full genomes from several different HIV cohorts across southern Africa. And as these sequences have been collected and data sets have been increased, we do see these patterns, a few clusters. And so the analyses plan for Pangea and others working in this area has been to kind of move away from clusters initially. Of move away from clusters initially, but now we're kind of circling back and asking the question: well, so we don't see clusters. Let's not throw away all the singletons as non-informative. Let's try to figure out what this pattern tells us about the epidemic. And so we asked this question. What explains the patterns of genetic clustering in Southern Africa? Some possible explanations that we've been discussing include what perhaps are just lower sampling coverage in Africa? In Africa, or perhaps the core groups are not being sampled sufficiently, so we're biasing against sampling transmitters, perhaps, or the core groups who are driving the epidemic. Or perhaps there's just differences in heterosexual and MSM sexual networks, which will be that will cause differences in the transmission networks and probably the patterns of clustering. This last hypothesis has. This last hypothesis has been described recently by Christoph Frazier as many infect some, not some infect many. And this sum infect many is referring to what we generally think of as what happens in MSM epidemics, where we see superspreading events and rapid transmission chains. And so the hypothesis is that these patterns of clustering that we see in Africa are the result of few supersparring events. Of few superspirant events and few private transition chains. So, why is this important? Well, the existence or not of core transition groups can guide prevention. It's also relevant for funding decisions related to increasing sequence coverage or identifying who to sample for phylogenetic studies. So, if we do think that the core groups are just not driving the epidemic, then it's possible that targeting individual groups for Individual groups for increased prevention will not actually end the epidemic. So, this is a pretty important question, even though it comes from a very simple way to understand phylogenies and types as just clustering patterns. So, in order to answer some of those questions, over the last several years, myself and some others, including Edwin Wilkinson and Oliver Ratman and Christoph Frazier, have been also kind of taking a step back and looking at, well, whether HIV clusters are. Well, whether HIV clusters are enriched with transmitters at all. This assumption kind of drives the use of clusters in the West and initially in Southern Africa, but we don't actually know if clusters are enriched with transmitters, if they're a good proxy for transmission. So I'm going to start out with answering this question and we'll move on to whether this helps us understand clustering in Southern Africa. I'm going to do this using two existing epidemic Existing epidemic models, these are stochastic agent-based epidemic models of HIV. On the left, this model is calibrated to Eswatini, which has incredibly high HIV incidence and prevalence. Within the models, it's important to note that there's different types of relationships and different types of risk individuals. And we will compare the results we see from ESO Atini, this calibrated model, to the results we see from. See from a different model, also surpassing an agent-based epimodel HIV, which was developed by Sam Janess and his group and collaborators. This model is calibrated to the Atlanta MSM epidemic, but also includes variation in risk across individuals. And down here, I show the typical incidence patterns from these simulations that we're pulling from. So an Esotini incidence goes up to around 2.5. Goes up to around 2.5 infections per 100 person years and then drops with the rollout of ART. And in ART, and in Atlanta, right now, we're just using one set of simulations in which incidence is fairly stable among MSM at around one and a half infections per 100 person years. So first I'm going to focus on transmission enrichment in clusters in Iswatini. This is how we make and define clusters using our simulations. Our simulations. From each simulation, we get a line list out, we sample that line list, we make a phylogeny, then we identify clusters. So important pieces of this pipeline include the sampling. So each individual sampled once. We start out with random sampling. So we do not sample based on any of the demographics or risk categories in the model. We just pick people at random. The sampling times after infection. The sampling times after infection here are based on an exponential distribution with a mean of one year. So, given what we know from Eric and Art's papers about the importance of sampling time after infection, we keep this consistent for both the Esotini and Atlanta models. And then we don't actually simulate sequences on top of these phylogenies, on top of these line lists. We just use phylogenetic branch lengths in time. And so we identify clusters based on varying cutoffs of particular distance. On varying cutoffs of participant distance, and this distance is time, not substitutions. But this is probably not going to play a large, have a huge role on our results. So just some early results, just to get you oriented to what we're looking at. These are kind of odd bar plots in which each separate bar plot is a different threshold for. Different threshold for cluster inclusion. So, this is cutoffs of 0.5 years, two years, five years, and 10 years. More generally, the cutoffs in years that will be equivalent to cutoffs in distance that people use to identify clusters will be between two and five, which are somewhere between one and four and a half percent distance pairwise distance for clusters. So, we'll probably focus on the two and five year. On the two and five-year cutoffs for clusters. We see that very low cutoffs, so very strict definitions of whether an individual is in a cluster or not. We see that most transmitters are not clustered. We also see that clusters, so clusters are the orange and yellow groups here, clusters appear to contain more transmitters than non-transmitters. More transmitters than non-transmitters. We're just comparing the size of the yellow bars to the orange bars. The higher the sampling coverage, the more clusters we get. So, sampling rate of the population is increasing as we go up. And we do see that we get more clusters and more transmitters in those clusters as we increase the sampling rate. So, just from this initial look at the output from the Easter TME model, we can say that clusters seem to have some value for identifying. Say that clusters seem to have some value for identifying transmitters, especially as cutoff and sampling coverage increase. So, to look at this a little bit differently: what is the probability of being in a cluster if you are a transmitter? So, remember, in real life, we don't have any information about transmitter status, right? All we have is clustering as the proxy for transmission, but we do not know in a given data set whether or not any sequence is linked to an individual who has transmitted. This is just the percent of clustered if. Is just the percent of clustered if transmitting. So, if you're a transmitter, what's your probability of being in a cluster? This is the sampling rate going from one to 100% across the x-axis and the cutoff in years. So, the size or sorry, the threshold for identifying clusters goes from very strict to very progressive as we go down. So, at low coverage and low cutoff, we see very few transmitters end up in a cluster. Does that make sense? And at relatively high sample coverage, And at relatively high sample coverage and large cluster cutoffs, we see almost all transmitters are in a cluster. But that's not incredibly informative because those are just percents and we don't know that information. This information we do have: probability of being a transmitter if you're in a cluster. So if you're in a cluster, what is the probability that you are a transmitter? Probability that you are a transmitter. Did I just skip a? Oh, no, no, here we go. This is the same plot here. I don't know why there is. Sorry about that. So we see here that the probability of being a transmitter if you are in a cluster is high, but it decreases as sampling coverage increases. So it looks like clusters might be a good way of identifying transmitters in a population using clusters because we can see that. Because we can see that if we're in a cluster, the majority of individuals in clusters have transmitted. But let's look at this from a different way. Now we're going to look at relative risks of transmitting if clustering. So we need to know this because we can't just take these previous percents as at face value because As a face value, because we don't know the percent transmitting if not clustering in this heat map. So if we add in the relative risk of transmitting if clustering. So again, we are looking at clusters and we are comparing the rate of being a transmitter if you're in a cluster to the rate of being a transmitter if you're not in a cluster. And we see that we have a slightly better chance of finding transmitters in clusters. Finding transmitters in clusters than among singletons. So I would say that relative risks are slightly elevated at low sampling rates and strict cutoffs, you know, in between one and two, which does though that which does show that the clusters are slightly enriched with transmitters. And this effect, these relative risks increase with sampling rate and cutoff. Cut off. So, a couple of takeaways from this result is that it's interesting to me that the relationship between clustering and transmission does vary across sampling rate and cutoff. It's not consistent. And while indeed clusters are enriched, it's not an incredible level of enrichment. So, how do we interpret this and move on? Well, one thing we can look at first is what about high transmitters? So, this heat map shows the relative risk of transmitting more than one time. So, enrichment increases as we focus on those that transmit more. The increase in enrichment is more pronounced at small cutoffs and low sampling rates. So, and these show that the relative risk of being a transmitter who's transmitted more than once or the probability is high. Where the probability is higher for, let me back up. This always gets me over time and go through these, even though I've looked at these many times. So we take clusters. We want to identify individuals who have transmitted more than once. It is more likely to identify individuals who have transmitted more than once by looking at clusters than it is at non-clusters. So clusters are informative. So, clusters are informative. However, high transmitters do make up a minority of cluster individuals. So, even though these are relatively good, relative risks, there actually are not that many people who have transmitted more than once. So, it may not be that informative. If we look at very high transmitters, so individuals who transmit greater than four times, we see that the increase in enrichment is actually stronger. But again, very high transmitters make up a small fraction of clustered individuals. So, you can see here that. Clustered individuals. So you can see here that in the yellow, which is the individuals who have transmitted more than four times across all cutoffs of clustering, there are very few individuals who have transmitted more than once. And so even if we are enriching, even if clusters are enriched with transmitters, the actual number is quite low. So this first question: so are HIV clustered initially. So, are HIV clustered enriched with transmitters? We can say yes, they are, not incredibly so, but they are enriched with transmitters in our epidemic model of Iswatini. And we can see that enrichment increases with hevel coverage and we consider multiple transmissions. So, how does this help us understand clustering patterns in Southern Africa? So, again, I put this up here. I'm going to compare these two model outputs now, just to remind me to talk about the fact that we're now including Atlanta simulations in these analyses. In these analyses? First, clustering rates. Remember that one of the first things I talked about was how the Pangea Consortium and collaborators identified that the percent of clustered individuals was very low in African data sets. And so, do our simulations of each hotini recapitulate this pattern? And we see that here. Here. So, this kind of messy plot shows three different cluster cutoffs: green, orange, and purple at increasing thresholds for cutoffs. We see on the y-axis the percent of the population that's clustered, and then the x is the sampling rate of the population. We can see here that at low sampling rates, we do see in our We do see in our isotaining model percent clustering outputs that are consistent with the empirical data that we see in Botswana and Uganda. So that's good. It reconfirms that our model is at least consistent with the empirical data. With Atlanta, Atlanta is supposed to, for us, I only have two minutes be a simulation that we use to recreate or be a good simulation of generally epidemics at high sampling rates. We do see high percents of individuals that are clustered. But these are unbiased sampling because we're sampling anybody without regard to the. Anybody without regard to the risk value. So, what about sampling bias? HIV sequence sampling is biased in both Southern Africa for sexual and MSM settings, North America and Western Europe. That's our idea. And the sampling bias may have an impact on clustering patterns. So why would there be bias in sampling? Well, in Africa, sequences are primarily collected from clinical trials in which people have to enroll as negative or from general population surveillance. So there are probably lower risk with fewer transmitters. Probably lower risk with fewer transmitters. This is the opposite of countries in North America and Western Europe. Sequences are probably affected from HIV and STI clinics, so they have a high risk population with more transmitters. So we know that clusters are enriched with transmitters. So if we enrich the sampling with transmitters, will we see more clusters? Indeed, we do. So this plot shows, again, sampling rate on the X and percent cluster on the Y. These lines on the top are sampling of the population bias towards transmitters. Population bias towards transmitters. On the bottom, we see bias towards non-transmitters. We do see that as the sampling rate increases and we have more transmitters selected for inclusion in our data sets, we see more clustering. Bias towards non-transmitters provides a better match with compared to results at the coverage level seen in Southern Africa. So, low sampling rates. At bias towards non-transmitters, we see levels of clustering that are consistent with the comparison. Of clustering that are consistent with empirical values. So, to put it all together, this is a quite busy slide. I apologize, but the points are essentially the differences in percent clustering that we see between MSM epidemics and African epidemics were hypothesized to be due to the sexual networks or the transition networks almost in absence of issues of coverage or bias. Of coverage or bias. And our analysis have shown that sample coverage and sample bias can, by themselves, result in and produce difference in clustering rates. And so this is hopefully going to be a way to push forward this field. So we have to do more sampling or do better bias sampling on transmitters. So, quickly, in conclusion, I'm sorry, I'm about over. In conclusion, I'm sorry, I'm about over. We see that the relationship between clusters and transmission is complicated. We do see that enrichment of clusters changes with sample coverage and cluster cutoffs. Clusters are enriched with transmitters slightly. This enrichment should increase with biased sampling of transmitters. Differences in patterns between Southern Africa and North America MSM are consistent with biased sampling. So we agree that sexual and transitional. That sexual and transitional networks, many, in fact, few, are a potential and perhaps likely cause of the different patterns. But we would propose that sample coverage issues and sampling biases also play a large role in the patterns we see in Southern Africa. So with current sequence data sets in Africa, clustering analyses as they are done now are probably unlikely to reveal the role of core groups. We need more sampling, actually, more samples. More sampling, actually, more samples from Africa, and we need better sampling strategy. If we knew how to sample transmitters, we should prioritize that kind of sampling in order to see clusters or to evaluate whether that does or does not fix this issue of different clustering patterns between the two regions. So, I just want to acknowledge my coworkers at IDM, some collaborators, Sam and Adrian, who kindly. Collaborators Sam and Adrian, who kindly provided the Atlanta simulations. And I've been talking about these issues for the last couple of years with Oliver Edwin Tulio, Kate Grabowski, and Christoph Frazier. And I'd like to acknowledge their contributions. Thank you very much. Sorry, it was rushed. Excellent. Thanks very much for the really informative, clear talk on an important topic. And we actually started a few minutes late. And we actually started a few minutes late, so we do have a little bit of time for some questions directed directly to Josh. And then, and then, of course, we're going to take some time where we can have questions to anyone. Hi here in Oaxaca. Can you hear me? Yeah. Yeah. So very interesting talk. Thank you. I just have a question regarding, because you emphasized on how the sampling was random at the beginning of your time series. Of your time series. So, what would happen if it, because transmission events can be time-sensitive, right? So, what would happen if sampling schemes would change there? And there's also a chance that you are not sampling complete clusters if you are doing it random. Would be also a way of going back. Once you have like a preliminary idea of what the clusters could be, then go back and resample to complete the data. And resample to complete the data and then render it more informative. So, what's your ideas on this? I'm not sure I fully follow you. So, initially, you're right, just to get a sense of the relationship between transmission and clustering, we sampled randomly. We did not have any covariates that affected who we would sample. We did sample the sample after. Sample the sample after each individual's infection consistently across each simulation. So you're asking if we didn't, if we identify clusters, could we go back and sample individuals close to those clusters? Yeah, or try to enrich your sampling based on the initial observations. So try to enrich the size or the Enrich the size or the earlier individuals that would correspond to the initial events of the cluster transmission. Something in that line. Yeah, so I think that I do think that biased sampling, the sampling that currently exists in Africa is not biased towards Towards those individuals who are likely to transmit more. Most of the large data sets in Africa are from general population surveillance or trials. There are smaller data sets that have focused on, for example, female sex workers or small MSM populations within urban areas. And interestingly enough, those small phylogenetic data sets do have clustering rates that are similar to those seen in North America and Western Europe. In North America and Western Europe, but they're too small. And even if you add those data sets into the larger Pangea data sets that include thousands of sequences, the clustering rates don't increase substantially. So the next question is, you're right, we need to somehow enrich our sampling to identify cluster individuals, but we don't know how to do that. If this pattern of low sampling or Low sampling or low clustering rates because of the low importance of core groups is true, then we could increase sample coverage a lot and we still wouldn't see a lot of clusters. Thank you. Interesting. Yeah, I think that's very interesting. So Dave Rasmussen has raised his hand. Do you want to unmute yourself, Dave, and ask your question? Sure. So Josh, I was curious that you looked at how the effects of bias sampling affects. Bias sampling affects clustering. But I was thinking about the quote that you mentioned from Art Poon, where I took that to mean, you know, just the presence of sampling heterogeneity alone could sort of produce these patterns of clustering. So I'm wondering if you looked, had a chance to look at whether, you know, if just you had random sampling heterogeneity across the population, like just people had different probabilities of being sampled. Different probabilities of being sampled if that alone could create sort of these artificial, yeah, that's a really interesting question. No, we have not done that, huh? Yeah. I feel, yeah, that's a really interesting point. We should, we should, we, we could try that. Um, so you're suggesting right now we're doing random, completely random. Um, everybody has the same probability of being sampled, and then we're trying by And then we're trying bias sampling based on one covariate transmission or not. And you're suggesting just change a pick a random covariate and bias on that on age or gender or any random number generation and just see if that itself would result in increased clustering of those individuals. Yeah, that would be really interesting. Yeah. I do think that's what Art is saying is basically he's saying those individuals who happen to engage with Individuals who happen to engage with care more, those subgroups will get sequenced earlier after their infection. And so they will be in clusters, regardless of what individual traits or behaviors or demographics they have, as long as they get sequenced sooner after infection, they'll be in clusters. And we've tried to just ignore that completely in all this, in all this. Thanks, Josh. Yeah, thanks for the question. Excellent. So, I guess at this point, we can just open everything up. We're going to have a coffee break here. We'll leave the Zoom session on. And I think anybody should feel free to unmute yourself. We'll try to have something as closely resembling an actual discussion at a coffee break as possible. So, if you're on Zoom and you just want to speak up, by all means.
