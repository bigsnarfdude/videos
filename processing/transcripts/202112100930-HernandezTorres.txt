It is a pen that can bear with the difference of difference, but the sessions in the tardem, but everything that fantastic, and theatre suggested in occasions. In distinct occasions, and today vance the protectionists of structure. And well, I want to thank the organizers, and I want to recognize their perseverance to organize this event because there were many incertains, and this is very content that we can form ibrida, and the rod of the world. So, I will comment: space metrics because. And first one of motivation. And when we send the paper that has the probability in the mathematics, there are when you are relatively recent, this invalid parts. And I consider that part of their dynamism of this mandate. Now, this is a change in the paradigm in the science and engineering science to try problems as complex systems. And the need to system definitely microscopic forms and mergers that are macroscopic. All these fascinating, but how are they mathematical with no resonance for what I problem? And I think that illustration in my work. It is a illustration of the mathematics of Anatolia fomenco, that the titular Spanish chaos. And here are more colloquium, not necessarily more systems. And to represent the. And to represent, we have these agujas that are tiradas for solo forma chaotic format, which is a reference we have from the gufon, that we have all escuchadable. And that we have Venezuela, one, and security, we have the longitudinal literature, is the longitude one. And then And then it's that the probability that this event succeeded is two people. These are independent agents, the leaders of numerous queues. We have this great cantidad of the children. And when we are here, there are people who are afraid to converger to two. And there is no. So, this is artistic representation, what is this legend, this region el cows, so much of the cows. And this is what this is from these legs that are the comports of electoral systems. And we vistoy in the plateau of Rodrigo Trevino, of Carlos Nigia, of Emilia Alvarez, so that these one of these other instances. And here the segments are decided because they are eventually independent, and what we continued have independent elements and interest. If we have the object principle that are the aleatories, and this can definitely all typically graphics, we have finite graphics, infinite graphics, and the point. And the point is that for one of the vertices, a number of decimals is finite. So, we can define a problem corresponding. This is a process of Marcovian, so that implementation of the position presentation. And this will define what passes the criminal territory, independent form of what there is. In the past, and between the possible becinos that have this verticals, the projection is a part, and we advance. And then tomorrow, the same decision to independently pass, and form the decimals. And we have a champion that I could say. And here what I intend, and this is very important, are what are. And we can establish. That is what we imported from this. Other point that other idea will be in numerous occasions: we are problems that can define finites, or combinatory, and we will see. And we will see infinitesimals. So, the motivations are very concrete, combinatorially, but all that will try to do. So, and more specific to majority, and a very specific way for what we want to 3 and several times. And so more forms, so that the bushes like a plan, the bushes with a plan, because it is more, but it must be. And the result of this type of graphics is that this dimension, the transitory. So this significant positive probability that the challenges are not regressed, and that eventually regresses. Entalmente ya no regrecara. And the forma habitual form in the queue sole in usial serene una glama que cutani y diciendo que si a boracho in the pueblo, de seboracho en alguomento regrecaríía su casa, but if there is a borach, so poverty algorithm is three dimensional in the moment and not regret. So this are the This are the dimensions in which this practices will work. And there are other important dimensions that is the dimension 5. So in 50, we are completely proprietary more fully. Or consider two electoral champions that are independent, like this roja and this verde. And this verde. So, these champions can intersect or not. And that is part of the dimension 5 in which we have a positive probability of not all intersections. In dimension 3 and 4, the transitory electoral, but intersecting the other champion, some independent electronics. In dimensions, it is sufficient to understand that these two electors. Two independent electorators have a chance to do not encourage a campaign. And we know also because this consideration of two electors intersects relevant. Let's see two abodes of electoral chambers. First, the electoral code and segment are caminators. And that segment are charging electoral infinitesimals. And the name are based on descriptive porgual para figurines with a day. We have the chaminata law with cyclos borrows or the random vocabulary. And here to simplify the exposition first, you can change passes. All these, but also the. But also the point that was the initial point, that was the last. And we radio that significantly, we have the chronological change, and we will read all the cycles that will go into our champions, here this cycle, the simplest buy, and implement the ultimate. And that is relevant that I So we are boring cycles, for example, we are like, we are the ultimate, and then we have a simple change between the point, and the point and this. That series is our champion. This is a model that was definitely by university subcenter. And I hope to universality of other models that consider for us. Results that do not universality, but the time can be said that this model by 2000. And wear 30,000 victory, all eventually where we are definitely in the space that interests us that are sufficiently great, of course, that are all normal. In the treatment, doctor, what? So, we simply aquí eligo que first pointo se el sero. So, if the future has a total campaign, and in the past, you have another chaminato that is independent. So, this changed the authority that I was the passado, we also lost in the time. Well, the champion loses the time or the individuals negative and we obtain their champions that are indexed by the enterprise and finite process protecting two finishes. And that is an election arbitrary election if you do. We decide that the point, the distribution of probabilities. Because what is important is that the future, how the passage, which is negative, have the distribution of the camera. So, this plan for the rest of this chart, we know the borrows, this will construct the first model of today, which is the uniforms or uniform spanning trees in English. Uniform Spanish tradition in English. Mientro is that the electoral champions with two infinites, but definitely segundo model of the day, that are the actor. And the general information is a model that comes to my doctoral doctor. My entrance model is something that comments during my postdoc. So the first one. Of algo, generadores, uniforms. And this algo combinatorial consideration finite graph with next, we mark it. All for this graphic, combinatoric, and all the vida, we are a general gender, it is a subgraphic graph that aristes passing vertices, but not general cycles, because it is a And this only is one example of possibles generated, but the number of generators of G, is finite. So, a infinite collection of their graphics. And the uniform general is some uniform distribution about this with generators. So, if this definitely paragraphs. Graphicas, infinitas. And I loved a infinite graphic, which one of the today, you know, definitely this in this and what you have infinite volumes is that the arbor for the conecidad and we are considering. So, the sir because they are. Sir, because there are general uniform general established, but the boss generated uniform. And well, one is that we are a little discussion about the name and implementation of these things that have been taken to define the form in media decirule for and I can see that and space to create these graphics finites. This subgraphic finites there is a associated idea, the uniformity, and we limited them. And that is a complex table to construct this object, but today we are going to change the channels. And that is the form tool. And for this, with the algorithm of Wilson, infinite results. The algorithm of Wilson is more qualificative for. It is to produce finitas. And Benjamini Lyons peram, the extended expansion to function infinites where the actor was transitory. So it was infinite. And that allows when the distribution of the role generated from the voice that generated a uniform description is available. So, we have a So, we are not finito, we are tomorrow the vertices and thereby, and we see how the general diploma in those passes for those vertices. And we will see a solution of their graphics, which is a serious, verbo, education, and cabinet of the pas that will terminate the algorithm that will have license. A queen will have the distribution that correspond to the subgroup that generates uniform. So, in the first place, the first passion. And this is the part of infinite part because in the sense, and that we are the integration, we are watching the books. So, we are the first vertices, and we have a champion. We have a champion with cyclos vocabulary. And this is not a simple change and this value has intersected what if you are, but like the first pass, especially the vaccine, because we will have and this implementation will hardly say and the actual borrows infringement. So, we are told the aristocracy that contramos in this camino, the agreeably, and these local iteramos vertices. They vertically, the scientists that have to let go, intersect this moment, and if you want to generate. And this is that in the distribution of the views that generate porvec corresponding to the voice that is generated uniformly. No, they can't have a Yes, in the practice, also important. Os here is courier established because it is sufficient for distribution in cylinders, and this defines good sufficient to define the probability of σ, but But in the practice that has some vertices that are special, and that can be discussed because it is formed, and not a important form of cojas, if you will, with the distribution of distribution. Okay, well, what mention is because it can be very utilized, that is a no quiet cojournal, puel itself and say, I don't know how to explore. Bueno. Te gracias por la plegunta. Y the segundo que tamino nos puede ver de formos mos esidilla consta construction esporque es unbosque. So if we are tomando encada paso, we are born the ramas del arbor concaminatas aliatorias. So that is the cyclicals. So we are first passing, it is a total concise borrow infinite. Infinite, and in second pass, if we are in the dimension of majority that are positive of what we have with what we consider this moment, and possibly what we terminate is a component with this infinite component. And for the form that this algorithm, we generate cycles, we are learning, so we are observing. We are finally components connected. And of course, infinite name of components and explorers, we all know. What is more impressionable is that dimension two here connects us to a narrow queen. What we have to do is a boss. So, So, what is the dimension of 3 por es implemented uniforms? Because this first part of the part only well in dimension of iguana 3, we have a narrow descriptant. So, this is understanding how. This is like a spacometric space, and they are spaces like what we have. So, the general uniform is three abstract space that has intrinsic social form natural form. If a chamino and distances between aristocrats that champion the record, it is the intrinsic distance that the distance of the graphic distance. May also have a form of natural form of definite formulas, the media and control, so that is the number of vertices that have been. We consider the formula that the general uniform Uniform with all these defines that para came vertices, also identified and between the aristocracy that presents an interpolation. And so all this indefinitely tomorrow we favorito and definitely rice. All we have is a spacemakrico that is a real, we cannot. That one in this space metric because they have 3 with a raised and with a media. So, these have a good space. And we want to see the tirad many times, and we will go. We don't know who we are to many people who have the piece, but the narrative asymptotic will study one possibility. So, that is a very great form of expicures. Here the distances reverse is more than escono. So, this is the tomb for metro details, and we are detailed value. And we're going to see that value. And, for example, in the space, in this moment, when the 10, because we are the three, basically. But when we have a distance between these same points, we have space client density of graphical distance. And the champion, in the space, in the arbitration generated uniforms, also more complicated. So, this is like this graphical description: what is more of the uniforms, that parameters are there, and in the description, significantly the elements that define our space. If the encouragement for delta, the media can be quite scalar because vertices will have the unitary. You are the model in 3. And the distance of more cuidado is exponents that Carlos Mejía, like this base, when. This will scale when we consider the symptoms. For example, in the campaign when we convert, the exponent we do here the exponent that we are beta, which is not simple that is a number that exists, and this is a relatively different. So, existing exponent beta que selling the exponent recently of the porous in cyclos in these three porous. In cycles, in 7 threads, because we can scale so that this does not, that is general. And this form is going to be our uniform. Here, a commentary estimate is the principle. The option consequences about the same. Consequences about the media with them, more consequences of the scalam of the intrinsic distance with all and the result. This more is that we are a narrow society to a unified case, and we have the distribution of stages, the distribution of the talator, so. Latoria conciples borados. So, um, a good part of studying uniforms well the tourist concept. There is a working work for a mitigation of the arbitrary, but this concept is point of mission, and some things are more facilities. And I will continue to say that. And David Croydon and I in Tokyo. So, we consider the role generating uniforms that comment, and what we laid, correspondingly, have limited subsequent limits with me of the basic. Of the baser. And if one specifically in the subsequent two seconds, there can be this convergence. And in certain time, I could think, but not the convergence completed, and what we have is what these restrictions. That restrictions that are restrictions that limit to a remote of the army. And just working with Xingili and especially, a men who are well, we have here a vehicle that is listed that immediately, what we have in this first. What are these first work? And we have the convergence of these conformities. And for their idea of what we can also say, this spacious limited space is that if we are a spacious modular space, that have limited entonces of the dimension of the cause of 3 cases. What is this thing in this limit, but we have a total, that has a layer, and this object or something that we have with probabilities, in this case, how probability, one, the dimension of Hausdorffe, and this beta especially exponential of the tool with it. I understand that typo of results in that. That type of results in these ramas del three dimensions. And clearly, this relationship with what we need to know about the limits of scala. And to simplify, consider a change that is tie to the first sale of the unitary. And we don't have the aquatics that we have the space with. The space with the uniforms here also we have the space and this will be a parameter of the distancing between macercamos. The first result to circle the limits of limits of champions with them. But the problem is a topology that has the intrinsic distance. So we have the form, that is the But the parametrization. And the parametrization is all specific in this season two and what we proximate is that this comprehension. This comprehension, the podemos convulses the upgrade, so that in increments diadicos, if it is to delta. So that is what it is necessitating for me for the information, we have the comprehension for it. And here what upgrade. Upgrade, and one of the various fundamentals to provide results. It is understandable what is the probability that one of the three independent gamma intersects, all here we have, and we have a champion of the tool in the retreat. We are in retreat that is independent. And the point that this initiative of Gamma exists a good probability of intersection between these two curves. And that significantly, when we join the algorithm of Wilson, can control what are the electors that will detect electoral communities have the proprietors who do not see. And well, if you can. But now I have another model that only changed a little time for a lot. And this has fundamental problems. In this case, what is a change in the actor in the discrete? It is the discrete longitude in the identifications corresponding. Again, the identification of correspondent identifications is correct on the final. And well, yes, we are correct theory evidently, we are currently all. And that is also the covert esord in the day what this distancia delays the fundamental project. So, Así que la question es go y que pasa cuando estamos casí, but when all cover all when we have this parameter that is intensified and we will say migrants, so we will see the time covert, but if you express that confuent vaccine more friends, and those are questions that are. And I think that is considering especially for it. And we have this infinite escape, in the same way. And we definitely process between the actors. And this process was definitely to study this with it. So there is another motivation. So that's a idea simple, that are central to all processes of people, all control processes in its first current probability, and the processes that are in point. So, you have points what we have infinitely different. So, we are going to see how we. And this will be in dimensional 3 and we decide to por double space of chambinos doublement that is living in these chambers. So the event is a process of And well, there are some intensity, and essentially what is that the elements of W have the distribution of a limited element. One construction is complicated, and that the work of the same thing. Because the work of Didman is very good because it is trivial. But what is relevant for the propositions of today's queen esteems, and like a champion of the total. So, conform what we are doing, which is some etiquette. So, these are how we are etiquette, which is blended, and we are. And if we change the infinite in this page of this and the idea is that this similar to the intensity, when we are dealing with the change in the torque, the correlation significantly. And that is the same. We are. We les cumula the etiquette, we have massive grand, weirdo with massive electoral infinitesimal. So, it is the intensity, and the central electoral defines a graphic that is all the vertical. Well, we have the champions of the tools of infinite elements that have been strictly ignored that we have all the same graphics. Here, I want to do a claración that first works like interesting, all that in the conjunto de vertices that are occupied, and the conjunto developes that not occupados. Here, what interesting are we considering the aristocracy that works for some of these electors? And well, we have this graphic, and it is a graphic. And it is a graphic with probability one. So, if we want two vertices that centralize the actors, a chamino que los connect. And this biennial master of the first paper of Steedman, and considering that we connect through aristocracy, who have worked for electoral chambers in the original process, independent. It is independent and simultaneous for two groups of procedure and Johann Tikes, and the other, and Arthur Saposhnikov. So we have this graphic that is connected, and we consider their intrinsic distance, like we have a form. So, we have to equidate because well, we have. Well, we have and we are not in the situation of one of those or valleys. So we tomorrow the infimo delos chaminos in the entry the torrentio que están entrequí si llano aquí es como vaante clar que es lo que deviar es useder a musun, aque ten musotra, etc. And we put our notion of distances for this finish. Distancia so that this definitely para queera equi encetad because the different generador uniform is not this definite about all the points of lattice points, but a subject of points and for what we can ignore. I have primarily and that. Equa, and that is not the entry of the total. So, notar como equispa corchete de el vertis more cando enlightro la segmento la torio equisprima. So, if these vertices medical distances will be the most important thing that is in the entry of the total, well, in the graphic. And this is in the entry theory. This is a very simple distance. This simple parameter is function of this indefinite function two vertices of setting. And we have to understand asymptotic. And I provide this convergence. So violence la distancia between And in here, they are considering here, and in veces one of the first vector canonical vectors. And conform this distances will receive linearly, and converges to a number that convergence is part of the consequences of the argument superditio. But the important part is that this time and what this definitely directions here, we are like what reality is what direction in RD, we consider it, and how we do the distances between distance. Distancia between the points that we are handing to support this linear linear. So, in the limit, what we obtain is a normal and a normal form of society. And well, this type of more of the form, and present. Of the form, and they are present in many models. And that is a question in the majority of elloss, in the case that are interested in the associated concept that would be the asymptotic normal. And then we know for the central electoral. There are trivial escape, because if you are very, very spacious, so if you are very great. Well, if you are very great, I am allowed to enter the topic, especially as the norm would be comparable to the norm. And in general, this is part of the result of Cherni Pupov, is that these satisfaction. This satisfaction that the normal norm is comparable with the norm. And this is more important, but also the change in the history that is very similar to the change in the topic in this and not that historically because we interested a gimen, very particular. Regiment very particular, which is when the intensity is baj because when it is very powerful, that is what succeeds because it's when it is sufficient only a solitary. And so, when you limit all this solitary activity, with a lot of sin, what we have to do is, Wendriamos este para constante de time con respondiente esque el rebu de here de verada ser similar to normados, la una vola. So we are what is a conjecture that the comportament when huba sero chambia similar to this comportamento de lattice queer comportamento escrito que seat. This comportment is great that it is trivial to a comport that is more candid to escape what we are using. And this is the result that also works with my two soldiers here that have the post-equality and Ron Rosandar. And also mention to RAT and Palace Rat and Saphnikov that is to be edited in a very initial project. And here we see what is important of the constant and time when you have superiors and inferiors. That's simple to understand the admission. It is one. And this entire form in the escalando with respect to the intensity when it was the superior is that this as one between them. And the inferior case we have, but we have a correction of epsilon. So we have precisely, we have to calm epsilon. We have to epsilon exist a yaw that is interval between a formally interval, we have these superiors and inferiors. That indicates what respect to what the form of the society to the time. And very likely in their lag here, my dear inferior, this is the difficult part. And it is clear because it's based with construction champions. If there are a champion that satisfies, but inferiors that are all possible yodels, satisfaction in this cottage, you have a control much more of what. And they find a little like three minutes of the idea in this inferior. And simple so that they understand the formal queue optiene terminals of the intrinsic distance is that this porri pora vajo por est núme. For these numerous numbers, and that this is with positive probability, a positive probability that is not dependent on. So, we can also limit when it comes to the same thing. The probability for this part of it, and we can technically like one of these constructions. These constructions, habitual, utilized normalization in multiple scales. Because we are minding between more and more legados to control that living in our space in cases. This is a cash that contains our control and the difference between this and this exponential. And this contains other people, and if we are. And then the sero, we have the sero, and this can be good or more. And a cajes buenas, yes, region of the series, we have the cotton, we have interest, and a cajes malas, yo. And when we go on, and the cantida queen malas is peculiar. Malas especially the density, for a region. And well, these are very great rags, the types of things. And these are the areas. And one thing that I mentioned is that the result of the functional reason is because we have civilization between them, between them, because it is. Because in this type of process, we have correlations and to these correlations and that interference in our work. We are machines that are constructed in these years for this type of functional argument. And I think well, 2 minutes more in local elements. Those who are in the local element, in the service. First, the service is not that very precise, and not going to be much of what are the numerous actors that are necessary, but this is important. Unondo can be the numerous one that has, but the giometric areas. So, that one clearly. And what happened when very quickly is that your cash, when we are the sero, and we are a double idiometer. And we want to distances between. And only the two areas and that do not interact with us. So implement tendriamos, the tendril. The entry, we see what distances intrinsic of this electorate in dimensional menu. But that is the reality, the related intersections of various electoral variables. It is significant that we note the distances of a child of a cluster of electoral children. And that's going to be that complicated. But we have to manage and And we can dominate stochastic number, and the number of intersections that interviendes. So, to cluster, if there are intersections between the elements, the cluster elements, we are dividing this in MMA for decirgo. And for principle, the case will exist a new intersections between the elements of the clusters. So, what we are seeing exists a region where our children are where we can apply our estimations. This history doesn't care because we don't have to control the intrinsic distance between these other intersections. For this, if you have very good studio por Greg Loller, when this study is. When we are studying the concise, that is in the first part. You thank you to the work that I mentioned, but we can understand the intrinsic standards for a individual. And with our argument that implement the great grandmother, we can see this implication that we parametric for our model. And this is implemented from this business that all the geodesics are dominated by a leg that we implement the client when you do that first pass, but for what many of you are doing. Thank you so much for your platica and por to commentarios encuentro with our plateau. Well there questions I have questions. Well, if you vasaya very platica, the principles about the exponential veta que No, well, that is a put. No, well, that is a figure, and they are existing, but a little comfortable because there are no, but there are like the principles in the first part of your platform with this habito dears. De losing the press. Yes, yes, there is no security here. A moment is no, no, no, no, try. No, okay, ah, yeah, we go. Well, as I completely here, it is that one rango typical para veta or. Ah, that me pregunta. Well, I never refer this con. Ah, oh, ah, okay. Estaslando de U, como este conjunto de la generador uniform. No, no, no, no. This is not, this veta en relida associated to the uniform. This veta simplement music can define what is definition. But veta is one of them, it is the number of passes that need the chambers for this volume, a nice change in the region, which is y the time. So, the longitude of this game is very passionate that.  That exists. If depending on it, for the point of point, is that their numero que simplement is modern specific model and the dimensional queue of this work. And when you have a mien. Okay. Okay. And other questions between the norms that definitely in the segment. That tiences that when it parcels the Uclidian norm, and when it is more than separate when it seems to the norm of the taxino. There is a typo of interpolation between these norms that. Well, we cuando positive and comparable norm. That when you go there, this is comparable to the normal two, that is for this moment. That is something that we are saying. And that is a type of interpolation, because we are entosed to see the spectrum. Gracias. Gracias, very much gracias, but many politicians, and you're just very padded. Because the terrestrial mention of existence and comment that don't yield. And comment that the numerical via some algorithm that allows approximately 100%. Well, David Wilson is at Microsoft, and I create that rationale, and the story vacuum uses that. So, it's a paper that exponents about the uniform. About the uniformest, no, the gross exponent of the previous random walk, in the approximation numeric approach, and the conclusion of this paper that rational paper. So, no que vista puels are algorithms, but the vertical form is efficient. Okay, many. And the other point is: when the normal definition, the distance between two points, and for some points that are introduced. And that for some point that this entropy linguist, the projectas almost, no, and calculated distances between two points so that it points more than that problem. You are important because well, definitely regularly, we are talking about this format. I don't know what this Is that this regulation principle for the empathy? Similarly, transformations of this so that we consider these well that are not romp for this decision arbitrarily that we can see and problem. Ferran, tieno una pregunta ola soy ferran Valdez de la Unam. Mucho gusto. Etienna pregunta, no yen la person pregunta que espando sobre el para metro veta de nao osa cómo electo de que para cirtos veto how veto empone algobla dimension de jausdorf. In a mental heist for the veto that converge sociometric and spacérup. The intuition is that to prove what the dimension of jausdorge needs to have control over what the volume of the intrinsic metric. So what is it that is. What is it that para these volumes of the intrinsic metric we have superiors and inferiors that are not the intrinsic metrics have superior and inferiorly to reality expression of 3 correction logarithmic and So that is how I question holistic response correctly and what there is, but the problem is because the control of the intrinsic control. I have a question as our platforms, what you can provide, but what respects how the two limits of the platforms, but the first time we have craft and the digital in the cases of a braja, utilization, chaminatas, intersecting chambers. Caminatas intersect. But I don't get Crofton Technica. Crofton, the formula of Crofton. The formula of Crofton. Ah, okay. Let me generalize that longitude. The idea general queen proportionalities in intersections. In this type of work, so no, that's a artistic interpretation. Also, as general ideas, this is illustration, and more respect, but it is for the tenants. Here is a mystery, no escrow for what limits as I do, but what if explicit queen que pass when a parametro grandeur for many conjuring. Conjuring when we were much, and we have some and we passed the media, like for the artificial. Ah, yes, for the puzzlement, not this. It's algo distinct. That is one. Yeah, that's what I don't know. Okay. So no quality, for example, can work in graphics of Kaili demo of groups of matrices, like Heisenberg or groups of pervolka. Y per tonnes that. Please all of the series, like all that for these other spaces and not yes completed possible. Okay.
