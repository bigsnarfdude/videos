Coming at our ten years. Really great. Last time I was here in December, so it's great. Hopefully look forward to hiking and all those activities. So today what I want to tell you about is some of the work we've been doing in understanding how protosomes in cancer cells and immune cells sort of allow the cells to grow through the extracellular matrix. Now, how many of you have heard cortisomes? Okay, protosomes. Protosomes. Okay, great. So, a lot of stomes, you know, invadosomes, philopodia, lamellopodia, so protosomes are much less well studied, right? And though a lot of the machinery that the cells use to form protosomes are the same as the other structures. And this is particularly relevant in the context of cancer. So, as you know, primary tumor can always be removed. So, it's when the cancer becomes metallic. When the cancer becomes metastatic, that from one organ it can move to the other organ, all the different organs. And so 90% of the cancer deaths are due to metastasis. So our lab is part of the National Cancer Institute metastatic network. We are really trying to understand if the primary tumor is, say, the breast tumor, breast cancer, right, will it eventually end up in the bone or in the brain or Bone or in the brain or things like that. And mechanical forces play a very important role in it. And in particular, starting from the primary tumor, you have these indexosomes that allow the cells to break through the base membrane, going to the stroma, and then also allow the cells to get into the blood vessel from where they can go to other orchids. So, invadosomes are really important in both these contexts. And immunotherapy, cancer immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, cancer immunotherapy has become quite a popular sort of idea to sort of kill cancer cells. So the idea there is also to take remote blood cells from the patients and then introduce molecules in there which allow these T cells to recognize cancer cells and then inject back. So in the process, when you inject them back, they again have to do the opposite of what the cancer cells do. They have to escape the blood. To escape the blood, go through the base membrane and then go into the tumor. So, today I'm going to be focusing on portosome. So, this here is a dentalic cell sitting on a substrate. And the structures that you see here are portosome. So, they are sort of formed. Protosome and these parasols are the same cells. They're not, they're not. I'm coming. That's the next slide. That's the next slide. So, invertosong is a gelato, photosome is an inveterosol. Portosome is an invertosome. Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right. So, right. So, these are structures, and here is a little bit of a magnified view or a cartoon of what cortisomes do. So, in the core of the cortisone, there are conical structures, and in the core of the cortisone, there is active polymerization, right? And on the sides, there's a cone. So, on the periphery, you have these additional molecules, which is integrated. Molecules, which is integrins, bincolin, talin, etc., which are all mechanosensitive and they pull. So, overall, there has to be mechanical equilibrium. So, it's like you want to pull grass or something and you're kind of pulling it. So, that's pulling and you collect, that's going to be pushing. So, it's exactly that idea. And so, coming back to your question, so inverosomes generally means these protosomes and what are called inveropodia, or people. Or people, some people call them telepodia as well. And so, here all the molecules that form these structures are very, very similar. You have integrines, you have the plaque proteins, you have different types of actin filaments, as mycin, all the components are the same, and cells can decide which ones they are going to. That's not going to be my focus today. So, what I want to do is in the beginning, talk about how Dynamics of individual protosomes. How do they really invade? Is it a periodic motion? And how do they communicate? That's very important because for the cells to relate to the basal membrane, there has to be some coordination between these. And in fact, what we found is what are called chemomechanical diffusion waves, right? Diffusion is like DCDP is grad squared. Wave is like the second derivative is grad squared. So how do you get waves from these sorts of things? Waves swam these sorts of things. So, with diffusion-like motions, that's going to be my focus today. And please do interrupt, ask questions. So, time permitting, we've also looked at the similar same phenomena in Indianopodia. And here, so the key you have a question? So, the key the key here is that the they share a lot of similar mechanisms. They share a lot of similar mechanisms. I forgot to mention that a lot of the work I'm going to be presenting is going to be theory. And so a lot of the experiments are done by in Alessandra Cambi's lab in NiMehin. So Peter Friedel is part of our consortium, so she's his colleague. So they are kind of international collaborators on our U54 brand. Okay, so this is what I'm going to be talking about: sort of the protosomes and then time permitting in Vedapuria. Time permitting in Vedapuria. But I understand this conference is cell mechanics and polygonal mechanics. We've been quite in network mechanics. I don't know if I'll have time, but we've also been very active in understanding force transmission in collagen networks. And in cancer stroma, you would have a lot of glycosaminoglycan. There's very little or practically no work on the role of these charged molecules on collagen networks. So we developed a theory for it. I don't know if you'll have time, but. Theory for it. I don't know if you'll have time, but I suppose there's some post-the session or whatever. So happy to discuss more if I don't get to it. Alright, great. Now let's look at individual protosomes. So this here is an array of protosomes imaged with LIFE Act as well as internal reflection microscopy. And so here LIFE Act will tell you that it is high intensity. That means actin is formalizing. Is formalizing, right? Here it's the opposite. When you get close to the sort of the you know, to the glass underneath, it's going to be clouded. Is this one cell? Yeah, this is one cell, and you're looking at multiple protosomes in the same cell. And so now you see that these protosomes are undergoing sort of a periodic motion. You're kind of doing this from both techniques, from both IR and inverse IR and static. And now you can also look at, you know, you can look at individual cortisols, you can zoom in and look at. Portisomes, you can zoom in and look at these protosomes, and again, you see periodic motion. And if you look at the time scales, there are minutes, five minutes, ten minutes, that's sort of right. So, what we want to understand is what controls these oscillations. That's sort of number one. So, it's not that an individual one can appear and disappear, but you always have one which is getting kind of larger and smaller. It's both, it's both, but we are focusing on an existing one, but existing ones can disappear. We've not gotten to that. ones can disappear, we're not gotten to that. So we are looking at ones that are already there that are sort of doing this. Right? I mean, because cells can also assemble. That's a nucleation problem. That's a lot more complicated. So we're looking. So just the oscillation, it's getting more intense, like brighter and yeah, more polarization. So that you know, so if you I'll come to it. So if you look at the length of the portosome that's going up and down, right? So if you go back here, portosome has got a length, right, this this length here. This length here that's going up and down. I'll come to it. Alright, great. It's the length or the whole thing physically moving up and down. It's polymizing, so the length is increasing. But the distal part is stationary and only the tip? Uh both will move. I I I'll come to it. So you can define two lengths. You can define the length of your uh you know, from the top to the bottom and the additional length because I I'll come to it, okay. Because I'll come to it. Okay. Alright. So, bottom line: length is increasing. The references we will come to in a second. Okay. Alright, great. And so, as this is oscillating, so does the viculin ring. So, as you know, as this is getting, as this is polymerizing, you also have the viculin ring that is taking the pet soil force, and that's also appropriately getting activated because viculin is activated by tension. And so, that's a single portosol. Now, when you look at Single protosome. Now, when you look at an array of protosomes, what you're looking at here seems like a 4th of July fireworks, right? So, this is these protosome sort of started polymerizing here, right? They're not really moving. These are different protosomes at different locations getting activated. That's what it is. I'll discuss this in more detail. So, at time t equals 0, these are the ones that are polymerizing. Then, after a while, that polymerization front moves here, here, etc. And so you have this radial wave property. So, you have this radial wave of picture. Now, if you can also look at a cluster and you see this sort of, you know, that's act. This is purple is actin and green is wrinkled. So, you can see the sort of motion, which looks random, but there are correlations. Yeah, the upper part, there was an asymmetry where things actually, the polymerization started at the center, you know, due to heterogeneity. Here, this is what typically you will see. Here, this is what typically you will see, but every now and again you can see things like this. So, this is more of the rule. But that looks more. So, that's why I put it there. When you look at it, you know, when you look at it, you know, it doesn't look like a wave, but it is. They have random views. There are correlations between them. Yeah, exactly the same thing. Yeah, yeah, both vendor excels. Okay, great. Okay, great. So, as I said, so the questions you want to ask is: why do cortisomes show oscillatory growth? Then it will come to your question: what are the lengths, etc.? And how are protosomes, oscillations coordinated, leading to this kind of wave-like motion, random or radiant? So, we want to write down a minimal model, right? So, here you have polymerization, here you have binkulin and you have all the adapter proteins. And your audio adapter programs, and your myosins that are pulling. That's what will give you tension. So, what we're going to do is: so, this is the answer to your question, Dan. That we have this length, that's a variable, right? And from there, and then it can also, the polymerization can lead to more length. So, the total length can change, and there can also be contraction on the side. So, L1 and L, L and L one are both variables. But isn't that experimentally? Did people know the dynamics of those types? people but the dynamics so they can measure i'll come to it yeah yeah we can look at we can look at uh actin intensity uh uh right i mean you can't exactly measure the length we need for it from the from life activation and you're not it's not how near you are to the cover store that that is the that is the iron that is the internal so you you know how far how close you are to the counter slip so you have that information as well all right so okay so so everything that is written here is going Okay, so everything that is written here is going to be pretty standard. So there is going to be polymerization here, depolymerization there. The polymerization depends on the force that's exerted. And force can be related to this length here. And in addition, the process is mechanosensitive, meaning polarization involves rack activity. And rack activity is upregulated by stiffness. And so we assume that the So we assume that there's an effect of substrate stiffness here as well. And we see that on stiffer substrates you have more thicker cores. There is more. Sorry, I'm just trying to think about the process. I guess one quick question I had, you said it's the moving up and down. But the oscillations might also come from enhanced polymerization and depolymerization cycles. But a formalization should do two things. As you pointed out, this thing can move down and overall length, right? Overall length is going to increase. That's the oscillation. If the length is fixed, that's a constant. So you're by polymerizing, let's say this is remaining fixed and L1 is increasing. That's going to increase the length. But L1 can move. Alright, right. So that's the polymerization piece. And for college. And for contractility, we take a model wherein there is an active contractile force and there is also passive stiffness. So the total force is the sum of the active component and the passive piece. How this is important because if you treat cells at least in our hands with an inhibitor that completely eliminates myosin filaments, what are some cells really hate? That's not the case here, you see. Not the case here, you'll see. That's not the case here. So, I have studies where, yeah, I'm going to show you data that if you eliminate myosin, they don't really oscillate and they even come apart. And Alessandra can be as less. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Alright, you know, because if you don't have my sin and you don't have tension, you don't even have force balance. So, you've got to get this, it's going to be balanced by something else. Balance by something else. It's not an internal balance. And so there is a membrane. There is a membrane. Yeah, so it may be very. What cell types are you looking at? The THP1, the macrofuge type. Okay, these are delta X. I don't know if it's cell type, but it shouldn't be, right? It shouldn't be. I think there are differences code, of course, exists between but have you looked at nicolin? And so then you remove myosin, ninolin should come off, right? Because you need tension to stabilize nicolina. Because you need tension to stabilize the people. No, no, nothing. Myosin is only negative urgent in our hands. Oh, it's alright. Okay. If you enhance myosin activity, portasomes will go on. But if you completely block myosinum activity, portasomes are very activated. Yeah, I'll show you. The portasomes, you know, they don't oscillate, they come up, come up. You know, so that that's kind of yeah, yeah, absolutely. So so the point is in biopathy, there is always The point is in biology, there is always the redundancy, right? If one goes, you know, if you take something out, something else might kick in, right? I mean, technically it should be open mind. Yeah, yeah, no, absolutely, yeah. Alright, so here, I think in, so the way we are looking at it, row signaling is really, really important. If you use the white compound or bladeset and things like that, eliminate row signaling, then cortisols don't function the way they do. They do. So, the main idea here is that the tensile forces have a passive and an active component. And the active component, as we all know, typically contractivity, if you pull, then the contractivity will increase. So, we have that feedback which I have written here. So, that's the RoRock signaling. And one of the reviewers also wanted more miasin is engaged, then they'll kind of shut off some of these sites, which is not a big deal. The sites, which is not a big deal, but we had to put that in. A couple of others piled on. So we had to put that in, but does it change any physics a whole lot, right? And in addition to this, there has to be force balance. The tensile and compressive forces are balanced. And the contraction here and the lengths, they have to be, there's a geometric coordinate as well. So you put all these things in, what you end up getting is two coupled equations, one for the polymerization force and the other for this. Other force, this misinform force, remember the force balance is between Fr and Fp, the you know, this total force. So, this is the passive piece there. So, you can eliminate all that and then come up with these two. And so, the important point here is that if you look at the dynamics of this, there is the myosin turnover time scale and a polymerization associated time scales, which are both of the order of minutes. And through this mechanochemical feedback, alpha, these things are. Alpha, these things are coupled. So, here Fm is coupled to Fp and it's coupled in this manner, right? And if you do rescaling, then the response, as you will see, will depend only on two parameters. It's the ratio of the myosin time scale to the polymerization time scale and the feedback. With this, now we can draw a phase diagram in this space to see what kind of behaviors you will get for the dynamics of the chromosome. So, what you end up So, what you end up getting is either you start off from, if you look at the cortisome height, which is L1 plus L2, it will start off from some height and monotonically go to a steady state. And this steady state, of course, depends on the myosin force. Or in this space, you get damped oscillations or persistent oscillations. So, here we call it unstable because of the linear regime, this infinite energy input. In this infinite energy input, so you have to put a non-linear region to stabilize this. But here, we are going to be focusing on these two regions primarily. And so, the physics is when you have two competing time scales, it's like a damped oscillator if you do, a couple oscillators. If both these time scales are comparable, that is when you will get oscillations. And more feedback due to row signaling, you will get more oscillations. If one is too big or too small, you are not going to get oscillations. Or too small, you're not going to get oscillations. Everything is going to be monotonic. So these time scales have to be comparable. So in addition, while these oscillations are damped, I'm going to show you in a second, once you put in noise, when you have a damp oscillator with noise, as it starts going to the minimum, the noise will kick it out. So you will basically oscillate with the frequency given by these expressions. I'm not sure. Show you in a second. Okay, great. So that's what this is. So you have this couple. This is so you have this coupled motion. So, the maximum of the myosin force and the maximum of the length, they have a time lag, these are coupled equations. And the oscillation period is, in this case, you know, you get more or less because of noise, you basically get these oscillations. And the time scale is the square root of these two numbers. And now, so I'm coming back to the question of noise. So, if you do not have noise, what So, if you do not have noise, what's going to happen is in this phase, it will just be a spiral, go to that steady point. But with noise, as it goes to a steady point, noise is in both equations. So, you have two first-order equations with noise. Oh, okay, you're just removing it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's always noise. Active noise, thermal noise. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. So, this was a little surprising to me because you were expecting damp oscillations, because of persistence oscillations. But once you put noise, the the the Once you put noise, the time period of these oscillations are given by the same expression we get from the linear theory, but you get a persistent sort of amplitude. So now come back to Sasha's question. So then what we did is we treated this with cytoclycin, we treated this with Y-blapostatin. And you see you don't have the oscillations, they completely disappear. Okay. What about intended your photos on some cells? That there, I mean, the portals, the core size decreases also. I don't have the data here, but you can talk about that separately. Because that tension is really needed. The tension compression balance is needed. If you take out the myosin, there is no other place where you're going to get that. And of course, membrane is a possibility. Yeah, well, what I can say, in our hands, it did not work on oscillations, but it works simply on integrity. Right, so your silverboard sitting on glass exactly. So your silverbot sitting on glass exactly like this? Yeah. Okay. And what we saw is that if you eliminate myosin, what are some still exist? We did not notice any kind of decrease of brightness. They are very beautiful. On the other hand, if you increase myosin activity, you can eliminate brightness. Simply, if you, for example, activate myosin by any Activate myosin by any means, then odasomes simply gone and focal adhesion will appear instead. Right, and the third thing, you can eliminate polar stock by any treatment that increase men-ventures. So, for example, hyperasmotic shock, all of this better cyclotextin. We can discuss that. Yeah, definitely. So I can imagine that would be certain type difference. Probably. And also, it is by no means a criticism of the theory. The theory is fine, but the ferromodal theory is yet to come. So this was the fun part is coming. So this is basically a couple system, it shows oscillation. System, it shows oscillations, but how do we get these coordinated waves and all the 4th of July fireworks? So, that's what I'm going to get to talk about next. So, now as these photosomes polymerize and depolymerize, they're going to release actin. And this actin can go diffuse, right? So, two chrotosomes that are oscillating can coupled through the diffusion process. So, if this protosome is oscillating and letting actin out, so that can diffuse and that can further lead to positive. Can diffuse and that can further lead to polarization nearby. So, what's going to happen is we can write down the diffusion equation of actin. And in that, so this is the standard DCDT, the standard diffusion equation, but there can be sort of sinks if it's taking up actin. And that has to do with the rate at which these cortisols are growing. And so, what you have is, you have all these different cortisols, each one doing its dynamics, coupled through the diffusion field. Through the diffusion field, you know, the acting diffusion field. So that's basically what it is. And what we can do is we can either set up a discrete system like this, and I'm going to show you a movie in a second. And in here, you know, the size here sort of represents the height, the total length. And also the color. Blue is like not polymerizing, red is, you know, blue to red, it's polymerizing more and more. Can you explain the second part of this? I do say. Dilutes the acting is very important. So this is consumption of actin. Consumption of actin due to polymerization. Okay, and right and so this is basically the polymerization speed. Yeah, it's a sink. It's a sink. Sync. Sync. And the velocity of polymerization will depend on the local actin concentration. So everything is coupled. So the actin concentration is a spatially dependent variable and each photosome oscillation is coupled. Portosome oscillation is coupled to that diffusion theorem. So that's really the idea. Alright. So here, what we do is a discrete simulation where we are going to assume, coming back to your question, what happened in the middle. So we are actually going to initiate polymerization there and see how that sort of spreads. So we start off from there and you see that in a minute, you see wave-like phenomena, right? This is oscillating, and then you can see these radial. And then you can see these radial waves emanating and moving out. Alright, so you see this nice wave front propagating out. And we can also do it in a completely continuum model. You don't really have to have a discrete model. So what you do is we have a PDE that looks at the diffusion equation and at every point in space we have a high behavior or a polymerization behavior. So it's like a distribution. So, it's like a distribution, a PDE with a distributed ODE. At every point, we're solving that. And with that, too, you can nicely see this. So, the important point to notice, this starts off red, so it's polymerizing. And there is a clear phase relation between this and the next ring. And this goes blue, the next one goes red, and vice versa, right? So, so, yeah. So, five minutes. Okay. Is it obvious that active monomers are actually rate limited? Active monomers are actually rate limiting, or is there also performance and the active polymerization? Yeah, assuming it's all the polymerization that's rate limiting. So, this is all diffusion limited, basically. But it could be catalyst that catalysts, not the monomerize. Could be, it could be. So, you've got to change the boundary condition instead of that DLDD, you've got to put a kinetic term that will say how fast it will polarize. You can do that as well. So, in principle, it can be checked by different doses of atonement. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We have that. We have that. Yeah, absolutely. We have that. Alright, I give you five minutes. So, the bottom line: why do you form these waves and what's related to their wavelength? So, what's going on is, imagine that this thing is big. So, this will start depolymerizing because your forces are strong enough to stop polymerization. So, as it depolymerizes, these active polymers will go diffuse. You can then induce a polymerization at the neighboring spring there. And once that happens, what's going to happen is that now this is at its maximum height. This will start depolymerizing. So it will spread that information both ways. So in this manner, in time, you're going to get these waves. And if you do it in a random setting, then what you are going to see is that you get these random waves. But there's a correlation between them. You can do this. mean that. You can do this sort of random polymerization and see how they are coordinated. So in this case, you still get wave-like motion and the wavelength is the square root of the active diffusion and t is the time period of the oscillosum. So, right, this is meter square per second. That's second. So square root is a length. So that's basically the wavelength of these chemo mechanical diffusion radius if you look. And now if you look at two And now, if you look at two cortisols that are close to each other, their motion is correlated. But if you start going far away, they are uncorrelated. So, you can from modeling and simulations, you can look at that as well. And now you can do all sorts of, you know, you can use cytoklycin, you can use bernostatin, you can use the Y compound and you can sort of see how by changing either the oscillation frequency or the G-actin consumption rate, which actually does depend on stiffness. Actually, it does depend on stiffness because lack activity depends on stiffness. So, on softer substrates, you see less of a less wave propagation. So, the model also predicts these waves, the properties of waves on stiffness as well as pharmacological treatments. So, what I've shown you here is that you get wave-like phenomena, and it's a combination of oscillation and diffusion. Oscillation, of course, diffusion can give you waves. Kind of give you waves. And they are chemo-mechanical because they clearly depend on mechanical forces. Both the road signaling and rack signaling are mechanical sensitive. So, right? And we have two minutes? Okay, so I'm not going to talk about the filipordia. I just want to definitely want to talk about the networks. So, in the cancer micro-environment, hyaluronic acid is also highly overexpressed. And hyaluronic acid. And hyaluronic acid basically leads to swelling of collagen networks. And so, when you account for this, I'm going to go to the main conclusion. What happens is, when you have two cells, this actin network is swelling. So, when you swell, it is hard to align the collagen networks. The reason is when you swell, it is hard to buckle the collagen fibers in the opposite direction. So, as a consequence, if you have So, as a consequence, if you have one sphere here, the other sphere sitting here, both contracting and a collagen network, if it is purely fibrous, no glycosemino glycans, the displacement fields go like 1 over R. Now, that's a monopoly decay. It's called long-range force transmission. If you put a dipole, it would go like 1 over R squared. So, here is 1 over R. But then, if you only had the glycosaminoglycans, that's not a fibrous material, DK is 1 over R squared. By changing the gas. Squared. By changing the gags, we can come up with an analytical expression, which depends on what the nonlinear fiber stiffness is, the osmotic swelling, and all that type of thing. And we've actually validated this working with Becky Bells, where she can change the amount of hyaluronic acid. With that, I'll be happy to take any other questions if you can color any. So, the photosome work was done by a really bright postdoc, Zirk Gong, who has its own. Zerg Gong, who has its own lab now at USTC in China, the top engineering schools there. He's got a thousand talents position there. And so these are our collaborators. Happy taking investments. Go ahead. Have you checked for the radial wave? Have you checked the influence of the Check the influence of the diffusion coefficient of the G-actin and the rate of polymerization when you change both. Are you observing different? So you can use cytoklixin or electroniclin, things like that, and that will decrease the wave propagation speed. Okay, because it also polarization is important also for oscillation field. There is a diffusion of G i kin I don't know how you change it. I I don't know. How do you change it? I don't know. That's something that's harder to change. No, no, I know. So if you just talk mathematical speaking, we do have an expression. In Android, we have an expression for For see the oscillation frequency, as I showed you earlier, it depends on the time scales, it depends on you know, and also the G-actin consumption rate. So, so each of these, so if you look here, blabostatin, Y, cytoklycin, each one of them is going to affect the oscillation frequency of the individual cortisome and the wave propagation properties. Note if there's any microtubules involved that they kind of ask the membrane. Okay, yeah, yeah. So she will read the massage. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Microtubule, if anything, microtubule will have an effect on contractility. That's the way I would look at it, right? So if you get rid of microtubules, it will affect contractility, right? It will increase contractility. So you can go to the model and we immediately know what the effect of that is. Contract leading is in it. So that's a simple way I would look at it. Okay, yeah, yeah. Okay, yeah, yeah. You know, really hard to keep track of all the papers out there, right? Yeah, yeah. That reminds me, actually, there's work done back in the 80s, and I think I did following this in the 90s, and where on microtubule systems, they're very similar, where you polymerize them and basically cfence, and the size actually helped nucleate the microtubules. And so they would grow, but then So they would grow, but then basically they would go under a dynamic stability, and you would get basically waves which would come in from the outside. It looked exactly like yours, except the waves went the opposite direction. It's the same principle in having this diffusion of the free units. I mean, again, I already ran out of time, but once we got this, I was kind of wondering, have other people done this, right? There is an article in the American Institute of Physics from about 10 years ago where similar phenomena is seen in optics. Similar phenomena is seen in optics. In fact, they're called diffusion waves, right? And you have these oscillators, and in some limits, light diffuses. So I don't think in this context we sort of discovered it, we didn't look at other stuff, but I'm sure there are related things in other fields as well. Actually, it means that the main message here depends on diffusion effective, which is fine. And what is actually needed to Actually, needed to sustain the oscillation. Not necessarily myosin. Myotin myosin. No, no, no, the myosin, he's the time period is decided. See, if you look at the time period, that is the square root of the myosin time scale and the polymorph. So myosin is involved. He's definitely involved. And without myosin, right? Probably. So I can fully see a scenario where instead of the tension provided by the Provided by the myosin is provided by the membrane, and you will still get the same physics. Okay, okay, but the physics I don't think is going to change. The time scale may have to do with the membrane remote. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So, this data definitely we should look at that. You had a question? Yeah, uh, just because you were already on the signing the wait to be, were you able to get it? Because you didn't show the BDs, were you able to get that analytic? Or did you? Absolutely, absolutely, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely. It's a very cumbersome expression, a fourth power of omega, you know. So, so, I mean, so that's why we did the continuum model. So, we did the discrete. The PDE is, you know, PDE is very much here, right? It's a PDE, ODE system. It's not just a PDE. It's a spatially varying ODE. So, if you look here, this L1, L2 actually depends on X. So, what you can do is you can do the standard stuff, like E3, omega, and you can plug that in. And you can plug that in, and you can get all that. And there's linear limit, so it's not 100% linear, but we can get it. And so it turns out that it'll be of the form, there will be an imaginary pot and a real pot, because these are diffusion waves, so they decay, right? So it will be in that form. What about the wavelength of the oscillations? What about the spatial prophecy of the oscillation? Is there a. Is there a preferred separation between them? So, so these waves, you know, so the protozoans themselves have a time constant of oscillation, right? So, the square root of the diffusion constant times that time scale is what you saw as when you saw these waves, you know, you saw the spacing between them. That is that bit that right galaxy. Right. But when you show up, photosomes close to each other that are. close to each other that are closer anyway right they seem to be like the the um the spacing between the individual here here like this oh spatial spatial like this is spatial right this is spatial so this is distance between protosomes and that's a correlation so that will decay there is not a preferred separation Yeah, uh that there is, uh there is. You know, so the preferred so this length scale here would roughly be this. The scale over which they will decay will roughly be this. Because see, these are not perfect waves. Perfect waves are correlated to infinity. These are diffusion waves, so there is a length scale. They'll be correlated over that scale. They see different protosome frequencies if they're on different spits. Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, because of the row and the rack. Yeah, because of the row and the rack. Yeah, yeah. And is that something you could model? Like by filling it. We already modeled it and put all the equations in there. We already have lack of row kind of effects. And so I think I fully see what Sasha is saying. It could all be lagged and then the row effect would be through the membrane. It will still do the job. Possible. What I wanted to say, you were speaking about oscillations. Yes. How many oscillations kind of get Kind of can perceive during the lifetime of what I was talking because it appears, then oscillate and then vanish. So the oscillation periods are like 500 seconds, right? Actually the lifetime of individual podasome is 5 minutes. 5 minutes. So this is like more like 2 minutes, 3 minutes, that's all. Because without complete vanishing of podasome, you cannot. Vanishing of polisom, you cannot obtain these waves moving from the center to the period. Existing photosons can do this, right? But polasons, the previous. I think we are out of time, so we can continue this later. Well, it's great fun. Okay, second one.
