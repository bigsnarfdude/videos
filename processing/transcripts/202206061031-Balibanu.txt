I want to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to speak and also to come here to this beautiful place where I've never been before. So the plan is that I will begin by giving you a kind of complex algebraic counterpart of the bile resolution that James described at the end of this talk. And then I will give a kind of suggestion. A kind of suggestive, slightly more general theory that shows how this algebraic counterpart fits inside an area of study called symplectic resolution, which are kind of surrounded by a lot of interesting questions in algebraic geometry and representation theory right now, but have not been studied so much from a Poisson perspective. So let me start throughout. Uh throughout, uh G is going to be a complex, semi-simple d algebra. But if you want, for the whole talk, you can pretend you're this is SONC. And G is going to be a connected algebraic group. over C R integrating this Lie algebra. And then of course, G acts on little G by the adjoint action. And the first thing we can try to understand is what do the orbits of this action look like and how do they fit together. So if I try to take So if I try to take just naively the space of orbits, this doesn't have the structure of an algebraic variety. But what I can do instead is take something called a categorical quotient by this action, which is just the spectrum of the ring of invariant polynomials on the Lie algebra. So the points are maximal ideals in this ring of invariant polynomials, and the topologized Lie algebra. Polynomials, and it's apologized in the usual way as an algebraic variety. And if you think about what do the points in this space look like, they're going to be equivalence classes of adjoint orbits because these adjoint orbits are not necessarily closed. And invariant polynomials can't distinguish between two orbits whose closures intersect. So, this is going to be the space of Adjoint orbits. In the Lie algebra, modulo and equivalence relation that says O1 and O2 are equivalent if and only if their closures meet. We can parametrize the space using the draconian. Using the sort of complex version, what we call the Shovel-Way theorem, which essentially tells us that the restriction map from, so what do I do? I fix a maximum criterion, which you can think of as the subgroup of Which you can think of as the subgroup of diagonal matrices in SLN. And the Chevrolet, and actually, indeed, I fix a maximal criton, and I fix a subgroup, a geiconnected subgroup, integrating it. And then I have the file group list. And then I have the Weyl group associated to this pair, which is just the normalizer of H and G modulo H. And Chevrolet tells us about the restriction map from polynomials on G to polynomials on H. On H induces an isomorphism of algebras between G-invariant polynomials on the Lie algebra and Weil group invariant polynomials on the carton. So then if I think of my quotient map, which I'll call fee, which sends sends G to this adjoint quotient and then applies this isomorphism. What does this quotient map say? It says that every equivalence class of adjoint orbits, every fiber here, intersects the carton in a unique orbit of the wild. And if we're And if we're in SLN, you can think of this map as just taking a matrix A and outputting the eigenvalues of A with multiplicity, but without order. So in other words, the fibers of this morphism are just collections of matrices. Collections of matrices that have the same eigenvalues. There's a theorem, a very classical theorem of constant, that tells us what such collections look like. So a theorem says if I have a point in the Cartoni, then I denote by s bar its image in this quotient. And then the fiber above S bar is an irreducible algebraic variety of codimension equal to the rank of G. And the union And a union of finitely many adjoint orbits, but you need open dense one, a regular orbit, so an adjoint orbit of maximal dimension. And the unique closed one will have minimal dimension, which will be the orbit of the semi-simple element H. So let me spell it explicitly. What this means for the kind of two most distinguished classes of points like this. So I could take S, my element in the carton, to itself be a regular element. So its orbit to have maximal dimension. And this is going to mean that this fiber is, well, the orbit of S and this fiber is going to be both open and closed, so it's going to be the entire fiber. So it's going to be the entire fiber. Which gives some more effect to quotient group modules of Carton. And of course in particular the snow. And sort of at the other extreme, I could take that to be zero. And then the fiber above zero, according to this intuition that I gave you, this is going to be the collection of points in G on which all invariant polynomials vanish. And if we think of invariant polynomials as being something like coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix, then this is going to correspond exactly to matrices with eigenvalues. Whose eigenvalues call zero, which are called nilpotent matrices. Usually I denote this by n, and this is called the nilpotent cone because it's invariant under scaling. So, with this nil potent clone, it can be a little bit more. It contains an open-denis regular orbit, which in SLN is going to be the orbit of the maximal Jordan block. And it contains a unique closed semi-simple orbit. Which is just the order, the orbit of zero, which is zero. And if we draw like a kind of a two-dimensional real caricature of what the space looks like, it looks like a comet. And the closed orbit is here. Everything else is part of the ring. Of the regular orbit, and you can see that in particular it's singular. So I had a non-closed adjoint orbit, which is the orbit of the sky, and when I took its closure, I added some things in the boundaries that created a singular algebraic variety. Other orbits, they're all Jordan blocks, basically. Yes, so the other things that appear in the non-profit clone are going to be kind of all possible orbits of all possible Jordan normal forms. And in fact, this is true more generally. So any Jordan-normal form theorem is true for SLN. It's also true more generally for semi-simple V algebras. Two things are going to be in the same adjoint orbit closure if they have the same semi-simple part in the Jordan-normal form, but maybe they have different. Normal form, but maybe they have different ones above the diagonal. Okay, so the question I want to answer now is that if I GSME simples, I can identify it with G star, and then it gets a natural Poisson structure, which is the Cost and Kirala structure. And this is singular as the Poisson manifold, because uh symplectic leaves are the adjoint orbits and they have Leaves are the adjoint orbits and they have different dimensions. And then sort of in the vein of Jonathan's talk, I can ask how can I desingularize this manifold to a regular plus one. A regular Poisson structure. So, first I'll construct the manifold that will be the desingularization, and then I'll show you how we obtain a Poisson structure on it, and then we'll look at what its relationship is to the Lie algebra that we started with. So, for this, we're going to fix a Borel sub-algebra, factor B and G. Fractor V and G. Or L means maximal solvable. But in SLN, it means concretely that it's conjugate to the subalgebra of upper triangular matrices. And I always, if I choose my Borel so that it contains the fixed Charton A, then I have a decomposition. Then they have a decomposition, H plus the null potent radical of the style, which you can think of with H is the diagonal sub-algebra. The linopotent radical is strictly upper triangular and no potent matrices. And I take A where I'm going to take a look at the A oral subgroup that integrates the subalgebra. And then because all maximal solvable subalgebras of G are conjugate under the glue action, and because Borels are self-normalizing, so the normalizer of B and G is. So the normalizer of E and G is exactly this subgroup. If I look at the homogeneous space G mod, this is the space that parametrizes all maximal solvable subalgebras of T. And because in SLN, a borella is exactly the stabilizer of a maximal flag in the standard representation. This is sometimes called the flag provided as well. Here's definition the growth and be Springer of the Lie algebra G is ourselves defined as just as a space of points. You can call it G tilde. It's pairs of a point x in the Lie algebra and a Borel subalgebra B prime of G. B prime of G, so this is a normal product, with the property that x prime is an element of b prime. And I'll remark that, of course, I have a natural amount from g tilde to g, that's just the first projection. And if we look And if we look at the fibers of this natural map above kind of my favorite points, so for example, above a regular semi-simple point, the fiber of this map is going to be Borels containing S. And these have an action of the file group. File group and this action from mute phone freely and transitively. So this piper has as many elements as there are elements in the file code. And the way you can think of this is that if I have a diagonal element that has distinct eigenvalues that's living in the That's living in these diagonal matrices. And it's contained in this positive Borel that I fit. But then when I apply the normalizer of the carton, that's going to fix the carton, but it's potentially going to move this nil-potent part around the Lie algebra, and I'm going to get different Borels from the one I started with. And then at the other extreme, I can look at the At the regular nil potent element, so this in SLN, this corresponds to this maximal nilpotent Jordan block. And this is contained in a unique Borel subalgebra. So the statement is that the only subgroup conjugate to upper triangular matrices that contain this Jordan block is the subgroup of upper triangular matrices. So the smell, along the regular locus, it has finite fibers, but the number of points in the fiber can vary from violus many in the regular semi-simple case to just one in the regular and important case. And then above non-regular elements, the fibers are going to get higher dimensions. So for example, if I look at the fiber above zero, zeros contain an oligarl sub-algebra. So I'm going to get a copy of the flag variety as the as the fiber. As the fiber. Okay. And just like before. So can I ask the thing? Take a file if you take a compact real form and you take a file participation, it's what's down here as a third power. Tell me this. Does it sit naturally in the routine spend the resolution? I think you have to do what Janus was describing, where you first kind of like blow up by the bile group action so that it's no longer exactly one. And then when you take a real form in this G tilde, you should get that. So I'll describe what the I'll say a bit more about the geometry of the sky, and then it will look a lot more similar to. Sky, and then it will look a lot more similar to the vial resolution as Janos described it. So it's relatively straightforward to check that there's a nice morphism from this associated Borel bundle over G1B to this Growth and Higgs Bringer space that just takes a pair G. and match it to the pair and g x and g. Because of course if x is contained in v, then g applied to x is contained in g applied to v. So from this we see immediately that g tilde has a structure of a smooth variety. And And there's a natural map then from g tilde, which I identify with this vector bundle to the Cartan H, because whenever I take a pair gx, I can write X as a decomposition into semi-simple part and no potential part. So some like S cross n. And then I can just map this to the semi-simple part. Map this to the semi-simple part, and one can check that this is well defined. And the reason for this is that when I take an element s plus n and I conjugate it by something in b, I don't change the semi-simple part. And this map fits into a commutative. Fits into a commutative diagram. With my kind of resolution map mu, where I can map g tilde to h, let's call this capital. And I can map it down to G using the first projection. And G, I can map to H1 W using this adjoint quotient. So this is the partitioning of G into closures of regular orbits. And this is just a quotient mapped by the Weyl transaction. So this diagram commutes and Diagram commutes, and when I restrict it to the regular locus, it's actually a pullback square. So the number of points in this preimage is determined by how freely the bile group acts on the point up here. And when I restrict it to the regular semi-simple locus, then all the fibers are W covers. And this map is actually a W covering map, and there's a global file group action on the regular semi-symbol of this subject. On the regular semi-simple, we'll just subject all that. So now I'll explain. G carries the classic Kiralog Poisson structure. I'll explain that we can also put a Poisson structure on G tilde, and then the diagram will have a Poisson submit. So watch around utiliza. I begin with a cotangent bundle of. With the cotangent bundle of G, which I trivialized with respect to the left action. And then I also identify G with G star through the killing form. And then I have the right action of G on the space by a point H acts on the G part by right multiplication and on the fiber by add H. I hate and the fraction is Hamiltonian and it has a moment map to the Lie algebra which I identify with G star. And this moment map just takes a pair of GX and projects. Put their GS and projects onto the second component. So I want to consider the restricted action of just the subgroup B on this space. So here's the moment map mu. So here's the moment map mu that goes to G. And actually write it like this. And I also have a moment map for the V action, which factors through this, which goes to B star. And under the killing form, the curve of the Borel subgroup is Of the Borel subgroup is the group of no-potent matrices U, which corresponded to the strictly upper triangular matrices. So this means that I can identify E star with G mod V per, which is G mod U. And then I get a map over here. That's just a projection. That's how this move far. Can we imagine you? Things that are strictly upper triangular and they'll be altogether. And now the observation that I want to make is that when I look at the image of E under this quotient, so this is upper transition. So this is upper triangular matrices quotiented by strictly upper triangular matrices. This is fixed by the adjoint action of the Borel. Because conjugating something upper triangular by something else upper triangular doesn't change its eigenvalues. The diagonal component is the same. So this action is trivial. Which means that I can take the preimage of this space V mod u under the moment map mu bar and mod out by the action of v, and I will get something with a plus on the structure. And if I look at what this And if I look at what this actually is, I follow this diagram. So B mod U here comes up to B here. V here comes up to G cross V here because of the way the moment method is defined. So here I'm going to get mu inverse of B mod V and this exactly the Rosen-Dexpringer resolution that I defined. So this has a button structure. And the symplectic leaves are individual Hamiltonian reductions when I take just a point in V mod U and I do usual reduction at a point. So they're going to look like inverse of s. Of S plus U mod B, and this is this kind of affine bundle over H mod. So, in particular, you can see immediately with this Poisson structure on G. Of this Poisson structure, and G tilde, which is G cross V over V is a regular Poisson structure because all the leaves have the same dimension. Let's draw something. Diagram, ah. This is regular. And this mount, capital Phi, is exactly the map that parametrizes the leaf space because it picks out the semi-simple component S. Semi-simple component test. Of course, we already said that G is a singular as a Poisson manifold. And this map mu And the smut mu, if you think about what the smut mu is, it's just the map that takes a pair GX and applies G to X. And this is the residual moment map for the left action of G on T star G. So in particular, it's a moment map. So in particular, it's a moment map. So in particular, it's a and one that is generically finite, but not generically one. And the space here is a very simple thing. And the space here, it's not really parametrizing the leaves of trees, but you can think of it as parametrizing the closures of regular leaves or the closed leaves, which are in ejection one another. Let me pause to see if there are any questions. No, this is this is a well, it's a diagram of algebraic varieties and and it's compatible with the Poisson structures that appear. So this is Poisson, this is Poisson, and this So this is Poisson, this is Poisson, and this is a Poisson map. G tilde is not a Lie algebra in general. So even the G and H are. But I think what Frank is actually asking is kind of so how classically, because it's classical, very classic, right? How do people in Wii theory thought about such a diagram? Because you are starting in the category of Lie algebras and then you get out of it. But there is still something that remains, which for us is the plus one geometry. Which for us is the plus one geometry. Yeah, so I think all the alters were as a linear plus star term. I think I'm going to answer this question in the second half of my talk. So this is great because it really leads into the kind of final observation that I want to make about this diagram, which is that if I take His remark. If I take some S bar, an H mod duffel heel, then the S diagram gives me a map from the fiber of capital C above S, which is a symplectic leaf in G tilde. Two to the fiber little feet above S bar, which for generic S is going to be just an isomorphism. But for non-generic S, and notice that this is smooth and inflective. And this is potential. This is potentially singular, but symphonic on an open, dense, smooth set. And on that open-dense smooth set, this map is always an isomorphism. It's one to one. And it's what's called a resolution of singularity. What's called a resolution of singularities, which I'm going to define in a second what people mean when they say this. But basically, you have a singular variety and you do something that may or may not look like a blow-up, for example, to get rid of the singularities and model it on a smooth space. And in particular. In particular, when s is 0, then this gives me amount from this vector bundle to the fiber of little t above 0, which is the nucleotin cone. And if I was going to draw a doodle of this map, then here's the nucleotin cone. And what I've done is I've designularized it by taking this off. I instead by taking the singular point and replacing it with a larger fiber. So I think this was the original motivation for the production of the Space G held up, was as a way to resolve the singularities. To resolve the singularities of closures of adjoint orbits in the Lie algebra. And the fact that the space G tilde has a kind of symplectic or Poisson nature was something that only came into fullness afterwards. Okay, it doesn't This is that's called the screen representation of an employment So now what I want to do So now, what I want to do for the second half of the talk is explain a little bit about an area of research that I think was basically motivated by this example, which is the study of symplectic resolutions. So the maps will be created in this way. And let me give some definitions. This is kind of the second part of the talk, but I didn't give a title to the first part, so I also won't give a title to this part. Also, we'll have the title to this part. So, from now on, X is going to be the complex algebraic variety that is possibly singular. And A resolution of singularities of X is a mass i from some algebraic variety y. Which is smooth, and such that the smantas are proper, and people usually say birational, which means generically one-time. And there's the famous era of Hiranaka no longer the smooth part of X? By rational, sort of includes it. Not not necessarily over the smooth part of X. So it might have, there might be smooth points where pi has bigger fibers, but it's okay. I mean, it's okay. Yeah. So there's a theorem of Hiranaka that says that. Actually, I think that depends on where you look. The answer to that question, maybe some people will require it. But yes. But I want to be a bit more general. So it says here mahirana because it says that such things always exist. You can resolve the singularities of any algebraic variety by a possibly very long succession of blots. And then we can be interested in what happens when we're in this kind of situation where we have a singular. Where we have a singular algebraic variety, but generically it has a symplectic structure. And for this, I'll give another definition. So suppose that there's a symplectic form omega on the smooth locus of X. X then I call X a symplectic variety if it satisfies two conditions. We all call them one and two. One is that This is normal. This is a technical condition that you can think is roughly equal to saying that x has no singularity when codimension 1. So the singular locus has codimension greater than or equal to 2. And in particular, this implies that every function Every function, algebraic function, on the smooth locus of x extends to an algebraic function on all of x. And the second condition, I'll say the second condition, and then I'll Condition, I'll say the second condition and then I'll say a little bit about why we have these conditions. The second condition is that for every resolution of singularities, pi from y to x, the pullback of the symplectic form on the smooth locus of x through omega extends to a two-form tower. Two-form on one, which is possibly degenerate now, but which is the global regular two-form. So here are some remarks. First, yeah. Why don't you look at the Poisson bracket associated with that form and talk about the extension of that to the functions as you have? Yeah, so let me so so the I in terms of the function. I interpret your question in two ways, and I'll answer one of them. Well, the other one only has a kind of speculative answer. So the observation that Roy is making implicitly is that if I have a symplectic form on the smooth locus of x, then that gives me a Poisson bracket on functions on the smooth locus. But that gives me a Poisson bracket on functions on all of x because of this equality. Of x because of this equality. So this normality condition actually implies that x is a Poisson variety in the sense that its algebra of functions, its chief of functions, carries a Poisson bracket. And then the second condition is that when I pull back the symplectic form to a resolution, I get a two-form on the resolution. I get a two-form on the resolution. And maybe Rui is asking, instead of asking whether I extend to a two-form, why don't I pull back the Poisson bracket and ask, does it extend to a Poisson bracket on Y? And this is, I'm very curious. Or to a D-RX structure. I don't know of any answers in this direction. There may be other people in this room who know some answers in this direction. And one of the actually made a list. I actually made a list of questions for the discussion session in the afternoon that we could ask, and this was one of them: what happens if we study kind of Poisson resolutions of symplectic varieties. And the second observation. It would be nice to have a criteria simply in terms of x itself, not using your resolution. Yeah, so I can say a little bit about this. So the second condition about pulling back to resolution, which is here. Which is here, it's actually sufficient to check this for just one resolution that extends, if the two-form extends to one resolution, it extends to all of them. And in fact, there are conditions, there are ways to characterize whether this happens just looking at the geometry of x, in terms of the sort of the algebraic geometry of the singularities of x. Of the singularities of x. So an algebraic variety with a certain type of singularities and a symplectic form on the smooth locus is always a symplectic variety because it always has this property to be. Okay. And like I said, the kind of motivation to come to this topic is that one kind of candidate for symplectic varieties is if I have a Woisson manifold and the And the leaves aren't closed, and I can take the closure of a symplectic leaf, and then I can ask: is that a symplectic variety? When is that a symplectic variety? And I would be very interested to know answers to this question that come from the Poisson geometry and not from sort of algebraic geometry in the closure. So, the plan is to say some of the things that I know about these symplexic varieties, which now I think I don't know how much time I'm going to have to execute this. And before that, let me say that if this pullback actually extends to a symplectic form on a resolution y, which may happen for Which may happen for some resolutions but not for others, or it may not happen at all. And then this pi is a symplectic resolution, like we saw. We saw, and then I'll put in one example which I just erased. But again, these are kind of rare, so there are very few known examples of symplectic resolution, even though symplectic varieties seem to be kind of abundant. Is it a unique? No. But you can count them. There's a formula. In some cases, In some cases, in a case that I will say, hopefully, there is a formula to count them. But in general, they're going to be finitely many and possibly zero. In homological terms, I don't know. There are certain properties that this resolution pi is going to be. That this resolution play is going to have that is symplectic, that can tell you, that can let you easily figure out whether a resolution is a candidate for being symplectic or not. Like the fibers, the dimension of the fibers is somehow controlled so that it can't be too big. But I don't know of any other kinds of criteria. Okay. So we just get into the whole working symplectic and then whole working symplectic and then that's kind of if y is compact that's very rare uh yes in general you know in uh in a lot of the examples we have y will not be compact it will just be kind of like this this map will be proper but x might start out to be some kind of often an affine variety like the no button column um yeah okay so uh here's the thing due to Due to colour it is. And here I'm telling us that if I have a symplectic variety, so it satisfies the two conditions one and two, then there exists a finite There exists a finite stratification into sub-varieties XI which are smooth Poisson subvarieties. Sub-varieties. So in a Poisson algebraic variety, a Poisson sub-variety is just one that's locally defined by a Poisson ideal. Into smooth Poisson sub-varieties, which are symplectic. So this is a theorem that's saying if I have a symplectic variety, I can break it down into Break it down into finitely many. And thus, as in our kind of running example of the nilpotent cone, these symplectic leaves are going to be the other nilpotent orbits that lie in the cone. So the smallest one will be zero, the biggest one will be the regular one, and the intermediate orbits of the nilpotent coordin blocks will give you some. Of the Noplot and Gordon blocks will give you some intermediate formats, each of which will be smooth and symplectic. They're going to sort of paste together into the singular variety. Okay. Is the smooth part one of these pressures? Is the smooth part... Yes. So one of the open-dun stratum here is exactly the smooth part of X. And then the other ones are stratification of the singular locus. Notification of the singular locus. Okay. So I want to specialize a bit further. From now on, let X be an affine simple. an affine symplectic variety. So as an algebraic variety of the spectrum of its ring of functions and I will say that x is clonical if it's equipped with a C star action. With a C star action that has two properties. So the C star action induces a grading on the polynomial ring of X. And I want this grading to be by non-negative integers such that the zero graded component is just the constant component. It's just the constant functions. So geometrically, what this is telling you is that there is some point, let's call it x0 in x, with a property that if I take any other point in x, apply the c star action, and take the limit, the parameter tends to infinity, and the analytic Euclidean topology. This limit is this point x0. So, in other words, this is a contracting action to a single point. Like you can imagine on the nilpotent cone, I have a C star action just by scaling. And the C star action by scaling contracts every matrix to zero. Just the kind of unique, most singular point on the column. Okay. And a second condition is that the Poisson bracket that I have on the That I have on the polynomial ring of X is homogeneous for this action of some negative degree. And what this does is that if I bracket together functions in degree n, in degree m and functions in degree m. I'm going to get homogeneous functions in degree m plus n minus of things. So here's the proposition Do you think it's a good idea? Well, degree of minus L. The proposition says that if x is conical and pi is a resolution of singularities, which is a symplectic resolution, so when I pull back the symplectic form on x, we get out of symplectic form. On X, we get a symplectic form on Y. Then the C star action lifts to Y and pi is C star equivariant. And you can see this in our Neltophonic Cone example. I have this bundle over G mod D. Bundle over G mod D is a symplectic resolution of the singularities of the nilpotent cone. Here I act by scaling of the nilpotent cone to zero. And here I act by scaling the fibers, which contracts to the zero section of this vector bundle, which is exactly the fiber it is. It's above zero local section. And the reason conical symplexic varieties are very interesting. Very interesting is because they have something called a universal Poisson deformation. So let me quickly say what this means in that in the time that I have left, here's the definition. If x is an affine variety and a For some deformation, the resolution doesn't have to be a vector space. The resolution could be a vector space, no, X is only an affine variety, so it's not necessarily an affine space, it's something like a cone. And the resolution Y. Cone and the resolution y is just some other variety that is probably not affine that is sitting above this. So, like in this example, N is an honest cone. And thus, the doodle is going to look like a cylinder, kind of a roll-up of the column. It's a vector bundle. Yes, it's a vector bundle over a GMO E, which is a protector IA. Okay, that's a vector variable. So, but this and the C-star action is the actual. But this and the C-star action is the action of the fibers of the droplets? Yes, yes, so it's the action that scales the fibers to the 01. So I'll say that the Poisson deformation of X over S is a affine variety right maybe X hat. Uh, maybe X hat where they morphism C from X hat to S, which is flat. So flat is a condition that is, in this case, roughly equivalent to and generally implies that all the fibers Let's see, have the same dimension with the property that the The algebra of functions on x hat has a Poisson bracket which is linear over functions on hat. So this implies that the fibers of P are Poisson subvarieties. Right, it is probably and such that there is some distinguished point in F above which the fiber is isomorphic to X as of the Possum variety. I apologize that I will go like five minutes over time. I think we're bad presenters. Jono suggested that we also speak during the coffee break, but I convinced that we shouldn't do that. Okay, um, so. Okay, so this is what I mean by a Poisson deformation of the symplectic variety X. And now the statement, we immediately say the statement with, I believe, a student on the call. Which is that if S is a conical symplectic variety it has a there is an affine space TX and a universal graded, by which I mean compatible with the C star action on S Poisson deformation. plus some deformation from m to tx. So universal means that any other Poisson deformation is a pullback of this deformation through some morphism from the base to Tx. And uh I have a resolution of singularities high from y to x, then we already said that y gets a c star action if this resolution If this resolution is a symplectic resolution, and in this case, y also has a universal Poisson deformation compatible with this action. And now y is a symplectic, is a smooth symplectic variety. And its deformations are unobstructed. This Ty second to some hormonology of y and y is symplectic. So this is just second to wrong hormonal y. And then the final theorem that I want to state is also due to Nami Tawa and he says that in this case But in this case, there is a map of algebraic varieties, which we'll call capital pi between these two universal graded deformations and a finite reflection group W. W, which acts on the deformation parameter space upstairs, such that the parameter space downstairs is naturally isomorphic to the quotient of Ty by this action. All of these things fit into Evidently a commutative diagram y is deformations of the central fiber parametrized by Ty. This portions the Tx mod w. This is the map with existence. The map whose existence is explained in this theorem to x, the deformation of this complexic variety non-kn px. And thus, diagram is commutative. And let me finish by making some observations about it. The first is that the spy is a deformation of a smooth simple. Of a smooth symplectic manifold that has a kind of, I wrote here gridded, but I didn't have time to define what it means. You should understand this. It's a compatible C-star action on the entire deformation that contracts all the fibers to the central fibers that you're deforming. So why is irregular, in fact locally trivial in the analytic policy? Poisson manifold that fibers over the space Ty. X is a Poisson manifold that is not regular and potentially singular. This is a Poisson map. This is the leaf space of the deformation y. And what we've done is we've kind of reconstituted the growth in the Springer diagram. Springer diagram, where previously this was G and this is G tilde, and this is H and this is H mod W. And in fact, one can prove that G is the universal graded deformation of its central fiber, which is the nil potenti cone. And G tilde is the universal graded deformation of its central fiber, which is the resolution of the nil potenti cone. And this in the case where fan GX is G. Where fan tx is g, this diagram just specializes to the Grossman-Springer resolution. And in particular, what I've produced is like a slightly larger class of desingularizations of Poisson spaces, but again, at the cost of having something that is generically finite and not generically one-to-one. Because how finite these fibers are is determined by how the bile group is acting on the state. So I think I'm going to. So I think I'm going to stop there. Some time for questions, remarks, observations? Find it a reflection group? Is it a wild group? Or is there something that I'm talking about? I haven't I also learned about this at a Poisson conference in 2018 that was not here and there I learned that this W is like quite difficult to describe in an explicit closed form there are root systems around this situation as far as I can tell no but it is always finite yes it's always a finite reflection group It's always a finite reflection group. And in fact, you can tell where the fibers pi are finite by the kind of degeneracy hyperplanes of the action of this reflection group 1 T1. So if you remove those degeneracy hyperplanes, then you're going to get an actual W cover. And away from that bad locus, the The fibers of little phi and big phi are going to be isomorphic, just like they.
