Welcome to this afternoon's session. It's an honor to have a spoken university here. He will speak on biometric and multimetric surface. Biometric and multi-metric of gravity. Thank you very much. Okay. So I will basically. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So I will start the talk now. And at times I may be a bit pedantic. So apologies for all of you who are quite familiar with things. But yeah, okay. So I will talk about theories of multiple spin. Theories of multiple spin two fields. Of course, I will motivate them first and then proceed. So, the work is done mostly with these collaborators basically. Joachim Flinkman is right now my PhD student, so the later part of the work is done with him. And the rest are my collaborators over the years. And of course, many people have contributed to this field. I will focus only on a few of the work, essentially, what I have done. So, yeah, but of course, there's a lot more work in this field. Okay, so let's start with the motivating multi-spin two theories. So, why do we study these theories? Okay, so of course, okay, so in the talk, what do we do? We talk about, okay, so we know that general relativity is a theory of a matrix G mu nu, which is basically a field of spin 2 and mass zero. Okay, so in this Okay, so in this talk, we considered biometric and multimetric theories, and these are basically theories of gravity described by Gmu Nu, coupled to extra spin two fields, which we may call, for example, F1, F2, etc. These are extra spin two fields, and we couple them to Gmu Nu. And if we do that, we get a spectrum for the theory, which is which consists of a massless spin 2 field and a number of massive spin 2. And a number of massive spin-2 states. Okay, so described like this, this looks like a rather boring thing. We just construct a theory of several spin-2 fields interacting with gravity. So the question is, why are these theories interesting? This pointer is a bit difficult to control. Okay, so why are Okay, so why are these theories interesting? I will try to motivate that. What are the challenges in constructing these theories? And what is the progress so far in our understanding of such theories? Okay, so I will try to address these questions. And the relevance of these kind of theories to this workshop is that such theories also arise in some form in non-competitive geometry and some other approaches to constructing various theories. And for example, see talks by Morris. And for example, see talks by Marco, Daniel, and Arcadius today, for example. Okay, so let's now proceed. Okay. So starting from very basics, let's recall the concept of ghost instability in field theories. So if you have a scalar field phi, the Lagrangian basically is the kinetic energy minus potential energy, and it starts with. Minus potential energy, and it starts with a term which is like time derivative of phi squared. So that's like the kinetic energy, basically. And the Lagrangian contains kinetic energy with a positive sign. This is a heldy theory. It's a standard theory. If, however, a field appears in the Lagrangian in such a way that its kinetic energy is negative, so you have minus of phi dot squared in the theory, this field is called a ghost. And these theories have problems. Classically, Have problems. Classically, these theories are unstable because the energy is unbounded from below. So you can transfer an infinite amount of energy from the ghost field to other fields. So essentially, you have a source of infinite energy, basically. Quantum mechanically, these theories have these theories have negative norm states. So unitarity is violated at the quantum theory. So these series are not good. So you don't want to have ghosts in the theory. Okay? So ghosts are not good. Okay, so ghosts are not good. And this, of course, we all know. Now, what is the connection with spin in ghosts? So, higher spin theories in the ghost problem. So, generically, theories with higher spins have ghost problems. Why? For the following reason. You know that if you want to count the number of degrees of freedom for a field of a certain spin, you know that in general, when the spin is S, when you're looking at the field of spin S, then the spin S will. Then the spin S will have 2s plus 1 polarizations or projections, basically. So the physical number of degrees of freedom you need to describe a state of spin s is 2s plus 1. And this is if mass is not zero. That we know from basic quantum mechanics, that a spin s has 2s plus 1 stays basically. And if your field is massless, then you need maximum two polarizations, like two polarizations for electromagnetic field. Polarizations for electromagnetic field. Okay, so that's this is how many states we need to describe a field of spin s. Okay, and we know that the particles and fields are classified by spin, basically, because of Poincar√© invariance. Okay, however, if the theory is Lorentz invariant, then you also need the various fields to also form representations of Lorentz algebra, okay, or to transform normally under general covariant transformation. The general covariance transformation, general coordinate transformations, you need general covariance. And this requires your field to have many more components than 2s plus 1. Okay, so 2s plus 1 that you need for spin is not enough, that you need for describing a field of spin s is not enough. You need more components. So examples are here. If you have a field of spin one or particle of spin one, then you know that you will have two or three degrees of freedom. have two or three degrees of freedom. Three for massless, 2s plus 1 is 3, sorry, for massive particles, and 2 for massless particles. So photon has just two polarizations. However, the field that you require, the field that you need to describe photons is E mu, which has four components. And if you go to spin two, then for spin two, you know that you need either two components if your field is massless. These are the two polarizations of the gravitational waves, or you need five. Or you need five components if the field is massive, so 2s plus 1 is 5. However, if you look at the matrix Gmu Nu, it has 10 components being a symmetric rank 2 tensor. So you can see that the number of components that you need in a field in order for it to transform nicely under general coordinate transformations or under Lorentz transformation, the number of components is much more than you need to account for the freedom of spin-off. There's a freedom of spin of the field. So, what do you do with these extra field components? So, these extra components, when you write a generic Lagrangian for this field, these extra field components generically ghosts. You will have two plus one or degrees of freedom that you need for the spin to describe your actual degree of freedom, but the extra ones become some of them become ghostly. Okay, so you want them in the spectrum. Quantum in the spectrum. In a head, these extra components are removed by gauge symmetries and constraints. Okay, so the question is: if you actually have enough of these symmetries and constraints to remove all these unwanted degrees of freedom that include ghosts. A well-known example of this is arises in the case of massive spin-two fields, where if you write down a generic, then Whereas you require five components to describe a two-field, your generic theory will have six propagating modes. Five of them corresponds to the massive two-field, and the sixth one is a ghost, and this is called the Bolo-Daeser ghost, which is a well-known problem. Okay, so okay, so this is basically the problem that in order to describe fields of higher spin, you need a certain number of components. You need a certain number of components that are dictated by the spin. However, in a covariant theory, you need many more components to generalize to ensure covariance of the theory, Lorentz or general covariance. And the extra components generally turn out to contain ghost-like instabilities. Okay, so, and of course, now when you want to construct such theories, you don't want these ghost modes, and as a result, Modes. And as a result, the notion of ghost instabilities becomes a very powerful tool because once you combine the condition that you should not have a ghost in the theory, plus the fact that the theory should be Lorentz invariant or general should have a Lorentz or general covariance, then these two conditions often very strongly restrict the form of your basic equations and sometimes they essentially lead you uniquely to the theory that you want. You uniquely to the theory that you want. Okay, so as a result, oops. Okay, so as a result, this requiring absence of ghost plus Lorentz or general covariance is a very powerful tool in the construction of various field theories. And these are, of course, the basic field theories that we know generically. The spin zero, which is Claren-Gordon, spin half, which is Dirac, spin one, which is Maxwell. Spin one, which is Maxwell or Youngwill, spin two is Einstein. All of these equations, basically, the basic form is dictated by the fact that you have a field of a certain spin and you need, you don't want to have a ghost. And most of these equations actually were discovered on this, essentially on this basis. Not by looking at experiments, but just looking at what kind of consistent theory you can write down for a field of a certain spin. And the last example is string theory. Most of this content of string. Most of this content of the string theory basically comes from requiring the absence of ghosts plus Lorentz invariance. And that's what gives you most of the content of the theory. So this is a very powerful requirement. Now, if you look at these theories, you can make an interesting observation that general relativity is the simplest possible theory of a field of spin 2. The simplest possible thing that you can write down is general relativity. And the simplest one that you can write for spin zero is the Klein-Gordon. For spin zero is the Klein-Gordon theory. So essentially, general relativity is on the same footing as Klein-Gordon theory. Normally, when we think of GR, we think of it as a very complicated theory with lots of physical content, which of course is true. But it's the simplest possible thing you can have for a spin-two field. There is nothing else that you can write down for a massless spin-to field. Okay, so in some sense, it's trivial. You don't even need experiments for it. If somebody told you it told you. You told you to write down a theory of a spin-two field with zero mass and no ghost, that's the only option. You have no other option, basically. So in that sense, it's a completely trivial theory. It's like Klein-Gordon theory for spin-to fields. Of course, it has black holes and inflation and all that, but it's a trivial theory from a structural point of view. It's completely dictated by general covariance and absence of ghost. By general covariance and absence of ghost. Okay, now, on the other hand, if you look at the standard model of particle physics, which is the other theory that we essentially, the other successful theory we need besides GR, there you of course need field of spin zero, spin half and spin one, but the structure is rather intricate. It's not the simplest theory you can write down. You have a lot more structure there because you have gauge groups, you have Gauge groups, you have multiple, so there is a lot of structure there. Okay, so the question you can ask is: okay, why is it that for particle physics, my simplest basic theory is not enough, I need more structure, but for gravity, my basic theory is enough. There's a kind of unsatisfactory parallel between the two, basically. So you may ask, okay, what happens if you want to go beyond GR? What happens if you wanted to construct theories of spin two fields? Theories of spin two fields, which are closer to the standard model than GR. Okay, for and for that, you need to have theories of multiple spin two fields. Okay, so this is a kind of motivation. So just to summarize now, the structure of theories based on spin, how do we classify them? This is the classification. You either look at theories with spin less than two, and these are well-known, spin zero, spin half, spin one, and they are part of the standard model of particle physics. Of the standard model of particle physics, okay. We know their structure. Then you can look at theories of spin more than two. And if you go beyond spin two, then it turns out that to construct interacting theories, you basically need infinite power of spins. You cannot just say, I want to write it, I can write an I write in a theory of spin three. No, you need spin four to make it interacting. And for spin four, you need spin five. So you need infinite power of spin. So these are called higher. Tower of spins. So these are called higher spin theories. And another example is string theory. So if you go beyond spin two, then you need to consider the entire infinite tower of spins. And these series are generically also not local in interacting form. Okay, so then you say, okay, what is spin two? Spin equal to two. That's of course the case which is left out. And this is the theory where the simplest, these are, this is the field for which the simplest theory is. The field for which the simplest theory is GR if the field is massless, and that's the analog of massless Clan Gordon or the Maxwell theory for spin two. And then you say, okay, what are, can I write more complicated form of theories here? And that is essentially an open question, basically. Or rather, it was an open question until recently, but still we don't know the full answer there. Okay. Then if you compare this. Then, if you compare this spin two case to lower spins, then you can see that for the lower spin case, you have much more complicated structure in the standard model, as we mentioned earlier. Okay. And okay. So then the question, just comparing the spin two case with the spin less than two, then the question arises as to whether theories of multiple spin two fields exist or is GR unique. That's the question that you can ask. That's a mathematical question that you can ask. Mathematical question that you can ask. And this also is a corner of the theory space which is less, which is rather unexplored. For spins less than two, we know the structure. For spins more than two, again, we know what kind of theories we want to deal with. Spin two itself is the unknown corner, basically. So this is the motivation for looking at these theories. So just to recap. So, just to recap, this is an uncharted kind of corner of the theory space for local field theories with finite spin content. If you want to go to infinite number of fields, then you can do higher spin theories or string theory. But if you want to stick to theories with finite number of fields, then spin two is a kind of uncharted corner. So, for this reason, it's interesting just from a mathematical point of view. Then, if you Then, if you look at this, it has features that are relevant to gravity: dark matter, dark energy, inflation, etc. And of course, it's natural because gravity itself is a spin-two field. So the structures could be very similar. Okay. And finally, while the study of such theories is not demanded by experiment, there is no experimental evidence to look at these theories. However, they are very well motivated by experience. Well, motivated by experience. Oops, what happened? I hope I didn't press the wrong button, but it is three buttons here. So three buttons and combination of exactly. Okay, yeah. So for me, the last point is a kind of a very strong motivation. It's not demanded by experiment, but it's motivated by experience. And experience tells us that when you construct field theories that are consistent mathematically, they turn out to be useful. Okay, so non-abelian. Useful. Okay, so non-abelian theories, Dirac theory, Einstein's theory, all of them were constructed without experimental evidence, basically. But they were the only things that you could construct based on consistency, essentially absence of ghost. And it turns out that if nature has a particle of that spin, this will be the theory because there is no other option, basically. So in that sense, I find it quite compelling to also look at theories of multiple spin two fields and see if Of multiple spin two fields and see if they actually exist in a consistent way. Okay, so that's for the motivation part. Okay, yeah, okay, so now we look at the area of multiple spin two fields. Okay, what can Fields. Okay, what kind of theories will we get if we add more than one spin-two field? And as I mentioned, generically, if you add any other spin-two field to general relativity, it turns out that your theory will propagate more fields than you need, and some of these will be ghosts. Okay, so generically, you will have ghosts in such theories. Okay, so let me look at let's look at an example. So we want to write a theory of a dynamic, a dynamical theory of Of a dynamic, a dynamical theory of a matrix G mu nu, so that's general relativity interacting with another spin two field which I call say f mu nu. Okay, so how will that theory look like? So first of all, I have a Lagrangian here for g mu nu. And then to this, I add an interaction term between g mu nu and f mu nu. And generically, you can argue on general grounds that the interaction term will look something like this. It will be a function of g inverse f or f inverse g. Okay. So that's So that's the kind of interaction potential. And here, the restriction we have is that we don't want to modify the structure of the Anishinaab-Hilbert term, because if we do that, then life becomes much more complicated. So I will keep the structure of the Anishinaabe-Hilbert term for G mu nu unchanged. So I want interactions which are non-derivative. Otherwise, my whole canonical structure of the theory changes and things. Structure of the theory changes and things become complicated. You can do it with investigating those theories become complicated. Okay. So we have this kind of interaction term. And now if you look at this theory, then if you take this F mu nu to be eta mu nu, the Minkowski matrix, then this is what people in general call massive gravity. Okay, so F mu nu was not a dynamical spin to field, but just a background matrix usually taken. Background matrix usually taken to be atom uniu. So, and this theory, if you look at the content of it, it describes a massive spin two field. So, this potential V gives you a mass term for the field F. So it becomes a massive spin, the theoret of a massive spin two field interacting with gravity. Sorry. Sorry. If you take F mu nu to be eta mu nu, then this becomes a theoret of a massive spin two field for g mu nu. So this g mu nu is a massive field, and this v becomes. Massive field and this V gives you a mass term for G mu nu. Okay, but the theory contains five helicities for the massive spin two field plus one ghost, the sixth helicity. Okay, so this theory will have a ghost. So this not okay. So the question is if one can come up with a interaction potential V, which does not contain this ghost. Okay, so this was answered a few years ago, basically, and the resulting theory is called ghost. And the resulting theory is called ghost-free massive gravity. So there is a form of V, I will describe the form of this interaction later. So what we want is a dynamical theory of interacting, of two interacting fields. We want the second field F mu nu also to be dynamical. So for that to be dynamical, what do we need? We also have to add an interact, a kinetic Lagrangian for the dynamics of the field F, which will contain the field F and maybe its covariant. Contain the field F and maybe its covariant derivative, et cetera. So now the question is: in this theory, what is this interaction potential V between the two spin two fields? And what is this dynamical, the part of the interaction that gives dynamicals to the field F mu? Okay, so those are to be figured out. And once we have a candidate for these terms, then we of course need to look at the proof that this. Uh, the proof that this theory really does not contain ghosts. This volunteers ghost should be absent from this theory. Okay, so that's all we need now. In order to tell you what this mass term is or this interaction term is, okay, let's have a small digression. So, let me remind you what you mean by elementary symmetric polynomials of the eigenvalues of a matrix S. Okay. Values of a matrix S. Okay, so suppose you have a four by four matrix S, just a four by four matrix with eigenvalues lambda one to lambda four, then you can define the following symmetric polynomials. E1 is a sum of eigenvalues, so this is the trace of the matrix, and okay, E2 is a product of two eigenvalues summed. E3 is a product of two. Summed, E3 is the product of three eigenvalues summed, and E4 is the product of all the eigenvalues. So E4 is the determinant of S. These are called the elementary semantic polynomials of the matrix S, and all the ones higher than 4 are 0 for a 4 by 4 matrix. You can also write these elementary semantic polynomials in terms of the matrix S, in terms of its traces and traces of squared, etc. So E1 is this quantity, it's just a trace, E2 is trace. 2 is trace squared minus trace of the squared of s. E3 is like this, and E4 is the terminal. Okay, so these are elementary semiconductor polynomials of a matrix S. Now, once you know this, you also know the identity that if you expand the determinant of 1 plus S, this is just the sum of elementary semantic polynomials of S. So, this stuff was known to Newton, if not earlier. If not earlier, to people like Newton, if not earlier. So, this is a nice expression here: determinant of one plus a matrix is equal to the element sum of elementary semi-click polynomials of that matrix. Now, what do we do here? I remind you of that relation here. Okay, now take this. Now, take the sum of the term of 1 plus s, look at the sum, but put arbitrary coefficients in front of these elementary symbolic polynomials. So insert the coefficient beta n. So every EN is multiplied by beta n. And the claim is that this is the interaction potential that you need between two spin, two fields. This is a consistent one. What is S? S is this very strange object. You take the matrix G mu nu and invert it. So it's a g mu nu is a matrix. So it's a g mu is a matrix. This is the inverse of that matrix. Multiply it by f. So g inverse f is a four by four matrix. Then you take the square root of that matrix. So this is a matrix square root. Okay. And call that s. And it is this s for which you are evaluating the elementary symbolic polynomials. You take a linear combination of them, and that is the interaction potential. And the claim is that this is the unique ghost. Claim is that this is the unique ghost-free interaction potential that you can have. Okay. Now, the square root of a matrix is a strange object. Generically, we don't deal with these kinds of objects. So, I will tell you more about this later. It's a very important object in the theory, and it has very nice properties. Okay, okay. So, now we know about this construction. So, take the square root of this matrix, evaluate. Matrix, evaluate its elementary symmetric polynomials, take a sum of them, and that's your interaction potential. What is the dynamical term for F? It turns out that the only possibility is that for F mu nu, for the other spin 2 field, also you write down an Anish and Hilbert action. Okay, so the theory is very, it has a lot of symmetry between the matrix G menu and F menu. Okay, this is the only possible ghost-free. Possible ghost-free interaction that you can have. Yes, MF and MT are in basically different scales. So you have different Planck masses in front of them. Is that what you meant? Yeah. So you have completely independent Planck masses in front of them. Yes. Okay. So Mg is the Planck mass of G, M F is the Planck mass of F. And these parameters These parameters beta, the beta ends here, beta zero and beta four are cosmological constants for G and F, and the remaining three are just interaction parameters, interaction couplings, basically. Okay, so this is the action. And the claim is that this is the unique ghost-free action for the interaction of two-spin, two fields. And from here, you can see that because both G and F have Anish and Hilbert time. Have Anish and Hilbert type of dynamics, basically, they both behave like matrix in the physical sense. So that's why you can also call it a bimetric theory. The intention was not to construct a theory with two gravitational matrix. The aim was to construct a theory of gravity interacting with another spin-two field. It turns out that the other spin-two field also becomes like a gravitational matrix. Okay, and it also turns out that okay, so this has a biometric structure. If you analyze its degrees of freedom, it has seven modes, two for a massless spin two field and five for a massive spin two field. Okay, and so non-ly even at the nonlinear level, this theory propagates only the seven modes, a massless plus a massive spin two field, and there is no Boulevardes or ghost in the theory. So this is completely ghost-free. So, this is completely ghost-free. That one can show. And also, the absence of ghosts gives you a unique coupling to matter. So, G and F couple to separate matter contents exactly in the same way as ordinary GR. So, these are minimal couplings, basically. Okay, and that's it. And they must be different. And these matter sectors must be different. If both of them couple to the same matter field, you get a ghost in the theory. Okay, so you need the matter. Okay, so you need the matters which fall because of the G graduate exactly and the apple prime exactly which you which you do not see in any way except through the fact that those other apples affect the matrix F and that matrix F affects the matrix G. So you can only see indirectly their effect on gravity. Exactly. Yes. Okay. And it turns out that in the In the so generically, we take this, you can one can easily take this g to be the gravitational matrix and this mg to be the Planck mass, which is very large. And then if you take the Planck mass of F to be a lower scale, for example, Tv, then the theory looks very much like GR. The effect of the other field becomes reasonably small. Today. In today. If you go back at earlier pokes, then its effect will be larger. Okay. So there is a slide here about how the analysis of constraints actually is done, but I will not spend time on this. But the idea basically is that you can actually do an exact analysis of constraints in this theory. And you can show that you have enough number of constraints that precise. Number of constraints that precisely eliminate the ghost and leave you with a massless plus a massive spin-to field. And the other one must have the same signature. Yes. Okay. So I will come to that in a while. Can you have a different minus? Okay. I will come to that. So okay. So the signature has we take it to be minus plus plus plus. We take one. plus plus plus we take one time in space one time three space okay the rest of it i will that's very very important i will i will i will spend some time on that but that's a very very important question in this theory exactly yeah okay there was a lot of confusion about this about that issue in the beginning but now it's resolved okay uh good okay so let's uh good okay so there is a there is a constant analysis for that theory There is a constant analysis for that theory which can be done, it's technical, so we will skip that. Okay, now this is the mass spectrum. If you look at the theory, so first we look at classical solutions where the two matrix are proportional to each other. In this case, each matrix will satisfy Einstein's equation with a cosmological constant, and only around Einstein backgrounds a mass spectrum can be defined, a proper mass spectrum can be identified. Okay, that's true in general. Okay, that's true in general. So, if you take the matrix to be proportional to each other, then you look at fluctuations of the matrix around their backgrounds. So, delta G and delta F are the fluctuations of the two matrix. Then you can easily show that the theory has a massless mode. So one combination of them is massless and the other combination of them is massive. So you have a massless plus a massive mode in the theory around these special backgrounds. In general, you will have seven propagating modes, but Seven propagating modes, but identifying them as massless and massive becomes more complicated. Especially the five massive modes then split up into various helicities. All of them will not have exactly the same property. They will have different propagation speeds around general backgrounds. Okay. So this is the mass spectrum of the theory. And generically, okay, and we see that the original matrix G mu and F mu nu that we put G mu and f mu nu that we put in the theory are mixtures of massless and massive modes. So, in this framework, if our gravity, if we actually have an extra spin two field like this, then what we call a gravitational field that couples to matter will be mostly massless, but a very small massive piece. Okay, and the other field will also have a massless and massive component. But what we call gravity will be described by a field which is mostly massless, but a small massive component. Mostly massless, but a small massive component. These are like neutrinomic things, basically, in some sense. Okay. Then there are limits of this theory where in one limit, the theory can go to general relativity, in the other limit, it can go to massive gravity. Not very important. Okay, but this is the structure of the theory. Okay. Now, if you look at this theory, you say, okay, I have constructed this theory. I have constructed this action. It doesn't have ghosts and all that. So I'm happy with that. But With that. But this theory has, on the face of it, it has, it can have very big problems. Okay, essentially related to the question that was asked. And those are the problems. So just on the face of it, there could be potential inconsistencies in the theory, which would mean that the theory is not well defined. But it turns out that there's a very nice solution. And in fact, these inconsistencies do not. Solution, and in fact, these inconsistencies do not arise. So, that's a very nice thing from my point of view, because we started from a theory where we did not even bother about these issues. We just wanted absence of ghost. And we got a theory which actually also has, which is also consistent from other points of view, which is not guaranteed from the beginning. Okay, so what are these problems? One problem is the following: that we have now two matrix, G mu and F mu. They both had Anish and Hilbert terms. F-mu, they both had Anish and Hilbert terms, and they both have one, Kappa III signatures. But in this construction, nobody told us that these theories will have the same notion of space and time. Okay, so their time signatures could be completely in opposite directions or in complementary directions. And that would be problematic. So the matrix G and F may not admit compatible notions of space and time. So they may not admit compatible three plus one. not admit compatible three plus one decompositions and if you cannot do a three plus one decomposition of the theory then you don't have you don't have a hamiltonian formulation you don't know what you mean by time evolution etc so that's the problem so if we if we write if we draw the null cones of the two matrix so suppose it's red is the null cone of the matrix g blue is a null cone of f they could be intersecting in these ways in this way and in this way or in this way and here you can see that And here you can see that in cases C and D, you are okay because the theory has the null cones intersects. You actually have a common notion of time for the two theories. Case A is very bad because the notion of time is complementary. The time of the metric G is not the time of the metric F. It's space for metric F and vice versa. So this is not good. In case B, it could be either ways. Either ways, you can have a complement, a notion of time which is in the same direction, but then the matrix can flip around and you lose that notion of time. Okay, so the null cones of G and F can have different orientations in principle, and that would mean that the theater is not consistent. We want the null cones of G and F to be consistent. Otherwise, you get profits. No, you don't get okay. Problem. Okay, you don't know. Problem. Okay, you don't know. Most likely, you will not get a ghost, but the proof of ghost actually relied on developing 3 plus 1 decomposition of the two matrix. Okay, so if the two are not consistent, then I cannot even do the proof of ghost. Okay, so I assume that, but that assumption depends on what I'm going to tell you now. Okay, most likely you will have the constraint equations, but the theory doesn't make sense. Here, the Hamiltonian analysis doesn't make sense. Here, the Hamiltonian analysis doesn't make sense because there is no Hamiltonian. You don't need an Hamiltonian for the not for that part, but for time evolution. If you want to say, okay, I have initial conditions, I want to evolve my system, how do you evolve it? There is no common initial data surface, basically, no common Cauchy surface if the null cones are not compatible. Okay, so this is one. So, this is one problem. Okay, it's a geometrical problem. The second problem is the following here. So, in the definition of the theory, we had the square root of a matrix. Now, the square root of a matrix is not familiar to us, maybe not familiar to most of us, but mathematicians know a lot about it, and they know how to deal with it, how to evaluate it. There is a well-understood theory of square roots of matrices. And notice that this matrix is not. And notice that this matrix is not, this is not a symmetric matrix. So it cannot be diagonalized in general. Okay. Okay. So this square root matrix itself could have problems. What are the problems with it? First of all, it's not, let me go back here. Okay. So the problem of uniqueness, reality, and covariance. Okay. Sorry, I cannot control this pointer. Control this pointer. Either my hand is not working or the pointer is not working. Okay. So first let's look at the question of uniqueness. So these kind of matrices have square roots which are called primary and non-primary. There are several primary square roots for a four by four matrix. In principle, you can have up to 16 primary square roots. 16 primary square roots. And for not, and if you have non-primary roots, then you can have an infinite number of non-primary roots. Yeah, so okay, so even if you have even if you have a diagonal matrix, yeah, you can have infinite number of non-diagonal square roots. You can have infinite number of complicated matrices that when squared give you unity, for example. Gives you unity, for example. So that can happen only for special types of matrices, but not in general. Those are called non-primary. So for non-primary roots, there is no generic way of finding them, basically, in some sense. But primary ones are the standard ones for which there is a formula you can evaluate them. So, yeah, I have the details. I will not go through it, but I have a slide for the details if you want to look at it. Okay. Then the square roots are not possible, may not. Then the squirrels may not even be real. So if you have a complex matrix in your action, then you are sunk. And the other problem is that non-primary roots are not even one one tensor. So this object has an upper index and a lower index, the square root. So it looks like a tensor with a covariant and a contravariant index. But if you actually look at its transformation properties, this guy transforms. This guy transformed like a 1-1 tensor only for primary roots, but not for non-primary square roots. Okay, so in general, it's not even a 1-1 tensor. And in that case, the theory will not have general covariance. General covariance breaks down. And generically, primary roots can degenerate into non-primary ones. You can start with a primary root, primary square root, and as the eigenvalue. Primary square root, and as the eigenvalues change, it can become non-primary. Okay, so as this as your space-time evolves, your root becomes non-primary, and your general covariance breaks down. Well, last question. So, in this case, this index is not raised and lowered by anything. This is the natural upper and lower. But if you actually do it, then you have to be careful which one you can use either matrix, but you have to. Can use either metric, but you have to know, you have to keep track of that for this quantity. This is the natural choice, natural structure, basically. Yes, could you give me a bit where tensoriality breaks? Is it an inhomogeneous term or something else? Sorry? How does tensoriality? Yeah, so okay, it breaks like this. I think I can use my hand, it's easier. Suppose you have a matrix A, okay, you transform it QQ, suppose DX. follows with q q suppose dx by dx prime okay so generically an a which has one upper or one lower index transform like with q inverse q so it gives you a prime okay so if the matrix a transforms like this then you expect that its square root should also transform like this square root of a prime should be q inverse square root of aq okay then both of them will be one one tensors but if the square root is not But if the square root is not a primary one, then this is not true. Yeah, my question is: does it have an extra term or is not is q not q? Yeah, first derivative. No, it's uh I can okay. Okay, sorry, it's a technical. I can no, no, no, no, it's actually very simple. Take this A to be one, one, two by two matrix, one identity matrix. Okay, you look at the transformation here. Your square root of one, one can be. your square root of 11 can be one minus one. Square root of one one could be a matrix one one or one minus one. If you take one minus one then this transformation will not hold. You can check that. So for a square root for a matrix one one you should you have to take the square root which is one one or minus one minus one not one minus one. One minus one is a non-primary square root and this fails there. That's a simple example but there is a bigger theory behind it. A bigger theory behind it, okay. Okay, so these are the problems. Okay, so you can see that once you have the square root, then the whole thing can break down basically. In particular, uniqueness, because you have the square root in the action. The square root appears in the action. So if I do not tell you what the square root is, if I tell you, oh, the square root can be this or that or that, then your action is not well defined. Because if you have a quantity in the action, you have to know what that quantity is uniquely. Quantity is uniquely, otherwise, the action is not well defined. I can take, I can choose one square root, I can use one square root and work my cosmology. You take another square root and work the cosmology, they will be completely different. So we have to have a unique choice. And the question is, is there a way of making a unique choice? And the question is, yes, there's a unique choice and it solves all the problems. Okay, so what is the choice? The choice is this. Okay, so this. Okay, so this argument, I will not go through it in detail, but just outline it basically. The idea is that of all the primary square roots, there is one which is called the principal root. The principal root is like the one that like square root of four is plus minus two, plus two is the principal one. Okay, so in analogously, there is a principal root, okay, but every Okay, principal square root which is never degenerate. So there is one square root which is called a principal one. It never becomes degenerate. Sorry, it never degenerates to a non-primary root. Okay, so the non-primary square roots were bad. And a generic square root genetically went through a phase when it became non-primary. Okay, there is a unique one, which is a primary square root, which never became. primary square root which never becomes non-primary which never becomes non-primary okay so that's of course that's the one we have to choose so we we define the theory by saying that the square root of this thing that we write down this is a primary square root that's it that that must go into the definition of the theory and once you do that then you guarantee first of all that the theory is unique there is no if and but there is no arbitrariness square If and but there is no arbitrariness, square root means principal square root. So there's a unique theory, and your theory is always general generally covariant because this square root never degenerates into a non-primary one, so you have general covariance. Okay, so these problems are sorted out by this choice, and the other thing that you can do then is to look at the reality of the reality. Is that same? So when you dischoice is the one you find an actual integral form for the square root of the integral. Yeah, yes. So okay. So the generic formulas give you all of them. So there's a standard way of evaluating the square root using this Jordan normal form. There's a formula for that, but they will give you all of them. I have a final. I have a feeling that it should give you all the primary ones. If it is only one, then it should be this one, if it is one. But the standard way that I know of is the one going through Jordan decomposition, and that gives all the primary roots, basically. And also the conditions when a primary root becomes non-primary. But if you get one, then it should be this one. Yes. Okay. So very good. Then we look at the reality condition. Then we look at the reality condition, okay? That the square root must be real. If it is not real, then your action is imaginary. So, if you impose the condition that the square root is real, then you can show that the reality of S, the reality of the square root, is in one-to-one correspondence with the statement that the null cones of the two matrix must intersect. Okay, so the question about the signature, if the signature can be arbitrary, is uniquely determined here. No. Is uniquely determined here. No. The null cones must intersect, and therefore they must all have a common time direction. Okay. So we essentially have to define the theory with a principal square root and intersecting null cones. And if you do that, then you will see that the theory will remain within that. It will not come out of that. Okay. And there is a problematic condition here, which also gives you a real square root, but this here, this. Square root, but this here, this configuration has no primary root. They're all non-primary, so this is ruled out by the two conditions. So the final statement is that the theory essentially guarantees that you have a unique structure by looking at the principal square root and that the two matrix have compatible three plus one decomposition and compatible. Three plus one decomposition and compatible space-time structures. Okay, okay, so now let me go. Okay, and there are lots of discussions about the causality problems with this theory. There are a large number of papers by Stanley Daser and collaborators, basically, that argue that the theory is not causal. And essentially, all of them, the ones which are correct in The ones which are correct and mathematically not incorrect, they all rely on this configuration, which is not allowed basically. Okay, okay, so that all that stuff is essentially answered by this observation. Okay, now we move on. Okay, so this was the story of two spin two fields. The question now is what happens if you go beyond two and you want to have more than two spin two fields. Want to have more than two spin-two fields. And that story becomes much more complicated. The full answer is not known. So, okay, now before doing that, it turns out that if you go beyond two spin two fields, then it's easier to write down the theory in terms of field binds rather than matrix. So let's look at a field bind structure. So just to remind you, of course, a field bind is just an object in terms of which you can write the matrix in this way. Can write the metric in this way. So the field one contracted with the eta AB is a Minkowski metric. So these are this E is a field one of the metric G. And if G is a, if G has 10 components, which is a symmetric rank two tensor, field binds E, A, mu will have 16 components because A is in the Lorentz local Lorentz space, mu is in the coordinate space, and the field bind has no symmetry, so it has 16 components. No symmetry, so it has 16 components. It's useful to parametrize field points in this way, where L is a local Lorentz transformation, and local Lorentz transformations have six parameters, three Lorentz boosts and three Lorentz rotations. Sorry, three Lorentz boost and three spatial rotations. And E hat is a gauge fixed field bind. So E hat, E hat basically contains exactly the same. Exactly the same functions that go into the matrix G mu nu. Okay, so this is uniquely given by the matrix G mu nu, and all the other degrees of freedom are in the Lorentz transformation. So this is an easy way of parameterizing a field wine. And this is in fact, so this is quite useful. Okay. So every Fieldbine E will have Lorentz parameters and it will have matrix parameters in them. Six Lorentz parameters and ten metric parameters. Okay, so now. Okay, so now it's instructive to first look at biometric here in the field bind formulation. That structure is very nice and easy. So we write two Anich and Hilbert terms for the two field binds here. That's the easy part. Then you write a series of interactions like this. So a wedge product of the Fieldbind small E, these are small E is the field bind of G, and capital E is the field bind of F. is the field bind of f so this is a cosmological constant for g which is theta zero then four field binds of the cat one this is the cosmological constant f have other term which three field binds of e one field of f two field bind g three field bind of one of f two of g f one of g three of f okay you can easily write down these terms and it turns out that this is equivalent to the biometric Out that this is equivalent to the biometric interaction that I wrote earlier. And in fact, if you look at the equations of motion for this theory, one conjugate from the equation of motion, yes. This basically means that if you contract two field binds, B indices with eta B, and you anti-symmetrize the mu nucleus, this anti-symmetric combination is zero. Anti-symmetric act of two field binds is zero. This is an equation of This is an equation of motion coming from this Lagrangian. Okay, and you can easily see that equation of motion for the product of two field lines, this is exactly the same as evaluation of this matrix. They are exactly the same, basically. If you want to solve this condition, that means that you are evaluating the square root of matrix. They are equally complicated. The Fieldwein theory may look simpler, but one Simpler, but once you try to solve this coin, then it becomes difficult as the other one. Okay, so this is the start. Okay, now go beyond the albines. So now let's look at n feelbines. So we look at n makes g capital I, where capital I go from one to n. So you have now g's, sorry, you have n spin twelves. I write all of them. I write all of them a g menu index r, and you, of course, will have n mines ei. Okay, and now you can look at okay, so then now an action was proposed for this theory, which is just the isometrized product of all the field bonds taken at all possible ways. Okay, and it looked that this one was ghostly, and that's what the authors claimed in the beginning, but then it Authors claimed in the beginning, but then it turned out that no, the things had been overlooked. The was ghost-free. Okay, so this doesn't. And then some people conclude that maybe no ghost-free theory exists for more than two-spin, two fields with no interactions. Now, I will show you that that's not the case. In fact, some actually do exist. So look at this action now. So you have n spin two fields, you write n. Spin two fields, you write n of the iron hiltion, then you construct an interaction term. This just take the sum of all the field binds, all the L field binds, take a linear combination of them, and take a determinant of this matrix. That's the interaction. Okay, and this actually is ghost-free. So, you can actually argue that this has the correct number of constraints to eliminate the ghost, and we have solved the constraints numerically. The continents numerically to see that they actually need the right kind of physical network. Okay. So, how use the two by just the two? You told us it was one S at the internal number. Yeah. So if you remove this, that's the matrix case. But this is a special class of metric. So one plus. So one plus s were in life's case the coefficient beta were equal when all the couplings are equal. So that was a way of motivating the interaction basically. Okay. Yeah. Now, how does this correspond to the how does this compare to the previous general action that people wrote down and it turned out to be not free? The relationship is that they had these coefficients with now Which is now that beta is a subduct of in betas. Okay, beta one, beta two, beta three, beta four, just product of them. So this is a special, but this is ghost free. Okay. Is this ghost-free? A little bit more about the actual here. Okay. So okay, so the classes go through now. We can also down general. Now we can also write down generalizations of this, but we don't know the full structure. Okay. Now, a little bit more information about this. So that's the action that we start with in the first line. The equation of motion looks like this, the equation of. And if you look at this piece, the V mu this is the variation of the potential of the interaction term with respect to the field bind. It has a symmetry piece and an anti-symmetry. It has a symmetric piece and an anti-symmetric piece. Now, if you look at this equation, the Hilbert part only has symmetric pieces. So, this would mean that the symmetric and anti-symmetric vanish separately. So, in particular, the angle part of this V. Okay. If you look at what implies or this is the equation of motion for the Lorentz parameters of the fields, ones have Lorentz parameters, so when you evaluate the equation, Factors, so when you evaluate the equation of motion, you can evaluate the Lorentz factors, and this is the equation of motion for that. For two matrix, you get science of the anti-similarization condition for two that I mentioned earlier. This was equivalent to the square root and field bond theory that we wrote down, the anti-similar condition. So it's one of the field lines and some of all the other field bonds that product the symmetries. Now, general field theory, which was not ghost-free, this condition becomes much more complicated. This is just bilinear in the field wise. This is okay. But general theory, which people thought was free, but it turned out not to be ghost-free. The analog of this equation is highly non-linear in the productial minds. So that is the problem. This does not, the argument will not work. Here, the structure. Here, the structure. What this means also is that, in analogy with this, if the field bind E1 has a matrix G1 and the sum of the field bind, if you define a matrix for the sum of the field binds, think of all as a field bind, define a matrix, and these matrix will have their null cones will intersect. And this is true for every field bind and the sum of all the other field binds. sum of all the other field points okay and at least numerically if you look at this equation then this equation basically numerically you can this equation implies that the alcons of these matrix will intersect it all have a common intersection which means that in this theory also the Rossian space-time is well defined basically okay so okay so that's the structure of null cones that follows here absence Here, absence of ghosts. This is important, arguing that there are no ghosts in the theory, and for more general fear-bind theory, the structure gets up, so you get ghosts. Okay, okay. So, that's as much as we know. And okay, okay, now we go here. Okay, so this is something very fast. So, this is something very fast. So, then try to look at the mass spectrum of this TA. So, you look at around field binds again, like this, all field binds proportional to each other. Then you have an Einershan space matrix. You get an effective cosmological constant. And you can parametrize the fluctuations of Fieldbine. You can start with Fieldbine and expand it around the background with a Lorentz parameter. Lorentz parameter parameter matrix fluctuations. So the Lorentz parameters and the K-lipization. This is easy to parameterize fluctuations of both Lorentz and metric degrees of freedom in the field. And compute the mass matrix. So you get mass matrix. And you can very easily check this always has a zero eigenvalue. So you have a massless mode. Mode modes found out, or have to find the values of this equation without complication. Basically, I stop here. So, okay, this is all what we know for sure about theories. So, what essentially can one say more? There's a question of causality. Are these theories causal? Do they admit causal evolution? As far as we know, yes. As far as we know, yes. But there is no concrete proof. But the violation of causality people had constructed, they turned out to be incorrect, basically. So as far as we know, everything works okay. Superluminality, yes, you have superluminality, but non-Einstein backgrounds, which is okay. So you have faster than light, but the theory is still causal, so there is no problem. In fact, in simple models of primary, Models of primary very early on, some modes propagate five times the speed of light, okay, and the number is five, okay. But there is causal, okay. You have initial constant, you get fun, you have initial data, you get final evolution, future evolution. So, and that's not a problem. Okay, the two fields mix. The two fields mix the states mixture fields, and this is unavoidable here. So, this is like neutrinos, which have mixing, but unlike neutrinos, this the nature of mixing is given the theory. For neutrinos, the theory allows you to have mixed or un doesn't matter. Nature tells you mix. In this case, the mixed mixing is. The mixing is by default built into the theory. It's the only option. Okay, systematics of multiple spin interactions. We don't know the full system on two spins. We are certain that some extent model that I do exist for more than two spin fields. We have some of them and ensure that they are ghost-free. General structure is known. Okay, and these are formulated in terms of. And these are formulated in terms of the field binds. The question is, does a formulation pure in terms of matrix exist or not? An open question. You can have extra symmetry. I showed you no extra space. But in order to have theory with extra symmetry, then you need to modify the kinetic terms. And life becomes more complicated because the canonical strategy theory is. The theory is and in particular, you can have this McDowell-Mansuri type of constructions based on higher gauge group, basically, and they can give testing results. These are not very well. And that is the end of my talk. Thank you. Thank you for the nice involvement. Yeah, the question, yeah, 70 microphone. Yeah, this one. Yes, actually, two microphones. Yes, how do you speed of light? Do you couple an electromagnetic field to one of the bricks? Yes. Yes. So you can take G mu nu to be so you can take g mu nu to be the gravitational matrix that that divides the speed that all matter fields will move like fields. And then you see that you have a you have two massless polarizations that move at the speed of light. So that determines the speed of light. But then you have a scalar rate, which is coming from the massive spin field. From the massive spin field, and that one moves five faster than what of light. So, the speed of light, the speed of propagation, massless tensor models, which is the same as the one, the speed of propagation of photons in that theory. Okay, and of course, quantum mechanics is something we we do just. We do just have some interesting relations, local unitarities. The Hilbert space now will be the Hilbert space of the two theories. The evolution can be unitary in bigger Hilbert space. But since we have access basic and only two things, you can have some with also violation in the other way, so the probability. Other ways, or the probability growing to speak. Yeah, exactly. So that would be like dark matter. Matter is a hidden quantum sector that we don't see. So dark evaluating an SMH takes where you take into account dark matter will give you unitarity violation if you do data. Yes. I have a question which is a really I have a question which is related to what you said. There has been a paper recently, or I mean, I don't know how recent, but anyway, by Damur and Smikla, I think, where they say that even though there are theories where the kinetic term in the Hamiltonian will tell you that there is a ghost, the ghost is not problematic because you can define the unitary quantum evolution operator. So, I don't know what you think about that. So, this is a large subject, of course, where Course, where you have a ghost in classical theory, but then you define your quantum theory in such a way that your okay, so in quantum theory, the ghost appears at the pole of a propagator. At the pole, the propagator will have the wrong, the residual has the wrong sign. And you define your quantum theory in such a way that these poles are excised. That's one way of doing it, for example. But they require modifying the quantization procedure in some way or the other. So they may be valid, they may not be valid, but they are usually an unorthodox ways of looking at the theory. So if you just do standard quantization, you will see the ghost. Yeah. Also, there is There is one or two recent papers by Sediq Defaille, Shinji Mokoyama, and collaborators Vikman, where they actually claim that, okay, they actually write down the classical theory, classic, sorry, the particle models with negative kinetic term and they show that, okay, nothing wrong happens. So this is, of course, also possible. I have not looked at it in detail. I have not looked at it in detail, but in principle, you can cook up theories where you have a ghost, but the evolution doesn't blow up anywhere. It's okay, classically. Even classical evolution, it looks okay. Yeah, but I'm using the standard definition of ghost and the standard quantization procedure, etc. Yeah. Yes. No question. More questions. Thank you for a very nice presentation there. The way you presented it, I didn't see anything that special about four dimensions. Was there something special? No. Okay. No. So the structure I give you can be written in any dimensions from two to infinity. It's just that the square root becomes larger and in four dimensions. And in four dimensions, you had four elementary semantic polynomials. In 15, you will have 15 of them. So you will have more and more interaction terms. But otherwise, the ghost structure, the analysis, everything is general, dimension independent. For both bimetric and multi-metric, there is no dimension dependence. Thank you. Thank you for the nice talk. I wanted to ask: so, if I consider that the second If I consider that the second spin two field is not a two index metric tensor, but it's perhaps a three index metric tensor, three index not symmetric, but two, one tensor. Does this go through somehow? Has anybody looked at this? I have not looked at it and I think maybe a few people may have looked at it. And I don't know what happens then. Okay, so. Okay, so one thing, of course, also is that if you have a three-index object, that generically means spin three. But spin three, even in the standard case, that becomes part of higher spin. So if you want to have, so you can write down that area of mass this spin three with certain symmetry, gauge symmetry. But if you want to have interaction, then you need spin four. And you need, you want to have interaction with spin four. You want to have interaction with spin four, you need spin five. So, once you go to spin three, then you need the infinite tower. So, in that sense, two is index two is a kind of very special. Yeah, but I meant three indices, but spin two still. I mean, like you can have specific specific ones. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Like a hook-yang tableau, for example. Yeah, I don't know. So, I know that before people constructed this like massive gravity with spin. Like massive gravity with spin two, when it was believed that these theories always have Bolivar-Deaser ghosts, some people were trying to write down theories of massive spin two with three index objects. I have not followed it. Yeah, so at least before 2011, there is work on spin three, sorry, three index fields denoting, sorry, three index fields. Sorry, three index fields describing massive spin two particles. But I don't know the details.
