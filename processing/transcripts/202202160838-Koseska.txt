In and also change over time and spaces. And this is not a situation that happens only when neutrophils, for example, chase bacteria, but also in tissues during development or during wound healing. Cells have to migrate over long trajectories and they deal through these tissues with signals which could be disrupted. And in order for cells to be able to respond. To respond properly in such conditions, they need to, on one hand, have a temporal memory of the location of the previous signals in order to avoid random walk and generate a robust migratory path over a large distance. But on the other hand, this memory should not be limiting for the cell. So the cell needs to maintain responsiveness to the upcoming signals and use this memory to be able to compare, for example, when there are conflicting signals and Are conflicting signals and how to resolve them. So, in order to do this, we first wanted to study how cells in general would send signals which change over time. And to do this, we used one example from the receptor tyrosinkinase family, the UNCO protein of the epidermal growth factor receptor. And like many other receptors, upon ligand binding, and EGF is the most common ligand, the receptor dies. Is the most common ligand. The receptor dimerizes and activates, but it has been shown mainly in the lab of Philippe Bastians that only not only the ligand-bound, but also the ligandless receptors contribute significantly to the signaling because they are able to autocatalytically activate. And even more, the ligand-bound receptors can promote autocatalysis of the ligandless receptors. So, my group was previously in the we were In the department of Bastions, and we joined to understand how the EGFR senses time-varying signals. And they had developed a beautiful experimental system in the lab to be able to tackle this question. So they have epithelial cell lines where the receptors are fluorescently tagged, and the EGF is also fluorescently tagged. And also, there is a protein tyrosine binding domain that is fluorescently tagged, that translocates. That this fluorescently tag that translocates to phosphorylated receptors. So one could measure simultaneously in live cells both the localization of these receptors, but also their activity. And we can also discriminate between ligand-bound and ligand-less receptors. So if we look into a dose response, and we did dose response in live single cells, where we increased the dose of the ligand in every 1.5 to 2 minutes. 1.5 to 2 minutes. And we looked how the fraction of the postporylated receptor is dependent, but in this case, on the fraction of the ligand-bound receptors rather than the ligand dose, because we wanted to not have the effect of the ligand-binding dynamics. And we can see that at low ligand concentrations, so physiological concentrations, actually for approximately 20% of ligand-bound receptors, 20% of ligand-bound receptors, we achieve, or the cells have approximately 70% of phosphorylated receptors, which suggests that there is a strong contribution of the ligandless receptors to the activation response of the system. We can also track the trafficking dynamics, both of the ligandless and the ligand-bound receptors. So we quantify this also in the experiments. And the ligand-bound receptors, they internalize very rapidly. They internalize very rapidly and they traffic unidirectionally to the lysosome for the degradation. So they are actually not really the main sensing entities when there is a when there is growth factor, which changes over time, because they can sense only once. EGF is a high affinity binding ligand. Receptors are quickly internalized and they will be degraded. However, because they can promote autocatalysis of the ligandless receptors, now the ligandless receptors, they Now, the ligandless receptors maintain the information that there has been a ligand through their activity. And these receptors actually recycle. So they are internalized, they will be dephosphorylated in the perinuclear area, and they return on the membrane and they are capable to sense the upcoming ligands. And the response of the system, however, does not depend on the receptor alone, but we also, through a larger screening study, we try to Larger screening study, we try to identify which are the main proteins which regulate the dynamics, activation dynamics of the epidermal growth factor receptor. And we have identified basically two main phosphatases, PTPRG, which is also localized on the membrane, and PTPN2 that is localized on the ER, but the EGFR interacts with PTPN2 via the vesicular recycling. And also, through experiments, we could identify. Through experiments, we could identify the basic network motifs, how they interact with the receptor, and how they activate the activity. So, now we have our basic sensing unit for the epidermal growth factor receptor. And we wanted to ask the next question, basically, how cells would sense signals that not only are disrupted, but also would change over space, or maybe they become conflicting for the cell. And in order to do this, The cell. And in order to do this, we need to also understand how the activity or the phosphorylation of the receptor will polarize on the cell membrane. So they have also a mechanism for the signaling polarization. And in this case, we first started with some theoretical hypothesis. And since we have our topology of the network, we can develop a reaction diffusion model that basically describes. Model that basically describes the phosphorylation dynamics in these spatial frames. So it's a very generic form of a reaction diffusion, but we can model the system in detail. So here U is our, represents the local densities of the active signaling components. F describes our chemical reactions in the system, and then D is the diffusion constants. And because both the receptor, but also one of the phosphatases, which are on the One of the phosphatases which are on the membrane can diffuse along the membrane. And what we would like is a mechanism that can basically describe in this language of dynamical system a switch when there is a signal presented to the system. There is a switch from the basal or a non-polarized state to a polarized state in the system. So we propose that there is one dynamical transition. Dynamical transition, so-called pitchfork bifurcations that actually produces such symmetry in the system. And we proposed also that if the receptor number on the plasma membrane is such that the system is organized exactly at this transition between an unpolarized and polarized state, when the cell is presented with the stimulus, then the system will switch from the attractor of the basal to the symmetry-broken attractor of the polarized state. Of the polarized state. But when we remove the signal, the system will not return immediately to the unpolarized state, but rather it will be trapped in a so-called memory state. And this memory state emerges because we lose this subtle node through which the pitchfork bifurcation is stabilized. We lose it when we remove the signal, and this generates a so-called dynamical ghost. And this dynamical ghost And this dynamical ghost is in terms of the activity trajectory of the system will be presented like a trapping in a certain phase-space area. So, this means that after we remove the signal, the system will still maintain polarity for a transient period of time. So, this is like a metastable state, and then the system will reset to basal. And in this metastable state, then the system can still maintain also the polarized shape of the cell, and this will be then reflected also in the migration. Also, in the migration. So, in order to be able to couple this to also changes in the cell shape and migration, we also generated a physical model of the cell where we model the cell as a viscoelastic cortex that's surrounding a viscous core. And we can represent the changes in the cell shape that is affected by the signaling dynamics through a Hamilton-Jacobi equation. And in this way, we could analyze the properties of the system. So, in the simulations, we simulated the cell with a spatial signal, so with a gradient, which is dynamic, basically changes from a very steep to a very shallow signal over time. And then, what we plot here is a chemograph of the receptor phosphorylation on the plasma membrane. So, we just take the rim of the cell, which is The rim of the cell, which is stretched, and then we look over time how the activity changes and how the cell shape, the shape of the cell changes. And then we can see that upon presentation of the stimulus, we get polarized signaling activity of the membrane. This is reflected or triggers a polarized cell shape. But more importantly, when we remove the signal, the cell maintains both the polarization in the signaling and also the polarization into cell shape. The polarization into cell shape stably for a transient period of time before resetting to a basal and a non-polarized state. So, in terms of migration, this would mean that cell will polarize upon presentation of a stimulus. It will move in the direction of the stimulus. But when we remove the stimulus, the cell will still maintain this directional motility for a transient period of time before. Of time before starting to move in a random direction. So we wanted to test this hypothesis also experimentally, and we were very fortunate to have this EGFR system from the Bastians lab. So we subjected cells to gradients of EGF in microfluidic devices, and basically we can measure the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor with spatial and a temporal. Factor receptor with spatial and a temporal distribution. And also, since the ligand is also fluorescently attacked, we can also measure our gradients. So we can establish stably the gradient. So we stimulated cells here with a gradient for duration of one hour and then measure the phosphorylation of the epidermal growth factor receptor. And this is one example of a chymograph of one such measurement of EGFR activity in the cell. And we see that during the gradient, And we see that during the gradient, the EGFR phosphorylation polarizes in the direction of the external signal. When we remove the gradient, we maintain this polarized activity for a transient period of time before the cell resets to the basal phosphorylation state. Whether this memory depolarization comes exactly from such ghost or metastable state as we predicted, so we took this as the measured EGF. So, we took this as the measured EGFR phosphorylation response in this temporal profile in this cell, which is basically integrated over the whole cell area. We can see also here nicely that after we remove the gradient, EGFR phosphorylation stays relatively high for a transient period of time before it rapidly dephosphorylates. And what we also have here is the fraction of the ligand bound receptors that we can also measure in the single cells. And we can see that this. Cells, and we can see that this polarized activity is not a consequence of a remnant EGF binding because the ligand-bound receptors exponentially decay on the plasma membrane after we remove the signal since they are rapidly internalized. So, we can reconstruct the phase-phase trajectory from these experimental measurements, and we can see that upon removal of the signal, we indeed have the switch of the system from the attractor of the basil to the attractor of the basil. To the attractor of the polarized, but we remove the signal, the system does not reset immediately to the basal and unpolarized state, but rather it maintains memory of this polarized activity for a transient period of time. Suggesting that indeed these epithelial cells use this metastable state in order to be able to maintain memory of previous signals. So we quantify. Signals. So we quantify this memory in single cells. It is relatively variable. It goes from 30 to 150 minutes in some cells. On average, memory would be around 40 minutes that cells would maintain the polarized activity and the polarized state. And this is also reflected in the cell shape. So we can quantify the cell shape in the experiments by using solidities, basically a ratio of the area over the area of a convex hull. Area over the area of a convex hull. And we can see that the cells will maintain this polarized shape also for a transient period of time, which is on average around 40 minutes, which matches the memory in the phosphorylation of the receptor. So we looked and next if this is reflected also in memory and migration. Will they maintain directional migration after we remove the signal? And we stimulated in this case the cells with a dynamic gradient per five hours. So we have a Gradient for five hours. So we have a gradient which steepness changes over time from a very steep to a very shallow. And we can see: so green is the trajectory of the cell during the gradient, red is after removal of the gradient. So we see that even after we wash out the EGF, and this can be achieved very quick in the microfluintic devices, we have memory in the directional migration of the cell. So these are some. So, these are some quantifications of several cells, and after the memory is lost, the cells start to do a random walk, which is very similar to how cells would migrate in absence of an EGF. So, in order to quantify whether the property of the migration or the features of the migration in these memory states are similar to those of the migration in the presence of the gradient, we quantify the cosine. We quantify the cosine of the basically the direction that the cell is moving with respect to the direction of the external gradient. So if they will be properly aligned to the gradient, then the cosine of the theta will be equal to 1. When there is no EGF, they will randomly walk, so the cosine will be distributed between minus 1 and 1, which is indeed what we see in the case of no EGF. Of no EGF. Whereas when there is a gradient, we see that the cells align themselves to the gradient. And if we also estimate the kernel density distribution of this cosine theta, we see that the distribution is shifted towards one in the presence of the gradient. So then we try to see, okay, how long will cells maintain this directional migration after we'll remove the gradient? So we use like a sliding window in order. A sliding window in order to find a kernel density distribution that will be similar to this one in the presence of the gradient. And we find that cells on average move 50 more minutes or maintain memory of their directional migration for 50 more minutes before the system or the cells will start exhibiting random walk as they would generally do in absence of a growth factor. In absence of a growth factor. So, this shows that receptors, EGFR receptors, operate in such a regime close to such a critical transition so that they can generate a memory of the previously encountered signals. And this memory and signaling is then reflected into a memory of the cell polarized cell shape. And cells can use this memory to maintain a directed motility, which would be of use. Motility, which would be of use, for example, when the signals would be disrupted. So, in order just to test whether our connection between memory of signaling and memory of migration indeed goes via this memory in the receptor signaling, we had experiments when we, after we remove the gradient or the EGF, we wash out the cells with lapatinib, which is an inhibitor for the EGFR activity. So, from these temporal profiles, you see. These temporal profiles, you see that immediately the EGFR phosphorylation will exponentially decline. And if we reconstruct now the phase-based trajectory, we can see that the system from the attractor of the polarized state will be directly reset to the retractor of the basal activity state. So it has no memory, and this absence of memory is also reflected in the migration because immediately after we remove the gradient in the The gradient in the microfluidic experiments, the cells will start moving in a random walk. And also, we can see this effect of absence of memory also by quantifying the cell shape. Basically, after removal of the gradient, the polarized cell shape is relatively quickly lost. So, then we ask the question whether such a temporal memory will help signal. Memory will help signals to migrate when integrate the signals in an environment which is noisy and when these signals will change both in time and space. So we generated a simulation where we first stimulate from one side. Yeah. Sorry. In the previous slide, I just, you know, in the previous slide, when you were showing, or two slides, you were showing the videos of the cells moving. Maybe you. Moving, maybe you mentioned it and I missed it, but the time scale is very long, right? In 10 hours, things move like 100 micrometers. So, is that typical or? So, first, the range of our EGF or the growth factor, so if the cells, for example, sit on the very end, so in the very, very shallow gradients, they will see very low concentrations. So, our gradient is from 20 and From 20 nanograms per milliliter is the highest concentration, and on the other side, it reaches to very, very low EGF concentration. So it's a linearly distributed. So if there is a very low EGF, they would take time to start migrating, maybe especially to establish the direction. So if you can see, for example, here in the Cosen-Tito plot, it takes around 30 minutes for them to establish direction because the gradients are very shallow. Because the gradients are very shallow. And these are epithelial cells. So they're not also fast-migrating cells. Fast migrating. Yeah, I'm asking in context of development also where these things are. Okay, got it. Okay, thank you. So we generated a situation where the signals would be disrupted and they would also change a position. And in our case, when the system is criticality, the system can integrate and adapt. Can integrate and adapt its, the cell can adapt its migration depending on the location of the signal. So, when there is a signal presented from the opposite side, the cell can also rapidly repolarize and move in the proper direction. And in all these times, it maintains memory of the previous signal and is also reactive because, for example, in this case, the second signal we presented to the cell. We presented to the cell during it had a memory from the first signal, and the cell can integrate the signals. And just as a comparison, how it would be different if the cell would be, since our hypothesis is that the cells operate exactly at this critical region, how the cell would behave if it operates after the bifurcation. So, if the cell operates in the region of the stable attractor of the polarized state. Well, in that case, already the first signal, we switch the system to the polarized. Signal, we switch the system to the polarized state, and this will generate a long-term memory. And this long-term memory will leave the cell non-responsive to the upcoming signal. Basically, when we present with the signal from the opposite side, the cell will not be able to resolve these competing signals because it's very hard to remove the cell from the stable attractor or it will resolve it in a physiologically non-relevant way. Physiologically non-relevant time. So it takes a very long time to be able to resolve these signals. So we generate a similar experimental paradigm where we give signals first in this case from the left which are disrupted and then we switch the direction of the signal and we also see in the experiments that our cells are able to integrate these different signals. They present memory with respect Represent memory with respect to each of the signals, but also in the memory they are responsive to the upcoming signal. And this type of memory, where the system can store the information over time while still remaining responsiveness to the upcoming signal, is what in neuronal systems we know as a working memory. So, what we propose here is that cells use a form of a molecular working memory to be able to navigate in changing environments, and for this they use. Environments. And for this, they utilize metastable dynamics because that helps them to process time-varying signals. And this actually triggered for us another very general question. And here I would like to just show you an outline on something that we are working at the moment. Basically, if we have, if the receptors in the cell have such a temporal memory in their receptor phosphorylation, will this contribute for the cells? this contribute for the cells to be able to integrate signals in order to generate classes of signals that they would then map to specific phenotypic outputs. So would this be helpful in a way for decision making, how cell responds to specific signals? And this is important because there are numerous examples where exactly the same growth factor, so for example, EGF can cause both proliferation and differentiation. It activates the same And differentiation, it activates the same receptor and same downstream components, but still the signaling networks exhibit specificity, so they can map the right input to a specific phenotypic output. But also, the signaling networks exhibit generalization because many different growth factor inputs can generate the same phenotypic output. So we at the moment We at the moment try to formulate this also, well, primarily theoretically, in order to understand how we can describe this specificity and generalization based on systems that have memory on the level of the input layer. And if we have signals that change over time, then the state of the system will also depend on the structure of the external signal. So instead of the classical representation, so we are familiar with these attractor landscapes where we see or we Where we see, or we usually describe how the signal would push the cell from one to the other stable attractor. When we have time-varying signals, what happens is that both the topology and the position of the steady states change. So, this attractor changes shape. And when this landscape changes the shape, we cannot formally, we cannot describe anymore the solutions of the system through their steady state, but it's necessary to describe or formally. It's necessary to describe, or formally, the solution of such a system, non-autonomous system, will be the trajectories in the system. So, we use this as our theoretical framework in order to define how cells would use dynamic trajectories in order to map input to a specific phenotypic output. So, our hypothesis is that dynamic memory in the level of the input layer of the cells, on the level of the research. Of the cells on the level of the receptor networks will enable such robust input to trajectory class mapping, which can be identified to a specific phenotypic response. Because, depending on the memory duration, each receptor will generate classes of inputs that will be mapped to a family of signaling trajectories, whereas a different signal with a different characteristic will be mapped out to a different signaling. To a different signaling trajectory. And these differences in the signaling trajectories will then trigger differential activation of the early response genes and thereby will be mapped to differential phenotypic outputs. And even though we are not completed with this project, we already have some predictions. So how each receptor would classify the signals is, of course, dependent by the memory length. So receptors that have memory length so receptors that have memory of approximately 40 minutes will generate different classes which signals will be similar or which signals will be will be different than receptors which have a memory of approximately 60 minutes, let's say. Also on our framework, the topology or the structure of the signaling network does not really matter. So this concept would generate a robust input to trajectory class mapping. Input to trajectory class mapping, even when we have an arbitrary structure of the signaling biochemical signaling network. And we also can predict that the intermediate early response genes would generate differential expansion patterns already 20 minutes after presentation with the stimulus, which suggests that both the encoding and the decoding of the external signals in cells. Signals in cells could happen in real time, and that generating specificity but also generalization of their phenotypic responses can be an emergent property of networks that have memory on the level of the receptors. So, that was all what I wanted to tell you about. So, the work on the memory in Memory in cellular migration was driven by two excellent PhD students that are actually having their defenses in next weeks, Akilesh Nandan and Abishek Das, with help of Robert. And the project on the theory of general information processing using networks that have memory on the level of the receptors is driven by Manish. And with that, and I And with that, and I would definitely should mention our long-term and very fruitful collaborations with Philippe Bastians at the MPI in Deutschland. And thank you for your attention. Thank you, Anna. So I think we have time for one or two questions. Alex, go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, you were just clapping your hand.
