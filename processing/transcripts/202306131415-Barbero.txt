Okay, thank you. So first of all, my apologies for not being here. It has been an unfortunate hypo that keeps me here. And I would like to thank the organizers to give me the opportunity to describe my food combat and also to call from only so I'm very appreciative. So yesterday you guys were introduced into yourself and I started to my GPU metic control theory. But they close to geometric mechanics, and I kind of, in the last years, been working a bit more in like geometric inspirators, together with Labi Mato Diego, like many of you know, John, here who's also here at Isma in a bit, and Juligo Sado, who was this present with a bit. So, what I'm gonna have to think here is something that started a couple of years ago. And it And how to use traction maps to define a new map in order to define the magic integrations for mechanical systems. So we are looking, we're trying to find in sensitive descriptions that will guarantee us the simplicity of the numerical directors. You know, there are different ways to do medical analysis. We can just discretize the differential equations we have. The differential equations we have in place, or we will try to keep some kind of structure in the system. Just be the synthetic structure, basically with the distribution of the volume form. So we are trying to look for synthetic integrity. So I will start by minding the paradigmal principle introduced back by Marx and the beginning of the century. And as you know, we already explored some of the functions in workshops. And this would be the continuous psi. And in the counterpart, we extend the positions and velocities by two copies of Q. So typically, how we simply use our paper is what we have on principle and we will describe or define a discrete analog of the functional. create another of the functional we have to minimize and that will be a summary that has as many terms as the points we have in the code. And then we will look for necessary conditions for humanity specifically and on the continuous counterpart we get the old Lebanese equations and on the discrete counterpart we get the discrete Lebanese equations where the V1 refers to the integration with respect to the first variable and the V2. First, valuable and the need to step to the second net. So the idea is when we are in a clean space, we usually have a trajectory and as we all know we can use a Newton's method to have a linear approximation of the curve and one agreement with kinetic plane space of manifold without curvature. From the alt curvature, if we move along the tiny line, it will be in the same state. But these things change if we're working on manifolds with curvatures, it would be like here. And then in that case, if we have some kind of hydrogen free and we want to move along the tangent vector, this is not going to be in the sphere nest value. So that's where the fraction map has. The exponential map of remaining user and remaining manifolds is guaranteed that it would be obtaining a point on this sphere. So there are different ways to do that. One is using exponential map or going to the action of the sphere and so on. So the journey of my first appearing detail on the theories from an ecological perspective and as far as I know but got him here until 50 years later. Until 50 years later you cannot shoot from the 80s to start using it thinking about restructuring maps to study dynamical systems and luminance. So in the dispute relational principle, the focus is on discretizing the hand-closing principle, so we are discretizing equations. And when the Lagrangian we have is regular, we know we can we know we can think describe the equations as a second orbit vector field. It will look something like that. Sorry, I'll put this light here. And then this is going to be sometimes called the earlier transpector field that is going from TQ to TQ1 and then we have big identities. We got identities and the lateral anomaly operation on a tiny man. So we want to obtain medical vectors by focusing on this space, that is, where the vector field is taking values, and we are going to use the continuous dynamic. But we will discretize this space. So we are not discretizing so much equations, but the configuration discretization. That's how we're going to do it. So we are going to associate to this. So we are going to associate to this tangent model two copies of TQ. Similar to the function we had earlier from the distributional principle. And this can be done in the branching propolism and of course can be done also in the Hamiltonian propolism. And as you know, again, if the branching is regular, we can have a Hamiltonian vector field that in this case would be In this case, we'll be defining the tanium balance and we keep taking values in this tanner. And then we're going to be more interested in working in these kind of manifolds because then we can start symplectic structures to them, and then we can very easily run these easily of the network methods to ourselves. So this is what we described in the paper but published last year about additional computational mathematics. So that's more or less the idea and what we wanted to say here is something we used recently, this week, at LoC2Archive, and on how to use these methods when we have mechanical systems with harmonic constraints. So some examples yesterday in the last talk that we also have not That we also have non-holonomic constraints, but so far we just speak with holonomy. So, in order to do that, before describing the main object or our technique, I'm gonna just review what the holonomy constraint is. And you all know, but I assume we have a systemic on Q, and I just gave a simple example. I didn't have the IC feature, and it is a double. It is a double pendulum, and as you know, we can look at the double pendulum as in s1 the circle, s1 times s1, we will describe the proticles. And in this case, we will just obtain difficult Lebanon equations as if there are no restrictions, as it's already in the micro. Or we could think of this as a Think of this as a submanifold of R2 times R2. That means we're going to be describing the position of these two particles subjected to the restriction of realms have to be kept here. And that will give us the holonomic concept. So these two approaches beside the same mechanical system is what we call the intrinsic, starting your own times is one, or the strengths. All the things that we embed again and make it in a bigger manifold. Of course, when we're trying to get numerical incubators, engineers, I believe, I'm not engineers, but there are many more engineers doing that, they feel more comfortable if they're doing a mix analysis in the cloud state and not in Ling Chains. But what we're trying to do is uh go to the fixed Blink Stick and Links this and come back to our intensive description and see if our fifth hope is satisfying the astronomical constraints we have to face. Because that's one of the problems you see here when trying to get medical information for mechanical systems, that constraints won't be satisfied precisely by two. So that's what we want to get. But by claiming the intrinsic formulation, we also have the typical. We just have the typical cuisine that there are normal constraints, and in this insect, we have the Madam Duspinsil showing up with the familiar electronic carriers. And as Alan and Winston say, almost everything is electronic manical. And as we are picking for syntheticity, instead of working on companion bundles, we're gonna go to the companion bundle tool and then we're gonna be working on the And then we're going to be working on Lagrangian's manifolds to have different. And again, I can associate a Lagrangian manifold in to state the differential, one coming from the Lagrangian. And I can also associate another Lagrangian manifold on that explinit description, where the emphasis is: I cannot forget my base point has to be not only on n, but I want. Not only on n, but I want to try to look the tangent to that manifold, so I will never believe my constraints with one. So just a short note here, like a dimensional manifold, the way to describe it. Quickly just have dimension of the symplectic manifold. The symplectic manifold we can have, the manimano, and the pullback is we think of the element of x cones on q, the pullback is x. So this Lagrangian submanicole in the extinct view point, so in the big one and the plutonium and the cube, it has these expressions, it can be written by the way. And just to keep all simple, let's look at this last expression here. What we see, they are showing a family list of the current multipliers, and one is coming from the differential of And one is coming from the differential of the economic constraint, because that n is given by the figures of the alpha, as you can see here, the point of n. And then we also have this bottom family of like mass multiplier that is related to the final one, the fibers never zips away from our constraints of m. Because precisely these two families of constraints define the family vandal of n. So beta to be appear in this mechanism. Appear in this conscience manipulation transfer to some problems about how to introduce the photonometry constraints for doing speed variation of principles. And one option is we ask for all the points in the speed flow to precisely be in the constraints to manifold. In the constraints of manifold, or we can define some kind of function, like it's a typically a comma combination of two consecutive points of the land growth. And then the point, the numerical interference signals, none of them are satisfied in the space, but in some intermediate point was satisfied. So that sometimes will lead to some stability issues when it's integrated for a long time. Is candidated for a long time. So we want to get to deep, but not using the virtual principles, but focusing on discretizing the configuration management and using the continuous renovation. So in fact, we can last year have seen a few papers showing up by Lina Colony, Norman Leo, David Chime, this is MicroShape Motor Orient Mon. And collaborators And collaborate was trying to find numerical integrators for the holonomics of space. There were different approaches, different from the one we are bringing here today, and also for flip-loop integrators, so let's now finally introduce what we call, after the suggestions from the referees, a session map, that is a generalization of the reflection map. Retraction map. So, as I mentioned earlier, retraction maps should have again in applications related to small regions on matrix manifolds at the beginning of this entry, by people like Axlow, Max Honey, Adelaide. And then what we are doing is, at the reflection map, as I was picturing at the beginning, if I give point and velocity, it will give me another point on the manifold. point on the manifold and our discretization map is gonna receive point and velocity but it's gonna give us two points and not necessarily the first point has to be x to take both big backward and a big hole so it's a bit more general than the reflection mark but of course we can be easily difficult to do the reflection so the two conditions was to end in reflection mark is at the velocity we just recorded the same point Just record the same point. And analogously, we have this communication for a discretization map. At zero velocity, we just get the process idea. And then we have this second condition, that is what is known as local Bucharest condition to guarantee the approximation the right approximation of the curves, that is telling us that this tangent map at the zero velocity is uh identity. There are some identifications here, basically when we are looking at different mechanical systems, have to be done. And the way to pass this condition to our framework fixation map, after thinking about it, it was to take this difference of the tiny map of all the components defining this extraction map. As we could definitely linear maps, defining tanium space, this extraction makes sense. Find the space, this abstraction mechanism, and then we're gonna ask them to be map again. So, our object is the Q map. We have it down here. And as in mechanical systems, we know if I have a curve on Q, gamma, I can list it and get the integral curve of the hybrid transaction, the obvious. Of the Iron Range, the largest writing area in the slides. So, with this idea of listing, we are going to apply for the disputation maps because, as I mentioned earlier, we can either work in the Lagrangian formalism or we can work in the Hamiltonian formalism. Again, if the Lagrangian is regular, I can use the Lagander transform, that would technically the Hutanium bundle. And then here, what I have is precisely the Hammond-Continium bundle. Precisely the Hammond Hammondium vector field. I don't know, right? And local problems for the Hamiltonian vector field are given in this way. And then what we're going to do is, from this discretization map, we are going to lift it to something that is discretizing the space where the homotopy method field is taking values. So that's why we get two copies of the hotany. Is called takotani. And then the way we construct it, we have here a bunch of maps. And this one is what is known as the full CGF canonical synthetomorphism that gives these two manifolds have a syntactic structure associated. Then in here we have, because of the conditions, we have this disease map that That it is a local differomorphism. So we can take the tannium, the inverse, take the tannium, and then make this dual. And this is true in the differential geometry. This is always a simple morphism as long as it's coming from a local hypermorphism. And we also have this natural implications. So these three maps happen to be in vector morphism. That means it's disturbing the symplectic structure associated with this manipulation. Of this manipulation. And as a consequence, the one up here is also a simple homomorphism. So here you see this is the distribution of the space. So here is what we're going to have about this flow associated with the Hamiltonian electric field. But we're going to be only using the continuous map to 106 flows. So that's what we proved in the paper. Like this map here, you have some of the local expressions. This total of the distribution map is a simple thermophyson, so it's giving rise to simplicity vectors and they're gonna be a time-meanway. We're gonna start from the expansion, we give a point and velocity. Again, assuming the function is regular, we pass onto the momentous into the total bundle, and then we look at this next point and it's it flows. Next point in the flow set that satisfies this condition. So, this is the Lagrangian submanifold we're having associated with the early Lagrangian spatial with no constraints. So, this was living on T star PQ is mapping back to uh T star T star Q star Q No. Yeah, sorry, it's like Q minus this and then this one finally takes two copies of the picture and then we keep on going this process until we get to the given initial and final conditions until we get all the unscoping condition of the number of points in the scope. So at any point So at any point all these vectors are corresponding to the slip flow on Q and then I can either take the fiber on the tanning model or either the fiber on the titanium model. So I can always recover this. And this is a synthetic integrated raton structure. So how do we use this when we have polynomial constraints? We have polynomial constraints. How we adapt this geometric procedure. So, as we say, we would like to have a discrete flow that precisely preserves the constraints at all times. That means we are gonna, since naturally starts from two focus of n, and that we are gonna use the fact that the specification map is locally. Mark it locally to move it through the tandem bundle of Q. Of course, this is not necessarily a tiny bundle of N and very rarely will be a tiny bundle of N. That's why we call it this COPFELT T. So what we are doing is we are modifying the continuous dynamic to guarantee that the steep flow deserves the holiday constraints. But that's not a problem, we can still apply this dynamic. The problem, we can still apply the same discriminatory. So, we'll have our branches of manifold defined on the description here, manifold. And the only thing is we're gonna work on the angulator of companion of this modified manifold. So, the two families of constraints showing up are these ones because this manifold we have is Have is described by these two constraints. Like basically the two points on the speed flow and n times n are satisfying the whole management strain. It seems the velocity is not playing any role, but in fact velocity will play a role depending on the discretization of what we have in the case, as we will see in the example. And then we start the same procedure to move from syntactic manifolds to another syntactic manifolds until we get Syntactic manifolds until we get our escape flow. So, this is again the two CF diffeomorphism to go back to CCCQ and then we have the citadel leaf. So, we now know the difference with respect to the mechanical system with constraints. We need to improve like the base point is on our constraint submanifold on F. Okay, and then because of this condition, we're going to be able by using the natural inclusion we have from N into Q, we're going to be able to provide performance intrinsic and give the momentum. So, lastly, this Lagrangian submanifold, this is the one here, has As this stressor, and from here we're going to obtain the numerical intake laser. So, as I said, we can move to the intensive description by using the natural encryption. We need to do the pullback and two copies of it, so everything works okay. And again, by construction, what we have is the simplest indicator for holonomic mechanical systems. Mechanical system. And this is another compact way to write down the steps I looked down earlier for the integrator in a mechanical system without strain. So remember, we started here, n times n, that was our focus. We modify the continuous dynamic with this listed, just doing applying the inverse of the institution mark. Institutional map so that we end up having a explicit current formulation on this microphone and then we go back to our intrinsic with this book. So this relates to some what is called discrete non-statis methods of the NDLETI curve by E. Perves and Negi-Necker and that studies are relation between the momentos on Q. relation between the momentos on Q can be related with the momentos of Pn because we are not taking momentum in the full potential model of Q but restricted to at this point on N. So this is another way to write these methods. And that's why this open us the path to try to implement this what they call the spinal space method for technical system with non-toroids.
