Okay, so let's continue with the final talk in this morning's session. Very pleased to have Buddha Fowler from Unicamp, who is going to tell us about the harmonic flow of SP2-SP1 structures on 8. Thanks, Jason, for the introduction. I'd like to thank the organizers for presentation. Ventration to do this toolkin panel. Okay, can everyone hear me at the back? Am I loud enough? Cool. Okay. All right. So I want to talk about the harmonic flow of SP2SP1 structures on eight manifolds. So I mean, this is the conference about sort of G2 and SPIN 7, so you might be wondering why is there SP2SP1 here and not G2 and SPIN 7? So I'll try to make the case that if you do replace it by one of these groups, If you do replace it by one of these groups, the same thing is more gonna hold. And I'll explain what the words in the title mean as I go on. But for the time being, let me tell you sort of what is this talk really about. So, oh, the thing is a bit off. There we go. So, first thing, what should you think of when you see the word SP2S1 structure? So, you should think of a cousin. So, you should think of a cousin of spin set and structure. So, well, you know, like a spin set and structure in eight manifold is given by the data of a four form, an adjustment special four form that will in turn give you a metric and an orientation. So, you should think of a spin, a speaker SQ1 structure as making something very similar. And the second sort of keyword got keeps getting off, I don't know why. This is preview. That should work. You're hired. Thanks, Bill. The second keyword is the title is. Sort of keyword in the title is harmonic. So we've heard all sorts of notions of harmonic. But in this talk, what a harmonic structure is, is something very similar, very sort of closely related to the notion of harmonic maps. So classically, what is a harmonic map? A harmonic map is a sort of map between two Riemann and manifold, and it is called harmonic if it is a critical point of some energy type functional. So in this talk, these harmonic SP2S1 structures are going to be likewise some critical points of some energy type. Some critical points of some energy-dime particle. So, this is what this talk is about. And there's a word flow in the title of this flow, and so it is the title of this talk. So, I'm going to be giving you a way of how to flow these structures to find harmonic ones. I'm going to be more precise later on. But the plan for this talk is first to give you some background on general what does it mean to be a harmonic H structure. And then I'll discuss the case when H is SP2, SP1 in more detail. To SP1 in more detail. I'll discuss some results about the flow, and at the end, I'm going to discuss some very sort of concrete examples. So, to make you kind of see that it's not just an abstract computation, like no, you can actually use it to compute stuff. Okay, so where does SP2SP1 come from? Well, it comes from Berger's classification of Holomic Row. So, you guys are probably all familiar with Burger's classification. So, you have KLA manifold, Clabiab, HyperKela, Quotenica, G20 Spin7. Quaternic Keller, G20 and 7, this is sort of our favorite ones. So the SP2 SP1 bit really comes from this Quaternic Keller case here, which occurs in every sort of damage and multiple of 4, where, well, we start from 8. Let's not look at the case n is equal to 1. And so what is the relation between sort of G2 and spin 7? Well, G2 and spin 7 manifolds are sort of Riemannian manifolds where your tangent space is modeled to look like the Octonians. So in the G2 case, it's a massive. Octonians. So in the G case, it's the imagery octonians, whereas in the Spinzerian case, the full Octonians. By contrast, Coton kilomanifuls are modeled on the Cotonians instead. Okay, this card is done. Cool. So what you need to know is that aside from the first case, with manifold scalar, all the manifolds arising in this list are in fact anchored manifold, so which is proportional to the metric. And all of them are rich, but aside from the cotton killer case, the cotton killer one is a bit odd. Case, the cotton kilo one is a bit odd in this list in the sense that there could be positive scalar curvature or negative one. And in the problem, sort of the classical problem in sort of special homomy is sort of to find manifolds with homomy contained in one of these lists. This is what the business about. And the problem is that it is generally very hard to find go for. Can you go for I think of this SP2, SP1 case as being like choosing reduction from like Using a reduction from like a reduction of structure where I choose a way to take O and write it as H2? Is there any way to going from O to H2? Spin 7 to SP2. Maybe I say something a bit later about that? I mean, the different sort of algebra, but maybe I'll say something a bit more. Okay, cool. Okay, so in all of this setup, you would like to find a currently constant tensor, usually a differential form. Tensor, usually a differential form. But the problem is that it's an over-determined system, it's very hard, and you even have sort of topological abstraction. For instance, if you don't have some function co-modules class, you know that you might cannot admit a torsion-free guide. So this eventually sort of leads you to look for weaker notions. For instance, in the GT case, you look for close, co-close, you might sort of constrain the intrinsic torsion in various ways. And in this talk, it is one of these sort of weaker notions. And the notion I'm going to be interested in is that of harmonic H structures. Sometimes these are also called isometric. Of also called isometric guys. So, what is it? What is the harmonic structure? So, here's a setup. Go for it. The harmonic structures are the best among a certain isometric class. They're not isometric. So, claim binary case that you know. They have a way to choose someone within an isometric class. But I don't want to say harmonic and isometric. Yeah, he's objecting to your last sentence on the previous. Yeah, he's objecting to your last sentence on the previous line that you're saying there are also coloursymmetric structures. Well, I mean, you say isometric, you say harmonic, so you guys sort of. No, no, both of you guys had papers with one with title isometric flows, one with harmonic flows, so it's not up to me. I just want to say that if you look for papers and you see harmonic structures or isometric structures, they're both the same. No, they're not. No, harmonic is a special case of isometric. It's just the best one. Oh, okay. If you go back one slide, just real quick. The very last thing you said, the AKA, should probably not be there. Or if it is, it should say the best among isometric structures. Okay, okay, fair enough. Okay. Okay, it's fair enough. It's fair enough. Fair enough. Okay. Yeah, no, no. It's not isometric structure. Yeah, I get your point. Yeah. So, so. Asymmetric structures, probably. Okay. Yeah. It's fine. Anyway, so what's. What's our setup? So the setup is as follows. Suppose I give you a reminder minefall, ng. The metric is going to be fixed. And let's suppose that your mindfall admit an H structure, which is compatible with the metric. So that means, so concretely speaking, suppose you had a metric on a sort of seven manifold and you had a G2 structures that induce that metric. You could find sort of this is the sort of statement I'm saying. Now, let's suppose you had one of these. Suppose you had one of these guys, you had one sort of tensor psi which is compatible with your metric, there's a sort of gauge group acting on that guy, which gives you different tensor psi, which again induces the same metric. So a very sort of simple and concrete example to keep in mind is, suppose I give you a manifold with an almost Hermitian structure. So you have a UN structure, you have a metric, you have an almost complex structure. And let's suppose that this guy has matching first-churn clause. Okay, and you say, well, can I find an N0 form that is compatible with this? form that is compatible with this with this data. Well you can pick one but the problem is that you can pick other ones. You can multiply by e to the if for any function f, you're going to get a different n-zero form which is also compatible with your with your metric. So you have different sort of S-UN structures which is compatible with the same sort of UN structure. Now the problem is well how do you pick the best the best the best guide? So a natural answer to that question is Answer to that question is: well, let's try to minimize this functional here. So you take the covariant derivative of your tensor, take its L2 norms, the energy functional, and you say, well, let's try to minimize this guy, and the guy that minimizes the size that minimizes this energy functional should be the best representative. This is the goal. Yes, everything's sort of compatible. That's right. And one sort of remark here is: if instead of psi of is if instead of psi of being a tensor, it was a map between Riemanni and manifold, this will be precisely the energy functional that you use to define harmony maps. So by analogy to this, you call a critical point of this functional here a harmonic H structure. So this is what harmony, this is where the name harmony comes from. It comes from the algebra of the theory of harmonic maps. And indeed, a lot of the theorems I'm going to tell you come from sort of analogues of harmonic maps being translated to these harmonic H structures. But I should be wary using But I should be wary that harmonic doesn't mean that the tensor here is harmonic. It's a sort of very different sort of notion of harmonicity. What does harmonic tensor mean? The Russell class here, too. No, I guess if it was a differential form, then you have an obvious notion, but that's what I want. Because I mean, in all the cases, you have a differential form. So I want to emphasize that it does not mean that the differential form is harmonic. It's a very different notion. You are fixing the SON structure. I'm fixing the SON structure. Yeah, that's right. Another thing you could do is. Do is let the xi determine the SON structure. Sure, then B. Cool. Python bit do that, right? The G2K. I mean, they do exactly this with the vector. Yeah, but then the problem is that working out the critical point of this function would be natural would be much worse because the metric will also have to vary. But I mean, we're going to hear probably talks about that later on. So tomorrow, there you go. Okay, so. Okay, so the natural question is: sort of, what is the critical point of this functional here? Well, aside from the trivial one, of course, there's always currently constant guys. So, to tell you what these are, let me remind you of the notion of an intrinsic torsion. Whenever you have an H structure, where H is a subgroup of SON, and you take the covariant derivative of your tensor psi, which is customized as precise as this H, then its covariant derived one form that values in. A one form that values in H perp, where H perp here is the complement of the holnomy algebra are viewed as a sort of sub-algebra inside SOI. And this guy here, this two-form valued one-form, is known as the intrinsic torsion. So this is always the case. And what Eric Luber and Enrique Sai proved was that this tensor psi from before defines a harmonic A structure precisely when this intrinsic torsion. Precisely when this intrinsic torsion t here is divergence tree. So the d of t here is zero. And so this is the number of pds depends on the dimensions of each perp here. So the weaker notions are coherently constant. Now, the problem with this definition here is that it's an implicitly defined guard because intrinsic notions are one form the values in the space of two forms and I haven't told you how to compute that. So how does one compute t in practice if you want to work out something? If you want to work out something, well, the way you do it is you think of the intrinsic torsion as a one-form that values in the space of endomorphism. I mean, it is a one-form that values in the space of H perp, which is a two-fold. So this is a cusy metric endomorphism. And you can act by this diamond operator here, which is just the standard slot TLN action. And this is precisely what nabula psi here is. And to get the intrinsic function, you just have to invert this operator here. And then you get T, and then from this, you can compute what D of T here is. This is how the rest. What d of D here is. This is how the recipe goes. But the problem is that this inversion operator does depend on the H structure. So, in principle, there's not like a general way of just defining this diamond inverse sort of operator. So, you have to work it out for different H structure. Okay, so far so good. So, let me sort of give you sort of a more sort of concrete definition. I mean, like, when, for instance, I say I give you a closer due to structure of co-close one, you know, precisely what that means in terms of intrinsic torsion. But if I say deep. Terms of intrinsic torsion. But if I say div t0, I mean, what in God's name does that mean concretely? So let me sort of motivate that. Sorry, okay. So let me sort of motivate what this means in a very sort of elementary case, the simplest case. Consider harmonic SU2 structures. Very simple. This is simplest non-trivial special harmony. So in this case, what is an SU2 structure? It's a triple of almost complex structures that behave like imaginary quaternions. Attorneys, or advice you have this triple of two forms. And if you work out what the covariant derivative of this guy is, well, it has to be one form that values in h verb. And in this case, the h perf is just omega 2 and omega 3 for omega 1. And then you get cyclic permutation of these indices. And if you do the recipe that I told you before, you find out that the intrinsic torsion, well, it's a one-form the balance of. Well, it's a one-form the balance, the orphanal complement of the Liadra, but the orphanal complement of the Liadra is, well, it happens to be another Liadra, which is the SO3 Liadra, which is a speech of cell draw two-form, which is precisely omega-1 of 3103. So what does D mean? Well, D means that each of these one forms are co-close. So you can just work that out. But if you just stare at what I've written down for you, you're going to realize that what is T? Well, T is just the induced Levischler connection and the space of self- Levi shifter connection and the space of self-dual two form because this is precisely what how you define that guy. So the condition that d here is zero is simply the statement that the induced left-shift reconnection on the space of self-joint two form is in fact incoulom gauge with respect to the trivialization given by omega-13. So it is saying let's pick the best trivialization of that space so that your connection is in full engage. So that's a statement. It's not a statement. This is what Sergei has been telling us to do. Exactly. Exactly. So he was talking about this higher dimensional analyzation question. So here's a non-trivial example of a harmonic SV2 structure, which is not torsion-free. So you could pick, you could figure out the half-surface, it's S3 cross S1. You can pick the standard sort of left-invariant structure on this guard, which has the hyper-complex one. And you can check that indeed it will satisfy this condition that df d here is zero. But it is obviously. Here is zero, but it is obviously it's not hypercaler, right? Also, hypercalero compact guys are flat torus or K-free, you know, the tannier. So go for it. If you take D of omega i, is it just a i, wedge omega i? Is that these the leaf forms of this of these selecting forms? If you take d of this guy, d of one of the omegas, like d of omega one, is it just a one wedge omega one? No, it's gonna be it's gonna be in this case. Change the tensor products by the wedge. Yeah, in this case, yeah, you just replace the tensor by a wedge. That's how you get it. It's not the same thing. Okay. Yeah. Another question. Go for it. So in terms of where hella classification and this dimension, this is what I want corresponds to the stars? This guy here? No, no, this is an example. Yeah, it's a second order. It's a second order condition, not a third order. It's not a special condition. It's not a special torsion. I'm not restricting the torsion to like in a special sort of. Like in a special sort of space. It's not like that. It's a very sort of trap. I'm just sort of minimizing the energy of the intrinsic torsion. Yeah. So it's not necessarily killing part of the intrinsic torsion in principle. Yeah. What is this harmonic basic structure on the intricate one? On this guy? Yeah. It's just a hyper complex one, the standard left invariant guy. Okay, cool. Okay, cool. And of course, Sergei has been telling us about the sort of that the same thing should be true in the G2 case. You can think of the intrinsic torsion. Well, it's a one form that values, well, not in the Lie algebra, but in this sort of loop, whatever that is. But the moral of the story somehow is that whenever you should pick up harmonic structure, you should pick up something as being in column gauge. It's sometimes in the best representative. That's sort of the moral of the story, concretely, what you should pick up. You should think about. Okay, so we are interested today in SP2SP1 structure. So let me define that because I mean people here are probably familiar with V2 Spincer, but not this guy. So a convenient way to do that is to start with an SP2 structure. So an SP2 structure is just like an SP1 structure, but in four dimensions higher up. So you have a metric and you have your, again, a triple or almost complex structure, J1, J2, J3, which satisfies an imaginary quaternion multiplication rule. Multiplication rule. And okay, it's an eight manifold now. And one very convenient way of defining the spin seven structure group is to define a four form, which is defined by the sum of the square of two of this guy, but you take minus of one of the other guy. And the stablaza of this four form is precisely spin seven. Okay, so it's a very convenient way of seeing how to kill the manifolds as special cases of spin seven. And to get to the sp2 case, sp2s one case, SPTS1 case, what you do is instead of putting a minus here, you put a plus here. You just take the average. Oh, there should be a rocket. The average of this guy here. So in this way, you could see, like, I mean, advertly speaking, they might look very similar, but this guy here gives you octonions, this guy here will give you sort of quaternions. So maybe that answers your sort of question of philosophy. You can explain something that always confuses me. Omega, so the J's only exist locally. Yes. Omega exists everywhere. Yeah, that's right. So why are they? Big omega. Big omega exists everywhere. Little omegas do not. Yep, that's right. Why is that? Yeah, why is that? Oh, why is that? Why does it not exist closely? Why is this thing exist globally? Because if you change frames, it's independent of. Yeah, it's kind of saying you have a bundle. The trivialization of the bundles, the bundle is not trivial, basically. So this guy's precisely saying that. So, this guy's precisely saying that on charlotte stuff. But there is actually a concrete way of defining this J1, J2, J3 using, oh my gosh. So somehow the moral is that you could use these guys wrong. And this doesn't change this guy, that's why. So it's free. Yeah, but I don't have a better reasons for that. Okay. So some basic facts. Because of sort of some basic fact about SP2S1 structure. So if a manifold admits an SP2S1 structure, then it also always admits a SpinStrian structure. Not necessarily related to that guy, but topologically satisfies the same condition. It satisfies the condition to admit a spin-sign structure. But the converse is not in general true. So, you know, like being S having an SP2SPN structure is something more restrictive. And also, another contrast with the spin seven case is that in the spin seven case, asking that your foreform is covariantly constant is equivalent to asking that it's closed. Is equivalent to asking that it's closed. But this is not true in the particular case. Asking that this guy here is correctly constant means that your form has to be closed, and also that the algebraic ideal, this ideal differential, like determined by omega 1, omega 2, omega 3, has to be a differential ideal. So if you take d of omega 1, it has to be combinations of omega 2, omega 1, omega 2, omega 3 again. Okay? So it's a different condition. And it's a non-trivial condition. There are examples where this indeed doesn't hold. You have closed guys. Indeed, it doesn't hold. You have closed guys, but the add-back ideal, not the differential ideal. It's a theorem by Swan, isn't it? That's right, yeah. That's Swan's PSG thesis. But just to be clear, SP2, SP1, and Spin SET, neither of those are subgroups of each other. No. Yeah. So I'm confused by this fact then because how do you see from because that should be obvious? Are you saying that if there's an SP2SP1 structure topologically you've satisfied the criteria needed to admit a The criteria needed to admit spin-up. So you would automatically say, well, you have locally these omegas and you just change the sign, because then it would be kind of a message. No, no, no, no, no, it's not, no, it's not, it's not obvious at all. Yeah, yeah, sorry. Yeah, this is not a natural sort of candidate to be, yeah, sorry. And since we've been hearing a bit about spinners, so I should tell you, for instance, in the quadranticular case, the cell draws part of this sort of spinner bundle, the pulsive spinner bundle. Positive spinner bundle splits as a three-dimensional component and a five-dimensional component, whereas the negative bit can just be identified with the tangent bundle on the manifold, which is sort of again different from the spin-set case. Okay, so just to sort of highlight that they're very different, but even though we're going to see that the harmonic theory is just going to be very, very similar. Any questions, comments? R five and R three are I'm going to see what this is in a minute, maybe more precisely. It's a lot of decomposition, so it's a it's not a it's not an irreducible bundle. It's not an irreducible bundle. The bundle splits. That's what I want to say. Okay, so let's do some simple representation theory. So in the spin 7 case, you know that spin 7 is a subgroup of SO8. So the Lyard raw splits, so you have splits as a spin 7 bit and it's fourth group complement. And the spin 7 four forms sits inside the space of four forms. And you see that H bug here, again. See that H perp here again sits inside lambda 4 as well. And again, the same thing is true in the SP2SP1 case. Again, this guy here is a subgroup of SO8. So again, you see the holomory alpha sitting in here, and the off-known component is over there. And again, you see this guy embeds inside the space of lambda 4, where the tensor capital omega here lives. This minus here is, earlier I said, you know, just a Earlier, I said, you know, just a sort of comment: this lambda four five minus the sort of subscript is the dimension of the space. The minus here is just to say it's ant sub-draw guy, and this is precisely in the spinner representation. This is exactly this five-dimensional block here. And the R3 here can just be identified with this star. Okay, so there's natural slope isomorphism. You can compute surface. So you can identify spin as a point because you can identify spin. Identify spinners, the point because you can identify spinners using sort of differential forms. Pretty key. Okay, so the key point of this is that H perp is always irreducible. This is what you need to make the theory work. And secondly, this also holds true in the GPN and UN case. And HBERP can always be embedded in the space wherever a tensor is. This is the sort of key criterion you need to make the theory work. Okay? Sorry, what HRP now is. Yeah, HRP is always. Lambda 215 here. Yes, lambda 215 here. Sorry. Just maybe say if it's not irreducible, one has to work harder. Yes. If H perf is not irreducible, yeah, it's not the other one. If you think of something like an sp2 structure, then H perf will split. Because you have omega one, ogg, omega three, and then you're gonna have more components as well splitting. So then you have to be more careful with the representations. But in this case, it's gonna be fine. But in this case, it's going to be fine. Okay, so here's a recipe for cooking up the intrinsic torsion in our case. So, well, I told you earlier how to get the intrinsic torsion. You have to inverse the style operator, and this is where the inverse is in this case. In this case, you take the covariant derivative of your four-form, so you get a one-form that values against the space of sort of four-form, and then you convert three of the entries into vector fill, and then you shove that back inside the four-form. So, this gives you one form. Inside the four-fold. So this gives you one point, the values in each birth, which is this 15-dimensional space. And surprisingly enough, the same formula works for the spin 7 case. So you know, the exact same formula works, but should be aware that this is also very different equation. One is like 7 PBs, and this is also 1 seconds. Can you explain again the notation of what these things need to be contracted? Yeah, so you take NAB, you take NABDA omega, you get the one-form, the value of the space of four-form. You get a one-form that values in space of four forms, and take three of these forms, you convert them to vector forms, and then you shove that back in there. So you get a one-form, the values in sort of two forms now. This is one form, the value space of two forms. And well, I mean, it's not obvious that it has to appear, but it does, because it's entry in the book. Cool. Okay, so what's good now is now we have an expression for t, so you can. Is now we have an expression for t, so you can compute what dv t is. But the problem is that, well, how in Gaussian do you actually find a foreform whose div t is actually zero? Well, the proposal is to mimic what happens in the case of harmonic flow of maps, and you introduce this heat-type equation to find a harmonic guide. So you decide to evolve your full form via the div t itself. And the critical point is precisely. And the critical point is precisely going to be the harmonic guys. Okay, so I've written down a flow. So far, so good. Cool. Well, not really, because, well, I've just written down a flow. I don't know if it has a solution. So first thing I have to justify this. And this was justified by work of Eric and Enrique. So they prove that the harmonic flow of any structures in general, where H is some stable subgroup of SON, does have short-term existence and it is unique. Short-time existence and it is unique. And moreover, they show that if the flow cannot be has a maximal sort of time of existence and it cannot be extended beyond that, then it must be the case that the intrinsic torsion is blowing up at some point over the manifold here. This is the intrinsic torsion has to blow. And the problem of interest at this point is, I mean, we know that the flow exists now, and we want to understand what happens as time goes to the maximal time of existence. So we have this finite time singularity. So, we have this finite time singularity. So, how do we try to understand what is going on with the flow? So, to do that, we do a parabolic rescaling, which means what you rescale the distance on your manifold by a factor C. So, in a four-form it scales by C4, and then you change time by a factor of C square here, and then you get a new solution to flow. So, regardless here is not flowing. So, the point being that if you start with one flow, you get a new flow, but now this guy here is defined over a different interval. But now this guy here is defined over a different interval of time. What you can do, you can translate S, so you can shove this guy here with a minus, and then you can have a flow well defined up till time zero. And if you take C in this expression to be this guy here, the intrinsic torsion, the super of this guy, then you know that this guy is blowing up. So if you take the limit of this guy, then you should get a flow that is well defined from minus infinity to p squared to zero. You should get an anti-en solution. Solution. Okay, and you would expect that this guy or solid. So these are still solutions which evolve by symmetries. I'm going to give a more precise definition later on. But the first problem here, only in the type 1 case, we'd expect them to be solitons. Yeah, expect it to be. I don't think it's always true. More philosophically. Yeah, it is for Richie flowing. Yes, for Richie, for a lot of good flows, it is, but I think you have to prove it each time. Yeah, there's. Sure. Sure. Yeah, that's why I say expected. Expected by comparison with Ozopless, yeah. Yeah, but it's not a theorem, it's not like not obvious reason, yeah. Why is can in red and inverted commas? Well, because I haven't justified that we can take a limit. So we can't. Yeah, well, I mean, a priori we don't know that, right? So we need to sort of justify that. Okay, so first I need to. Okay, so first I need to justify why we can take a limit, and then I'll have to tell you what solutions are. So let's do that. So, first thing first, you do have a compactness theorem. To take a limit, you need the manifold, the sequence of solutions here to be in a compact space, meaning that if you have a sequence of solutions, which is well-defined over some interval of time, and you need some extra condition. So, first you need bounds on the curvature and the intrinsic portion, and you need a lower bound on the interactivity radius. Then, if you have this condition, then you can. Have this condition, then you can actually take a limit of your galai. Let me sort of say why you need what. So, the reason why you need a curvature bound is because you don't want in the limit your manifold to develop a singularity. So, you could get point like concentr like curvature could concentrate that point, and then you can, in the limit, you might get something which is not a manifold. And you need uh I thought the metric was fixed. Why why why do you are you varying the metric as well? I thought the metric was fixed. As well, that's all the metric description. I think the bounds and coverture it gets for free. Yeah, the boundary cover is for free. Yeah, and the activity radius. Yes, and you need to lower bounds. Oh, yeah, I guess I guess we'll say true. Sorry, can you say the answer to that question again? The answer to what question? Why didn't you take the metric to be fixed? Why do you worry about curvature? He's okay with curvature. Yeah, but we're well. Yeah, I probably should not. Yeah, but we're well yeah, I I probably should not have said that. Probably the the people under engineering dictionary. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, maybe it's a the maybe the way you state the statement like this is so that we can apply the more sort of general theorem. Because the reason the way you prove this theorem is really to just rely on Chigogramov compactness theorem for manifolds. So this works in this setup where the metric is allowed to vary. I guess in this case, I don't have to do that because the metric is always fixed. But in principle, if the metric was allowed, Things, but in principle, if symmetric was allowed to vary, then you would need these conditions to make it work. Okay, uh, and secondly, so I mean, so from Georg compactness, you only get a Riemannian manifold in the sort of limit, but you can't justify explicitly that it had to be a cotton killer. It had to have a cotton-killer structure. But the point is that there is an expression that gives you the metric out of the differential form. And almost the same expression works in the spin 7 case as well. So, Spiro found this sort of expression here for. So, Spiro found this sort of expression here for the Spin Servant case. But if you stare at what he does, it always works for any sort of non-degenerate foreform. And then you just kind of realize that. I wouldn't say I found it. I asked Robert how to do it, and he told me something which I didn't understand. And then, guided by his guidance and my confusion, I stumbled onto it. But he certainly has it in his file encounter. Fair enough. Okay, but no. Rough. Okay, but no, surprising enough, it's not surprising here, I guess. The same, it's almost the same formula works once you adjust things the right way. So now we can take limits, so we're happy with that. And next thing is what solitons. So what is a soliton for this flow? So a harmonic soliton is given by the flowing data. You have your four-fold, you have X, the vector field, C is some constant, and you want this vector field to be homogeneous. You want this vector field to reskip to be homophatic vector field. And you need the divergence to satisfy this condition here. So, div D, we know what D is. Contracting a vector field with intrinsic torsion makes sense. This guy here is the D of the dual one form to the vector field, which is the two form, and then you just put that into the H bar. And then the same sort of expression works in other cases, like in the G2 case or in the spin 7 case. And if the constant is negative or zero or positive, then you're Negative or zero or positive, then you call them shrinking, steady, or expanding solitons. Which is kind of confusing because the metric doesn't change, but it's just because of analogy with R2 flow. Yeah, so just because of the sign of the constant, you just call it soliton, although it's not necessary. It's never sort of changing. So the accuracy is always zero. No, it's not. No, no, because you're because the vector field, the diffeomorphism part coming from X is going to is going to be zero. From X is going to scale the metric, but you also have the scaling, which cancel each other out. So, the defined solution of this form where this row here depends on the C. Okay. So, the flow will cook up some scaling. You can cook up some scaling from the C, and you can find some diffeomorphism trying to write in this vector field here. And then so you get a symmetric solution. It's just called a solid. Okay, so one sort of simple observation, just from this definition or proposition, if you want, is that expanders and shrinkers necessarily have to be on a hidden space. Because if C here is non-zero, then the existence of such a vector field essentially just has to be the order vector field of some transition stuff. So it has to be an original. Translation stuff, so it has to be on our rate if you want to cut. C heading stuff. Well, I mean, we have C positive or negative, you're in Euclidean space, so C0 is the only interesting case. Yeah, but that doesn't mean that it's torsion tree. No, no, no, I wasn't saying that. I was just saying that you only want to take C equals zero, is what I was saying. I think what it says already says that if you're auto-completing, you can't sorry, if you haven't. Sorry, if you have a decliner or a shaker, the manifold must be quicker. Okay. You'll give you an example. I'm going to give you an example of a steady soliton later on, but I don't know about expanders and shrinkers. And when I say steady soliton, not trivial ones. So I don't want torsion-free guys. So I won't say that I can solve this guy on some examples, but not necessarily the torsion-free guys. Like not to see because there was the only interesting case, I think. Okay, so you think that you're never going to be able to cycle? Oh, okay. Well, thanks then, there. Okay. Okay, so a bit sort of more technical version now. So, in order to prove, I mean, you have a flow, in order, if you want to get epsilon regularity, so if you want to get regularity of the flow, Regularity. So, if you want to get regularity of the flow based on sort of controlling certain quantities, you want to get long-time existence of the flow. So, maybe you control certain quantities and you can justify that the flow will exist for a longer period of time. If you want to study singularity set of the flow, you need to control some maritime quantity along the flow. And the obvious guide to use is, well, you might just say, well, let's pick the energy, because the energy obviously is decreasing. But however, you will need to do parabolic rescaling to get something meaningful out of it. To get something meaningful out of it. And you can't use the energy because it is not invariant. So, in order to tackle this problem, you have to introduce a new functional and system sort of localized energy-type functional where what you do is, instead of looking at the energy, you shove it over here a solution to the backward heat equation, and then you scale this integral here by some by this by this time factor here. Okay, and if you do that, then you If you do that, then you can, well, you can think of these as somehow telling you how much the energy is controlling as t goes to zero around that point, p and t node. And if you do that, you hit it with a sort of standard theory, you can get this polling almost monotyped formula. But it's almost monotone because while it's not quite going down, it's going down up to a factor and up to this star here. So it's not quite as good as you want it to be. However, if you are on flat space, On flat space, then you know precisely what the backward heat equation is, what the solution heat kernel is, and to this guy here. And in this case, you actually get it to be monitored. You can actually kill off this whole guy here, and you can just set this guy here to be one. Now, while this formula here works and does give you certain regularity and long-term existence, you have to control some very strong quantity in order to get that. So, that's the problem. And the same thing is true in the heat, how many heat flows. Heat harmonic heat flow for mass. But the idea originally due to Chinese true base is to use the fact that you know explicitly what the Euclidean backwards heat kernel is, and you can use that and modify this functional in a right way to actually get an improved estimate. And this is somehow what is sort of different in what was previously known in the G2Spin 7 case. So let me sort of emphasize how this is done. I mean, this was originally done by He and Li in. Done by he and Li in the case of UN structures, but if you scare the proof for long enough, you're going to realize that the proof can be extended very easily if you just interpret things the right way. So how do you do that? I mean, first of all, how do you prove this formula? Well, the way you prove the formula is, well, you just take ddt of this guy here. Once you take ddt, well, once you hit this guy here with ddt, you can just replace it with La Vashan. Once you hit this guy here with ddt, well, you know precisely how this guy here is evolving. So you can hit everything here, then you integrate by code, because with La Vashan, and then you extract all. And then you extract off the term that you need, and so you get the bar. And then you use a Yempi-type equation kind of diffimorphism variance. I'm going to come back to that later on. That's a curious idea again. Sure. But somehow here, the point is that the best you can do if you do that is you can just get this constant C here. And the problem really is that you don't know at all what U is going to be on an objective manifold. It's an absence and sort of an existence theorem, but you don't know what Q is. Don't know what u is, but whereas you know what it is in the flat case. So, what you do is you modify your functional, your localized energy type functional by introducing it, by introducing in the standard heat kernel of flat space. And then you multiply by some test function, which is sort of locally supported in a little ball, and you can just scale your metric in such a way that your injectivity radius is one everywhere. You can just work on this sort of little touch. On this sort of little touch, and sort of you identify the point we have with the origin. And what you do is you're going to do the same thing, you just hit it by ddt, and then you see how this guy has evolving, and you get sort of some differential inequality, and then you integrate that to get your quantity. And this turns out to give you a better monotonic formula in the sense that before you had this fixed constant here, now you have a better estimate of what's going on. I'm not going to write down what the function f here is, but no, it's some sort of function that. Of functions that it's a bit like log type functional, but it gives you the bad estimate that you need. But somehow, what is somehow the key point here in this proof? Well, the key point here in this proof is that when you work on this little ball, the metric in sort of geodesic normal coordinate is approximately the flat one up to some curvature term. And this curvature term is fixed because the metric is never changing. So th so the point being that the intrinsic torsion is varying, but the curvature is not. Is varying, but the curvature is not. So you can sort of trade off in that way. And then you can just replace partial cograin derivative with partial derivative, and then you just do the integration by balance in the obvious way. And this leads you to this improved estimate here. And one sort of key ingredient that makes this proof work is the so-called Yankee-type identity. Which I'm not that I'm going to go into. Okay. So so far so good. So so far so good? This is a better more quantity formula because of the exponential term of giving. Yeah, exactly. It's just enough to give you like if you control the energy, you'll be able to get long-time existence instead of this entropy time. Yeah, go for it. Can I just ask quickly, how about your regularity of this T norm squared? Why do you need these kernels? Is it to regularize it or like what do you. Regularize it, or like what? What do you how should I think of this kernel? What is it doing? What is a signal? It's concentrating at the point T. What do you mean? Sorry, it's red, it's smooth, but it's not too bright. It's just to concentrate with it. Yeah, okay. It's just, yeah. It's converting to the delta. Okay. So the key point in this proof is like, you know, like, well, like, the key thing that would change depending on your age structure is precisely the anti-type identity. I'm going to. I'm gonna go to back this slide. So, yeah, so this the reason it's almost is because of Hamilton's estimate on this heat kernel. When you try to take the d by dt of u, there is a term and that's why you have to use this c1 and c2. But that term vanishes if you take it, the Euclidean heat curve. I don't understand why you are still getting some exponential term if you. Well, I get this on the next slide. Yeah. Well, I get this guy here. No, that that will be there, but because this G is the Euclidean heat current, right? Yeah, but the metric is not Euclidean. Yeah, it's currently. The metric is approximately Euclid. So in that term, I would say that's right. Exactly. Cool. Okay. Any possible? Okay, cool. Okay, so what is this Bianca-type identity? Well, when you're doing this int integration by both, at some point you have to take the inner product of the covariant derivative of t with t itself, and then you're going to have to sort of integrate by both. And in doing so, you're going to have to see how the covariant derivative commutes. So when you swap X and Y around, how the intrinsic torsion will vary under this guy here. Well, so there was a way I wanted to read. Yeah. Well, so the way I wanted to raise this term here is to say that when you take current derivative of T and you sort of skew symmetries this guy, you get some quadratic term involving the engine's torsion and you get some curvature term. Point is that curvature term is not changing at all. Whereas this gathering could potentially be changing. Moreover, in this case, if you project in the h-per direction, this gathering goes away. But in the proof, you're going to see that at some point you have to kick in a product with key, which belongs precisely in the space. So you can kill off this gathering. In the space, so you can kill off this guy straight away. And this same proof works precisely. How do you sort of prove this guy? Well, you use the fact that you know precisely what the intrinsic torsion is given by. So you take nabla of this guy, you get nabla square here, which is some curvature terms, the curvature operate acting, and then you get some quadratic terms involving the intrinsic torsion here. If you screw symmetrize, you get precisely the result. And for the last bit, to prove that, what you have to do is just realize that. That, what you have to do is just realize that here is some quadratic pairing on the intrinsic portion, so it's belonging to H perp and H perf. But if you look at the representation pair of this guy, you see if there's any H perf component, there's no guys. This is how you extract this term here. And the same proof here works in the spin 7 case as well. But the advantage of doing it this way is that you don't have to chase indices whatsoever. In the G2 case, it's a bit more tricky because if you take 47 and the 47, you can. Because if you take R7 times R7, you're going to get another R7 component. But in this case, you're just going to have to be a bit careful, and you're actually going to have to understand this operator here in the corresponding case. But it's point-wise. I mean, it's an ad-write computation. You can just do that on R7. Once it's fine, you're good to go. Yep, that's a point. Yep, I just saved that. And I just saved that as well. Any school beyond it? And it's called blanket type analytic because spiracle it's because arises by different moves in variant of the interesting torsion. But I think you can actually show that it is a BIT identity for some other connection with torsion, animal connection. I see. So I accidentally gave it the right name. Oh, okay. So when you split the connection into the H-bit, that's the precise connection. I see. Thanks. Thanks. And an immediate consequence of this is that if t here is zero, you see that, well, if t is zero, well, everything vanishes, and you have that the projection of the curvature in the 215-bit is zero. This implies the statement that the holomogises. Yeah, go for it. So could you say why did you just refer to the market? Because in the g case, if this guy would be all seven, if you take all seven tensor all seven, you're going to get another all seven components. You're going to get another R7 component sitting in there. So it's not obviously clear that once you project, you're not going to get any other contribution from this quadratic term here. So you have to work a bit harder to see that the operation indeed is going to kill up that term. That's what. So just another quick question. So that's quadratic term, can you rewrite it in terms of T? This guy here? Well, that is T. Well, yeah, this is more only T, this is more only T, but I mean, having an index, because T was. Because, like, T was this time, right? It was NABLA. Oh my god. So, T contracted with T in a very strange way. Yeah. To be clear, tomorrow I'll show you the general the architect. So, yes. So it's just sort of like Sneeter doesn't have index. It's my yeah, so this is just a measure of the failure of the reduction of the harmony group, and this is this also works for the other cases as well. Other cases as well. And this you need precisely this argument here inside the integration bypass that you do in the previous statement, in the previous era. So I'm not going to discuss the epsilon regularity, no long-time existence, because Enrique is going to talk about that tomorrow. But this relies crucially on the fact that you can get this improved estimate on this new function here. But in essence, the point would be that if you have small That you know, if you have small enough energy, you can get long-term existence and it's going to be smooth and it's going to converge to 50. You're going to get a precise statement about that to wrong. Okay, but let's move on to something a bit more concrete. Note that if you're on a homogeneous space and you are working with something which is completely invariant, you don't need all these guys because the point being that the energy is going to go down. If the energy is going down, you know. You know precisely that you know that globally the integral is going down, but because if it's invariant, then that means that every single point it has to go down as well. Because at one point, it's going to determine the intrinsic torsion everywhere, basically. So, in this case, on a homogeneous space, you always have long-term existence in the sphere. Okay, and we're going to see an example of that later on. Just one comment is that in this case, if you do have a finite time singularity, then you can only show. Singularity, then you can only show using this method of this paper is that the singular set has half the dimension six, so you only get sort of two dimensions down, you can't get more than that, and that's because we don't have a better theory than the original theory due to Grayson and Hamilton. Because in principle, what you would expect is if you're working in some sort of special honorary case, you would expect that the single set would be some sort, somehow related to the special geometries that you're working with. So in your working in a GH case, you might expect. With so, in your work in a greet case, you might expect as shady as shady. In this case, you might expect it to be some sort of calibrated guy, which is maybe S4 or something like that, but we don't have that just from this theory. In this case, it's probably just this guy, or H. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, in Kotenkilla case, calibrated semanticals are much, much more restrictive than the sins of an case. Yeah, Yeah. Cool. So, give us a basic example of harmonic structure, which is not trivial. If you have a Riemannian manifold which is locally conformally parallel, then it is automatically harmonic. This was known in some cases, but this is quite okay. So, how does the proof work? Roughly speaking, if you know that it's conformally parallel, what does that mean? That means there exists some function where you multiply by this function. Where you multiply by this function, this guy here is going to be currently constant. F here some locally defined function. But then the projection map into H buff, this is conformally invariant operator. And the point is that once you do that, the new left shifter connection that you get from the torsion free guy is going to commute with this guy here. Because this guy here presents honomy, this is a special homic type. So it's going to commute with this guy, whereas the original connection would not. Using this sort of comparison, you can actually extract off. Comparison, you can actually extract off the diagonal div D. This is a bit tricky computation to do if you just did it with the original connection. That's why you need to conformally parallel here. A similar proof was done by Sergei in the G2 case. This proof also applies to the internet case. In fact, for any intensor you want, the same exact proof works. It doesn't depend on anything. So there are lots of examples. In a way, I'm sort of justifying why harmonic is good, because if you're confirming valid, you're harmonic. Okay, so let me now give you an explicit solution to the flow. So I'm going to start with the hyperbolic curve in plane. So this is topology is just R8. You can think of it as a solvable Lie group. And here is your structure equation. Okay, so this is a solvable Lie group. This space here is an Einstein manifold, has negative scalar curvature. This is in fact a non-compact dual. A long compact dual of HP2. So it has full holomy, this torsion free guy, holomy sp2 sp1. You can define an sp2 structure using this formula here, and you can define the quote-unquote full form precise by its expression here, antiscographic constant, because it has special harmony. So it is trivially harmonic. So what you can do in this very sort of elementary case is, well, the nilma, it's a sort of sort of Lie group, right? So what you can do is. So the Lie group, right? So, what you can do, you can just take two of the coframes and just rotate them around minus one factor. Okay? You sit down now, you start computing. This guy is not going to be total-free in general. So, you sit down, you start computing, and you get that df d is given by this expression here, which in constants, a and b or any functions. Any functions, yeah, as valuing as one. And here you see there's only one guy, which is comic in this case. Okay, so supposed to be so expected. To so expected. And you can work out what the flow equation here is explicitly. It turns out to be this flow D here. And you can sit down and you can solve it. And you see that indeed the flow converges to the guys that you knew because there was one torsion-free guy. So it indeed converges in infinite time. So you get convergence in infinite time. In fact, the solution is in fact eternal. So it's well defined for all backwards time as well. Well, this was naturally to be expected because there was a torsion free guide to begin with. And also, you should note. And also, you should note that the energy is always infinite in this case because the manifold is not compact. But the flow still does what it's meant to do. It still finds a torsion free guide. Although the volume is also not sort of the gradient flow in a way. Yeah, could you do it? Yeah, could you I don't know I guess not because it will disprove the conjecture of Watson that the compact no no sorry. Can you propose one moment today how do you say it free? No, because all I did I I rotated but I mean I rotate it, but I mean, yeah, you were preserving the metric noise. Exactly, that's precisely. I'm very restrictive in what I can do because I can't make very general ansats. Because my ansat always has to preserve the metric, which is why I get like this weird type of answers where I can only, I mean, you could pick more general guy, like maybe you rotate that between SO3, something like that. And I think it will still work, but it's just not your computation. I don't want to do it. Okay. Okay, nearly done. Okay, so let me give you a non-conformally parallel example now. Start with SQ3. This is Moracla Penform. Note that the fourth commodity group of that guy is zero, so it cannot have made a torsion tree guy. In fact, I should have said that any compact, all cotenic lar manifolds in dimension A are either the cotenic plane HP2. The quotinic plane HP2, G2 of SO4, or the graph management of two planes in C4. There's only three examples in the compact setup. So this clearly could not have been a contact. They're the only ones that can exist. Yeah. Positive case, yeah. Negative case is y. Okay, so you can define a metric using this guy. Define the obvious metric. This is not the biomediant one, the binary one is something else. The biodiversity one is something else, just sort of a comment. You can again make a similar answer as before, and you can, in fact, check that this guy here is hyper complex. The ashruated, almost complex structure is in fact interval. The same was true for the example I gave you earlier in the SU2 case. And you can check that this guy here, the fourth one that I define, indeed satisfies it is indeed a harmonic guy. And there was no chance of getting the covariance constant guy. No chance of getting the covariantly constant card, but still, there's harmonic in this case as well. Indeed, it's not close. You can play similar trick as before, and then you can run down the flow, and then you're going to see that people again converge to this card, just like in the other case when I rotated the card, rotated to framing. But the natural sort of question in this case is that, can you prove that this guy here is a global minimum? Like, you know, can you, like, no, is this like the best harmonic structure that you can get in this guy for this guy here? Plus back here. In general, I don't know if there's a second variation formula. If you could check whether this guy is stable or unstable under the flow, something like that, I don't know that as well. Just some open question, like maybe it's applicable to the different other cases as well. Here's a non-trivial example of a steady solution. Take the flat guys on all eight, make the following answer. Take two of these one forms, multiply them by some cost and some sign, match up the. By some cos and some sign. Metrics again are chained. Again, I have to do cos and sine because I can't fiddle around with the metric. Work out what the intrinsic portion is. Well, everything else will vanish except for this guy here. And then you can see that dF T here is precisely the portion contracted with this vector field here. This is precisely the soliton, the steady soliton. So in fact, the gradient soliton here. This is lambda of x1. And in fact, you can do the same computation in this case, and you can also get a In some cases, and you can also get a steady salt in this in some cases as well. So they are non-trivial solutions, and you can actually use them to do computation in general. Okay, I think that's all I wanted to say.
