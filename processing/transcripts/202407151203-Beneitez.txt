Hi, I'm Miguel Benetev and I'm a postdoc at DAMP at the University of Cambridge. So first of all, thank you very much to all the organizers for having this very nice location, very nice workshop. And then I would also like to talk about the people that I've been working with in the projects that I'm going to talk about. So it's Rich Carter and Gergi Busa. Rich Karch and Gergi Busa at Dan and then Jacob Page in Edinburgh, Yves Dubie in Vermont, and then Miles Couchman, who was a postdoc in Cambridge and now moved to Professor. Alright, so the title of my talk is about linear stabilities and the relationship to viscoelastic turbulence, elastic turbulence, and elastic inertial turbulence in a straight geometry. Because one thing that bores me is really fascinating, but it's too complicated. And I'm still approaching this matter, so I'm just working on. Just working on a straight geometry so far. So, the first thing is: well, we all know that adding a small amount of polymers changes significantly for our properties, right? So, if we use have a very high inertia and then you add a little bit of polymers there, then we have drag reduction in the term turbulence. There's this classical picture, I think, of the New York Police Department that shows that when they add polymers, the liquid jet actually reaches much farther. If we then go to the other end of the spectrum, now we Go to the other end of the spectrum. Now we don't have any inertia, but we have a lot of elasticity. Then it's what we were in the year 2000, it was found what was called elastic turbulence, and it was from this setup. They used two rotating plates, and then some chaotic motions were identified. And then in 2013, it was actually found that if you have enough inertia and enough plasticity, then you have something called last inertia turbulence. And this was a And this is significantly different from elastic turbulence or from inertial Newtonian turbulence, right? And there you can see that that's a liquid jet and if you don't have any polymers then it transitions to turbulence and then if you suddenly have polymers the transition is quite different and the state that you reach is also quite different. So so these are the three states that I'm going to be talking a little bit about, mostly focus on on the last generation of turbulence and plastic turbulence. And as turbulence. So, in order to deal with these products, I'm taking a continuum approach to the polymers. And we're going to consider planar shear flows normalized with half the channel height and the mean velocity. I'm just going to talk about flows between two infinite channels, so plane plus X flow or plane covered flow, typically Q D and we have the Gabriel Stokes equation where we have added one extra or We have added one extra. Well, we have the term that couples together the polymer stresses, and then we have an equation that governs the polymer pollution. And we are going to use the Philippine model. And just to bring a little bit of attention to the number of parameters, right, we have the Reynolds numbers, which tells us the role of inertia. Then we have the Weisemer number, which tells us the role of electroelasticity. We have beta, which is the ratio or the polymer concentration. Then we have a polymer diffusion term. A polymer diffusion there, which with a coefficient epsilon, and then we have an L max, which is the maximum sensibility of the polymers. So it's quite really a parameter-rich problem. Right, so I'm just going to talk a little bit about the way when we start to look at the problem, what the different areas are, right? So here is a very rough parametric space where we have the Weisenberg number and the Reynolds number. So high Weisener would be high elasticity, high Reynolds number. High elasticity, high Reynolds number, high inertia. And then what we know is that if we have very low elasticity and significantly high inertia, then we eventually would get into Newtonian turbulence, right? Then we start to increase our elasticity and that Newtonian turbulence gets modified. And this state is typically, well, it is 3D. Then what has been found is that elastic inertial turbulence, now if we keep increasing our elasticity but still keeping inertial effects, then we have elasto inertial turbulence. We have elastinesal turbulence. What I'm showing here is just the trace of the polymer conformation tensor flow from left to right, and this just indicates how our polymers are stretching the flow. This has been found to be characteristically 2D, and it's been observed in the straight and curved geometries. And then if we go to the other end of it, then we have the elastic turbulence, which has been found in 3D experimentally, and of course, well, 2D only numerical, because the wall is 3D. Numerical because the voltage 3D. And it's assumed that curvature is required for this. And the way we transition to turbulence there is an elastic instability characterized by voltage stresses. We have heard a little bit about this today. So in planar geometries, it was actually quite exciting when in 2018 a center mode instability was found. So this center mode instability was reported in a study led by GARP, published in PRL in 2018, and it was actually the first elastic instability. And it was actually the first elastic instability in straight channels. So it was found in pipe flow, in plain passeth flow. However, it didn't exist in plain coetaflow. And then the question that we had when we actually started to work on this topic is, well, this instability is very nice, and it exists kind of there in parameter space. But we want to see does it play any role with respect to elastic inertial turbulence and elastic turbulence? Can we draw any conclusions of the transition? Does it actually? Does it actually play any role there? And the first thing that we wanted to know is: well, is this perturbation supercritical? Or is this some way to supercritical? Is it supercritical? And then if we could connect it to the chaotic states. So the first thing that we did is, well, as I said, this is just a little bit of a recap. This was the first ethereal instability, and then it was found that it actually extends to Rendle zero for some limits. For some limits. So, what I'm showing here is this is the area where the region for a set of parameters where the flow is unstable to the center mode, and it looks like this. And then, if you actually do direct numerical simulations and evolve these perturbations in any initial condition, started here, you will eventually settle into this arrow-headed structure. And these arrow-headed structures were believed to be important because, well, they were the first exact query in the state that was found in. State that was found in a parameter system where a large tonial turbulence can exist. And they were also observed in DNS or retired numerical simulations of EIT, although transcendent. So this is a relatively long simulation done by If Dubi in 2022, and then he observed these kind of arrow-headed structures along with Captain Dynamics for quite a bit of it. So then we thought that it was, of course, worth exploring. Of course, worth exploring whether they played a role in transitioning into the scouted states. So, what we did first then is a branch continuation. So, then we take our perturbations of regions where we know it's linearly unstable, we do a linear analysis, and then we take that to build a branch continuation. And what we essentially do is that we start on a point here where the flow is highly unstable, right? So on the neutral curve, and then we can continue those solutions We can continue those solutions in parameter space. So, what I'm showing here is the brain of the supervisor. So, this is just different parameters. This the real is linearly unstable. And then, if you continue your solutions, then you can reach the regions where it's actually non-linearly unstable. So, the flow here is linearly unstable, but but we can still continue this branch of solutions. And what I'm showing in that other figure there is actually how the amplitude of those solutions changes. Changes as we come to this way, right? So the way we have found this non-linearly unstable region is that we take our network curve, we calculate the amplitude of the solutions, and then we just find the turning point, which corresponds to the symbols that you see there. And then what the arrowhead states look like there can be seen in the top corner. So this is essentially you showing how the arrowhead structures emanate from this center mode instability. Instability. So that was the first step of what we did. And then we put this red line here, right? So now we have a center mode instability that is linearly unstable under there. But we have shown that it's non-linearly, the flow is non-linearly unstable all the way up to here. And now we have these arrowheads of structures also in the regions where the elastic density turbulence exist and elastic turbulence exists. So then the next question was: can we actually connect these solutions? Can we actually connect these solutions to any of these states? And to do that, we did some direct numerical simulations using Derodos and spectral methods. And then what we found is that, well, actually, you can't. So if you start with slightly different initial conditions, what you actually will reach is very different end states. So this is a Reynolds 1000, so clearly within the elasto-inertial regime, what we expect. Regime, what we would expect, and if you start with an initial condition which has a very weak perturbation, then you will return to the laminar state. If you start with an initial condition which has quite a significant perturbation, but it's all in the shape of the arrowhead, then you will stay on this arrowhead. And then if you perturb your system very much on the coastal walls, then you will get into elastic inertial turbulence. And if you perturb your system with an arrowhead very much at the walls, you will get into that state which is a chaotic arrowhead. State which is a chaotic arrowhead state. So essentially, you have a multi-stability of your system where you can reach four different end states depending on where you start. So that was a bit disappointing. But this is essentially what the state looks like. So depending on how much volatility and certain projection, then you can end up in any of those four states. So in that sense, we found that and then we also calculated which are the states that lay in between well, the reasons of attractions of the others. The basis of attractions of the others. So, in that sense, what we found here was that the center mode was a benign structure that didn't have an instability at triggering transition, right? So, what we have found is that this structure was, well, it was first instability and it was quite nice, but then it didn't really trigger transition in 2D. So, that was a little bit disappointing when we were working on this at the time. The next thing that I want to bring your attention to is Your attention to his, we took a step back and then we noticed something that actually, well, we also did that at the beginning: is that when we take these equations and add this polymer diffusion term, it typically has quite a large value in DNS, and it's very often there because we need to stabilize our simulations. Even if we don't include it there explicitly, which happens, for example, if we use the matrix exponential to write an equation which still keeps positive definite, if we Keeps positive definite. If we use most dispretizations, you will have a term which has that shape because of the boundary conditions at the world. You don't have any boundary conditions if you don't have any diffusion, and then because you use one-sided differences, that typically brings in some numerical errors, which has this say. So, but these errors are typically very small, or these diffusion terms are typically very small, and they have been largely neglected. They have been largely neglected in stability studies because the values are much smaller than all the other terms, like 10 to the minus 6 or 10 to the minus 3. However, we introduced them into simulations, right? So there is clearly something there that we should probably also take them into consideration in stability analysis. And then what we did is that we introduced infinitesimal perturbations. So we split all our flow variables into a mean quantity, your capital phi, and then a perturbation quantity, phi prime, and then we just make. phi prime and then we just make a normal log dansage onto our phi prime just assuming that we fit into our two phi domain a number of wavelengths of wa numbers kx and then we'll have a phase speed which is the end by the c there for these perturbations and what we could find is that if one keeps these diffusion terms inside your equations you actually get an additional instability mode that is not there. Stability mode, but it's not there if you don't have it. So just and the thing that was very particular about this is that you get this for certain cases, it doesn't matter how much diffusion you have, but as long as your diffusion is not zero, it can be 10 to the minus 15, you can find a wave number for which your flow is linearly unstable. And this is this mode here. So, what happens then is once your eigenvalue, this is the minor part of the eigenvalue, it crosses. Part of taking value, it crosses the horizontal axis, then your flow becomes linearly unstable, and then you can have an instability growing there. This instability mode is a traveling wave, yeah, well, travels with the wall speed. And what I'm showing here is in the colours is the trace of the polymer conformation tensor, and the lines are the stream function. And you can see it's the blue line here is the square root of the polymer diffusion. And what you can see is that the trace of the polymer. That the trace of the confirmation pension is actually confining the wall within this bandary layer that is created because of the polymer tutions there. So we did a little bit more of a study, and this is an example of what this instability looks like. And I think that if you look at the papers in the literature, you can see things that resemble these numerics relatively often. And then there's a temptation to think that that's just numerical solution, but it's a linear instability that is there in your equations. And then we showed that. And then we showed that this instability actually can be found in all the areas, in all the region, which is delimited by the blue curve there. So then you have this limit instability that suddenly occurs in all of these, well, not for very low isomer numbers, but for a very large range of isomer and Reynolds number. And then the question that we had was, can this PBI instability, polymeric usage instability, trigger chaotic dynamics? And we did some very rough numerical And we did some very rough numerical simulations, or we did some numerical simulations, just adding noise into the system and simulating for long enough in place for ed flow. And what we saw is that we get a chaotic state. What I'm showing here is contours of the polymer conformation again, and this is just the time signal of the trace of the polymer conformation, which is a periodic and has all the characteristics of what would be a turbulent state. And then the question that we had is: okay, yeah, so we can trigger chaos with PBI. With PBI, but this is how this transition happened. Does it happen for all Reynolds numbers, all Weisenberg numbers? Well, and then, yeah, so that was the next question that we wanted to tackle. And then we looked at the secondary instability, because if you take this linear instability that I first discussed, and then you take it in a domain that is small enough, and then you evolve it non-linearly, then you will saturate it to a traveling wave. Once you have saturated to a traveling wave, then you can put that into a frame. Wave, then you can put that into a frame moving with the traveling wave, and then you can do a secondary instability analysis based on a floathead approach. So, what you do is that you essentially take these perturbations and then you just need maybe 12 Fourier moles in the stream-wise direction to completely soft the total waves because the length scales are quite small. And then you just make another extra answer where you add Where you add a shift, which would be the largest scale perturbations on top of this smaller scale perturbation. So now we are doing a linear static analysis on a base flow which looks like this. Okay, this I upload several replicas of what the non-linear state looks like, but I just want to highlight that all the algebraic studies do essentially on one wavelength. And then you see what larger scale perturbations do to this Due to this base flow now. So, as I said, and then these are the results that I present. This is the growth rates for the flow K modes. And once again, if this is above the vertical line, then you have secondary linear instability, otherwise it's secondary stable. And these are the fundamental length scales that we have for our primary instabilities corresponding to the Reynolds zero and Reynolds 1,000 cases, colour matching. Color matching. And then the other lines that I plotted is what the secondary instability length scale are. So it's actually quite interesting that such a small perturbation actually, they generate secondary instabilities which are on a length scale of order 1 or 10. So the secondary instabilities are much larger than this primary instability that we find. And also something that's interesting is that even though the length scale of the primary instability are relatively separated, the secondary instability and the length scale, they seem They seem to still be relatively independent to this. More studies would be, of course, needed to double-check, but this seems to indicate that the secondary instability is much more generic than what the primary instability is. That depends on the value of the diffusion and how small your length scales are. Then we looked at the instability modes. These are again Reynolds 1 thousand and Reynolds zero. And when I'm plotting in the top figure, the colours are the trace of the conformation tensor. The trace of the conformation tensor, and again the lines are the string function. And then in this figure, the colors are the vertical velocity. And what we can see is that in the Reynolds Applause, we have in the stream function symmetric with respect to the center line. And this is quite reminiscent of a viscolastic TS wave with a modified wall. If you actually will sum it very much, or if someone has very good eyesight, then you can see this kind of Kind of reminiscent of the PDI instability at the wall. So you have these small bands at the wall. And in this case, the diffusion was much larger. So, of course, the boundary layer where this instability is confined is much larger. So then you see them a lot more clearly. And at Rain L0, what we found is that this anti-symmetric with respect to the center line is a little bit reminiscent of that center mode that we had that I talked about at the beginning, because then now you have an anti-symmetric mode. An anti-symmetric mode there. And then, of course, you have the secondary style to most, and then you want to know where they lead to, right? I mean, we've got a lot of exciting bits, and then we just wanted to do the last bit of it. And then what we found is that they actually lead to a chaotic state. Again, color matching, and this is a Reynolds 1000. This is just the volume-integrated vertical energy over the whole domain. Same polar, so again, the trace of the polymer conformation tensor and the stream function. And what you can see is that, and this is the time. What you can see is that, and this is the time signal for the two different cases. And you can see that in both cases, you reach a chaotic state. Adrenals 1000, we reach the familial chaotic state, or was EIT. And at Reynolds 0, we find some chaotic dynamics. And well, because it's all 2D and all the experiments in E elastic turbulence are, of course, 3D. That's how the world is. There is a question mark there because it's a chaotic state. Mark there because it's a chaotic state at Raynon zero. And then you could say it's elastic turbulence, but you could also say that it's, I don't know, something else. So, some conclusions about my work then is that the first thing that we talked about is that we had the Sarofet solutions, were very supercritical. They exist in a large region of the parameter space, but they were really quite boring. They didn't contribute anything to the calculator dynamics. They were just there in the background. And then you could use half chaos or not chaos, independently of whether you have these structures. Of whether you have these structures, at least in 2D. And then we did a little bit more of a study, and then we saw that the chaotic dynamics are driven close to the wall, so the arrowhead did really not play any role. And because the mechanism that sustains chaotic dynamics was close to the wall, then this neolinarian instability that I talked about was actually quite a good candidate to try to trigger this Captic Dynamic because this happens close to the walls. We think that it can be found for experimentally relevant parameters. Can be found for experimentally irrelevant parameters, but we are not experimentalists, so some people might not think so. And then we also have seen that this instability, although the length scale of it is very small, the secondary instabilities that it triggers are much larger scale. So there is that to take into consideration, and it did lead to chaotic dynamics. And some final thoughts on some future work is that we really need to think about the cause that we're using, because if diffusion is not there explicitly, it might If diffusion is not there explicitly, it might be there because of spatial disparatization. And as I mentioned, it doesn't matter how small your diffusion is, you have this instability, even if the diffusion is extremely small. If it's physical, then we need to explore it experimentally and numerically. And experimentally, because of the smallest scale of the perturbation and lengthy scales compared to the polymer size is, it may be better if we're experimentally looking for the secondary stabilities, which are much larger scales, as I discussed. larger scale, as I discussed. If it's unphysical, then the Finnipi model is extremely used and then we have to understand what the role of this instability is in sustaining turbulence. Because if we are all using a model that has a feature in it that is definitely not good and then we are all saying like, oh look at my turbulence, that is terrible, then we have to do something about it. Some other work that we will be looking at is minimal flow units and minimal splastics associated processes, dynamic balances and equations, and then minimal Cs because all this was for super critical fancy. Because all this was for supercritical transition, but there are also regions of parameters space where the flow is actually supercritical. So, thank you very much for your attention, and that's just part of the transition. So, you know, if you go to small L squared, for example, does it still exist or does it disappear? Did it appear? Exist or does it disappear and did it fail? Right, so that's a good question. So, it does get produced with a smaller L. It exists in other models. We tried adding a little bit of upper convective derivative, and then the mode still exists, but then it gets dumped. So, it's something to think about. So, something that we really wanted to look into is that, well, once this mode is dumped, can you still sustain turbulence down? So, because then you dump the model, the mode, and then you make sure. Dumped model, the mode, and then you make sure, well, you just have a little bit of upper convective. I think it wasn't very much. And then you use, if you can still sustain all the dynamics that we talk about with a different model that doesn't, that always has this mode as stable, then you can be more comfortable about the response that you're talking about. So the second thing is: Yeah, yeah. So, are you with that 3D? Because there could be also 3D? I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, there could be 3D. Actually, we, I mean, I didn't talk about the original, but yeah, you can extend this into 3D. And yeah, I mean, we just haven't looked at it really, but it's fairly trivial. I mean, you just have a couple more equations. But the arrowheads actually that I showed here, they are, yeah, they are linearly unstable in 3B. So we did turn out. They are linearly unstable in 3D, so we did analysis for that. I'm wondering the galactic lenses here for the 2D. Oh, yeah, we didn't look into it. I mean, we haven't looked very much at what happens in 3D. I guess the motivation was that originally AIT was 2D, and then we used to start with 2D because it's what we looked at. But of course, maybe we'll be very interested to see some. So we can go back to your diagram. So you sort of said that this arrow here. You sort of said that this arrowhead one was a bit boring, which I take to mean it isn't the first thing you observed. But in your pop, there's a couple of things. I guess the first is if you're going along slightly lower Reynolds stuff, the arrowhead ones seem to be the first ones. Yeah, I mean, you hit them, but then I guess you don't. Oh, sorry, you said that red broken line, that's. That's it. They exist there. Yeah, that's non-linearly unstable. So you wouldn't hit them here. I mean. Well, I mean, you have to have perturbation of a certain amplitude to hit them there. Then they are not linearly unstable. Then you have to... I agree. But then the thing that is quite likely to happen, right, is that you might have something like this. Where you have EIT on the walls, and then you have your arrowhead in the middle. But the chaos in the wall, But the chaos intervals didn't come from the other head. Because you can trigger exactly if if you would tweak your experimental setup so that you didn't have any perturbations on the center line by some particular way, you can trigger this state for the same parameter setting. Because they coexist. So then it's... What about if you go down to the elastic turbulence where you go back to these so you never trigger the arrowhead? Yeah, so you it's it's a similar situation. You you can trigger It's a similar situation. You can trigger the arrowhead, but we never managed to trigger anything from the arrowhead in this regime either. So it was there, but we didn't manage to, at least in 2D. I mean, in 3D, there is a paper that was recently published, and you can get things in 3D. But then the arrowhead kind of disappears a little bit. So I think it doesn't play that much of a role. This is very interesting. I actually had a question about both parts of your talk, in particular the problem of diffusion instability. I guess in the spirit of thinking about porous media, you're here looking at a long periodic channel. How does any of this, how might you expect things to change if you have some geometric confinement in the lateral direction? The stuff is growing and being transported down. Growing and being transported downstream. You're thinking this is a pore throat, and then there's a sort of geometric opening here if you go into another pore. How sensitive is this to how long it's got to grow? Right, so well that's a that's that's what that would be very interesting to look at, right? I mean what I would expect there is that this would happen on the walls of the pore and then it and then it's a convective instability, right? So I would expect it to get convective away and then. Expect it to get back away, and then it depends if it has the time or space to draw enough. I'm sure I've seen it in numerical simulations of porous media, then you see structures that look very much like these. And then, of course, it's a little bit unclear if it's exactly that or not, but I have seen it in numerical simulations. I guess my point is that because we're sensitive to the sensitivity to parameters, maybe you don't care about what you've been for quite a long time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But you do care about. Yeah, but you do care about if you think about the finite length, that is, you know, how rapidly does this thing actually grow completely before it gets washed out because it's not. Yeah, I mean it's a very good question. Yeah, really cool. On the the diffusive instability, I know that you have said that it's it's present at vanishingly small diffusion. Yeah. But does it depend in any way on diffusion? But does it depend in any way on diffusion? Yes. Yeah, so it scales with the square root of the wave number that you have of the instability scales as the square root of one of the diffusion. Yeah, the most unstable mode. So when the flow is unstable, the marginally unstable mode, when it turns unstable, that scales with one or the square root of the diffusion. So if you have a very large diffusion, then your wavelength. Large diffusion, then your wavelength is larger. If that makes sense. But I just want to caveat all this with the fact that this here is... I mean, it's a little bit... I think it would be... I don't know if it does physically exist or if it's just a feature of the model, because the length and scales of instability are maybe ten times the size of the polymer. So they are really quite it's it's on the limit of where to continue model It's not the limit of where the continuum model, it's even a question if the continuum model holds at that point. And that's why I said that even though this might not necessarily be a physical thing, something might happen at the walls, but then you can have these kind of secondary instabilities which have a much more physical feeling to it. At least to me. Other questions or others? Yeah, sure. The first one. Does everyone call these damn things? No. Uh doesn't everyone call these damn things narwhal's? Well, that's a very good question. So so so so the first paper that was talking about it was uh published in 20... it was the paper by Jacob in 2020 and then they called it arrowheads and then some paper some papers after call it narrows and it has been a back and forth a little bit. So it depends on which group you are part of when you decide for naming the yeah. I mean the question was, I guess if eventually small diffusion is enough to trigger it, then
