And his experimental team with Jesse, Kottari, and Guillaume. And on the mathematical side of things, our PG student Lea with Grant Light and Martin. And we have been very fortunate to join the team with Michael Adamer, who is sort of the algebraic person here. So what is the story that I would like to tell you today? So let me start with cytokines. I've had very good introductions by Ignacio. Good introductions by Ignafio, also by Anton on Tuesday. So I'll be brief. But the idea is that cytokines are, or the cytokine cytokine receptor is a special type of receptor ligand systems. So cytokines are molecules which can stimulate immune cells. Of course, we know how important they are in adaptive immunity. They regulate the survival and proliferation of T cells, some of them. Cells, some of them and cytokines, of course, need to be sensed by immune cells by their specific receptors. So, if in fact we only see your first slide, you're probably showing another slide. We're just only seeing your title slide. Yeah, if you can click to forward your slides. Which slide do you maybe? Which side do you? Maybe we're stuck on our side. Can you see now? I think your screen share is frozen. You might have to stop sharing and reshare. That might be good. Okay. No fun. It's better to share the whole desktop. Oh, yeah, it's good. Is it good now? Okay. Right. It's perfect. There. So cytokines are sent by immune cells. Cytokines are sensed by immune cells when they bind their receptor. And in the case of cytokine receptors, they are composed of multiple chains. And these chains actually can be shared by other receptors. So if you look at figure A, this is the family of gamma C cytokine receptors. So all of them share their gamma C chain. But if you look also at the three that I've highlighted there, the IL2 receptor, the IL7, and the L15. 7 and the L15, not only they share the gamma C, but L2 and L15 can also share another chain. So important things to keep in mind and what we really wanted to address here is the copy number for each chain will depend on the cell type, as you can see on that table in Figure B. But also within isogenic cells of one cell type, protein copy numbers can vary quite a lot. Quite a lot. So, what is it that we would like to do? So, we can have a receptor that is characterized by how many molecules are expressed on the cell surface. The ligand usually characterized by its extracellular concentration or number of molecules available to that cell. We need to describe the binding and the unbinding. And as you can see, by exemplified there by that very simple K on and K of, K on association, K of dissociation. K on association, K of dissociation, we will assume mass action kinetics. And very importantly, I think when you need to link the modeling to the experimental work, is could we identify what we mean by the complexes that are characterizing the cellular response in this case? And of course, relate copy numbers of the different molecules to how many what we called bound signaling complexes are there. Complexes are there. Given the difference in time scales between these molecular reactions and the cellular decisions or cellular responses, we are going to make use of equilibrium. Usually for the in vitro conditions, L, the ligand will be in excess. And what we would like to do is at equilibrium, and of course, we don't need to know both K on and K off, but only the ratio, because we're looking at equilibrium, determined given the number of molecules. Given the number of molecules of each kind, how many sort of bound signaling complexes we obtain? And something that experimentalists like to sort of quantify and study is the dose response, which measures the experimentally determined cellular response, whatever, as I've said, whatever output you decide is a measure of cellular response as a function of usually the ligand concentration, but we need to. Ligand concentration, but we need to remember that this is assuming a fixed number of receptors which characterize the cell type. So, what is it that we've done here? So, dose response is the experimentally determined cellular response as a function of the concentration. We need to come up with a theoretical definition of what we want to compare it to. So, in our case, it will be the number of bound and signaling complexes as a function of that concentration. function of that concentration so that signaling function will denote as um sigma of l and the characteristic behavior of this function is um it can be defined by the amplitude which is the difference between the signaling value at zero and when there is infinite ligand which in drug in the drug development world that's also called the efficacy of the drug and the Of the drug and the half-maximum effective concentration or EC50 that I've called for short L50, which is the ligand concentration at which you obtained half of the amplitude. And as you can see, given one amplitude, you can have different EC50s, or given an EC50, you can have different amplitudes. So these two variables are in. Variables are independent. So, what we would like to do is basically, inspired by the experiments, analyze this dose-response curve. So, what Gregoire with his team studied was cell-to-cell variability of IL-7 stimulation and as a measure, the levels of phosphorylated STAT5. So, what is the observation? And the observation is reflected here in the first panel. Is reflected here in the first panel, which is a measure of phosphorylated stat 5 for different copy numbers of the involved chains. And I'll explain a little bit in the next slide. But basically, what you could imagine is as you increase the number of the copy numbers of these proteins, you would imagine having an increase. And that is seen for the IL-7 receptor alpha chain and for the kinase JAC3, but actually you don't see. But actually, you don't see that behavior for the gamma C chain. And in fact, what you see is that when you increase the copy numbers of the gamma C, you decrease the L7 response as measured by P stat5. They also looked at populations of cells that can be called emblem populations with a fixed number of GEC3, but various numbers of gamma C and L7. And as you can see, the dose response curves. Can see the dose response curve is rather heterogeneous. So, to ask the question is: oops, can we try to explain this experimental observation? And they were also able to not just quantify the amplitude and the AC50. So in our wish list was to develop a mathematical approach that would allow us to quantify these two variables, the amplitude and the AC50, as a function of the copy number of all the molecules. Of the copy number of all the molecules involved. So for the R7 receptor system, we've got, as you can see in figure A, you've got the ligand. The receptor is actually a heterodimer and involves two receptor chains, the alpha, the L7 alpha and the gamma C, and a kinase that binds the gamma C chain and allows it to signal. And we would like, of course, to characterize the cellular variable. The cellular variability in copy number and the cellular response as measured by PSTAC5, which we assume is going to be proportional to the number of bound and signaling complexes that we defined as the full complex, the ligand bound to alpha and gamma and gamma itself bound to JAC. In panel B, you see the reactions that we included. Since we are assuming equilibrium, as I've mentioned, only the affinity or dissociation constants. Affinity or dissociation constants are required. Very importantly, since you can have, for example, gamma binding to alpha in the presence or absence of JAC3 bound to gamma C, our first hypothesis was to assume that there is no allostery, that those reactions are actually the same. They have the same rate. So what is it that we did? So just to put and guide you. Just to put and guide you through the process, the gamma chain receptor is going to be called X, the alpha is going to be called Y, and the JAC is going to be called Z, and the cytokine is going to be L. And what one can observe is that, of course, depending on the numbers of these molecules, you're always going to form two types of bound complexes, what we call the dummy complexes, which is the ligand bound to the receptor without the JAC, and what we call the signaling complex in panel B. Complex in panel B, oh, sorry, there's a mistake, panel B, which is the receptor bound to the JAC3 and the ligand. So the hypothesis that we put in this first toy model was to, of course, assume equilibrium. Excess of cytokine and L will be a model parameter. And of course, we assume conservation of the total number of molecules for all the species involved, the gamma-C, the Species involved, the gamma C, the alpha 7, and the JAG3 kinase. We assume that there is no allostery, and the biological quantity of interest is the ligand bound to alpha, to gamma, and to JAG3. So that then, therefore, under these assumptions, the signaling function sigma is going to be the product of k1, k2, and k4 times L, the ligand x, the gamma c y, the The gamma C y the alpha and z the JAC3, and we need to calculate the limit of that function when ligand tends to infinity. And we also need to find the ligand concentration L50 such that we obtain half the amplitude. So almost by serendipitous coincidences, I was introduced to the concept of the Grebner basis. And in this instance, through the steps that I'm going to describe now, we were able to Describe now, we were able to obtain analytical expressions. So, what is it that one does? So, let me guide you through the steps. You start, of course, assuming mass action kinetics. You write the differential equations that are derived from the reactions that we proposed. Then, of course, you assume steady state and conservation. And I will, as you can see there, steady state gives you a relationship between the complexes. For example, the gamma bound to the jack is actually. Bound to the JAC is actually equal to the rate k1 times how many copies you've got of the free gamma and how many copies you've got of the jack3. So, in polynomial, that's k1 times xz. The conservation equations are going to give you a polynomial equation, as you can see there. So, if this JAC3 is conserved, so NC is how many copies of JAC I've got, it's going to be how many I've got of the free plus all. Got of the free plus all the bound complexes that we can have. In this case, we've got three molecules: the JAC, the gamma, and the alpha. So we've got three polynomial equations with X, Y, and Z, of course, the variables at equilibrium. And you look at those expressions, and of course, you've got them, you know, the X and the Y and the Z in every equation. What is the hope of really analytically finding solutions? Really, analytically finding solutions. Of course, one can always obtain computational ones. But if you're exploring parameter space, that search can be expensive. So the Krebner basis is a beautiful tool that allows you sort of to, let me just explain one, deconvolute the previous polynomials that you obtain in equivalent polynomials which have the same solutions, which have the same rules. Same solutions which have the same roots, but yet, as you can see, the equivalent polynomials are actually polynomials in just the one. So you get one polynomial in one variable, another polynomial in another variable, and then one which mixes the variables, but it's actually much easier to solve. So everybody in this room, I'm sure, has solved quadratic polynomials. So P1 and P2 can be. P1 and P2 can be solved with pencil and paper, which is something that I quite like to do. And basically, we obtain the equilibrium solutions for the three chains. We can put all this into our sigma function, the signaling function, and we can find the amplitude. So in this case, the amplitude is equal to the minimum of how many alpha or gamma chains. Or gamma chains, you've got k1 times z, with z being the equilibrium number of jack3 divided by 1 plus kappa 1 over z. One can do exactly the same for determining the EC50. What you do is you write the conservation polynomials augmented by the definition of the L fifty, which is the L fifty is the value that gives you of sigma, that gives you half of the amplitude. That gives you half of the amplitude. So, of course, the polynomials are going to be a bit more convoluted, but as you can see here, by looking at B1, that is the new polynomial which only depends on L and which will very beautifully allow us to calculate for the EC50 its expression. And that's there. So, the beauty of these expressions is that you can always then understand their behavior as a function of any of the Standard behavior as a function of any of the parameters, copy numbers of any molecules, and any of the rates, all the dissociation and affinity rates that you've got in this model. So then we can look at the comparison. And if you look at panel B, the top is the amplitude, the lower panel in reddish colors is the EC50. This toy model is able to explain the experimental, but unable. experimental but unable amplitude but unable to explain the ec50 and then a panel a clearly tells you that we can explain that decreasing the amplitude by when you've got a large number of gamma c chains it's the gamma complexes that are formed and not the signaling ones so that can be explained but what about the ec50 so we put forward a number of um hypotheses um that are That allostery might matter. That didn't do the job. The observation that you see in the panel for the for the, sorry, for the EC50 is that there really is a need to increase the theoretical value of the LC, of the L50, EC50. So what mechanism could reduce forming a full L7 receptor? So anything that competes and takes away a gamma C chain could be a good thing. And the beauty, of course, is that gamma C share, gamma C is. Is that gamma C shared? Gamma C is shared, so we don't need to make it up. We tried the alpha L2 receptor alpha as a potential solution to the problem that failed. So what we assumed is let's include in the model an additional receptor subunit that we called W and apologies because in this figure we called it X. So that's, but I didn't want to call it X because we've used X as a. X as a label in our polynomials, assume that gamma C combined W and we tried that and that didn't do the job. Then we had to make a further assumption. And I cannot see that what this will biologically mean, but the idea is that the number of copy numbers of this W chain is proportional to the number of gamma C chains to a certain power. And in order to explain the expression, And in order to explain the experimental results, P gets a value of 1.2. You can see the reactions in panel B. So, when we do this, where are we now? So, I haven't shown the theoretical expressions here, but if you trust me, you can look at the green and the reddish, so the amplitude and the LC50 experimental and theoretical predictions, and you can see the nice agreement. We are actually obtaining. We are actually obtaining analytical solutions for the amplitude for the full model, making use of asymptotic behavior and perturbation theory, since the amplitude only depends on the behavior of L at infinity. The amplitude of the new model is actually the same as that of the toy model, and the computation of L50 is actually reduced to a polynomial of degree 3, and we can show that that polynomial doesn't depend on the number of JAC or K1, the affinity. The affinity constant K1. So, with this in mind, the question is: is there something special about the L7 receptor system? Because, of course, ideally, one would like to generalize this to other receptor ligand systems. So, the first thing we did also, inspired by some work that Gregoire had been putting forward, was to compare receptors that may or may not have, I mean, that have extrinsic or intrinsic kinase activity. Is intrinsic kinase activity? The cytokine receptor has extrinsic kinase via JAK, but for example, the T-cell receptor has intrinsic kinase activity. And what one can do with predictions is compare if you change the number of receptors, compare if you go by 10 times the number of receptors of the wild type versus the wild type, and then lower those numbers. You can see, for example, First, you can see, for example, how robust the heterodymic RTK with intrinsic kinase is compared, for example, to the homodimeric. So what I'm advocating here, and so that you know the things that one needs to do, is one can put all these models, the HOMO, RTK, or the HOMO, with various orders of reactions, and the same thing for the hetero-dimeric, which Hetero dimeric, which I'm not going to bore you with the details. But the idea is that Leah and Michael have been able to obtain expressions for the EC50 and the amplitude in all these systems, and we can quantify. So to me, this is quite powerful and gives robust understanding of where we are. So I will conclude, oops, oh, there, with a summary of the results. So we were presented with an experimental paradox in the L7 result. Experimental paradox in the L7 receptor system. We put together a toy model that explains the amplitude, but didn't explain the EC50, and a more general model that is able to explain amplitude and EC50. But I think most importantly, and for me as a modeler, it taught us a new method in which we can push forward analytical expressions for the amplitude and EC50. And I should have mentioned, I didn't say, but usually in the work of, I mean, in the field. The work of, I mean, in the field of algebraic sort of modeling in mathematical biology, these algebraic methods are just used to understand the nature of the solution. So whether you've got a one, a unique solution, or whether you've got multiple solutions, but not really to try to get expressions that are linked to sort of signaling outcomes. So I thought that was quite nice that still the methods were there and we just had. Still, the methods were there, and we just had to explore them. So, the method actually, of course, can reduce computational costs because if you've got analytical expressions, you can do that much easier. But most importantly, is that it leads to a greater quantitative understanding. And we've been able to explore homo and heterodynamic receptors, both with intrinsic and extrinsic kinase activities. So, future work is what we can do. Is what can we do when ligand might not be in excess, as it can be the in vivo scenario? We've also not included, for example, the role of JAC1 that is associated to the L7 receptor alpha chain. And we would like to study also receptor-ligand systems where the dose-response function is not monotonic in behavior. So, with this, I would say thank you. Would say thank you. And of course, I couldn't be there today in Banff, but looking forward to more in-person events soon. Thank you very much for the invitation to give this seminar, Leia really, who pushed the project. And thank you, Gregoire, just when you hosted her. So that has actually led to some beautiful work. Jesse and Guillaume for being there with all the experimental work, Michael with all the algebraic. Work, Michael, with all the algebraic journey, the audience for listening. And I think it's very important to say thank you to the European Commission that funded the Quanti network, where a number of us here in this meeting have PhD students working on these different projects. Thank you again. Are there any questions? Yaron. Hi, thank you. It is very interesting. I'm eager to try it. So I may have missed it, so I have two questions. One, is the global basis mostly transforming the mass conservation equation, or does it also include the steady state in it? And the second part is. And the second part is: does it also work for systems where there are kind of cycles where the different components can assemble in more than through one path? Yeah, thank you very much. So yes, indeed. The Grubner basis, I mean, Grubner basis apply to polynomial systems. So very simply, as you can see here, in order to write the concept. In order to write the conservation equation as a polynomial, as you can see, you make use of the steady-state equations. So, for example, as you can see here, the gamma-jack 3 complex in equilibrium is given by, that's why you can write them in terms of monomials, right? So everything is sort of nice and simple. When you write the conservation equation, and if you look at it, this is a polynomial in all these variables. So the Gregner basis is, to me, this sort of magical. To me, it's this sort of magical thinking, which basically it's a generalization of division. So it's a basis which allows you to divide these polynomials and you still keep the same roots. So, and very interestingly, and this is just one of those things about mathematics, you have to choose an order. So, you need to choose a lexicographic order because sometimes Gographic order because sometimes if you choose the wrong order of the variables, you don't obtain anything nice. So it's almost really like magic. But as you can see, you deconvolute one polynomial in just the one variable. And back to what you said, absolutely with the cycles. So Leah is actually working on the cycles. When you've got cycles, of course, you've got to be careful, but then you can input the constraints because if you know what constraints the cycles impose, then as we've done for the Then, as we've done for the L50, you can include that as an equation. I should also say, you haven't asked, but the fact that you could actually generalize two systems in which you don't have conservation of molecules. So, by not including that variable, it's a conservation. So, it can be generalized when you've got sinks and sources. Thank you, Jaron. I mean, it was a little bit over my head because the math are not all my things. I should have said, you don't have to know any math. You just write the equations and then there's this symbolic software that will give you these polynomials and quadratic polynomials. Anyhow, you should answer. Yeah, so no, I'm curious. Discussion, yeah. So, no, I'm curious because you know, like when we talk about you know, like an A bind receptor B with this on-free and off-rate, and you know, those are things that we can determine experimentally, more or less, depending on the system. But there's this new wave of data that have started to show that the JAGs, beyond just phosphorylating stats and tyrosine, they are playing a critical role in stabilizing the complex. And we are not getting those values in solution KDE. So, you know, when we talk this complex. You know, when we talk this complex is, you know, have 20 picomor affinity in solution, it probably has fentomoro affinity in the membrane because the stabilization of the jacks. So, I'm curious, you know, how can you model that or it matters at all for the modeling and activities? That's a wonderful question. So, I mean, I've gone very quickly and I'll be delighted. In fact, as I've, I think as someone, I don't know if Ignafi or someone said this morning, you know, it's being an amazing set of people. You know, set of people. I'm learning a lot. So, lots of things are included. So, parameters that matter are, of course, number of molecules, but as you can see here, the affinity rates also matter. So, you can have the values of these parameters are going to tell you what is most sensitive. So, I agree with you. In this case, just due to the nature of the interaction. Is just due to the nature of the interactions. And also, let me add: not only the value of these rates, but exactly which reactions you include. Because if you look at this here, and maybe this is it's easier to look at it here, we've assumed a certain number of reactions. So the JAC binds to gamma, and you can see that gamma binds to alpha, and the ligand binds to the And the ligand bites to the preform receptor, right? So, as I've mentioned, and I'll go all the way to the end, something that for me, it's always, and you know me because you work with me, so it's exactly which reactions do you include? So, for example, one example here, maybe this is simpler, is imagine a homodimeric receptor, and you can choose what we've said, model A, in which the homodimeric RTK, you know, gamma binds to gamma and gives you the homodimer. Binds to gamma and gives you the homodimeric, and then the ligand can only bind to the preformed receptor. Or model B, in which the ligand binds to one chain of the receptor, and then, oh, that's a mistake there, and then the ligand binds to the preform. So depending on which order, you're actually going to find different behavior. So I think what this modeling can do is if you don't know what happens. What happens in the real situation, you could compare the predictions of these different models for different rates of these reactions. So, absolutely, to me, by being able to quantify these things much better together with the modeling, we can only learn together. Something I should say, of course, is that this doesn't include any dynamics, right? That this is assuming equilibrium. So, this is basically. So, this is basically understanding signaling, assuming equilibrium, not the kinetics of the reactions. Yep. Thank you. Thank you, Ignacio. Okay, thanks to everybody. We're a bit constrained by time. Okay, we'll speak to Kamen every week. We need to have a lunch issue if we're taking too much time. So just interject, sorry. Jack, sorry. I've uh I've increased, I've pushed the schedule back 15 minutes, so yeah, yeah, but but we have to put it another 15 minutes because uh we have to do the break now and and we should resume at 11, I think. Yes, oh, that's what you did. Oh, sorry, yeah, go perfect, thank you. So we have to do the break now and meet again in 10 minutes. That's great, that's what we should do before everybody disappears. Feel free to talk during the break. I just want to add something. So, tomorrow we are. To add something, so tomorrow we start earlier than today. So I just wanted to let everybody know because.
