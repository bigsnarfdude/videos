More vertices. And then since these guys all have to have degree R, they have to be adjacent to everything else. So you really get KR. Okay, so the regular graphs, of course, are just are just just disjoint cycles, so mostly I'm going to say r is of these three. These results, these results in the middle are things that have already been talked about today, but notice again we're getting these generalized polygons, projective planes, incident graphs, all this stuff that this conference is supposed to be about. And here's a table of the known values of the traditional pages. Jeff mentioned for me. Jeff mentioned for me that there's a conjecture now, Oakler. I mean, this is just based on all the cages we know, okay? It's just a matter of looking at them. But the conjecture is that for even values of G, the Rg cages are bipartite. Now, it's not Rg graphs. And he gave us an example of an RG graph where G was even that was not bipartite. And that's what actually is a whole idea. And that's what actually is a whole idea of what we're going to talk about, a part of an idea. But he did come up with an example that we needed. But people conjecture that when you look at the smallest RG graphs when G is even, that then they actually are bipartite, which is the same as saying chromatic number two. And so we're getting a relationship now between R and G and chi. And that's where our definition really came from, is looking at this conjecture. Is looking at this conjecture and then saying, well, what if we required a particular chromatic number as well as a regularity and a girth and now chromatic number. Because if this conjecture is true, then you've built in chromatic number to the whole problem. Okay, so these are, this is Gabrielle, Legen, or Michael and me. This was our new definition. If you have an RNA and a If you have an RNG and a chi, an RNG chi graph is a graph that's our regular growth G and chromatic number chi. Okay, and then of course now the big question is, do such people or graphs exist? And Jeff showed me an example, one that we needed just a little bit ago. But supposing they exist, then the case will be one of minimum order. And he calculated some of these numbers for us in his. Some of these numbers for us in his last talk, if they're correct. Okay, so before we get started on the actual existence problem, I mean, what kinds of things can be in note? Of course, if g is on, then pi has to be at least three. And by Burke's theorem, chi is going to be no more than r plus one. So the existence is a little bit more restricted than what I showed up here. I showed up here. And finally, for today, we're going to mostly look at chi equals three. Okay. This theorem is very much like the last one that I just talked about, K R R being the graph that gives us R4. We want to just look at the simplest version of what we're talking about. So you've got Version of what we're talking about. So you've got a degree of regularity, you want group 3, you want chromatic number 3. Okay. And essentially, this balance tripartite graph K, R over 2, R over 2, R over 2 gives it to you. Exceptions we're about parity in some cases. So R plus R over 2 is just these numbers if R is even. If R is odd and this is even, then you have to add another vertex. another vertex or parity unit can't have an odd number of degrees of an odd number of vertices above degree and here you would have to add a little bit more but these are essentially this and the argument looks very much like that kr argument that i just gave you for example if r is even you can argue pretty easily that well you have three clumps of graphs because or vertices because it's got a chromatic number of three and the only way they can all have degree r is if they're r over two Have degree R as if they're R over 2, R over 2, R over 2, and then you have all the just force 10. And you show in this case, for example, do you have to force one more vertex to get, I could say, an even number of vertices when R is on, and so forth. So that's essentially how that argument goes. All right, so you went too far. Did I go too far? So here's examples of those cases. So when r is even, we just get a complete tripartite graph. When r is odd in this case, we get a balanced tripartite graph, but you have to take out a one factor because you're getting r plus one as your degree. And in this case, it's not quite balanced. This was the r plus r over two plus two. And in constructing these things, we basically started with complete. Basically, started with complete whatever we had there. Like here, K222, and we had to take out a one factor. In this case, it was slightly unbalanced. We took out a one factor and then another one factor and part of it, not a factor, a one regular graph and part of the constructed graph. And the degrees are high enough that you can use Hamiltonian results, which I love, or factor results. Okay, but this is what the 3Ks look like. Now, the existence question. Again, sticking with Kypo 3, Gabby wrote a really nice proof that providing this folklore conjecture is true, providing that cages that have even growth, regular oak cages, RG cages, are bipartite, then we used those existences to show that we could get. To show that we could get Rg3 graphs for all R and G. If G was even, and we knew we had these bipart digraphs, and we could play with those to increase their chromatic number. And if G was odd, I think we looked at G plus one, made that even, and then played with the graph that we worked with. But at all these, and of course you get the cages, but at least for our paper, which was very introductory. So here's some questions. Can we show existence without assuming? Show existence without assuming that conjecture. The goal of getting this paper written was this particular conference. So we can come with ideas that we had looked at and not necessarily solved. So we can do RG3, assuming the conjecture. Graphs and cages. So that would be one big question, of course. How did you get it? It's delayed. In jump, jump, it's delayed somehow. Oh, it's added, so just don't jump so quick. All right, so let me go back to R33. When we constructed these, and in essence we constructed all of them, except I think in the last example, I didn't convince myself we had our method of construction would have gotten all possibilities. But all of the ones we did construct had the property that the color classes were different by most. were different by almost one. So we were getting what we called equitable colorings. Okay, so this seemed like yet another new idea. You could talk about an RG chi graph being RG chi equitable if there was an equitable colouring, chi coloring of G, and it's all regular and has growth G. Okay, so now we're going to put another restriction on it. I medicate. I'm in a cage to be an RGCHI equitable graphic minimum order. It turns out that you're right. Providing the folklore conjecture is true. Actually, it's provided if we had RG3 graphs, however we got them, we got them as a folklore conjecture, then it's easy to take copies and put them together and get equitable graphs. Equitable graphs. So you cut it cheap, but you can get, you can show that if you have an RG3 graph, you can get an RG3 equitable graph and consequently RG3 equitable cages. Okay, so another, so this again unfortunately goes back to the dependence on that conjecture. Okay. Here's a way more interesting question. I mean, this is the kind of thing that doesn't I mean, this is the kind of thing that not just is there at conferences sometimes get earth. People keep making more and more definitions, and you say, wait a minute, you haven't finished the last one, now you make another one. Do you have anything new? Do you know what you're talking about? Do we really have a new concept with this equitability? Maybe every single RG, chimra, or CAGE, whatever, is equitable, because in our R33 case, it was, right? We just got equitability for three. Equitability for free. So that really is probably the most, I think, interesting question of what I'm going to talk about. Could it be that in fact every RG high cage is affected equitable, kind of like every RG even cage as chromatic number two, a question like that. Of R3 and G is odd, just starting with. Just starting with small better cases we know more about. First of all, the 3G cage is a 3G3 cage, with one exception, by Brooks' theorem. If it's R-regular, its chromatic number has to be 3. Okay, so every 3G cage is a 3G3 cage. So we, and we know there are these things, so we know we have these things. So the question is, when G gets bigger, could it be there just a Could it be they're just all equitable? Do we have anything new or do we just have another definition? Well, just like the basis for the conjecture is all examples, we looked at a lot of examples, cages that were known, and we conjecture that in the case of R is 3 and G is I, we don't get anything new. Just looking at examples, and so we conjecture yes. So we conjecture yes, and this is motivated by the fact that many of the known cages, that is the three geod cages, like the Peterson graph, I'll show you pictures, and the McGee graph or the 3-7, or McGee, which is a 3-7, the one of the known 3-9s, the 3-11, every one of those cages, which are three G-odd cages, which means they're three G-odd 3 cages, they're all equitable. So, for example, well, you know the Peterson graph if you can color it with each one of the color classes, having only off by one size. Here's a picture of the McGee graph, which is a 3-7 cage. It has chromatic number 3, necessarily, and here's an equitable coloring of it. This is the fanciest it gets. Here is one of the known 3.9 cages. The known 39 cages, and here's an equitable coloring. So it's a 393 equitable cage. And here's the 393 cage, which is equitable. So in the case that we have three odd three, we don't think we have anything new. That's our conjecture. That this equitability just comes for free. However, However, if we look at r equal 4, we can prove we have a new concept. And it was not trivial to do this. So here's what I mean by saying we have a new concept. So we have R4, GS5, and Chi is 3. The unique 4,5 cage, which is the Robertson graph, has Robertson graph has chromatic number three and it's the unique 453 cage automatine, but it's not a 453 equitable cage. This was hard to prove. I mean it would kind of beat it up, but try to find some way of arguing without just looking at pages and pages and pages and pages of cases. I'll show you a picture in a moment, but every time you tried to build, so what Build. So, what would an equitable coing look like? We have 19 vertices, so we'd have to have a 6, 6, 7, right? A D equitable, the only way. And every time you try to build a 6, 6, 7, you end up with a 5. Just when you start ruling out what can happen with the girth of the regular areas. So here is the Robinson page. This is the best coloring we could get, and you'll notice that the greens are, there's five. Us that the greens are there's five green vertices. And this is what our proof showed. It has to happen if you were trying to build an egg what we're calling. More interest. Well, another interesting part of this is we can exhibit a 453 equitable case. So it's a four regular Girth 5 primary number three with an equitable coloring. Then he has order 20. So it's the this number is one more when you require. Is one more when you require equitability. Sorry. So, and here it is. This is a four regular verse five chromatic number three graph that has an equitable calling, and it's the minimum order among such things. Okay, so we, there's a lot of work we do. We have one example that this equitability is not, doesn't come for free with cages. For free with cages. Okay. Some future work, some more questions. Of course, there's this whole existence thing that it's a question. But we just looked at chromatic number three. So let's look at bigger chromatic numbers when G is odd. Why do we have G odd? Well, that's what we're mostly worried about. I'll talk about G even in a moment, but for G odd, which moment but for g odd which is what we looked at three three um how about bigger just you know bigger girth and getting bigger chromatic number so look for those cages graphs cages equifer pages this is cold this is where christian pops in um just a small number of days or weeks ago um gabby showed me this Gabby showed me this paper where he defined an R chi graph, and you can guess what that means. It's R regular with chromatic number chi. So he showed that these things existed for r's and chi's in this range. One of his constructions, I didn't have time to read them all, but at least one of the constructions contained a triangle. So it had Gur3. So this showed that we have R3. That we have R3 chi graphs for this range. Okay, so now I feel a little more the club because there's somebody else working on this stuff. Even if the folklore conjecture is true, now this is where Jeff comes in. Even if it's true, and that for Even G every RG cage is an RG2 cage. Okay. So we can look for RG chi. Can look for RG chive graphs and pages for larger value. And what Jeff just got done is showing us that, let me just make sure I get this right, that he found three, and then he had some evens in here. I think he had a six and an eight. And he found graphs that were three regular, girth six, that were not bipartite. And because of three, they had to have chromatic number three. So he found three. He found three, six, three graphs, and consequently, and I think he said he found a minimum order, right? So you actually found three, six, three cages. So even if the conjecture is true and three, six cages are bipartite, we can have three, six, three cages. We can have a bigger chromatic number. So, thank you, Jeff. So, this was. So, this was, I get me worried though, for a minute. I thought you were going to show that conjecture was false and consequently how my talk was. So, you know, this is, this makes me feel good. This stuff is going to tighten with what other people are doing. And then, finally, besides this kind of graphing cage, there's another kind of cage that's been studied where you're given. Study where you're given a degree of regularity and a Gers pair, and it's an odd number and an even number. So you want to know what's the smallest odd cycle and what's the smallest even cycle. And then, of course, you're going to look at cages. And we think that there's a relationship here for helping us construct stuff, but we didn't get to go too far with that. But so I think there are lots of variations, interesting variations. Lots of variations, interesting variations on the traditional cages. So, ready, so not so new.
