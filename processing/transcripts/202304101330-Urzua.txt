Yeah, yeah, you know, I can I mean I know it's all that session. It's a pleasure to have John Darla Muskola here to tell us about exotic format world and ASBA script. Thank you very much for the invitation. I come from the hub by geometry, so I hope. If you have questions, I need to go up and ask confusing. So I will be talking about exotic formifules and the relation with these KSBA surfaces. I will explain what that means. This is based on this preprint that is in the archive. And it's a drain work with an ex-master student, Javier Rodes, who is in. Have you ever seen New Maryland now in the PhD? The theorem that we have, one theorem that we have there is that there exists exotic minimum robots of V2. Of B2C at four points. Yeah, slow down technique. So I was going to explain the details of these examples, but I prefer to tell you more about why and how we get these kind of examples. And the main point is to explain the relation of this problem with configurations of rational curves. So I will start with a definition of a surface of general type. So for me, this is a complex projective surface. Not singular, but also I would say that Ky, which is the canonical class squared, is equal to zero, and ky intersected with any complex curve, zero equal to zero. So these are the typical surfaces that we need to deal with. That we need to deal with and that we would like to classify, but this is very difficult. I want to, so the way we classify these general attire surfaces is by means of these modular spaces. And for the modular space, we fix this imbalance. Remember that this k squared of y is just the first chain class square bigger than zero. But also we fix this holomorphic. But also we fix this holomorphic Euler characteristic, which you know is one minus the lower sections of omega one twi plus the double sections of omega two omega two. So this is known as the regularity. This is the geometric genus. This is also positive in this situation. You may have a general type You may have a general type surface where this is not satisfied, but you know that you can blow down minus one curves. These are spheres with set intersection minus one that you can contract until you get a situation like that if this is objective. So these are the minimum models you want. So okay, we have this invariant. By the way, the second gem tag here. The second germ task here is low intellectualistic, you know, and this can be computed as 12 i minus 2 squared. So we have this moduli space of surfaces of general time of surfaces of general time with those in biomass fixed. It is not even clear that you have something that is not empty. So, this is the geographic problem. When you fix these two invariants, it's not even clear how to find a y in general. And it has many, this is a plastic rejective. So, this is a result of P-second. This is a classic rejective variety. In general, you have many. In general, you have many components, several dimensions, so really different to Mg. This is the analog of Mg. This is a general type for curves. So, what is a KSDA surface? It's a singular surface, so it's not non-singular, it's singular or are singular surfaces that we use to compactify that modulus space. Compactify. compactifi and k square. So this is a bigger space that we put a bar. This is the analog of ng bar. This is the mean map for multiplication, although this space and that space are irreducible, in our case this might not be Case, this might not be, and this might not be really the minimal compactification. You might have more components parameterizing surfaces that are not smooth at all. It's polaristic. This is the polar check of param I see other duplications. This happens 1988. First, the definition by these two mathematicians and then compactedness, compoundedness, if you call it, Alexi, 1994. Okay, so this is the general picture. Those are the KSDA surfaces. I haven't said what kind of similarities you all have because they are very restricted. And also they analog the canonical class. The analog canonical class must be positive, like that, but with a strictly legal assumption. But for me, I will today I will talk about KSDA surfaces that are very particular, although very important, I guess, I think. And then one Uh projective surface volume with only wall singularities and so finitely many. My picture is something like this. There you have the singularities. Sometimes I do something like this, so that I remember that this is a surface. And the number of singularities is finite, it's going to be L. And then 2. So now we need a positivity, a positive condition on canonical class. The canonical class W is certain only of canonical class give you all the embedding subject space. Projective space. Yes, sir. Was it saying everyone with only one singularity? Projective surface W with only wall singularity. Wall. This is a mathematician you're not a wall. Okay, so what is a wall singularity? Okay, so these are CPO singularities. Simulate this. So you know you have C2, and there is a simplic action on C2, say order M. And now you need to have two, so you put two exponents, but you can make, so the action is like this. xy goes to some root of m that is primitive, x, and then some root of m to the q, y. And then you portion it. You get a singularity that is the singularity. You get a singularity that is the Cyclipoti singular. And the notation for those Cyclipotient singularities, remembering M and Q is 1 over M, 1Q. That is our notation. So these wall singularities are similar Poisson singularities of type 1 over n squared, 1 nA minus 1, where the G C D of N A Of NA is one. But also, these are the simple possible singularities that admit a complex moving number zero, but also, and this is the But also, and this is the other characterization that we like to have. You can recognize those similarities in the following algorithm. So, you start with a fibrous like this. Say that this is eigen500 and then figuration. So, the circuit projection is zero. Is zero. So this is the starting point. You blow up that point, then you get self-intersection minus 4 for the proper transform, the rational curve. And here you have the minus 1 curve. So this is 4, and this corresponds to 1 over 4 upon 1, which is the first wall singularity. And now you choose here or here, but in this case, doesn't matter, and blow up. Then you get minus 5, minus 2, minus 1. Minus one is part two, and then again, this is more than nine, part three, similarity, one. And now you can choose this point or that point, and there you will see the other point. So if you choose this point, you get minus six, minus two, minus two, minus one, and then minus five. And then minus five, and you choose that point, or this point, you get minus two, minus three, minus one, and you keep going. Now you have, you can choose here or here, here or here, and this is a tree tree, and these things represent the minimal resolution of the CV lines. So, So, you know, when you have a single position singularity, you resolve the singularity. So, this is like a cone. You take out that point and you replace it by this chain of P1. And here you have self-intersections minus V1, so they are negative minus VS. Vi's are all bigger equal than 2. And then this chain, if you represent it like this, is Is one of those chains. And this is the Hugsimple June continuum fraction. That will give you, at the end, the n squared over n n minus 1. There is a lot of combinatorics in these singularities that I will not touch, but this is what singularities, those are called walk chains. And you know, these are this is what you use to do rational loaddown on formalities. So after you have a world chain, you replace that wall chain by this homology ball. So take out the, so you have a link, you take out the chain, and you replace it with the ball, and you have the capacity at one now. Use Use to uh new rational protocols. Okay, so uh an application, so those are the similarities, an application of this kind of surfaces is to find surfaces similar type we We give properties. So, for example, John Mali and John D. Park, 2007, they gave the first simple connected connected campaign. Camped A surface, this means k square 2, and pg, this is the geometric genus, q equal to 0. And how they did that? So they construct a W so that that meets a cubor and sign. So this cubor and So, this Q-O-E-N-Stein smoothing, so this is my W that has several wall singularities. A Q-Borenstein smoothing is a deformation of this W so that locally at each of these points you have a smoothing with minimal number zero. This is very difficult to do if you have a W, you don't know how to produce something like that. But then there is a, in a different geometry, when you want to know if you have a smoothie or You know, if you have a smoothie block, there is an obstruction that you need to check, and hopefully, that is zero. But that obstruction lives in a vector space, which in this case is this one. And if this is completely zero, then there is no obstruction, and you have the WT for free. And this is what is happening in that construction. In that con construction, by the park, they prove the VCC. There are techniques to to do that. There are techniques to do that. And then this WT is this calcadaic simply connected surface. Now, the key for me here is that instead of working with a general type surface, which is difficult, you work with a rational surface. This W is rational. And rational sometimes is easier. So rational is birational fifty-two. Yeah, birational. They are quite rational. So you might think about starting with P2, then do several drops. You construct chains like this, then you contract them to singularities, and then try to grow this. Well, the reality is more subtle than that. That is the idea. I will give you an example. So for example. And a very good source of examples are elliptic vibrations, since you have several rational tools in them. That is the only reason. It's not because we need elliptic vibrations. So say that you have an elliptic vibration, you need a fibrous like this, L4, and two I1s. This is very simple to construct from a pencil of cubics in P2. Of cubics in P2. We can do that. It's not difficult. We need to have this fiber, these are the two, and there might be more. But these are the key fibers to do the construction. But also we need sections. These are sections. So you know, sections here are minus one curve. This is zero curve. And these are all minus two. They are all zero. They are all spheres, and this is singular rationale. Meant to be my set of annotation data. And now, imagine this is the difficult part. We do grow ups. So, in this case, I mean I have prepared an example. I know where to do blow-ups. You have this point, this point, that point, this point. And so you get this minus 4, blow up the up, and minus 3, minus 3. And now these sections are going to become minus 2 products, minus 3, minus 2. I blow up there, here, and then I resolve these singularities and blow up again, like that. So now you see three wall chains. One of these is minus four and the other is three two six two and there is a repetition three two six two contract this by the way there is a theorem by Arcon to allow you to contract when you have a chip To allow you to contract. When you have a chain like that, then you have a contraction to a wall singularity. Like a senoto, but for similar size. And you have these three wall singularities, this is my W. And now you can prove in this situation that there are no structures and you have the W T and this is id square one pg equals q equals zero and simply the net. So that is the way you So that is the way you work with these surfaces. Now let me take the diagram. I will put it here to explain something. So we have an S that has no minus one error. These are the V1s that set in the set, minus one. That you can contrar to a smooth one. Contract to a smooth one. So like D2. And then here we have an intermediate surface. There are some blow-ups. There are some blow-ups. By the way, something critical here also is to prove that the canonical class is positive. So this is one, even zero, but also you need to prove that the intersection of canonical class with any complex With any complex curve in the singular surface, it's possible. This is not for free. Typically, you don't have this. You do the wrong co-ops, you don't have that. Now, it is funny that this is not necessary. You might have that this is negative, but still you can modify this to get another example that works. Anyway, with this, we are good for the double T and then blow up together. And then blow up to get this x. This x is going to be the minimum resolution of the singularities in value. The singularities that you can solve is this minimum resolution of all singularities. So when you place all of these points by these wall chains, remember that this has only one singularities. My x or By x, so these are non-singular surfaces, this is singular, and maybe we have a Wt, which is a complex project surface. But this is very difficult to obtain when you have a way around doing this rational go down. It's typically this W is going to have obstructions, and when you have obstructions, Obstructions, and when you have obstructions, it's very difficult to know if we have a complex deformation, a complex smoothie or not. But in any case, you always have the rational lockdown, and so you get a simple. Now say that this W has canonical plus again, up. So maybe I will write it like Maybe I could write it like k squared is bigger than zero and kw dot uh any curve here is positive. Say that we have that. Then theorem, let me compute y, so this is going to be y is a minimum. So since this is positive, you can prove that this y is a minimum. you can prove that this y is a minimal simplect. And moreover, this is important for the following, if the fundamental group of y is trivial and say that we know that the intersection for is all. Or then we can use treatment to say that y, or maybe I will write it, then it will write. Then why is an exotic then while he's done? is an exonic 2 chi over w minus 1 go up then I have w minus k square w minus 1 c d to y. Okay, so this since this is so this is bigger than zero and remember that the k squared is also bigger than zero so from from there you know that we have this restriction one smaller of equal than kw squared smaller of equal 10. And actually you can replace And then and actually you can replace this by one plus pg because q is zero, this is simply connected, so you get ten pg and then ten minus one nine, but this is three, so we ask what we ask. Okay, so this is this is the relation with the KSBA surfaces, and now And now I will concentrate on the following. So here inside you have the minimum resolutions for each of these singularities. We call that the exceptional divisor. So simple ACT. This is the sum of all the wall chains. All the wall chains. Okay. Contracted. Then something that happens is that when you apply pi to this collection of chains, you get a configuration of rational curves that is not empty here. Observation. I mean, it has to be proved. It's not clear maybe at the beginning, but you can prove that observation. The image of the exceptional So the exception of I is known actually of rational curves and also we know what to expect as tests and then we have the following options Options for S and S can be one rational. So, like in this case. So, in this case, you can contract the nine sections, maybe if it's minus one, the next, and then other seven to get to P2. And in P2, you will. And in P2 you will see the image of this configuration as two cubics and three lines and nothing else. So and these are a singular as you see and also some fine intersection sometimes. A rational could be B two or a Hilson blue surface. Two K3 or a green B surface. Or unread surface. So this is collider type, this is collider type minus infinity, collider type 0, collider type 1. Here we have analytic vibration of a P1, some gradularity for S P0. And four, this is the hardest case, S would be of general type. General type. But again, you know, without any restriction on the attribute, this general type and all of these other surfaces have irregularity zeros. So general type with irregularity zero. And also, we add that the canonical. We found that the canonical class square is strictly smaller than canonical class of square of canonical. So for example, if you have this famous Horikawa problem and try to get a new generation like that, then for Horikawa, I use problem and check the block of Johnny for that. Lot of johnny for that. Then we need to work with exactly this case. Just to give an example. Okay, so now we will concentrate on the rational case because I need to prove the theorem that mentioned. So from now on. So from now on And also at the end I want to show you something from my computer five minutes any product S is rational and so because of that you know since this is this is rational this is one so we have a blowout of two so why this and suddenly And suddenly blow up at a certain number of points, two. And for us, this number of points is between one and two. Now what is known about the examples that are exotic with respect to the load of peak to atman point? So for we know we have examples. We know we have examples. I mean, no, we everyone. We all have examples. Or n euro equal than 2 is still open, n equals to 1. There is no a single example. Any technique, no rational loaddown. And then we have examples. Examples, yeah, rational down for any n bigger of equal than 5. For n equals 5, so that is why the theorem of this new example in this the contraction of these um exotic blow-ups be a rational codup. It would be very nice to have a machine giving you like Have a machine giving you like KSVA surfaces for fixing bias, but it's not like that, it's very sad or very difficult. I will explore that in a moment. But for n equals to 5, there are very few, very few, like not even 10 means, very few outputs. Yeah, much of them with co-breaks. Some of them with complex structures. Jan Carlo, okay, before you relate to that part, what is your assumption on S? Sorry, what is that? What is the condition on S when you start from net S? There are no S, there are no minus 1, but this is like a bottom line from. This by is a composition of logdowns. This S doesn't have any minus 1 trade. And so only conditions? And for only conditions? So it's not really a condition, it's like the end. I will, you know, in here the configurations of rational curves might get too complicated. And so I prefer to work in a certain block with a certain configuration of rational curves. That is why I have this. But this is the end of the talk now. So very few examples. Any more examples of n equals five? They come from this viewing. There are very few examples when n is equal to five. And they're complex, not just in fact. Yeah, some of them are complex. Paper by Jung Ye and Park and Park and Dong Su Chin in geometry and topology. I don't remember the year of the South. I don't remember the year 2008, maybe, so where they construct two examples. Two examples of a W surface like this, with two singularities, where you don't have, like I know, where you don't have any obstructions, and the general fiber is a exotic block of so this is a general type surface with k squared equals to 4 and simply connect. So it's even better than that. It's even better. But in particular, it's a mix of it. Okay. Now, how to so the question is how to how to how to study these configurations of rational curves. By the way, rational curve means a curve that is studied Curve means a curve that is birational to P1s. You know, you have this chain of P1s, when you contract, there is a mess because they self-intersect, they create singularities. Like a configuration of singular P1. How to study rational configurations of curves that correspond to these exotic blow-ups. So, how to do this? So, how to do this? And also, what is the recipe to do the blow-ups? But first, I want to understand what kind of configurations, so what restrictions we have on the configurations of Russian code. And I'm going to organize information of configurations of curves here. Is yeah chain numbers. But now so you know churn numbers like for the projective case where you have the C1 and C2 and you have the churn numbers C1 square and C2 or your characteristic and self-intersection canonical class. But now you have the pair of your surface set and a configuration curve. Add a configuration first, say C1 up to CI. So, what is this? So, you have set, and inside you have this collection of marginal curves, but they might be very singular, each curve and also the intersection. Each curve and also the intersections. They intersect like this, and also tangent here, and something like that. And now there is always a log resolution of this configuration. Essentially, what you do is to blow up over the singular points until you get simple normal crossings, like nodes. But you don't blow up a point that is that is good, like that point, you don't blow up that. You only blow up on singular points. But you are allowed to do something like this, blow up a node. Something like this to have a node, it's not necessary, and then this is going to work anyway. But don't do I'm gonna point that this small. Then the numbers are going to change. And now you have this, and now this is like a device of any code, and put it like this. This is A, this is my resolution, and now I consider A prime, which is the pullback of this configuration. And so you include all the exceptional devices. But you know, when you pull back, you get multiplicities. So I eliminate the multiplicities. So it used a normal device. And now here you consider the omega 1 of setran, but with poles, simple poles on this device. Okay, this is the notation. So these are the So these are the one differentials with both that are simple on the device. This is to remember the device. By the way, this device is now simple normal crossing. That means all the curves are smooth and you have only this kind of simple. And then for that, locally free shift, to compute the chart numbers, we code it, we denote it with a bar so that we remember that we are talking about. In a row, an arrangement. And then you have two term classes, you square one of them, and the other one is an integer. And you can prove that this is just the self-intersection of canonical plus here plus this A prime squared, which is very similar. Before it was like this, this was empty. And then here you have the Euler characteristic of Z prime minus the Euler characteristic of the configuration. minus the characteristic of the configuration. So these are going to be bar. These are going to be my churn numbers for the configuration. Now what happens even in for projected surfaces is that when these churn numbers, say that you do a portion and this is high, then the to find a surface when this high uh is kind of difficult. But there is a difficulty. If this is low, it's easier. If this is low, it's easier. Like Horikawa surfaces are easy to even classify because the churn is low, it's very low. But when you go high, like to the Pogonomi Yape Yao line, they are very difficult to construct. They are even rigid when you hit the Pogonomi-Yape Yao line. So something similar happens. There is no a complete reason why this A complete reason why this is happening. Why high means hard, low means you can do it. We try that with configurations, and the same happens. So let me give you an example of that. An algorithm next. So say that you start with each of my S. And now inside I consider an arrangement of lines. So you know for lines the singularities that you have or arrangements are these multiple points, ten points, we call them. You know, and you have only that kind of point and and then you can also the number of points. We denote the number of points for a given arrangement here. And then, okay, then you resolve here very simple. You take all the endpoints for n equal 0 equal to 3 and you draw up just once for each point. And you put it like this. And now here you pull back so you get all the lines and all the exception over. The lines and all the exceptions of the endpoints, and that is the A prime. And now you compute, and you will find out that this number is exactly 9 minus 5B. And then the other one is this. minus one plus minus one can be good whatever. I have worked a lot with lines, that is why the numbers is fun. And then, so you see that these numbers depend on the symbolic that you have, like here we have the endpoints, and the number of ones. And the number of ones. Then you can prove that if TR is equal to TR minus 1 equal to 0, that means that you don't want to have the TVR arrangement, like all lines passing through one point. This is TR equals to 1. Or you also don't want to have the quasi-trivial arrangement. Almost everyone through one point and then just. Almost everyone through one point, and then just one nine. So no. This means no those. Then the C1 square, C2 bar are bigger than zero, so you can consider the slope. And the slope lives in this interval. 1, 3. Now it's not difficult to prove that that slope lives in that interval. Leaves in that interval, this tree is not because of Pawonome Yaga Yao. This is combinatoria. And you know, you translate these three as the number of endpoints is always bigger or equal than the number of lines. It's exactly so if you are here, it's exactly because this is equal. Because this is equal like this. So here you have seven special points, so this is seven, and R is six, strictly. To have equality, then you need to be in characteristic that is not zero. You need characteristic P. So you take the projective plane, characteristic P, and consider all lines. Consider all lines and compute, you get that this is equal to that, and it's if and only if. This is combinatorial. This is also combinatorial, and when you are one, you are exactly in this configuration. Now, you wonder well, what happens over the complex numbers, and then over the complex numbers, you have 8 over 3 here, which is 2.6 periodic, and you can be only in this, this is over 6. This is already C. But here you have the volume, the log bolomaro and the update. And you are exactly at this point, if and only if, you are one configuration of lines, which is a dual arrangement. More or less, what is happening is that if your arrangement is kind of very special, you don't have any parameters. Really special, you don't have any parameters, then you tend to be tend to be high on slope. And when you are genetic, then you tend to be in this slope. The limit point for generic arrangements is exactly two. Here you have something discrete. A cubel is to two. So that is the picture for that. And okay. So why we care then about this Is dangerous because you can chase, you can encode the problem of finding these exotic logs in these log numbers. So we can write KC1 square1 C2. Remember that we have a configuration of lash arrays, so we want to know if this because we want to know if it's suitable to construct an exotic block of C D two. You can rewrite using these numbers the information of Pw square, the number of curves you have here, the number of singularities, etc. And then you get a series restrictions like this and we put one. So for example, so by the way I have a PDF with all of this I can send that into this up here and we we work out this in the preprint also so the self-intersection of of the canonical class for A new is always less or equal than twelve minus the third minus the third L minus R over three. You know, this is the number of rational curves, this is the number of singularities, this is the k square you want, and this is 9 minus the number of points. So you want that to be high if you want the viewpoint. The minus one of the case. So, for example, if you are on an elliptic vibration, this is zero. It's not there. And then plus, and this is an open window to have examples. Okay, let me explain this. Okay, so here I consider set and inside a configuration of R rational first. First, the same R here, here. This is Z, this is the configuration, L, wall singularities, this is K squared, and with only M points, as singularities. Only M points. But here there is a zero, and this means that over that end point, you count so what happens is the following thing. You might have an end point like this, you go up. Endpoint like this, you go up, something like that, but now you don't want to use this P1. Not used. If it's not used, then it's a contribution for T0M. And that is really good because then this bound allows you to increase the P squared, in principle. Because we want to have high K squared. But at the same time, you see that L, the number of singularities, should be small. So there are wise to So the wise to decrease a lot. And there is an equilibrium with R. Because at the end you can write down, for example, R in terms of this and that. And then you realize that R has to be large. And then when you are, if you want to have K squared high, that means very few points, then you need very long walls in wall chains. Very, very long. Maybe now I can show you. Or maybe now I can show you. And then there are other restrictions, like obstruction to deformations, to complex deformations, that you find after the number of points is smaller than or equal to 4. You need to have obstructions. And then you can see that also in the image. And there are some other things that. Let me show you. But then you put everything. So. So then you put everything. So what we did was to write an algorithm that includes all of that information. And then in the algorithm, you give a configuration of rational clothes, say in the plane. And then you give that to the computer, say with twenty rational clothes. And then the computer start to And then the computer starts to consider all possible sub-configurations and then all possible blocks for those configurations until you reach what you want. So for example here, you can see that we are trying to find case value for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. 9 is not possible. 8. And with a certain number of singularities. And then we have found, so this is for a particular So this is for a particular here you have elliptic so these are the elliptic configuration the elliptic fibers of elliptic configurations that are special. So for example the first one is a 99 and then 3i1. That is very special. No parameters. And we consider several rational curves. Or this is the other one that we put in the paper, 2i4 and then 2i2. It's also very special. There are no parameters. So let me go to this configuration. So let me go to this configuration, to this elliptic vibration, and then I told you that for k squared equals to 4, there were two examples with complex structures, and then a few others that do not have, we don't know if there are complex structures. Now, so here you have, so this is here each line is one example, and the NNA for the wall chain, this is what you see there. Chain, this is what you see there, 37, 10. We consider only two chains because, as you saw, if you want to be special, then you need very few singularities, so one maybe or two singularities. Here you have two singularities. And these are the lengths, eight, so that means eight rational curves. When you consider the wall, the corresponding wall chain. And here you have the other one, you have the GCD. The GCD. GCD is very good. GCD between the indices is very good to compute from the metal. That is why we have. Then you check that the canonical class is there, you're effective. Those are to check that the canonical class is ample, for example. And here you have an index that you put in another program to give you the complete picture, geometric picture, with all the curves. You you have like hundreds of examples. And when you see that obstruction zero is yes, then you have a complex structure. WH is one call, but that is another. And then, let me finish by showing you. So here we have hundreds. You know the length of the chains increases, so it's like The chains increases, though it's like a metro station, metro system, like with several, it's very complicated. The key question here is how you can guarantee from a configuration that satisfies everything that we want to have an example. That is something that we don't know how to answer. And then you go to the case for the file, very few. So immediately you go from So immediately you go from hundreds to very short list. And from this very short list are the examples that we put in the page. In case you want to verify something about that example, I can explain. One of the examples that we completely verify has eight lines and two conics, nothing else. It's all about how they intersect. And also, And also, you see this strange B0014. These are singularities that are need smoothing with minimal number zero, but are not wall singularities. Are degeneralized. In order that there is a conjecture that these are all weighted homogeneous singularities, and there is a list. Those are from that list with three legs. You have three legs and four legs. Three legs. If you have three legs and four legs, we only search for three legs. So they come from T singularity? These are not T singularities. These are not even not canonical. These are from the rest of the singularity. Not T. So we have wall singularities like here. And then this other QST that were the you have minim sor the minimum resolutions look like this. So one of them could be type B, where the length of this part is zero, the other length is zero, and the down length is one. And the self-intersection of the middle curve is four minus one. And you see that for the global at four points, we also have examples with those in okay, that's it. So now you have the unoticolance with k square equals five. How about k square equals six? No, not yet. That is a problem. We don't know how to We don't know how to construct a configuration of rational case. We know how to do it combinatorially, but not really, we don't have a realization of that yet. Do you have any pictures of these configurations between one? Let me see if I can.  Here you have it. So this starts, so this is like this. You start with that configuration, then you have the curves from the singular fibers, which are 12. And then you have eight sections and no more. And then you have four particular double sections that are passing from through this T1, T2, P1, T2, forming these multiple points. And then the computer. And then the computer searches for sub-configurations in all possible robots. And then you find something like this. Here we use almost all singular fibers. And this fiber we don't use one of them quite. And then two sections and one narrow section. So it's not very complicated. There you have the drop-ups. And the walls in the ID. The balls in the ID. So one of them is file 2 only, and the other one is this. Right again, uh 35. Uh 35.
