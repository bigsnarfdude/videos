Thank you very much. So the title is on the screen and Matt is on the university. Thanks a lot. And thank you to the organizers for the invitation. It's been a pleasure being here in Granada, getting to see some familiar faces and also meeting some new ones. Okay, so I'm going to be talking about Lagrangian solution to the porous media equation and also some friends, I guess. So let me just get into why I To why I got interested in trying to find Lagrangian solutions. And so, something that I've been thinking about a lot in the last two or three years or so are math models for cell growth. So, it could be bacteria in a petri dish like you see here, or it could be tumors. And in particular, you know, one of the most interesting things that can happen is you can get some sort of very strange shapes. And so, you know, trying to And so, you know, trying to understand the evolution of this free boundary is a really interesting problem. So, the models that I've been thinking about are these PDE models for cell and tumor growth. And they've been around since the 70s or so. And there's been a huge literature from the math community on these models, including a lot of people who are here. And so, the way we're going to think about this is the cells, we're sort of thinking of them as a most Cells, we're sort of thinking of them as a mostly incompressible fluid with some density rho. So we're really looking at things at a macroscopic scale. They have some growth rate G, and because the cells themselves are kind of incompressible as they grow, they're going to push against each other, this forms of pressure, and the cells are pushed down this pressure gradient. And so essentially what you have is this evolution equation, which is coming from basically Darcy's law, right? So you have Darcy's law, and basically this thing is the Poros Media equation. This thing is the Poris Media equation, where you have some source term which is accounting for the growth of the cells. And the pressure density couplings that I'm going to be caring about today are sort of this classical coupling. And then also the gamma to infinity limit. And this is where you actually start to encode real incompressibility of this cell density. So when you send gamma to infinity in that first relation, you really will get incompressibility that the cell density. Uh, incompressibility that the cell density has to stay below one everywhere. Um, okay, so I mean, there are still a lot of challenges with this equation, but in some sense, we have a relatively good understanding of a lot of things that are going on. Um, where things get a lot more interesting are with these multi-species models. Um, and so these are sort of the systems of reaction diffusion equations that other people have been talking about, in particular. Other people have been talking about. In particular, Marcus was looking at a very similar system of equations, except that he was talking about Brinkman's law. And here, I'm going to be talking about Darcy's law. And so, what's going on here is now I want to just think about potentially different cell populations. So I could have different species of bacteria or something that's very relevant for cancer modeling. I could have healthy cells and I could have tumor cells. And obviously, they're going to be growing differently. Obviously, they're going to be growing differently. And the important thing is that the pressure in the system only cares about the total density. So I have these individual populations rel high, but the pressure is only seeing this total density where I sum these two things together. And so in this model, I'm going to be talking about there's going to be two populations, but as soon as you go to two populations, two or more are all kind of just similarly difficult. Of just similarly difficult, so as soon as you have more than one, that's when things get really hard. Going beyond that doesn't really matter very much. Um, and so we sort of saw in Marcus's presentation, right, that you can actually have sort of these sharp boundaries between different species. And essentially, this equation one is just it's not a nice equation, it's hyperbolic, right? The this the population The population and the pressure are not connected in any way. And so you don't have any regularization. And so, if you want to get nice things, you basically have to sum over the populations. And then you get back to this sort of porous media equation where now the density and the pressure are coupled. And so you do at least have something parabolic, even though it may be very degenerate, singular, whatever. But at least it is better than this equation one, which is. Better than this equation one, which is really horrible. Of course, you haven't completely lost the horrible things because these individual densities are still hidden in this growth rate G. Okay. And so I'm not going to say much about exactly what these g i's are. If you wanted, you can even imagine that they are constants. But in general, they can be quite complicated. They could even be coupled back into some of the other. Some of the other variables that's very relevant for modeling. But the point is that even in this equation, even if you say these GIs are super nice, this G is going to be very bad because it has these bad variables inside of it, encoding the individual populations. So, again, the individual populations are bad, and that made even constructing solutions to this system quite different. So, in some sense, it's been done. There's this whole series of papers. So, I've sort of highlighted two different colors. And so, these first two are in situations where things are a little bit nicer. In the first one, you just don't have a free boundary. So, you assume that the density is bounded away from zero everywhere. In this case, you don't actually have a free boundary. And in that case, this equation is super nice and that makes things a lot easier. Is super nice and that makes things a lot easier. And then in this other case, you're in 1D, and that also makes certain other things easier. And then more recently, there have been papers that have given existence for sort of the general setting. And it's literally just existence. So basically, we don't know anything else. We don't know well posedness, right? Just existence of global weak solutions. And the way that, you know, And the way that these last four papers basically work, and this is again similar to what Marcus was talking about, is this last equation is nice. And so you can try to get some good information on the pressure. You can try to get strong compactness for that variable. And if you have strong compactness for the pressure and then just weak compactness for everything else, you can still pass the limit in this first equation. Okay, so. Okay, so the issue is you get information about the pressure, but if you want to say something about these densities, you don't know anything non-linear about them because they're just converging weakly. And so in particular, I don't know anything about this product. And so there's been this very important open question, which is: if these populations start out separated at initial time, can they sort of mix together in space? Of mixed together in space, or in other words, if I know that this product was zero at initial time, is it going to be zero throughout the entire evolution? And to try to answer this question, this is where Lagrangian solutions can come in. And basically, the reason for this is if I know this Lagrangian flow map, I know all of the cells are just flowing down this pressure gradient, then I essentially know everything. Then I essentially know everything about the equation. And if I know that this flow map is invertible, then what I can always do is at some time one, I can look backwards into the past and ask, where did the things at this particular location come from? And I go back into the past, and if they all came from a region that was just one population, then that region in space can only contain one population. Right? So as soon as I have a logo. So, as soon as I have a Lagrangian flow map and I know it's invertible, then in fact, I've answered this mixing question. Okay, so one way to try to say mixing cannot happen is by constructing these flow maps and showing that they're inverter. Okay, well, this question was open. So, obviously, something must go wrong. And so, let's just try to see. Let's just try to see when our Lagrangian flow is well posed. Okay. And essentially, the key piece of information that you need to know is if I want to construct the flow along some vector field B, basically I need to know some spatial regularity of this vector field B. And right, there's sort of this very interesting history of this problem. And basically, no matter what, you need some information on one full spatial derivative of your velocity. And so, sort of this result by Ambrosio, which is very well known, is as long as you have some B V regularity of your vector fields, that is good enough to construct Lagrangian flows that are well posed. You can invert them. All of that's great. All of that's great. Actually, even since then, there's been a lot of activity in this problem, and it's been pushed further than this in certain directions. But in a certain sense, this is quite close to being shark in the sense that if you try to change it just a little bit, you can actually start getting some things that are not logos. So, there are some directions in which you can push this further, and there are sort of some. This is further, and there are sort of some where you cannot. And so, let's just try to understand what will happen in the case of the porous media equation. And in fact, everything I'm going to say here holds for the most classical version of the porous media equation, not even this more complicated version that we saw with the multiple species. And essentially, the reason for this is If you look at a bearing black profile for the pressure, I mean, basically, it's always going to look something like this. And so, at these points where the pressure transitions from positive to zero, it's not a smooth transition. And so, if you calculate second derivatives of the pressure, you're always going to have a problem at the free boundaries, even for a barren black solution. Solution. And so, in particular, what you can show is that the Laplacian of the pressure is always a singular measure. It's a singular measure that's concentrating at this free boundary. And even though your Laplacian is a measure, that does not tell you that the pressure gradient is in BV. And in fact, there's this very, very recent paper by Nguyen, which shows that in this same sort of generic regularity class, Sort of generic regularity class, which is saying that your vector field, or sorry, the derivative of your vector field is the Riesz transform of a measure, well posedness of Lagrangian flows can fail. And in fact, the example that he calculates, you have a failure of uniqueness. And if you have a failure of uniqueness, you're not going to have an inverse map. And so essentially, Essentially, we cannot use any of this existing theory to try to construct Lagrangian solutions. And in fact, this existing theory tells us that if we try to rely on regularity alone, it just can't be true because we have things in the same regularity class where this fails. And so, what that means is if we have any hope of constructing Lagrangian flows for this equation, we have to be able to. Equation, we have to somehow be using a lot of extra information that the porous media equation has. Okay, so let me just tell you what the main results are. So you can do this. You can construct Lagrangian flows. And so in particular, you can find a solution where you can construct the Lagrangian flow along the pressure. And once you do that, it's well posed, it's invertible. That it's well posed, it's invertible, and so you know that things cannot mix. And so, this is first in this case where the pressure is given by this classical porous media equation law. And then I also want to see what can happen in the incompressible case. And essentially, that's going to be sending this parameter gamma to infinity. Then I get the incompressible coupling. And so, if everything And so, if everything that I needed for this theorem to be true, if all of those estimates are essentially uniform in the parameter gamma, then I will also be able to say that this is true in the incompressible case. And it turns out the only extra thing that you need to add in the incompressible case is you have to say that your growth rates are strictly positive. So, otherwise, I would say that all of the assumptions that we have are basically. That we have are basically the ones that you would be happy to accept as a modeler, but maybe a modeler would not like the fact that you have to have strictly positive growth rates. But in fact, if the growth rate can ever turn negative in the incompressible case, then actually the mixing is false. So this is not an assumption you can get away with. And the reason for that is if I start off with two populations like this, one of them dies and the other one's growing, then actually the And the other one's growing, then actually, the growing one is going to invade and do something like this. And this is actually something that's special to the incompressible case. Okay, so those are the two main results. And I'll try to use the next 10 minutes to give a very short sketch of how some of this works, or at least one of the main ideas. And so, again, we know that we have to use something beyond generic regularity, we have to use Beyond generic regularity, we have to use something that's special to the force media equation. And the force media equation is a nice equation. There is a lot more structure that we can try to use. And so if we take this equation and we rewrite it in terms of only the pressure using this coupling relation, then we get this very nice equation for the pressure only. And in fact, And in fact, you can use this equation to see that this object is bounded. So, in fact, the pressure times the Hessian squared is bounded. And if we just had the Hessian squared, we didn't have that annoying pressure factor, then we would be done because we could just apply all of that theory that we already saw. But of course, you need that pressure to be there because we know that the bad things. Because we know that the bad things are happening right at the free boundary. And so this pressure is essentially killing the bad part of the second derivative here. So that factor is absolutely essential. You can't get rid of it. Okay, so what we could actually then just try to ask instead is, well, maybe trajectories never see the bad part of the pressure. So if I'm a Lagrangian trajectory and I never go near. And I never go near the points where things are bad. If I stay in a high-pressure region, then I essentially don't see the fact that there's this P here. And so for a trajectory that stays away from the free boundary, I could just try to use the existing Lagrangian flow here. And so that's what we're going to try to do. We're going to try to just see, can we prove that trajectories should stay away from the free boundary? So that's our key question. So that's our key question. And so essentially, the object that we want to look at is we want to look at the pressure composed with a trajectory. And again, these trajectories are just flowing down the pressure gradient. Well, I'm trying to say that they stay away from the free boundary. So in some sense, the fact that they're flowing down the pressure gradient is bad because they're trying to go to low pressure regions. That's what this equation says, right? But on the other hand, these trajectories are. But on the other hand, these trajectories are carrying mass with them. So, yes, they go down to a lower pressure region, but when they do that, the pressure in that region should go up. And so, if we just try to think heuristically, is it reasonable that we could try to control the pressure along trajectories? You can't do it heuristically because you have these competing effects, right? It's really not clear what you have. And so, we do the only thing that we know how to do. That we know how to do, which is we just hit it with a derivative and try to see what happens. So I differentiate this quantity, I get the time derivative of the pressure, and then I have to differentiate inside of the map. So I get the gradient dotted with what's going to be the velocity field. And of course, that is the negative pressure gradient. And so what I get is that this time derivative is equal to dtp minus gravity. Is equal to dtp minus grad p squared. But that's exactly what you have in this pressure equation, right? So if I just rewrite it so that I have certain things on each side, then this is our pressure equation. And what I see is that the pressure along trajectories, the time derivative of the pressure along trajectories, is the pressure along the trajectories times this quantity W, which is coming from these red things. Okay. And so if I can get a lower bound on this W, then I can use Grunwald's inequality to try to control how close am I getting to B free boundary. But of course, this W is quite complicated. So it turns out that these estimates on this quantity are something that people have looked at for. Are something that people have looked at for a long time. And it's something known as the Aronson-Bennelin estimate when you try to bound W from below. And this original paper from 1999 was looking at the classic porous media equation. So there's no growth term G, right? It's just what we're used to seeing. But for non-trivial G's, if you want to try to bound this quantity, the regularity of G matters. And that sounds very bad. That sounds very bad for this multi-species case. Because, like I told you guys a couple of slides ago, there are bad things hiding inside of G in the multi-species case, because I have these bad variables that are only solving hyperbolic equations. Okay, so what can you do? There's this paper by Vyazda Pratam and Sveajushka Vyazda, where they showed that in a multi-species case, showed that in the multi-species case you could bound things you could get this uh you could bound the negative part of this quantity w in l2 except it wasn't uniform in this parameter gamma and again we would like to pass to the incompressible limit and they actually had very strong assumptions on the growth terms it turns out if you're willing to throw in a weight that is decaying to zero at a very slow rate near the free boundary um then you can in fact uh Can in fact get bounds that are going to be uniform in this parameter gamma. And so that will allow you to pass the limit. I don't want to say anything else about these AV estimates. They're kind of a pain. You just integrate by parts for a very long time. Okay, so we have some control on W, but it's not uniform, right? We just have an L2 bound. And so we can't use a classic version of grown-walls in a A classic version of Grom-Waul's inequality, but there are these logarithmic versions of Gron-Waul's inequality that I think, for whatever reason, don't seem to be very well known in the literature. At least it's really hard to find a textbook that has these written down. So if anybody knows a textbook that has these inequalities written down, I would greatly appreciate it. So essentially, you have an equation like this where we would like to use growing. Like this, where we would like to use Gronwaw, but this coefficient a is not l infinity, it's just in some Sobolev space. And it turns out that what you can do in that case is you can bound logarithms. And just one way to see this is if you divide the equation on both sides by f, then I can integrate the left-right-hand side. And I can get these logarithmic numbers. So, what does this tell me? Tell me in this case, it tells me this. I can control the logarithm of one plus one over the pressure evaluated at trajectories. And I can bound that in terms of initial data. So this is telling me something about how trajectories see the free boundary. For example, all of the trajectories cannot rush to the free boundary. That's impossible. Possible, but any individual trajectory can definitely spend time near the free boundary, right? This inequality does not prevent that whatsoever. And the second I have a trajectory that goes near the free boundary, I could potentially use lose uniqueness and I won't be able to improve. So this sort of nice strategy that I tried to sketch out at the beginning, which is let's just hope that trajectories don't go near the free boundary, that doesn't work. That doesn't work. And so, in the last few minutes that I have, let me just give a very, very fast sketch of what does work. And what does work is this combining these ideas with a different approach to Lagrangian flows by Crepa and Dewellis. And actually, a lot of the action in Lagrangian flows. A lot of the action in Lagrangian flows has been based on, a lot of the recent action in Lagrangian flows has been based on this idea. So, what do you do? You want to construct a flow along some vector field. You take a smooth approximation. You know you have flows along that thing. And then finally, the hard step is that when you pass to the limit, you just want to show that you have some strong compactness. You need strong compactness to get the flow equation in the room. And what they were able to show. And what they were able to show is if you look at these weird logarithmic integrals, you can bound them. And what this thing is, it's sort of measuring the continuity of this flow map. And if you can control this thing, it's enough for equicontinuity. So why this logarithm? Well, it's actually for exactly those log grown wall reasons that I showed you before. That I showed you before. Those law-Gronwal inequalities are also relevant in Lagrangian flows. And so it turns out that I have these two ingredients that mesh together perfectly because they both sort of like these logarithmic quantities. So, what is the thing that we end up looking at? It's actually a doubly logarithmic quantity. So this. So, this is the logarithmic quantity of CREPA and Dilelis that you saw on the last slide. That's trying to measure equicontinuity of your flow maps. The way that I actually bound these quantities is by taking time derivatives and showing a control time derivative. So, when a time derivative hits this, I'm going to get the pressure gradient. And this is why you need to control spatial derivatives of the pressure gradient, because I'm going to get. Gradient because I'm going to get pressure gradient evaluated at a point minus pressure gradient evaluated at another point, and I need to say something about how I can control that. Okay, so why do I have these outer logarithms? I mean, it's essentially because this inner thing is like one plus the derivative of the flow map. If I take time derivatives of that, I get the Hessian of the pressure, which is bad. I get the Hessian of the pressure, which is bad. But if I had a factor of P, then I'm going to get P times the Hessian of the flow, sorry, the pressure. That's good. And so if I have this factor of P attached to this thing, then time derivatives of this are good. Then I need this outer logarithm because one of my time derivatives is going to hit P and I can only get Gronwall things related. Get Gronwal things related to P in a logarithmic sense, and that's why you need this outer logarithm. Okay, so I know that this end was sort of very hand-wavy and sketchy, but happy to talk about it offline for any questions, and I'll stop there. Thank you. So, I'll have questions. I have one little question. What about making approximation at the level of the equations? By regularizing some terms? What would you recover, for instance, by smoothing a little bit the row to the gamma? Oh, sorry, smoothing rho to the gamma, like let's have one. Oh, yeah, I mean, so, okay. Right. Right. Let's see. Did I write? So, in fact, our strategy is to work through smooth solutions first. So, we just find a smooth solution to this, which actually you just do by pushing everything up so that you don't have a free boundary and you're bounded away from zero. And then the trick is just how you show that you can pass to the limit. Yeah, and so essentially, you have to deal with, in some sense, you have to deal with these things. Any other questions? Yeah, I have not at least wrong, actually. I don't know. Can you try to make this use this strategy? So then you would have like extra like the two populations against each other. It's not very far from this. Yeah. This I yeah, so I was originally going to try to do that in this paper, and then it was already very long and complicated. So it's okay. But I think it should be doable. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So no other questions. I'm sure we had a lot of questions.
