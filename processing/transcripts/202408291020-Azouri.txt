I'll just add a quote part of the. Add a closed part within a universe. And that closed part with a hotel model. So that's why just tell me now this is exactly the screen answer. Right. This is what I'm going to call it. Yes. Numerous geometers. Let us reconvene. All right. We are very happy to have Rana Zuri, who will tell us on quadratic about onquadratic Dalton Thomas invariants. Hey, so I'm also very happy to be here, and thank you for the invitation. Well, this talk will be a survey of some loosely related works that somehow can be related to this title. So I'll start maybe like Adil mentioned parents' work. So I'll start with. Start with this. So, say that we have X is some DM stuck embedded in some smooth ambient space then. Um then Berend in Spain 2009 had the following diagram so um well first the world First, there were constructible functions on X. Then there were Lagrangian cycles on omega n supported on X. The sum isomorphism between these groups. Here we have the degree zero change parts of Philson class, and here we have And here we have the intersection with the zero section to child zero homology group. Then we have the degree map to the integers. Now, this diagram is commutative. Here we have Some special object, the obstruction cone to the normal cone, the red is bad. Ah, the red is bad. Okay. Traffic. These correspond. This corresponds to some constructible function here. And then we have the following equality. This Schwarzme-Philson class of this function is equal to this the virtual fundamentals. The virtual fundamental class of X. Of course, I forgot to mention that X has to have a symmetric abstraction theory. Or in other words, it's a minus one shifted symplectic stack. Then we can take degree map in both sides and get that the Euler characteristic of X weighted by these parents back here. Weighted by B squared power equals the degree of the virtual fundamental class, and that being the dt invariable of X. So far, M has not played a role yet, right? Right, but I mean, it plays a role in the construct. This is omega M. M, of course, yeah, yeah, because M M is the small. Yeah, thank you. But okay, and then we have this equality. Now, the aim of the talk will be to describe quadratic refinements for some things. Refinements for some things in this diagram. Zero for sheet is what? So zero, what does zero per sheet mean? Intersection with the zero section. Yes, of X embeds in M, and then Maybe pulling back all the from M and then back to the X, I guess. Yeah, the zero section of X and so on. Okay, so the goal is to describe is to describe describe quadratic refinements or some aspects of this diagram. Well, so basically it gives us two routes to define those detail variants, right? One way is having this stable normal column, taking this root like this, and the other root is through here. It's through here, which eventually becomes this weighted Euler characteristic. Now, yeah, I'm not an expert on enumerative geometry or detain variants, so I'm very happy to speak in this forum, and I'd be happy to have comments and corrections. Well, so let's see, just looking at this diagram, let's see what we Diagram, let's see what we need. Some of it was already discussed. Okay, so by a quadratic refinement, placing child by child tiny. By child tilde not just adding tilde but in a meaningful way or sometimes perhaps or in general In TV for a moment theory ask her to make sure that we have all the pieces of this diagram in place. I question if you want this, X is the zero locus of a section of omega M. Can you do that in this situation? You don't need it. I don't have one. Yeah, no, I mean, just that it has a symmetric construction. Okay, so one way it could get a minus one shift and symmetric construction would be if it were the zero locus of the fraction of omega. But you don't require that. Well, I mean, if it was a critical locus of something that would be awesome. Well, yeah, that's the same as being a such. Yeah. So so far I don't require, but when I require that. But when I require that I will say that. Say something about how it can be. Well, okay. So let's see what components of this we already have and what fast. So maybe first. This degree map will be replaced by this quadratic degree map, and this was already discussed. I think this quadratic theory model Okay, I did forget one thing, and that is that X is proper. That is the protein featuring failed because characteristics. So this is just proper push forward in oral homotopy and homology. And the other thing is the quadratic Euler characteristic. That's also been discussed. I take the version with compact support to be able to define it on singular schemes anymore as far as So did you say why the cur assumption about characteristics is zero? I don't need it for this degree map. I will just yes, just in most of the discussion, I will need it for this side of the motor. And then, what I will discuss today is first a motivic degree zero John Schwartz McPherson class. That is this thing. Then T V Virtual Fundamental Class And that way, some definition of a quadrature. Some definition of a quadratic data invariant and then kind of motivic viewpoint of the parent function, so kind of motivic parent function. Function which will lead to some maybe alternative. Okay, so that's that's the plot so I start with this. So due to me and independently Jing Sun Yang So first, so here I need the characteristic zero, so matter. X would be a variety of our field of characteristic zero. And suppose that we have a class defined for every smooth X. Facts I just say the following. Let E in SHK be the public blue spectral This defines a motivic, what I call emotivology. Commutative, yeah, when I say means, but infinite, commutative, yeah. Emotiv borel moromology. Just now, if you don't know what this means, just think of having some oral morphology like this child. Then, suppose that we have a class E of x, which is the Euler class of the tangent bundle x for a smooth x inside this. is oral model of x, which we do have. This also depends on the theory. And we wish to extend it in a way that satisfies Kaplan H's, then there's this Bitten's theorem that allows to extend So, this extension will just depend on the values on smooth schemes, and of course, it has to satisfy. Of course, it it has to satisfy some relation, like cut and paste or some additivity over low-up squares. Anyway, so it's determined by two schemes. So the first possibility how to define the scheme is the same. How to define smooth schemes that then to extend. Option one is to take naught bar x to eat. No. I suppose that I mean just assume that will last longer. No, yeah, so the answer is no. No, yeah, so the answer is no. I have a class for every score. X, and I wish to extend it for a class for any X. Yes. So, option one: take this E of X and extend it. Of x and extend it take E of x for random coordinates with x and extend and this is possible. And this is possible using Bittner's theorem. Yeah, using Bittman's theorem. This is possible and then we get some class for every motivic borel morphology. For example, if we take E to B, E to be KGL, the motiv spectrum representing K-theory, then we get a class G0 which is the class that was previously defined. The class that was previously defined by Boracelet. I'm still confused about it the setup because this says X, you get a class in G0 of X. Given the X, you get the G of X in G0 of X. What does that have to do with K0 of varieties over X? It factors through the K0 of varieties, meaning Note of varieties, meaning that it's a kind of a cut and paste invariant. Like if I have some y over x, that is the union of an open and closed. Z and W, then it's additive. It's additive. But it depends, and you apply this just to X, you can order variants of X to get to E. I mean, you can say for X, you get a class in G0X. But now you're saying for any Y, a variety over X, you get a class in G. Right. That's why I'm a little confused. Right. I'm a little confused. Right, yeah. Well, yeah, so well, but you can, I mean, you get the class if you take x over x here. Then you get the class, but it also expands the sample factoriality. So yeah. Yeah, so this is the Borel morphology defined here, defined by this spectrum, and this was defined previously by. Was defined previously by Rasale Schumann Actually, I'm still confused also about something like if if X is smooth then what is this map and you still need to define it on singular Yeah, so Bittenel's theorem tells you that it's enough just to consider like the just to consider smooth, like relatively smooth things over X. Smooth things proper X and then smooth and proper and then show some global petitivity. So there's some kind of push forward to X also. Like if X is a point, then you're saying take over the class of something over X, but then also push it forward to point. Yes. So you're using some covered superficial. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Yes. Well, okay, so that's what you get in this case, but you could also take Chow with homology group and get also a classic Chow Wheat homology. And the other option is following Adufi, old paper by Adufi. And that is for any X considering the following limits I also have to take limits. So LX embeds as an open sub-scheme. So E0 is still E0 for L4, or you just want to pick up the 0. E0 is E0 for L4. Okay. From now on. Okay. From now on. Um so this is open and that and that is properly used. Then, for a class for a spoon proper, how do you take the? I mean, the draw terminology is not controversial. Um but since I consider consider embeddings to proper prototype then I I do have I do have homology and pullback. Normal homology and pullback or C proper. Okay, maybe discuss it later because I thought you stratify the X to be small pieces and do that. Yeah, right, but I think I can define it for a X. X is it a limit or a copy? It's a limit? It's a limit. So let's say here to to be s uh safe, just uh in this thing we have X move because I don't really remember. But I think that it's I mean somehow Somehow, I mean, basically, through this Bittener's theorem, but it extends. But, well, anyway, yeah, I didn't want to spend much time on this because this is the least interesting part of all. Okay, so for sorry, so for X, Smooth, and Proca, I'll take the spoiler class on your class of X which will be the same. Will be the same as this. And for X move but not proper, it's enough to consider consider a bad. Beddings of X in Z, which is smooth and proper and the difference is a simple normal crossing. Simple normal crossing divisor to sum of the eyes over the system of proper push forms. And I guess you only need proper maps and exactly other Yes, well, yeah, I had to say that what the category is. The category is that I take like for Z and Z prime for which X and bet, I consider only the proper maps between Z and Z prime. Okay? Yes. Yes, so we've taken the functor of the pushboard. Okay, that's right, but just define the class E of X to be inside C. Side z an alternating sum plus z minus the sum from 1 to r This agrees with Alufi's definition when I take E to when I take E to be the HZ, like the spectrum representing childhood. Representing childhoods and it gives a refinement when I take it to be H C tilde, the motivic spectrum representing child meteor. Yeah, so this is then and I guess that option two is more verified from option one. Of course, one have to check that this is well defined. And Jin Soon Yang had a different approach to define this, but they defined the same class exactly. Then, well, so that's a kind of motivic degree zero CSM class. You could still take ULL characteristic of this by the motivic Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Get that degree of this class is the oral characteristic, typical characteristic of this operator. Does that require execute proper to take a degree or you get the degree match of executive property? Yeah, for a proper X, right? I would support it. Compactly supported all of the parameters on the call. Right. Yeah. It's the completely supported version, and let's also agree that I don't try don't use this C, it's always the completely supported version. Okay. So that was about that. Now about Motiv Virtual Fundamental class. Oh. Yeah, so again, it's like it's a survey, I don't give any details. So now X scheme that X embeds into some smooth M And admit a symmetric obstruction theory let CXM be the normal column where I is the sheet. Where I is the sheaf cutting X from M. Then after some spec of the spec on the IMR. Spec over OX of this side so after some simplifications The symmetric obstruction theory defines a closed embedding of this CXM into Into some vector bundle over x, where e is part of the data of the symmetric obstruction theory. And this is a locally free shift and it defines a vector bundle over x. So I'll denote this by k. Here I have the Here I have that zero section which I'll go up like this. Then Mark Levin defined first some object C state NSHK Based on what's basically the random motif of CSM shifted or twisted twisted Listed by the pullback of tangent boundaries of M so X six and uh a class is here.  Which is defined by some version of the formation of the normal cone. And then we get the definition of the virtual fundamental class of X to be a trick, okay-low star of these classes. Of these classes. In fact, it's defined for any perfect abstraction theory, not just a sequentially obstruction theory. And that's how we get a virtual fundamental classic. Well, well, so this should be here, and in the case that I'm considering of a symmetric. The case that I'm considering of a symmetric obstruction theory, in order to have no list here, require that is SL-oriented. Well, so we have, and in that way, we have a virtual fundamental class which I'll be And we can take this quadratic degree and get a definition of the quadratic detail variant of x. So this SL oriented is some extra data on your symmetric construction? No, it's it's an extra data on No, it's a it's an extra data on the on the homology theory. Uh I mean it's a condition on the homo homology theory um on the motivic spectrum. But this is satisfied for this theory. It's just some technical thing. I'm interested in this. Right? And then I I get this equal thing. Ring goes the base field. Green goes the base field. That's where the legs has to be proper to get the green field. Right, yeah. So, yeah, so again, I should say it's somewhere ex-progress. Even if you use SL-oriented build, you in general have some twist barriers on lineboard build protections? Yeah, if if you have a symmetric abstraction theory then the determinant, like the virtual determinant is zero, then you don't have this. I mean, th this is not trivial, but this is just part of the theory. Part of the theory, like the context, and then it was and then the rank. Okay, and this can be computed in some examples. Be computed in some examples. So, some examples. So, first let F from A M to A one A two a1 be a function where x is the critical locus of f is zero-dimensional say that X also simplistic. For simplicity, let's assume that x is just one point, otherwise it's just some, then not necessarily reduced, I guess. What? Not necessarily. Not necessarily reduced, yeah. Then it's dt quadratic of x is the quadratic Milno number at the point. The same as what was introduced yesterday by Simone and that makes sense as a refinement of a dt invariant algorithm. In the classical theory it's just a the minimum values in this current equivalent. Right. Okay, so that's one relatively easy complication. There's been a work of more complicated examples. More complicated examples. So this is due to levy and let X9 the Hubert scheme of the end point, so Ph. So, this is due to Anna Ferber also based on what so strictly speaking, it it doesn't have a a symmetric obstruct theory. Symmetric obstruct theory, but it's still a case where this quadratic degree is defined, I think, as a covering by schemes that meeting a symmetric construction theory. And as the theory E, take not the same, the same as here, not the child wheat, but the island may claim spectrum of the wheat ring. Then we get a result on the wheat group and there is. And the result was that dtq n of course it depends on n is 0 when n is odd, 10 when n equals 2, 25 when n equals 4 minus 50 when 10 equals 50 and n equals 6. So I guess this is the most significant computation that has been done at this. Oh, it's in the integers. Yeah, it's integer. So I take this theory. This is W R. Yes, and I'm over my field K is R. So I get something in the V tree. In the entry of R, which is the integers. So I get it. That's not right, that's the signature. Yeah. Yes, and this is based on some works by Mark. One of them is a virtual localization formula, which constructs Which constructs the virtual fundamental class according to the Greber-Pandericande approach. In any case, this is really nice, but now I'd like to talk about the other how much time left up like this. Say uh seven, eight minutes. Okay, maybe no, more like ten. Thank you. So, um so is there a localization formula? Is it somehow not strong enough to do all cases? So, so it's um it's limited to this kind of theories. I think it was extended by Alessandro D'Angelo to some other kind of the I've noticed that these numbers here. Why does n equals n equals 6? The answer is in this case, the group is too small at an after n equals 6. I'll get isolated and use 2. However, if you want q, you always get q bigger, and you get isolated. Well, so now let's fix to the following case. So let x be f of some function f for m to f1 s. Two and one, A is moved. I like digital n. Can I just ask, sort of, in this T3? So if I did the complex case, there are of course two ways to, I mean, there's kind of the motiv TT way of extending, because it's not Carve app, there are sort of two different things you can do. One is the virtual class, and then the other one is the motivic thing. And the other one is the motivic thing, which are actually different. So which one should I be thinking of here? What do you mean by the motivic thing? Okay, so that's... You can do the thing we did, which is kind of gluing together just quantifically these local things and then computing. And the answer is very different from the one that's in the non-Club V in the non-Clubbear case. So this is the DT that works for non-codes. The virtual fundamental class. This is the degree of the virtual fundamental class and like wait a few more minutes. And you're going to do the parental function. Yeah. So that's now what I call that kind of motivated function. Although we don't have a motivated parent function, but yeah, that the work of parent Brian and San. And Centroid, they define, in this case, a kind of virtual fundamental class in a k0 value. So, define the parent function. Okay, not far E minus L Minus N over two. The next flow cells are nearby cycles minus the class of MCO K0. K out to the minus half. L to the minus half. Okay, so let me denote this by x there prime when I use prime as a subscript. Then, well, yeah, I'll just say briefly because I have no time, but if we take the if k is the complex number. If k is the complex number and we take the other characteristic, then what we get here is the definition of the parent function at the point in this situation. And then I guess that much of the theoretical work since then has been how to glue these things when we have something that locally looks like this. But let's just keep to this local case. Keep to this local case. Then, well, since we have this motival characteristic, like one could take the motivico characteristic of this and ask what we get. Define Vt prime T correlate to St. Yeah, well then I I have to decide what to do with this. So um so in a recent paper, uh Esprefico and Valcha, Esprefico and Valcha suggested just to adjoin a square root of minus one of bracket minus one. But anyway, let me for a moment ignore this and just consider this difference. Like this difference, I can forget. Sorry, I'm in charge here. Three more minutes. Yeah. Three more minutes. Yeah. This difference after taking the Euler characteristic, it agrees with if just describe what this difference maps to. So this actually maps to Take a characteristic of psi as one times the characteristic of both n0 equals the limit of k now okay so this is this psi of This is this psi f of the nef and those are but also this can be considered to be the nearby cycles in the motivic homotopy setting defined by a u. This could be a u's nearby cycles of a stage. comes on SH. The fact that those two gives the same is due to a new bug. So in a way, I don't have to pass through this. In a way, I don't have to pass through this. I get also a definition which is intrinsic to motivic homotopy theory for this DT invariant. Yes, and let's just, since we're, let's be a bit suspicious about what this should be up to, so let's just write this times beta. We can have some freedom about the reformulation of Behrend's theorem is that if Is that if we are over C, not taking this quadratic, then this dt over C of X is the same as this dt prime over C of X. One can ask, is it true also motivically or quadratically? So is it true that T x equals T prime prime? But so I guess that the answer is no or let's say no, but so first why no? Why no. So what was beta yellow? So what was beta again? I just said beta because I'd like to allow myself freedom to choose what beta is. So I didn't decide then. But we do know where L has to go. The only issue is the square root of L. Exactly. Yeah. And you know where to send Leverbs? L most minus one. Okay. Yeah. Just putting better here would give me more freedom to say. To say yes, but still the answer is no. Why not? So, again, maybe with the easiest case, so assume that x is cute f it is one point. Sorry, maybe it's not based. Sorry, maybe it's not beyond spaces, but like prior to spaces, because it's not a space, it's a point. And f is some function from a n to a1, then this Vt quadratic is, as I told you that. Is, as I told you, the quadratic or the quadratic Milnow number at the point, while this T prime quadratic can be computed just by the conductor formula, which was mentioned, I think, twice in the talks by Talks by Levine, Levin, Mark Levine, Simon, and Shrinivas, together with my world, which makes it a bit more flexible. Using this, I can use to be beta times say that F is homogeneous of degree E. Homogeneous of degree E minus one plus minus E and minus one quadratus. And then for many Fs it just doesn't doesn't use the same thing I think that the main idea was DCQ is the one defined with the virtual fundamental class. Right. Yeah, so so this is the the virtual fundamental class. This is this um image of this kind of motivated class. So this for the end is what's it like what's the constant? This this mu? Yeah, what's the right hand side? Oh, yeah, it's it's the um quadratic Milk number, which is like the degree, the A1 degree, or the OLL class with respect to DF as a section. Oh, it's not a button related. No. Okay, so I guess that the reason that the answer is no is that this formula shows that we have some deviation from Milno's formula as it is over the complex numbers and this correct. And these corrections, which are different than the Mino formula, they appear here and they make this understanding of the DT invariant to be different in this case. So the other characteristic of Denafloser is vanishing cycle thing doesn't see this norm at this moment. It sees the blue, it's just this constantly just. It's literally just so it's not getting the whole mu, it's just getting this e minus, but I wouldn't. No, everything's multiplied by mu. Everything is multiplied by mu. No, only mu is multiplied by mu. Only this is multiplied by mu. And this is like an additive correction. Yeah, so this, so maybe in a way, it's not universal enough to have more focus. Okay, so. Right. Okay, so I said this but. So let me just say the but and finish. Okay? So but I think for all people then so first at least in this example over R and C and with some flexibility about the definition of beta they do agree.
