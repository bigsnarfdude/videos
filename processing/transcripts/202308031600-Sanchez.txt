Our next speaker was supposed to come, but well, for reasons beyond our power, he's going to give, he had to stay home and he's giving his talk via Zoom. So I introduce to you Professor Ivan Sanchez. He's a colleague from my university, and he's going to be speaking about hatred topologies and almost topological groups. Almost topological groups. Whenever you're ready, thanks, Rodrigo, and thanks to the organizer for the invitation. This is a joint work with my PhD student, Antio Calderon. So let's start with the original definition of hotory. We need two ingredients, the circumference line, denoted by Denoted by S and with topology tau S and the usual topology on R we say tau E and then hattering defining a topology tau A on R as follow the neighborhoods of A are the same of R Of R and the neighborhoods of the complement are the same as in circular line. Something like that. If this is A and this is R minus A, then the neighborhood for points of A. The points of A are interpreted of this form and for the points of R minus A we have neighborhood of this form. Okay, and this the set of real numbers with this topology. Grand number with this topology is denoted by HA and it's called the Hatford space associated to A. Note that if A is equal to R, then this set is empty. So we get the usual topology on R. And if A is the empty set, then we get the third. Get the third-free topology. We also have that every hatchery topology is between the Euclidean topology and the source of the topology. Some properties of such spaces are for every subset of R, H R H A, sorry, is first countable, normal, hereditarily indeveloped, hereditarily separable. Lindelof, radar is parable, and is a bare space. However, note that all these properties are shared by R and the circumference line. But what about metric? And or in this context, it's equivalent to us about second-persibility. We know that the circumvent line is not. Line is not second contable or multizable, but are it is then Chattyko and Hatteri 10 years ago proved that the space HA is metraceable, equivalent, second concept if and only if R minus A. R minus A is contable. The idea behind this is that this subset must be small and then this space is more similar to the real numbers with Euclidean topology. There are other There are other facts like to be polished and to complete both properties are equivalent to the complement G minus A to be countable, similar to matrixability. Before to talk about almost topological group. Sorry. Could you go back one slide? Yeah, what is G or R? Yeah. Thank you. R minus must be control. Thanks. So, before to start with almost topological group, let's see some relationship between S and R. R, the topology relationship is trivial. Some topology is contained in the other one, and if we remove If we remove in this basic open in the certain line, we say A, then we get a basic open in the real numbers. More deeper than that is if we consider Surham line with the usual addition, then the addition is continuous. This kind of structure. These kinds of structures are called part topological groups. Also, we know that the real numbers with the usual addition is a topological group. And this is maybe less known. Euclidean topology is the finer Hausdorff topology on R contained in the source conference line and such that R Such that R with topology is a topological group. Then, with this in mind, not exactly this definition, it's more or less because this definition due to Manuel Fernandez was motivated by the Source High Friend line. We have the whole logo. If we have G, a group. G a group, a master group with a topology tau. We say that it is a non-orthopological group if the operation is continuous. If we have a housing or topological group on G, we say sigma. And there is a special local base identity in or almost to political group, such that if we remove the remove the identity of an open in this spatial base then we get an open in G sigma note that these properties are very similar to the last observation if we replace g tau by s and g S and G sigma by R. Then we have other definitions. If we have an almost topological group, we can consider, well, not only in almost topological group, but in this context, we can consider the finest topological topology of all topology on G such that G sigma is a topological group and sigma is contained. And sigma is contained in tau. The space G with this topology is a topological group and it is called the reflection group of G. It can be proved that this topology, sigma, in this definition, is equal to this. This tau star topology. Okay, then we have an example of a normal topological group. We define a local base at the origin like this open balls tangent to the axis y at the origin. Region and we claim that this is an almost topological group, and the reflection group is R2 with the usual topology. We can see that the addition in R2 with this topology is continuous. Also, the usual topology on R2 is weak. Topology on R2 is weaker than this topology tau. And if we delay the origin of U, this U, you get an open ball or open set in the usual topology. Okay. We will use this example. We will use this example several times in this talk. Example phi of Rasky's example. Remember that as in topological groups, if we have a local base at the origin of identity, then we get a topology by translations of Of the opens of this local base, more or less, as we can see in this figure. Then, if we start with an honor topological group and this special local base identity, then we can obtain a local base for the group reflection. For instance, For instance, in the case of S and R, if we have this open, then we can obtain an open in R as u minus U. Here we are using addition notation, and here we are using we are using sorry multiplier. The multiplication notation. Then, if we start with a local AI identity, we can get a local waste identity in the group reflection. So, we have all the ingredients to define a topology similar to. A topology similar to hatchery, but in the context of almost topological group. If we have a subset of the almost topological group, then we consider this family where the points of A have the same neighborhoods of. Neighborhoods of as in the group reflection and the points in the complement of the same neighborhood that in the almost topological group. And it can be proved that this family is a neighborhood system for a houser topology tau A point G. Here an example of this Of these spaces. Again, we consider G as an example of single phi, sorry, and we consider A as the right semi-plane. This means that the points here are the same neighborhood like in R2 with the usual topology. Two with the usual topology and the points to the left, including the axis y, a neighborhood similar to exam example phi. Okay. But what happened if we consider now? Then we consider now the subspace of this right semi-plane. Then we obtain something like that. Maybe this is a normal space for all of you. In fact, is the main In fact, is the Neminski plane. So I will try, I try to see that why it can be interesting to study this kind of topologies. They are interesting by itself, are a generalization of the definition. The Attorney definition, and we also can obtain interesting spaces like the main script plane and others. Well, as in the case of R, Hi is the hatter space of G associated to A. Associated to A. Tau G is the topology of the group reflection. Tau MT is the topology of the almost topological group. And if we put G equal to the circumference line, then we have the hatchwork topology or the hatchwork definition. Or the hatch redefinition. Some basic facts. The density of HA coincides with the density of G and the density of the reflection group. So Hi is separable if and only if G is comparable, and we have our. And we have a result similar for the bare property. What about separation action? If our almost topological group is regular, then every hatchware space is regular. Is regular. However, the converse is not true at all, but it's true for proper subset. I mean, if we have a proper subset A of an almost topological group G, E, H A is regular. A is regular or piconal, then G must be regular or piconal, respectively. Why we assume that A must be proper? Because if we take A equal to G, we know that there exists a non-regular almost topological group. Almost topological group G such that its group reflection is R2 with its usual topology. And of course, HG is in this case R2, which is deconal, but G is not regular. So the converse for the case A equals G is false. A equals 2G is false. And we don't know if theorem 9 is true for the axiom thickener. That is, if G is a thick one of all morph topological groups, we don't know if H A must be sequenced for H A for every subset of G. For every subset of G. We can give a upper bound for the weight of HA in terms of the density, the character of G and the cardinality of the complement. Here we put omega to Omega to avoid the case A equal to G. But this inequality can be strict because there exists an example of an almost separable almost topological group G such that its character is the continuum. Its character is the continuum and its group reflection once again is R2 with the usual topology. So if we consider A equals to G, then we have that the weight of Hg, which is the weight of R2, is omega. And on the right hand, we had that this problem. That this product is the continuum, which is clear and strict. However, if we consider further again the appropriate subset of appropriate Of a proper almost topological group, then we get an equality. Here, a proper almost topological group is an almost topological group, which is not a topological group, because every topological group, every house or topological group is an almost topological group. But that is not interesting. We are interested in proper almost topological group like the four conference line. We can compute the weight of H A but even if we can compute the weight of H A for proper subsets, it's difficult to say if there is something in the middle. If there is something in the middle of the weight of the weight of G and the weight of its group reflection, because the statement for all almost topological group G and every subset of it, we have that the weight of H A is the weight of G or is the weight of its group reflection. Is the weight of its group reflection. And this statement is equivalent to C to G C H, I mean the generalized continuum hypothesis. So this statement is independent to CFC. As a corollary of this equality, we have that if If A is a proper subset of a proper almost topological group, then H A is second countable if and only if G is first countable separable and the cardinality of this difference is countable. For first contable multiplicology group, we have that HA is second contable if and only if G is separable and the cardinality of the complement is countable. And then we get as a corollary the result of Shatirkua and Hatchery. And if we put A We put A equals to the empty set, we can get a characterization of almost topological group of second almost topological group as follow. G is second countable if and only if G is first countable and countable. This result. This result, it's very simple, but for me, it's very surprising because, for instance, we know that the source handled line is not second contable, but not only is not second contable, it's very far from to be second contable. And we also have a characterization of the polish, sorry, polished spaces. Then we start with a proper almost topological group and a proper subset. Then HA is a polished space if and only if G is first countable, regular, separable. Are separable and the complement is constable is a generalization of the result of Bussyat and Kacheva. Now I would like to present some results related to compactness-like properties. We start with compactness. We start with compactness. Here, in this proposition, we are considering also the case that G can be an outer topological group. So, we have that H A is compact if and only if G is compact and tau A is the topology of the group reflection. Topology of the group reflection. That is, HA is compact only in the trivial case. And for almost topological group, then proper almost topological group, then HA is compact if and only if the group reflection is compact and A is equal to G. To achieve. On the other hand, we don't know what happened with pseudo compactness. We don't know under which conditions H is pseudo-compact. And we also we don't know if we have a topological property. Topological property, we don't know under which condition HA satisfies such topological property. So there is too much for work in this topic. What about local compactness? Well, Usiada and Suhacheva, Roberto following. Follow within the context of the definition of hattery and the probability that HA is locally compact if and only if the complement is closed in R and discrete in the Storkhop and line. Then we get the following result. If we have If we have a subset or a proper almost topological group, if each edge is locally compact, then the complement like this is closer in the group reflection and is great in G like this. But the converse of this theorem is false. Once again, Once again, we consider example phi, but in this case we consider the complement J G minus A only the origin. Of course, this complement is close in R2 and is correct everywhere. However, there is not a neighborhood of the origin in this topology. The origin in this topology, tau tau A, we compact closure in such topology. And the argument is easy if we consider an open basic view of the origin like in the figure, then. Then remember that the points of the complement have the same neighborhood as in R2. Then the closure of U coincides with the closure on R two. Perform like that. Okay, then we have the closure of U in this topology is the same that the closure in R2 with its usual topology. And then we can consider a non-trivial sequence on the boundary. Say on the boundary, say, say A Xn and this sequence converge to your region. And if we consider a smaller neighborhood, we say V, we can see that the range of this. Of this sequence has no accumulation points. So this set, the closure of U is not quantably compact. And of course, it's not compact. So this is the example, which shows that the converse of the later result is false. What about Lindelof? We can characterize when HI is hereto Lindelof, and this is or this happened when the group reflection is heretari Lindelof and And the complement is securitary Lindelof if we consider G minus A as a subspace of G. We have an example to illustrate this theory. We take G as in example five, and this difference is the Is the axis X we claim that G is not Lindelof, but H I is here Lindelof. Well, G is not Lindelof because the axis Y is a closed and discrete subspace. And now, what happened with G minus A? We consider this as a subspace of G. Then know that this subspace is homomorphic to the circumference line, which is here Lindelof. And by this theorem, now we have that GR in this case is part to its usual topology, is hereditary Lindelof, and G minus A is homeomorphic to the source of line, which is hereditary Lindelof. So HA is hereditary Lindelof. We have other results concerned to use the loftness. We have that HA is hereditarily in the love if and only if the group reflection is hereditary in the love, and each group subset of H. Discrete subset of HA is countable. Also, if we put A equals to the empty set in this theorem, we have that G is hereditary indeed if and only if its rural reflection is heredarily indeveloped and each discrete subset of G is countable. For the Lindelof property, we have that we assume that G is hereditary Lindelof and then we have that H A is Lindelof if and only in the law, sorry, if and only if the extent of H A is contable. Of course, this implication is This implication is true in every topological space, but in this case, we have that are equivalent. And as a corollary, we have the if we start with a subset A of an homotopological group, such that G start is searcharial Lindelof, then G is Lindelof if an. G is Lindelof if and only if its extent is countable. Finally, we can consider some results related to metric ability. And once again, we start with a proper subset of a proper almost topological group. This means that This means that G cannot be a Hausdorff topological group. So if HA is metraceable, then G is first countable, regular, and the cardinality of the complement is less or equal than the density of G. And if we consider A equals to the empty set, we have that. We have that for proper almost topological group. If G is metraisable, then it must be first countable, regular, and the cardinality of G must be equal to the density of G. But we don't know if the converse of this result is true. Is true. I mean, if we have a subset of a proper homotopological group G, such that G is fairly countable or regular, the cardinality of the complement is less or equal. Of the density, we don't know HA must be metrizable. What about complete metrizability? We have We have an implication. If we start with a proper subset of a proper homostopological group, and if HA is completely immatraceable, then G must be first countable, regular. The cardinality of the complement must be less or equal than the density and A. And a sorry must be a G delta set the group reflection. But we don't know if the converse is true. I mean, if we have a subset of a proper homotopological group, such that G is first contraband. We have this inequality. A is a G delta set in the group of. Said in the group reflection, and also we can assume that G star is completely metracible. We don't know if HA is completely metracible. And here is note that every completely metraciable parathopological group must be a topological group, then we can rewrite this problem in the case A. In the case A equals to the empty set, as follows: Is there a proper almost topological group G such that G is first countable, regular? Its cardinality is equal to its density and G and its group reflection is completely metraceable. We don't know what is the answer. The answer, as we say before, if we have a positive answer to this problem, then we have a negative answer to this one. And that's all. I don't know why this is above. This is above. Sorry, I don't know why this thing is above. It should be in the middle, you say. Okay. Yes. Are there questions? No. So, what would be like a simple example of a paratopological group which is not almost topological? Group, which is not almost topological. Yeah, the square of the sorcery frame line. Ah, the square? Yeah. I didn't hear, I'm sorry. Yeah, the square of the square, I see. Because you have something like that. If you remove the origin, then you have something like this. And this is not open in R2, which is usual topology. And must every say countably compact, almost topological group? Topological group, be a topological group. Yes. Thanks. You're welcome. Are there any other questions? Yeah, over there. I just want to ask: what about homogeneity of almost? Homogeneity of almost topological groups. And if you take some dynamical system of the almost topological group, what happens with HA if you think it as an orbit? Have you think about that? Okay. Let me see. All most apological groups, of course, are homogeneous, but HA are done of they are only if A is equal to G and or A is only in the trivial case. So can you repeat the question, please, about dynamical systems? The dynamical systems? Yeah, let's say you have a dynamical system on an almost topological group, and you take A to be an orbit, for instance. Does that tell you something about H A? It depends on the property because the topology tau A is contained. A is containing in tau, but okay, okay. No, I don't know the answer, but that question is very interesting because it was thinking before it can be interesting to study dynamical systems in this kind of spaces. The spaces okay, thank you. Any other question? So I have a last question. Could you go back to your last slide, please? Because you were, I think you were, well, before that one, obviously. Did it work? Yeah, so you. Yeah, uh so you wanted to characterize when H of A is completely metrizable. So are any of the examples uh that you gave us uh completely metraceable, like of H of A? I think no, no, no, one of the examples I say before, but I'm not sure. Well, of course, if you take the reals and you take, I think, I don't know if A equals to the reals. Don't know if A equals to the reals or to the empty set. H of A would be the reals, and it's completely immatraceable. But I guess I was looking for non-trivial examples. No, no, no, no, non-trivial, of course. Okay. Maybe I have something in mind right now, but I'm not sure. Sure. Because it can be the answer of this question or this problem. But let me say the idea. You can consider again G as example single example file. Um no, no, no, it doesn't work. Sorry, no, I I I don't have a uh an example of when H A is completely matraceable. Is completely metraceable, a non-trivial example. Thank you. I think there are no more questions. So let's thank our speaker again. Thanks. I would like to say maybe something else. Sure. How I can I will it related to the question about an example of a paratopological group which is not almost topological group So, in this result, of course, we have this definition because we know a local base for the group reflection. However, we can characterize almost topological groups via Attorney spaces. Battery spaces. I mean, forget this, okay? Only you have BX Prime a local neighborhood. Path X in the grow reflection no matter how it is and then if you have a collection like that or like this Like this, such that this collection is a neighborhood system for a house or phological group for every A subset of G, then G must be an almost topological group. Hence, you cannot define in the square of the source reference line at spaces in this form. Thanks for Thanks for let me say this. Sure, sure. Thank you, Ivan. Well, let's if you don't mind, let's thanking again, again. Another round of applause for you. Okay. Okay. So I
