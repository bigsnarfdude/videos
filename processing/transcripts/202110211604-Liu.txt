I provide predictive mathematical models in collaboration with experimental testing to establish how the mechanics coupled with the biochemical pathways in defining cell functions. So we are currently working on a number of projects in the lab, including cell adhesion, cell division, and memory traffic. And today I would like to focus on one project. Focus on one project that concerns bacteria genome partition. And as you might know, the bacteria genome consists of chromosomes and plasmid. The chromosome is typically condensed into a rod-shaped structure called the nucleid. And the plasmid is the extra chromosomal genetic material that carries important genes for the bacterial cell to cope with the stress conditions. When the stress conditions. So, the phaseball partition of plasmid is actually important for bacterial cell survival, and actually, from our human perspective, is also very important target for the antibiotic treatment. And for high copy number of classmates, the random diffusion will be sufficient to make sure that each of the daughter cells can get at least one copy once your device. But for low-copy number classmates, for example, if you have a two here, For example, if you have a tool here, then active processes are needed to ensure the partition fidelity. Otherwise, here one can easily end up with two copies in one daughter cells and the other and guest not. So for most of all copy number plasmid, and they are actually probably partitioned by the party partition machinery that essentially Machinery that essentially have three components. Here, the PAR A is the ATPasis that are non-specifically bind to the bacterial chromosome. And the PAR B is the adapter that on the one hand, it interacts and binds to the centromere region of the plasmid called PAR S. And on the other hand, interact with the chromatin bond PARA ATPS. And this tripartite machine is a prototype model. Prototype model system that people had been using to dissect the fundamental principles of bacterial genome partition for many years. But despite all that, the underlying mechanism of the partition is still not well understood. This partition machinery can actually drive a very diverse multinity patterns. For example, it can drive the so-called portable oscillation of the plasmids. Here, Of the plasmids. Here, the PAR A is in green, and the plasmid is in magenta, and the nucleoid is in cyan. Basically, the plasmid oscillates around the length of the nuclid from pole to pole while chasing the concentration of the part A. And many filament-based mathematical models has been proposed to explain this oscillation of the plasmid in a way very similar to In a way, it's very similar to the microtubule spindle-based chromosome oscillation in mitosis in the mammalian cells. However, now we know that the PI partition machinery does not form the filament at all under the physiological conditions. More importantly, it turns out that only one person. It seems that after all, we have been barking at the wrong tree. For the majority of the cases, the plasmid is mobile along the surface of the nucleid. When the plasmid rapid, the sister plasmid will move apart persistently for a while and then position themselves when the segregation distance roughly at half of the nuclear length. The segregation by half of the nuclear length is very crucial for Crucial for to ensure the partition feed dynamic. The reason is that the plasmid partition is not coupled to the cell cycle of the host. So, as the nucleoid keep on emanating before the cell division, the replicated plasmid can be anywhere along the length of the nucleine. So, segregation by half of the nucleus is make sure that the Make sure that the replicated plasmid can always end up in two different halves of the cells, and therefore ensuring the partition fidelities. So, just our reference here, the plasmid typically is about 100 nanometer in size, and the nucleid typically microns, several microns well. The question is, how does the plasmid know the size of the nucleid? Fundamentally, there's two questions I would like to address. Questions I would like to address. First, what is the physical magnet of the parimediated, directed, and persistent motivities? And second, how does the partition machinery adapt the segregation distance of the plasmid to the length of the nucleoid and at the same time ensure the partition fidelity against the ever-lasting stochastic fluctuations. To address this, intuitions. To address these questions, we're going to combine theoretical modeling with experimental testing. Now let me first tell you what we found. For the first question, in collaboration with the initial experimental testing by Kyoshi Mizuki, we prove that the partition machinery works as a branding ratchet, the party concentration gradient-based branding ratchet that drives the Ratchet that drives the directed multi-increase. For second question, and in collaboration with Jiang Y from France, that we show that not only the partition machinery works near a critical point in the premium space that adapts the segregation distance to half of the nuclear lens, but the plasma itself unorganizes the part nearby to ensure the robustness of the partition process against the stochastic. Processed against the stochastic noise. Now, let me tell you how we get there. My starting point is the recent in visual reconstitution experiment by Kyoshi Amizuki. His lab successfully reconstituted the minimal size of the partition components that is capable of driving directed and persistent multiplicities. Here, the non-specific DNA substrate is covered when the PI ATP is. When the part ADBs. A micron-size magnetic bead is covalently bound when the part B. Now, when the magnetic field turns on to confine the microbead near to the surface of the substrate, we then observe the subsequent dynamics through the turf microscopy field. Upon interacting with the part A on a substrate, the beads start to move along the surface of the substrate in a precise. The surface of the substrate in a persistent and directed manner when the power depletion zones streaming behind. And to explain this directed motivity, without the formation of the pari filaments, we built the mechanochemical model of the pari-mediated partition by integrating both the mechanical and the biochemical aspect of the partition process into a coherent picture. So the biochemical stuff. So, the biochemical study shows that the nuclear bond part ADPase will bind to the cargo bond part B. There, the part B will trigger the bond dissociation and convert the part into a distinctive functional state. We call the part of D, which have a very weak binding affinities and hence it will release into the set of plasma rapid. At this stage, Rapid. At this stage, we know this part of D is still in the ATP bound state. So the ATP has not been hydrolyzed yet. Importantly, upon releasing into the cytoplasm, it really takes a long time for this part of B to regain its ability to bind to the substrate again. So, and this time delay turns out to be the most important factor in determining the directed motivity. The directed motivity. We'll come back to this point later. And from the mechanical point of view, we consider each of the peripheral bond acts as the elastic springs. So the motion of the bead will make some of the bond get stretched and break. And at the same time, a new bond will form. And we know that the molecule here are sufficiently soft so that the thermal energy could extend its conformation. For example, For example, this part B. And now, since the part B has already extended its arm, so it's more than likely to bind to the part A direct underneath and further away than those direct underneath. In doing so, the newly formed chemical bonds, etc., is pre-scratched. So the thermal energy is therefore utilized to primote the newly formed chemical bonds. And taken together with this mechanochemical model, we carry out the agent-based stochastic simulation. In our simulation, there's many pi-pi bond connecting to the cargo, the cargo to the substrate at any time point. They form and dissociate stochastically in according to the chemical reaction scheme in the previous slides. It is simulated through the kinetic. As the kinetic monoclaral simulations. So, the sum of the boundary emassive forces over the surface of the cargo could give rise to a net force that will drive the motion of the bead. And the motion of the bead itself will in turn impact the dynamics of the bond formation and the dissociation as we just talked about in the last slides. In this way, the mechanics and the biochemistry of the binding is coupled through the motion. Is coupled through the motion of the micro B model. And here's the typical simulation result. Initially, the carbo bond part B will start to interact with the substrate bond part ATPAs. We see from the top, and the green dashed line marks the boundary of the bead, and the magenta colour represents the local concentration of the PAR ATP on the substrate. On the substrict. When the part ADP binds to the part B, the color change from the magenta to cyanade. And as the part B start to deplete the part from underneath, the bead will become less tailored to the substrate. So this will allow the random diffusion of the bead to kick the bead in one random direction. As a result, the bead could establish more bounds at the front than Are at the front, then those at the back. Since at this point, most of the parties are largely depleted from the underneath. Since the newly formed computer bonds are pre-load, this will pull the bead forward, break the symmetry. And since it takes a while for the disengaged party to rebind to the substrate, the forward motion of the bead will create a party depletion zone training behind, just like a snow plaque. And this will further And this will further perpetuate the directive and persistent motion, just like that observed in our experiment. So, this is essentially a branding ratchet, which also predicts that the initial direction of symmetry breaking events is random. Indeed, in our experiment, actually in the same field, the trajectory of different bead follows different directions. That is, the bead could, in principle, move in all different directions. Move in all different directions, but after choosing one at random, it will persist in this particular direction. So, a brief summary here. We provide some evidence that the PAR A partition machinery drives the directed motivity by Par A concentration gradient-based branding ratchet mechanisms. So, the cargo basically quit and follows the Pirate concentration gradient, and the branding motion of the cargo will be rectified by this concentration. Will be rectified by this concentration ingredient into a directed or tinitis. So, the key here is that the time delay in the part refilling of the deposition zone, which controls the asymmetry. And we have many unique predictions from our model that has been verified by our in virtual experiment and they are published. So, for the sake of time, for the rest of my talk, I'm going to focus on the second question on how the partition machinery. The partition machinery plays out in Weibo and address how it always adapts the segregation distance to half of the audio queue length. To that end, we're going to improve our model on two factors. First, the simulation domain here now has a causal boundary and it elongates at a constant rate to mimic the nucleid elongation in vivo. And this caused boundary. And this causal boundary, we also can find the range of the motion. Secondly, the party concentration is kept constant so that the new party molecules will be generated over time in the simulation. And the constant party concentration will make the party refilling events become more relevant and vivid than its corresponding in visual condition, which we will see next. Here we carefully. Here we calculated the phase diagrams of the plasmid motivity that is characterized by the pariwaning rate of Ka and a peri-parpi bond dissociation rate, Kof. When the periwiffening is slow, the cargo can undergo the so-called portable oscillation. The portable oscillation here is essentially the same directed and persistent motivity in the corresponding in visual conditions. In visual conditions. It's just that now the causal boundary in vivo will hinder the motion beyond this boundary. And this will allow the party refilling event to catch up and reverse the motion to the other end. And on the other hand, when the party refilling rate increases, the party partition machinery will drive the so-called directed segregation for the replicate plasma. Here, the two plasmates will move apart persistently. Plasmate will move apart persistently for a while and then stop, just like the observed plasmid partition process. What happened here is that when the part B starts to deplete a part from underneath, in the eyes of each of the plasmids, its local part concentration is already asymmetric. So this will size off the directed motion towards its own associated pose. While moving apart, now the partition, now Partition. Now, remember, the partition is still in such a parameter regime that the part refilling events will eventually catch up and re-establish the symmetry and eventually stop the directed motivities. So next question is: why do we care about the different motivity pattern of the plasma? Well, it turns out that the different motivity pattern differs drastically in terms of Drastically, in terms of the partition fidelity of the plasmids. Here, we calculated the percentage of time in our sebummation trajectories that the two plasmids are in two different halves of the cells. We use this probability as a proxy to infer the partition feed activity. So the directed segregation, as you see, is the short scene. The fusion for reference gave roughly about 50% of the segregation. 50 percent of the segregation probabilities. Portable oscillation is an interesting case. It gives raise a large variation. The reason is that during this portable oscillation, when the two plasmids are not in exact collision course, they could interact through the pairs of pi deprecation zones. And in doing so, the two pi deposition zones will coalesce. Zones will coalesce and consequently the two plasmids will end up traveling together. This will compromise the partition fidelities. Therefore, to ensure the partition fidelity, you do not want partition to operate in the portable oscillation region. This could explain why there's only 1% of cells have this kind of portable oscillations. On the other hand, you do not want to be too far away from this portable oscillation result. Away from this portable oscillation region neither. The reason is that the further away from the portable oscillation region, the more the periwifene events will become dominant. And consequently, the segregation distance between the two plasmids will reduce. Now, I'll remember, as I told you in the introduction, the plasmid is constantly on the move. It can replicate anywhere along the length of the The nuclei. So, if the replicated plasmids are initially not at the mid-cell, then when a small segregation distance, there will be a higher chance that the two plasmid will end up in the same half of the mother cells and therefore compromise the partition fidelity. And therefore, the partition fidelity requires the machinery to operate in a very special parameter regime. Parameter regime that is very close to, but not exactly in the portable oscillation regimes. This is a very special operating point. Now I'm going to switch gear and reframe this partition problem in the lens of statistical mechanics and focus on this one first. Let us define the order parameter of the plasma partition as the Classmate partition as the maximum segregation distance between the two classmates normalized by the nuclear mass. It is very small when the system is deep into the direct disaggregation regimes. The order parameter will increase continuously towards the portable oscillation regime. It is very similar to the second order phase transition. Other phase transition. At the tipping point between the two phases, the variation of the other parameter peaks. So the effect of the stochastic fluctuation will maximize and when the largest correlation length. By definition, this is essentially a critical point. The model actually predicts that operating at this critical point, we This critical point will allow the partition to adapt the segregation distance between the two plasmids, always to the half-length of the nucleoid. And it further predicts that operating near this critical point, the individual plasmid does not confine to a fixed location, nor does it undergo a large-scale portal oscillation. Instead, the plasmid will display a jumping Classmate will display the jumping motion interspersed by the limited local excursions. And more importantly, the model predicts that at this critical point, the distribution of the order parameter form of the highly non-Gaussian distributions. And to test this prediction, my collaborator Jiang Yuf used two-color Lif CL imaging. color life cell imaging to image and track the F plasmid in colon. Here F plasmid is the most common and low copy number plasmids in bacteria. Our experiment shows that in fact the plasmid segregation indeed adapts to half of the nuclear length. And the individual plasmid indeed and this play Indeed, and this play this very distinctive junctive motion. More importantly, the distribution of the other parameter according to our definition appears non-Gaussian. And to further confirm that the distribution of our result is indeed highly non-Gaussian, we did a more analysis. For example, we used the accumulative distribution function to Distribution function to fit our result when the Gaussian. And the chi-square is about 8.9 for our experiment and 6.6 for our simulation result. In reference, if it's the perfect Gaussian, it should be zero. In addition, we calculate the excess kurtosis values, which basically measure the tailiness of the data distributions. Distributions and the katosis value is minus 0.75 for our experimental result and minus one for our model. In reference, if the distribution is a Gaussian, it should be zero. And if the if it's the perfectly uniform distribution, it should be minus 1.2. So taken together, we provide some evidence that the distribution of That the distribution of the other parameter is actually indeed highly non-Gaussian. And we demonstrated that the low-copy number plasmid partition operates near a critical point that could adapt the segregation distance to the length of the nucleoid. So, the physical nature of this critical point is the following. Although the part-part B interaction is Interaction is local and on the molecular scales. But the plasmid itself generates a power depletion zones that act as the sphere of power. At the critical point, the power depletion and the refilling event will balance out. So the resulting spheres of powers will overlap and spend the entire length of the new coin. This will allow not only This will allow not only the plasmid to sense the presence of each other, but also the boundary of the system, which is the nuclear n. So now, given the sensitive nature of the critical point dynamics, the next question is how to ensure the robustness of this near-critical point operations. Our experiment actually shows that the pie concentration varies more than tenfold from cell to cell. Handfolds from cell to cell, and yet the segregation distance is totally insensitive to this pari concentration variation. In contrast, according to our current model, the increasing party concentration by only a few fold, you're going to significantly reduce the segregation distance. So, to explain this robustness, we need to improve our model. Our leading hypothesis is that since the power Is that since the part A can bind to the non-specific TMA and also the PAR B, so the part A in the cytoplasm should bind to the plasmid itself. We therefore postulate that perhaps the plasmid itself could localize the party nearby. This will create a local environment that will buffer against the party concentration variation in the bulk. And by incorporating And by incorporating this localization effect into our model, we could indeed explain the observed robustness of the plasmid partition against the large-scale part concentration variation as observed in experiment. And more importantly, the model predicts that the partition robustness requires the appropriate pi mobilization factor. Pi mobilization effect. If the part A democratization effect is too big at the plasmid, then the plasmid essentially can supply many part A molecules to the nucleus, to the substrate direct underneath, so that the plasma essentially will get itself stuck on the substrate. On the other hand, if the pi openization effect is too small, then So, therefore, the model predicts that the partition robustness requires the party to localize around the plasmid when about two or three-fold accumulation. And to test this prediction, John used the triple-colored FCL imaging. When the low expression level is PAR A, our data verifies that the PAR A combo. Verifies that the party cob localized when the plasmid quantitatively confirmed our amount of prediction. We suggest that the plasmid-mediated party localization underlined the robustness of buffering the near-critical point operation against the party concentration variation in a bulk. So, this leads to the final question: where does the party concentration variation come from? Our experiment actually shows that the party The part A actually oscillates from pole to pole, but it does not correlate with the motion of the plasma. On the one hand, this explains, this means the two daughter cells will inherit very different amount of Pi upon the cell division, which explains the Pi concentration variation from cell to cell, at least for some time. But on the other But on the other hand, it deepens the puzzle because we know that the PAR APA B genes are auto-regulated. Here, the level of the cytoplasmic PAR A and PAR B, they're actually regulated its own gene expression, suggesting a highly tightly control over the PAR A concentration inside cells. So, in the future, we will dissect how and why the PAR A. By the pi oscillate. And I'm going to sum up my talk. I would like to provide or I should put our finding in some perspective. It has been proposed that biological systems works and operates near a critical point in a parameter space so that it can sensitively respond to the environmental changes. While the evidence While the evidence is emerging from different fields, ranging from the gene expression in deaf biologies to the neuroscience and the brains, they are largely statistical inference without a real physical mechanism. More importantly, the near critical point operation is inevitably highly susceptible to the stochastic The stochastic noise. How to ensure the sensitivity and the robustness at the same time is an open question in the field. So, we provide some physical mechanism and some evidence that the low-copy plasma partition works as the operating ratchet. And this ratcheting operates near a critical point in a parameter space. And this will allow the partition to adapt the separation distance always to half of the length of the nuclei. More importantly, we provide some evidence that the plasmid itself localizes the part A nearby, and this spatial recognition ensures the partition fidelity against the variation of the part A concentration in the cell plasma. And we suggest that this. We suggest that this spatial and temporal regulation over the near-critical point operation might provide a general mechanism to ensure both the robustness and the sensitivities of CRMR processes. With that, I would like to stop by thanking the people who are involved in this wonderful project and also the founding agencies. Agencies. And now I'm happy to take questions. Thank you very much, Jim. Any questions from Zoom participants? I've got a question. With the depletion model, it would seem like there's a limit. It would seem like the binding capacity would become limiting reasonably quickly. Is that an issue? Yes, that's a very good point. Indeed, there is the upper limit of how long. How long the system could adapt the size? According to our model, it's proportional to the size of the plasmid itself and is proportional to the number of part A's. And it's also proportional to the density of the part B on the plasmid. That's definitely right. That's definitely right. For the parameters that we use and we believe is more relevant to the physiological conditions, the upper limit of the nuclear lens that this mechanism could be sensitive and adapt to is about five microns. But in normal bacterial cells, it rarely gets to this low. So in that sense, This long. So, in that sense, we are okay. But it definitely is not going to adapt on forever. That's for sure. Great. Thank you. Good question. Any other questions, either from Zoom or in person? I think we're okay in the room. All right. I think for once we're done early, so we'll, if there's any conversations, we'll keep it open. And we'll wait until 40 after the hour.
