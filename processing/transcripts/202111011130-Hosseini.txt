So I wanted to talk today a little bit about some recent work that we did on sort of drawing connections between numerical methods for solving PDEs and sort of inverse problems and Gaussian process regression. It essentially connects sort of numerical PDEs with sort of inverse problems and also techniques. Of inverse problems and also techniques in machine learning. So, what I'll talk to you today is sort of everything is based on this paper we had in JCP. It's joint work with Yi Fan Chen, who's a PhD student at Caltech, and Kumeno Hadi and Andrew Stewart. And we did this back when I was at Caltech a few months ago. Okay, so here's an overview of my talk. So, I'll talk about the method and the multi- About the method and the motivation, and give you an example. Then I'll run through some numerical examples to show you that the methods actually work in practice and they give you sort of reasonable performance. Then I'll talk about theoretical foundations and then I'll end with some future directions. And really the talk is sort of a proposal about sort of interesting questions that arise when you sort of think about solving PDEs as sort of inverse problems or Sort of inverse problems or Bayesian inference problems. So the motivation for us was more from the machine learning side. There's sort of a lot of excitement these days around sort of machine learning techniques for solving PDEs. And the idea behind it is sort of that traditional PDE solvers, you know, finite difference, finite element, those are optimal in certain ways. Optimal in certain senses, but really, you need to be an expert a lot of times to use them in the sense that for a particular problem, you might have to go and find what is the best solver for that problem, code it up, and it takes a lot of work. And a lot of people are now interested in sort of modern machine learning techniques for solving PDEs. And the aim is that you can maybe automate this process. So if I have a new physical So if I have a new physical problem that I want to sort of solve and simulate, maybe I don't need to sort of go and do a whole literature search and find the best method and hold it up. And some of the techniques in this sort of area that have become very popular is, for example, this physics-informed neural networks or these operator-learning techniques like deponets, which kind of use neural networks to solve PDEs or learn the operator, the solution operators of PDEs. Operators of PDE. And sort of, if you look at this literature, you notice, you know, so from that machine learning perspective, there are sort of two families if you're doing like supervised learning. You have neural networks that are very popular. At the same time, there are Gaussian processes or kernel methods that are also very popular. But on the PDE side, it seems like most of the work is just focused on the neural networks. And there was very little done on Gaussian processing. Done on Gaussian processes, and that's sort of where our work fits in. So it's basically: can I use Gaussian processes to solve PDEs? And when you ask that question, it's actually been considered quite a lot, right, in certain settings. So thinking about sort of the connection between inference and numerical approximation, it actually goes back to the 70s, these works of Larkin and Wava. Larkin and Wava. But also for linear PDEs, essentially some of the working numerical homogenization is already kind of considering this problem of solving a linear PDE using Gaussian process regression. But very little is done sort of for nonlinear PDEs, right? And that's where we will focus on. And sort of also connections, what I'll show you today. Also, connections, what I'll show you today has deep connections to meshless solvers for PDE, so sort of radio basis function collocation methods, smooth particle hydrodynamics. And also, it's at its heart, it's a Gaussian process conditioned on nonlinear constraints. So it's also an interesting question from the perspective of GPs. Okay, so the goal for today's talk is essentially to design or to Essentially, to design or to show you a Gaussian process collocation method for solving nonlinear PDEs. And the three main features that the method that I'll show you has is that it's provably convergent, it's interpretable and amenable to numerical analysis, which is something that a lot of the neural network techniques at the moment don't have. And also, it ends up, because at its heart, it's Gaussian process regression. Process regression, it inherits this sort of state-of-the-art complexity versus accuracy guarantees of linear solvers for dense kernel. So, I'll talk about this in a second, but essentially the main cost of the method is going to be manipulating dense kernel matrices. And as I said, the technique is very closely related to this work of Human on Bayesian numerical homogenization. Okay, so let me lay So let me lay out the ideas by just looking at a very particular sort of simple nonlinear PDE. So suppose we have this PDE, which is just the Laplace operator plus some nonlinear function of u. We have the right-hand side f and g. And I'm just going to for now assume that we're in Rd and tau is some nonlinear function and everything is sort of set up so that my PDE has a classic So, that my PDE has a classic, a unique classical solution. So, it's defined point-wise. So, this will require some assumptions on tau that I don't want to get into, but let's say that we're in the setting where all of those assumptions are satisfied. Then the method is, the idea behind the method is very simple. So, I take this PDE, I'll choose a kernel as we do in Gaussian process regression. So, I choose a kernel K and And I'll think about its RKHS. It's reproducing journal Hilbert space. I'll denote it with Cal U. And every norm you see in the talk is pretty much the RKHS norm. Then I pick a set of points in my domain. Some of these points are going to be in the interior. Some are going to be on the boundary. And then what we do is to solve the PDE by solving an optimization. By solving an optimization problem where we minimize the RKHS norm of U subjects to the PDE being satisfied on our collocation points. So we have the J points in the interior, we impose the PDE there, and then we have the boundary data. So we impose the boundary data as well for the points that are on the boundary, right? And then we solve this problem and we denote its minimizer as you as you dagger throughout. Minimizer as u-dagger throughout the talk. So the idea is that if I have enough collocation points, this minimizer u-dagger will be a good approximation to the solution of my PDE. So you can already probably see that inverse problem here, right? Is that you have a Gaussian prior on U because this is the RKHS norm of corresponding to this kernel has a Gaussian process. To this kernel, it has a Gaussian process model underneath it, right? So I have a Gaussian prior on U, and then I'm subjecting it or I'm conditioning it on satisfying the PDE at the covocation points. Okay, so when you think about this optimization problem, the sort of first question you have is sort of, okay, can I come up with a representer theorem for this, right? As we do pretty much all the time with Pretty much all the time with sort of kernel methods and GP regression because it allows you to automatically get a discretization of your problem. Okay, so to derive the representative theorem, we need a little bit of notation. So we have our optimization problem. And by staring at the PDE, we realize that some of the terms in the PDE are actually bounded linear functionals acting on the solution used. Acting on the solution u. So this Laplacian of U at the collocation points is a bounded linear functional, right? It's the delta distribution composed with negative of the Laplacian. And then we have point values of u, and those guys are just delta distributions at the collocation points. So we take these elements, which are in the dual space of the RKHS, and we just stack them all into one long vector. So that's this bold fine, right? 5, right? So we had J points in the interior and then M points on the boundary. So we have a total of n, which is J plus M elements of the dual space. So that's the size of this vector bolt fine. And then we define this kernel vector field and matrix. This is just notation. So this is a vector field that you obtain by acting the kernel on each entry of this vector volt phi. So you go from this bar phi 1 to 2. So you go from this verifi one to j and then the size. Okay. And then you have the kernel matrix, which is the action of the kernel on each entry of the vector volt phi and then the end and the j entries of the vector volt phi. So if you're familiar with Gaussian process regression, this is exactly the same thing, except that you don't just have pointwise evaluations of the kernel. You now have its action against pointwise evaluations or these. Evaluations or these sort of red functionals as well. So there will be derivatives and Laplacians of the kernel showing up. Then you get kind of what you would expect from GPU regression, which is that you have a representative theorem, right? The proof is fairly straightforward. So you can show that every minimizer u-dagger of the optimization problem above can be represented as using this formula, which should be familiar. This formula, which should be familiar, right? Where the vector z dagger here, which is your representer, it's in n dimension, so the total number of sort of collocation points that we had. And it solves a different finite dimensional optimization problem where you have to minimize the quadratic loss. This exactly will correspond to the RKHS norm of. Correspond to the RKHS norm of U when you use this formula, subject to a nonlinear constraint, which is not surprising because the PDE has nonlinearities in it. So we have nonlinear constraints on this vector z as well. Okay, so I'll show you in a second where this function f comes from, but it basically comes from the type of nonlinearities you have in the PDE. The vector y here, the data in this equality constraint, is exactly the right-hand side. Is exactly the right-hand side data of the PDE. So it's the value of the source term in the interior at the quotation points and the value of the boundary on boundary quotation points. Okay. So how do I get this function f? It might seem a bit mysterious, but it's actually very simple once you see it sort of once. So you have your PDE constraint optimization problem. So the PDE, So, the PDE, sort of at all the collocation points, essentially you can think of it as some nonlinear function of point values of u and all of its derivatives, right? So in the case of our example, it's the Laplacian of U. So there's some derivatives of u here plus a nonlinear function of u, right? And the nonlinear function that's that's sort of acting on point values of derivative. On point values of derivatives of u is precisely the function that defines this map F. Okay, so in the first sort of PDE in the interior, you have the Laplacian plus tau of point values of u, then f on the interior points is exactly negative L plus tau of P. So L for Laplacian, P for pointwise values. On the boundaries, this map F is precisely just the point values. Okay, so you look at your PDE, you forget about all the derivatives. You forget about all the derivatives and everything, and you just think about what nonlinear function is being applied to u and its derivatives and all its point-wise values. And that's going to be this map capital F here. So when you think about where this map F comes from, you will immediately realize that the vector Z that you solve for in this representer optimization problem is nothing. Enter optimization problem is nothing but the vector of values of the Laplacian of U at the collocation points and u itself at the collocation points. So that's essentially what you will be solving for when you're solving this optimization problem, that you no longer need to solve for U in the entire RKHS space, which is infinite dimensional. You just solve for its values and its Laplacian's values at the corresponding collocation points where you impose the constraints. If you think about it again, this And if you think about it again, this is exactly what you do in Gaussian process regression, right? Except that here, because derivatives of u are showing up, you're going to have sort of, you have to keep track of those values at the collocation points as well. So the important points, just to summarize, the minimizer U dagger is completely identified by the minimizer Z dagger of this representer optimization problem, which is now n-dimensional. Dimensional. This is a nice optimization problem because it's quadratic. It has non-linear constraints, but it's still nice most of the time. And you can solve it using sort of standard optimization techniques, which is what I'll show today. All right. So I'm now going to sort of try to get closer to a practical algorithm. So you basically want to solve this region. Basically, we want to solve this representer optimization problem, right? This n-dimensional optimization problem. But you might wonder: okay, what do I want to do with the constraints? So standard approach in sort of optimization literature, you have two choices. You can eliminate the constraints completely, which requires some assumptions on the type of nonlinearities you have in PDE in your PDE. Turns out you can do this in in a lot of examples. You can do this in a lot of examples, actually. You basically, if you can eliminate this nonlinear constraint, you end up with an optimization problem of this form, where now we are minimizing over some new sort of vector w, but our optimization problem is no longer sort of the cost is not quadratic because if you eliminate this constraint, you have to do a change of variable from Z to this W, and there's going to be nonlinearities that would show up depending on how you eliminate. That would show up depending on how you eliminate this cost. Another approach, which will be very reminiscent of sort of Bayesian inverse problems, is that you just relax this equality constraint. So you add a little bit of noise to this constraint, and then you end up with an optimization problem like the one below, where I'm minimizing the quadratic loss on Z, but then I'm penalizing sort of the misfit between F of Z and Y. Of z and y, and the beta here is going to be the standard deviation of the noise that I'm adding to the constraint. And you kind of hope that if beta is a small, then this is going to approximate the solution of the PD, right? And there's a note here which we should actually be careful because this approach is very, very popular in the machine learning side. But turns out the choice of data here is very non-trivial, especially for PDEs, because you basically need a different data. You basically need a different data on the boundary and in the interior. And it's not very clear how to pick that optimum. Okay. All right. So what we do is, I'll show this for the elimination idea, but you can do it with the relaxation of the constraint as well. In both cases, you kind of end up with an optimization problem that is maybe quadratic or Maybe quadratic or has some nonlinearities in it. But then what we do is, again, because for most PDEs, the nonlinearities are not, they're fairly nice, they're sort of polynomials, we just set up a Gauss-Newton iteration. So we set up an iteration where we update the solution, and then at every step, you solve a linearized version of your PDE. So you linearize this nonlinearity G. Nonlinearity G at your current guess of the solution. And this exactly corresponds to a specific linearization of your nonlinear PDE. But now you have a quadratic loss that you can minimize, right? So you do this iteration, and then at every step, you can actually solve the optimization problem exactly. And that's essentially the algorithm that we will use to solve the PDs. A note on sort of A note on sort of computational considerations because at the same time, I mean, we're drawing these interesting connections between Gaussian process regression and solving PDs, but you also want to end up with an algorithm that can actually be implemented in a reasonable way and get a reasonable performance. So, when you're solving both of these problems, no matter which formulation you choose, then your main computational bottleneck is going to be a problem. Main computational bottleneck is going to be inverting this kernel matrix K. And this will suffer from the usual issues that you have with kernel matrices in Gaussian process regression. So what we do right now is we do a Cholesky factorization of K, and then we do back substitution. But this kernel matrix is typically opposed, and it gets even worse when you have the derivatives because the logs of the matrix corresponding to the derivatives are going to The derivatives are going to have a different condition number than the rest of the matrix. So, what we do right now is add a nugget term that is chosen in a specific way for our kernel matrices. But there's an idea here, there's recent work that actually allows you to compute the Cholesky factors of K-inverse directly using the screening effect of GPs. And we're kind of hoping that we're pretty sure that you can extend those ideas to this setting as well. And then that kind of helps you a lot with the ill conditioning of K. It also helps you get better performance. All right, so let me show you some numerical examples and then I'll talk about some theory underlying the method. So the idea, again, just to recap, is simple, right? You write the P D as a Gaussian process regression. As a Gaussian process regression problem, you look at its representative theorem and then you solve for the z vector. So let me start with our elliptic PDE. So we have the Laplacian again with some nonlinearities. We are going to choose the kernel to be the exponential, the Gaussian kernel. And we will eliminate the constraint by basically solving for the Laplacian of U. That's basically how we will get rid of our constraint. How we will get rid of our constraint. Because you can think that imagine you have like a z vector that represents the function of u and point values of u. You just solve some parts of some of the entries of z in terms of mirror points. Here's our collocation points. The blue points are in the interior, orange points are on the boundary. The contours are the exact solution we want to approximate. This is the loss function history for Gauss-Newton. So it converges in two-step. So it converges in two steps in our case with random initial conditions. These are pointwise contours of the error. And then in the bottom, we have two sort of comparisons. On the left is the linear PDE when tau is zero. So it's just a Laplace equation or Poisson equation. These two lines are finite differences, second order, and the lines below it are our method with different choices of the length scale. With different choices of the length scale of the GP. So you can see you can get pretty fast convergence, but it's not surprising because the solution of the PDEs is smooth and this kernel is pretty smooth as well. So in a way, this kernel is actually perfect for approximating solution of this PDE. Bhamdad, we have a question from. Sorry, I may have missed it, but what is F? What is T, and what is Tau, please? Sure, yeah. So in the picture on the left, Tau is. So in the picture on the left, tau is zero, so there is no tau in the picture on the left. F and g are picked by prescribing the solution you see here, the loops, the contours. You substitute them into the PDE, and then you record F and G, and then you impose them as the boundary condition and the source term of the PDE. So we're prescribing the exact solution we're trying to approximate. We're trying to approximate. What is the exact solution? Here, I think it's the product of like sine and cosine, something like that. I mean, it's this function you can see here that the contours. Yeah. I forget exactly what the definition was for the solution. Okay. All right. And then on the picture on the right is exactly the same problem, but the tau, the nonlinearity here, is now u to the power 3. Here is now u to the power 3. So there's a polynomial nonlinearity. And again, your convergence is more or less the same. We didn't compare to finite differences because it's a nonlinear PD now. Another example, the viscous Berger's equation. So this is a bit more exciting because your solution sort of changes regularity almost in its domain. So here we have the collocation points in space-time. So this is A. time. So this is X is space, T is time. You have the boundary conditions only on the bound on the on X being negative one and one and then at T being equal to zero. Again we have the Gaussian kernel but this time we have different length scales in time and in space and these are sort of hand-tuned but informed by the by the fact that the solution of Berger's equation is actually more very smooth in time so you want to have it Moving time. So you want to have a longer length scale in time. Again, they eliminate the constraints. So basically, we just solved this sort of nonlinear unconstrained optimization problem. You can see here, the solver struggles a little bit to converge, right? So now it takes nine steps. And if you look at the contours of your error, perhaps unsurprisingly, most of it happens close to time one, which is when you have like a very sharp interface. A very sharp interface. It's not a shock, but it's a viscous shock, but it kind of looks like this picture at the bottom. So, the issue here really is that you essentially have a solution that is not really well represented by a stationary process, right? Because you're very smooth at time one, zero, but then at time one, you almost have a discontinuity. So, it's kind of this is sort of a challenging problem, right? So, despite that, Problem right, so despite that, you can get in eyeball norm, you get good match, sort of even with your viscous shot. But convergence is much harder, and it's less clear here how, like what is a good choice of your kernel. Unlike the previous example, where because everything was smooth, you would just assume that the squared exponential kernel would be a good choice. The idea that I just showed you for solving PDEs, it kind of naturally actually extends to inverse problems as well. Extends to inverse problems as well. I mean, essentially, if you think about it, you're casting the PDE as an inverse problem, right? You have a Gaussian prior, and then you have nonlinear PDE observations. You can extend this, as I said, easily to inverse problems as well. So it's the Darcy flow inverse problem that Richard mentioned as well. So you have divergence of E to the A times grad U equals to one. The Dirichlet boundary conditions, and you wish to And you wish to recover EA or E to the power of A from point values of U. So, what we do here is we essentially put a Gaussian prior on the solution of the PDE and A at the same time. So, these two terms, this is the RKHS norm of U, so there's a kernel K that defines the prior on U, and then this is the RKHS norm on A, so there's a different kernel gamma that defines that. Gamma that defines that prior on A. And then you have pointwise values of U that is given to you. So that's what this magenta term represents. The OJs are observations of point values of u. Gamma is the noise of those observations. But again, this is a very familiar optimization problem to the ones we had before, except that now you have this extra sort of misfit term for your observations, and then you again have the PDE constraints, which Again, have the PDE constraints, which you impose again at the collocation points. So, here in this picture, blue points are the collocation points for the PDE, magenta points, again, are the observations, and the orange points are the boundary conditions of the PDE. But you just solve this problem exactly the same way as before using the Gauss-Newton algorithm. Here's an example again. We use the exponential current. Sorry, I'm missing a two here. I'm missing a 2 here. So it's again the Gaussian kernel squared exponential. For both u and a, here on the top is the true value of a, the true value of u, and at the bottom is the recovered value. So this is the recovered value of u, a, and recovered value of u. And this is the loss function. Again, this seems to be a much nicer problem for the optimizer, at least. It converges in about five steps. Okay. So let me now, that we have seen the examples, go back again to the formulation and talk a little bit about what kind of sort of theoretical results you can get. And they're mostly sort of preliminary results that you get by just extending ideas from GP regression and kernel methods. So now we no longer sort of think about that prototypical nonlinear PDE anymore. Non-linear PDE anymore. We're just thinking about the generic framework. So we're minimizing the RKHS norm of U subject to some PDE constraints at collocation points. We will have some assumptions. So you want to assume your PDE, whatever it is, it has a unique strong solution. You pick your kernel K with its corresponding RKHS, and U dagger again is our minimizer for this optimization problem. The first result we get is a The first result we get is a convergence result. So suppose that you pick your kernel in a good way, so it's adapted to the PDE in the sense that you have sufficient smoothness. So the RKHS is embedded in HS where S is bigger than B over 2 plus the order of the PDE. This just means the RKHS is sufficiently regular that I can make sense of the point values of BU and all of its derivatives that show up in the. All of its derivatives that show up in the definition of my PDE. So I want to be able to make sense of my PDE in the strong form. That's the blue condition. And also, U star, the unique solution of the PDE, belongs to the RKHS. So this means, again, that the kernel should be adapted to the solution of the PDE, because otherwise this constraint may not follow. You suppose the field distance of your collocation points goes to zero as the number of collocation points goes to infinity. Coefficient points go to infinity, then a very simple sort of compactness argument lets you show that as m goes to infinity, then u dagger will converge to u star pointwise in omega and also in regular sublux spaces. Again, the proof is very, very simple. It basically you use compactness of sublux spaces and then you get convergence of subsequences, but then because the minimizer Sequences, but then because the minimizer is that the solution is unique, as m goes to infinity, you get that all sequences converge. It's very, very quick. Okay, so we have convergence. What about, this is for the exact constraints with the quote constraints. What about the relaxed constraints? A similar idea with pretty much the same constraints. You can get a similar theory for the relaxed constraints. For the relaxed constraints, I think where we added a bit of noise to our PDE constraints. Here you can show that as beta and 1 over m, so beta was the noise, m is the number of collocation points. So as beta and 1 over m go to zero, you dagger beta, which is the solution of the noisy, sort of noisily constrained optimization problem, converges to the true solution of the PDE, again, point-wise and also in solar spaces, the T-Rex. In solver spaces, the T-westantness. Okay, so in both whether you relax or whether you keep the constraints, you have convergence. You can also try to sort of extend error estimates from sort of kernel methods and Gaussian process regression to this framework. So you can get results like this theorem, where we have our usual assumptions again. Assumptions again, then we have that the pointwise error between u dagger and u star is bounded by two terms. So the first term, the sigma x is the standard deviation of our GP if we had only linear observations times the RKHS norm of u star. And then we have a second term where this is this square root of k is just the standard deviation of your prior essentially, right? Your prior essentially, right? And this epsilon, I'll show you on the next slide, it's a computable constant, but because now we have a GP with nonlinear constraint as opposed to the linear case, somehow the data and the nonlinear constraints have to show up in the error bound, right? So that's where this epsilon term shows up, which I'll show you on the next slide. Similar theorem you can get for the R, you can bound. You can get for the R, you can bound the RKHS norm of the solution instead of the pointwise error in terms of sort of your best approximation in the span of your sort of functions you get by acting your kernel on the phi's that we had in the bounded linear functionals that we find our constraints. So these would be like the feature maps of your kernel. So you get the best sort of approximation error. The best sort of approximation error in that span plus this epsilon again, where the epsilon is the solution to this optimization problem. It's the value of this cost function, which again is a quadratic loss. This matrix A is closely related to your kernel matrix, but then you have your nonlinear constraints showing up here again. So your data actually affects this epsilon value here. Value here, and you get this epsilon term basically by sort of saying that, okay, what's the best minimizer I can get by looking at the span of my feature maps. And then you say, okay, amongst those guys, what's the biggest error sort of I'm incurring by sort of satisfying the constraints. Okay. All right. So let me move on to some future directions. Let me move on to some future directions. So, what did I show you? So, the talk is really a proposal on sort of interesting problems that arise when you connect statistical inverse problems and Gaussian process regression with numerical methods for solving nonlinear PDEs. And I showed you you can get some theory as well, but there are a lot of sort of open questions. But there are a lot of sort of open questions, especially from the perspective of like numerical methods for solving PDEs. One big question that shows up both in the numerics and also in the theory was that I kept saying you need a good kernel. You need the kernel to be adapted to the solution of the PDE. Or in the numerics, you saw, for example, for Berger's equation, maybe the errors weren't as good as the elliptic PDE just because the kernel is not good. Just because the kernel is not good at representing something that looks like Berger's, the solution to Berger's equation. So, the choice of the kernel is a very crucial step. And you can get sort of fast convergence or it might just ruin your convergence rates. And this also highlights sort of the learning of the importance of learning hyperparameters. So, in all the examples I showed you, we are All the examples I showed you, we are hand-tuning the coefficients in our kernels, like the length scales and all that. But what you really want is a very flexible sort of formulation of the kernels and also investigating what are the best methods for tuning those parameters. Yeah, and as I said, for certain PDEs, such as Vergius equation, it seems you really need somehow a non-stationary. Really, we need somehow a non-stationary model. So, just the Gaussian process is not with a fixed kernel, it's very difficult to sort of adapt that kernel to Berger's equation, but something like maybe compositions of GPs might actually hold the key to solving those PDs. There are issues with the nugget term that I talked about briefly. So, the main difficulty is sort of computational bottleneck at the Of computational bottleneck at the moment is the ill-conditioning and the size of this kernel matrix. So, this, for example, on a personal laptop, it's hard to push it past sort of like five, 10,000 points just because these kernel matrices become too big. And also, they're ill-conditioned. So, the question of what is the best way to regularize them is not clear. This also ties back to the choice of the kernel, because actually, if you choose kernel because actually if you choose a good kernel it oftentimes gives you a better condition number for your kernel matrix. A typical example is if you pick a matern kernel for example you get much better condition numbers than if you pick the squared exponential that we were working with. Yeah. Okay. There's also interesting connections to artificial neural networks and the sort of deep neural network techniques that Of deep neural network techniques that we discussed, that I mentioned at the beginning. And I mean, there have been a number of works in the literature that draw connections between GPs and neural networks. There's this idea of the neural tangent kernel, and then there's this paper by Hooman, where you can model sort of resonates as compositions of GPs. So basically, So basically, this sort of kernel idea or Gaussian process regression idea allows you to get some theory for some of these neural network techniques for solving PBUs as well. And you can easily, as soon as you can sort of identify your method as a kernel method, you can also extend things like your convergence result or error analysis to the neural networks as well. It also gives you a new way of training the networks too, because you will have to. Too, because you will have to write sort of solve the optimization problem that we were looking at, which is minimize RKHS subject to PDE, which is a little bit different from what is being done in the literature on neural networks right now. Okay, so I'm almost at 40 minutes. So, let me pause there and thank you all for your attention.
