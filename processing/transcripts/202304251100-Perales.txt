Okay, so our final speaker of the morning is Raquel Perales from Oaxaca, from Ibanam, and she's going to tell us about volume entropy rigidity for RCD spaces. Thank you very much for inviting me. I'm sorry, I speak very softly, so if you don't hear, please tell me, and I will try to raise my voice. So let's start with this. So let's start with this. Okay. Okay, so let's give a definition of volume entropy. And first, I'm going to talk about the classical definition. So this classical definition is going to be for Riemannian manifolds. And for Riemannian manifolds, what we are going to do is we have a compact Riemannian manifold and then we will look at the universal cover of At the universal cover of this mark. And then we will define the volume entropy by H Mg as the limit of the volume. So we take first a center x bar in our universal cover of F and then we calculate the volume of the ball of radius R, take the logarithm divide by R, and then take the limit as R goes to 0. Limit as r goes to. And then this quantity is going to be well defined and it's independent of x delta. I guess I should say that the manifold is connected, but I will never repeat this again. Okay, so then this is our volume entropy, and this is what we want to study. And then, um, yes. Sorry, can you come back to the document? Yes. So basically, I mean, in Euclidean space, this would measure the dimension of the. In Euclidean space, this would measure the dimension of the space or something like that. Well, actually, yeah, let's go to the examples. In Euclidean space, this is omega n to the rn. And if you take the logarithm, you will get r n of omega. And then you have to divide by r and then to take the limit as r goes to 2. Am I correct? No? Am I correct? No. Sorry, what happened to the N? Sorry. I found that. So I guess the N state comes outside and the R stays inside. Yes. So it goes to zero. Yeah, so this goes to zero. And if you take, for example, a manifold like the sphere, a manifold that is compact with positive curvature, then your entropy is going to be zero as well. So basically what we are detecting is like hyperbolic or negative stars. Mega x x stars. Yes. Okay. So okay. So why do we like this quantity or why we thought this was interesting? Well, there is an inequality between the entropy. So entropy square of a manifold is greater or equal than four times the bottom of the spectrum of the universal covered space. And then it's related. And then it's related, this volume entropy is related to what topological entropy that has to be defined for the geodesic flow on the manifold M. And there are very nice formulas using the volume entropy. And here I think I didn't put it. And some simplicity volume. Yeah, so sorry about it. And it appears in dynamic curves. Sorry, sorry, what is it? What does volume mean? I don't want to go into this detail. Yeah, sorry. Let's excuse this. Maybe it's not that important. Well, but I'm going to be talking a little bit about this bottom-up spectrum and the inequality with the volume and torture. Okay. So what are the results? Too many buttons. Thank you. Okay, so what are the results that appear for this maximum for this point of entropy? This volume entropy, well, if you have this manifold that satisfies this rich lower bound, so it's bounded below by minus n minus 1, where n is the dimension of the manifold. Then the universal cover of m also satisfies this rich lower bound, and then you can just use this of gram of volume comparison to tell you that the volume entropy is going to be less or equal than n minus 1. And that's because there. Minus 1. And that's because the volume of a manifold that satisfies this lower bound is going to be like the hyperbolic sign to the n minus 1. And that's why you get this n minus 1 here. And then you would wonder what happens if one has the equality here. So when one has the equality, let appear in one and later on you show the following. So if you have the rigid, So, if you have the rich lower bound as before, and you have a quality in the volume entropy, so it's equal to n minus 1, then the universal covered space has to be isometric to the hyperbolic space. So, that's the rigidity when you have a quality in this entropy. Is there a theorem for non-compact M? For non-compact one? It's not true for non-compact one. Ah yes, so my collaborators, two of my collaborators are here and they can retire a lot of questions for you, answer the questions for you. Okay, so now if we have Now, if we have that the bottom of the spectrum equals n minus 1 squared over 4, we have, instead of this volume entropy equality, then we get the same result. And this just follows by the inequality that I told you holds for the bottom of the spectrum in comparison with the volume entropy. Okay, so if we have this. Okay, so if we have this inequality, and furthermore we have this equality on the bottom of the spectrum, then we get that the volume entropy should be equal to n minus 1. We apply this result and we get that the universal cover is isometric to feature. And there are other people that have worked in this type of theorem. There is a quantity. There is a quantitative version of this theorem. And what I mean by quantitative version is the following. So given a dimension L and a diameter B, if your manifold has reaches greater than or equal to minus n minus one diameter bounded by D dimension N and if the entropy is very close to Is very close to n minus one, and very close I'm measuring by this epsilon. So if it's super close to n minus one, then your manifold has to be diffeomorphic to a hyperbolic manifold. And then actually the diffeomorphism, you can quantify how close it is to an isometry with a function that depends on this epsilon. Okay? So it's going to be very close. So, it's going to be very close to being an isotope. And another thing is that volume entropy has been studied for manifolds with an integral rich bound by Chen and by Goff and Way, who is here. So, you can ask her more about this last part. Okay, so let's continue. And I want to talk about volume entropy on RCPK and spaces. So, basically, I want to So basically I want to show that the results in the previous slide also work for RCDKM spaces. And what is an RCDKN space? Well, what we want to define is what it means for a metric measured space to have a richie lower bound and a dimension bound. It's like this class of Alexandrov spaces. Alexandrovis spaces where we have a curvature bound, a sectional curvature bound, and a dimension bound. Okay, so the definition is as follows. Even a K, which is going to be our rich orbital bound, and an N, which is going to be a dimension bound, a metric measure space is an R C D K N space if it satisfies the C D K N condition. The C detail condition and W12 is a Hill vector space. Okay, so that probably doesn't say much because I haven't defined a CDKN condition, but it can be reformulated in this way. Okay, so for those of you who know Riemannian manifolds, which I guess is all of you, will know Wagner inequality. Okay, so we can define RCDK into spaces by saying that they satisfy a weak Boekner inequality. Okay, so here is our Boekner inequality. Here I have the N, which is our dimension upper bound, and here I have the K, which is our rich lower bound. And we need an extra condition, which is called Sovolef to retrieve property, and this is telling us that. This is telling us that Lipschitz functions in this space Xd can, I mean, every time you have a subolum function, you can approximate it by Lipschitz functions, or you can find a representative, which is Lipschitz. Did I say it correctly? Probably I said it wrong. And correct me, please, if you know about this. So, I mean, basically, Lipschitz functions are. Lipschitz functions are a big space in this double-wanter space. Okay, let's continue. What are examples of these RCD spaces? Well, the manifolds that have a rich lower bound and a dimension upper bound are going to be RCD gaming spaces. Manifolds of this form that Christian mentioned, so when we put a mesh a function A function before the measure, and if they satisfy back the MLB corvatory conditions, they are going to be RCDK. This type of space, so Rn, which is volume 4, or with this measure, is going to be an RCDC infinity, alexandromic spaces, and measured from a household limit of RCD spaces. Okay, RCDK. Spaces, okay, I CDKN spaces. So this class is closed with respect to measured Romo-Hausor convergence. Okay, and as I told you, we want to study volume entropy for RCD spaces. And in order to give the definition, well, we need to know that R C D spaces have a universal cover. And this was done by Mandinho and Wei in Mondino and Wei in 2017. And when it says given an RCD space, there is a universal cover extended, which again has to be an RCDK space, which is what happens with manifolds, that the Richie permit of lower bound passes to the universal covering. And at that time, it was not known that there were a simple. Not known that they were simply connected, I think now we know. And this definition of universal cover was a generalization of work of Sarmanni and Waik. Okay, so now we know RCD spaces have universal cover spaces. Universal cover spaces, yes. And now we can define volume enterprise. So this is a joint work with a lot of people. Of people. So Chris Cornell, I think he's in Indiana. Jersey Dai, who is here. Noyas in Brown, who is in Mexico City. Suarez Serrato, who is also in Mexico City. And myself. So here I go. Okay. I go between Pondesim and Suarez Serrato. So I'm Perales. And then Paul Fanbay, who is here, and he's in Santa Barbara. So basically, this was a tolerance. So basically this was a collaboration between UC Santa Barbara and Mexico and then we added Cornet. So he's just there. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, so let's continue. Definition, when given a compact R C D space, K n space, we define its volume entropy or measure entropy, I guess, by Entropy eigens by this limb soup of the logarithm of the measure of the poles in the universal covered space divided by this R and we take R entropy. Okay, so that's our volume entropy. It's well defined because we are taking zoom. And okay, so once again, with the results that I The results that I stated before in the classical sense work just can work because in RCD spaces there is Picho-Crom of volume comparison. So by Picho-Crom of volume comparison, if XDN, and now I have to write minus n minus 1n. So n is because of the dimension, and minus n minus 1 because of the area. n minus one because of the Ricci lower bound, synthetic Ricci lower bound. Then by this of chromo-volume comparison I obtained again this inequality. And then the theorem that we proved was this statement, the rigidity. So what happens when the volume entropy equals n minus 1? And then for that, we get that the union We get that the universal covered space is isomorphic to the hyperbolic space. And I have to explain what is isomorphic. Isomorphic means that there is an isometry between these two spaces and also that the measures are going to be preserved under this isometry. And here we have to possibly re-normalize the household measure of our So okay, comments. Again, we have if the bottom of the spectrum equals n minus 1 squared divided by 4, then instead of this volume entropy equality, we have the same result. Okay, and this is basically because there is an analog inequality. There is an analogue inequality for the volume, for the bottom of the spectrum for I C D spaces that was proven by Carl Storm. And Jan in 2017, he proved volumetricity for Alexandra's questions. Is there a hope for Ms. Is there a hope for M0? Let's go to the cup, but I cannot go to the cup. Ah, yes, here, the cup. So this was in this paper, we have to bound the diameter of our spaces by some uniform B. And we have to have this axiic condition, so minus n minus 1. So minus n minus 1n, and then there is this epsilon that depends on the dimension, on the diameter, and we wrote here as system condition. So this is basically one system condition if you know about systems. Okay, so if the system is bounded below by some S, then we have that our metric measure space XDN. Measure space XDL is homeomorphic to a hyperbolic manifold of the dimension N and it's measured from a house of clause to this hyperbolic manifold. Okay, so this system condition is kind of weird, but we couldn't prove that the volume entropy is continuous with respect to measurement. Which is equal to measure from a house of convergence, unless we added this condition. And that's why it is second. But I can put news. I mean, this rejected this statement works with no system condition. But that was not proved by us, but it was proved by Chen and Shu. Straight in the statement where it says it's something MgH close. So the size. So the psi is a small parameter and it depends on all these things. Yes, yes, that depends on epsilon and goes to yeah. Okay. Sort of little one of epsilon with the little unfunction depending on these parameters. Yeah, I mean yeah, you keep N and D fixed, N D S fixed, and then epsilon, when epsilon goes to zero, this C goes to zero. Okay. Okay, so how does one prove such theoretics? Well the trick in the classical case and in this case starts in a very similar way. So what you have to do is to construct a nice function u from your current space to R. And in this case nice is going to be that it's the domain of the Laplacian. I mean it's in the domain I mean, it's in the local domain of the Laplacian, and it has to satisfy that the gradient of u, the norm of the gradient of u is 1, and the Laplacian of U equals n minus 1. Under these conditions, in the classical case, you get right away that your universal cover space has to be equal to, and let me write it. So the conclusion then it is well it looks very similar to what is written there. So I have the work product of R with R and let me write n minus 1. Okay? And this guide Okay, and this guy, or let me write it just this way. And you tilde that, and here the measure, or sorry, the Riemannian metric is as follows. I mean, it's our product. So if Tt squared close, and this is actually the hyperbolic space of Okay, but in this case, in which we have metric measure spaces, we cannot prove right away this. We can prove that our space our space x tilde b tilde m tilde is isomorphic to a worked space. Okay, so here I have a metric space and I take a working function. So now because I have a metric measure space, I need a working function for the distance and I need a working function for the measure. When one has a manifold, Riemann almost The Riemann aromatic is already telling me what is the working distance function and the working measure function. Okay? So that's why here I have Wd and Wm. So in this case, Wd is going to be e to the P and Wm e to the n minus 1 multiplied by T. Okay. So we have, and look at this. This is basically I'm splitting one line. So I have x tilde, and what I really want to do is split one line. And then I have the other factor that, let's say, it's transversal to this line that we are splitting. And let's talk about splitting theorems or vigility results in which the proof is very similar. Is very similar. And everything started with the splitting theorem, Chicago-Cromon splitting theorem for RCD spaces and IG. This was proved in 2013. Then Christian Gettel proved ovata rigidity and chain maximal diameter for R C D K spaces. The Philippis and G V E proved poly cone implies metric cone, and there are here other uh rigidity results. Or the GDP results. In all of this, well, yeah, I mean, the idea is basically split one direction and see what happens to the complement of that direction. So our proof is very similar to this journal at some point, and then it's also very similar to this result. And we copy Kettler's calculations to calculate the To calculate the Hessian of the function u that we are going to construct. Okay, so let me just go back. So we want to construct a function that satisfies these conditions, and then using this function, we want to get this white problem. Okay, so a big with big words, what do we do? What do we do? So we have this space extilde and we have this function u. So we can take this gradient of u and with respect to this gradient of u there is going to be a flow like in the classical case, so but this is weaker than the classical case. Okay, so this is called Okay, so this is called a regular Lagrangian flow. So I have this function f, and this function f is going to satisfy these two conditions. So first, the push forward on the f of t of the measure is equal to this quantity. And here notice that it appears like the warping of the measure. Okay? So warping of the measure multiplied by my measure of t. My measure of delta. And then in this part, what is saying is that, and this is, sorry, this should be an x. Okay? So if you fix a point x, x tilde, and you see what happens to the flow at time t and then at time s, this is just s minus t. So along these flow lines to have a geodesic. Okay? Okay, so it's telling you your flow lines once that you fix a point in x tilde are geodesics. And thus we are going to get this r factor. And now we want to study the complement or the transverse of this r factor. So for that we take the inverse of our function u at level set zero. At level set zero. And then we get this exp. We are going to define a distance and a measure in this space to make this space a metric measure space. And then, well, I'm telling you what's the wiping function for the distance, the wiping function for the measure. And then remember that we want to conclude that the universal covered space is isomorphic to this space. Is isomorphic to this space. So I'm going to give you a map from here to here. Okay, so what does this map do? Follow. Maybe I want to drop. And let me throw it case away. I mean, it is strange, but I'm thinking about, I mean, at the end I want to get something like this, right? That the metric looks like And actually, that I have this R factor cross this other factor. And here I have some working functions. Okay, so basically think of this as the line. And do we see why I wrote it this way? So this is my line, and then here I have level set u. u minus one zero. Okay? Because I have this function, this u minus one zero, is not like orthogonal, completely orthogonal. I mean it's not geodesically geodesic sub-manifold. And that's why I am writing it this way. Okay? Because this exponential is telling me Exponential is telling me if you have two points here, they go down where the exponential is smaller to join this point, join these two points. But anyway, so how do we construct these maps S and T, which are going to be inverse of each other given a point in the universal covered space, you can produce a number here by the Here by taking u. So this is going to be actually like the height, the height of the pool. And then calculate the projection to this u minus 1, 0. So it's going to give you this coordinate. Okay? So we have, if our point is here, I calculate the u coordinate. So this is q of x. So this is q of x tilde, and then this coordinate, well I don't know, this is going to be the projection coordinate. And the inverse map is going to be this way. Take a time t and an x and just move it to this flow. Okay, so you flow by time t, this point x that is in the x. And finally, we want We want to apply this theorem that I find it very cool, and I hope you appreciate it. It's coming in the next slide. It says that you can get isomorphism of spaces if you have isomorphisms of Wanted spaces. So, this is the theorem. So, let me see how much time I have. have and it says the following suppose that you have two categories spaces and that you have a function s from one of them to the other one and this function only needs to be a Borel map and then it has to be finite mass to bounded sets and the following two conditions are equivalent so one is that up to an M1 negligible set S is a Would set S is an isomorphism. And number two, as I told you, we want to have an inverse of this S. So we have an inverse T. This only needs to be a real map. And it doesn't need to be an inverse in the whole space, but two refrigerators. So if it's an inverse, and if we have this isometry of W12 spaces, So we want to spaces, then we have, I mean, this is all condition two. Okay? So basically, I told you we have a T, we have an S, and so the hard, hard part is to, well, not that hard, it's just technical, it's very technical, is to prove this type of isometry of sobola spaces. So once you have the S's and isometry up to this negligible set, can you then, I mean, does it Can you then, I mean, does it then have like a bijective continuous representative? Yes, I mean, we showed, I mean, it's usually shown in the theorems before that you have a bilibus representative. Yeah. So then you don't have to worry about these negligible sets. Yeah. Because you prove it even before. Okay. So questions. If there are no questions, I want to give. There are no questions. I want to give you a bunch of formulas, but this is the main idea. Okay? So. So you're going to give us a what formulas you just a bunch of formulas that will convince you that so that's just the incentive for asking questions if we don't this is this is the whole thing this is what I want to conclude and now a bunch of formulas that maybe don't make sense because they are technical so if we want to have a regular Want to have a regular Lagrangian flow that is regular enough, and regular enough means having a continuous representative that actually, for each time Ft we want it to be new sheets, we have to do calculations on the Hessians. And then I think I prove it without wanting. Okay, we want to do these calculations on the Hessians. These are just weak formulas. Are just weak formulas. I mean, it's not this. You have to integrate. Everything is integrated and you have test functions. Okay? So we calculate the Hessian and then an important thing is we have to calculate the Hessian along the flow. So if you have a function f next tilde, you compose it with the flow ft, and you want to know what happens. I mean, you can say to the metric of this new function. Of this new function, and it will give you this nice formula, or you can think of what happens to the Hessian along the flow of these functions. So, with these nice formulas, one gets that f admits a continuous representative, that for every t f of t is a Lipschitz map, and actually we know what is the Lipschitz constant for a Constant or about the Lipschitz constant. And then we want to start working with this space. And to start working with this space, we want to give it a distance. And this is basically the distance. So given two points z and y here, z and y here, because I told you that this manifold is not totally geodesic, then And then what you have to do is take curves that are actually inside q minus 1 of 0. And that's why I have to write mutables with cap. So they stay here, right? And then this is going to give me a metric space. And take the increment of the lengths of the curves and actually live in this set. Okay. Good. Good, and then that's a metric space. And what continues now is that we want to make it a metric measure space. So we have to define a measure and then we want to study the calculus of x prime. Okay, so let me tell you what's the measure. The measure is the following: it's basically given a point, given Given a point, given a set A here. So given a set A here, take the projection 5 minus 1. So it's going to give you a set here. And here you know, in this space extenda, you have already a measure. So I just calculate the measure of this set. But then, because our measure is not Because our measure is not, I mean, because we have working functions, we have to put some weight here. Okay, so that's it. Think about Euclidean space. Then, if you put a box like this, then the weight that you need to do, and if this is zero and this is one, this actually would be weight one, because it's the length of this rectangle. Okay? Okay, and with this measure, we are able to say that this is a metric measure space. It's going to be Hilbertian, locally doubling, and satisfies toward the beaches property. And in order to do this last part, one has to see what happens to the functions, to the L2 functions in x prime. In x prime. And what I am saying is that given a function f, here given f2x tilde of this form, so it's f equal to a function that comes from the base. And actually, this is not doing anything to the base, because this is just one. So think about a function that only depends on u minus one zero and it's constant. And it's constant along the floor lines. Okay, so for those types of functions, we have this equality of the variance of the functions f'. And that's why what can prove here the n solo f to be chips property. Okay, and just to finish, I mean, as I told you, we have to, well, we have to study these W12 spaces. These W12 spaces, and basically you want to say that the W12 space was R cross et et n minus 1 to the t multiplied by x prime, but this W1 to product, sorry, this W12 space of this product is generated by It's generated by functions that only depend on the R component or functions that only depend on the X plan component. And this is the theorem that is telling us that. Okay? And that actually one has an isolation. Okay. Well, that was the the big dilemma. And now how one finishes with the proof of the originality theorem. proof of the rigidity theorem. So from the previous dilemma, one has this isomorphism, then one has to show that this x prime is an R C D minus N minus 1 space. Okay, and notice here that this N is big N. We could like to have N minus 1. So here this should be N minus 1. Okay, and I mean we do it we did it in this way because using the Wick-Bochner inequality that is satisfied for the universal cover, you can pass it to x prime. So then it's going to satisfy a Wick-Bochner inequality, but with the same K and N, the X tilde. And once that you have that this is an R C D K in the space, with this choice With these choices of k and n, one has to draw that really x prime is some r n minus one space. And for that, one has to study the tangent space of x tilde and of x prime. And we do that following the paper of Jen, Wrong and Shu. And that's it. Come on. And that's it. Question.
