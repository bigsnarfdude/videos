So in this presentation, I'll first talk about the motivation of this problem, and then I'll describe our method, and then I'll go over our data set and results and draw conclusions in the end. So the culture cells on colour surfaces usually has a variety of shapes. The shapes are usually affected by the molecular processes happening on the cellular membrane or cytoskeleton. So the relationship between the molecular mechanisms are the same. So the relationship between the molecular process and the cell shape suggests various potential applications of quantitative measurements of cellular morphology. And among those measurements, some biophysical measurements using cell elasticity on tumor cells have shown heterogeneity across cell types, cultures, and measurement conditions. So the data set we use was previously used to develop image processing and hidden. And image processing and data analysis toolbox called Teeswork. So it is a tool to quantify the texture, irregularities, and the spreading of single cells. The data set contains two marine osteosarcoma cell lines, DOM and DON8. They differ based on their macostatic potentials. The control group was treated by dimethosulfoxide, and the treatment groups were treated by gestlopenolide and cytochalicinide. Just propenolide and cytochalicin D. So cytochalicin D binds to the actin and prevents the actin filaments. So it leads to actin D polymerization. On the other hand, dresphakinolide also is an anti-binding drug. However, it stabilizes actin filaments, so it's believed to enhance actin polymerization. And here's a And here's a brief overview of elastic metric for cell shape analysis. In 2007, Mio Edo proposed elastic metric to compare curves, in which they define the elastic metric to be a Riemannian metric on the space of curves. So the Riemannian metric equips the manifold with a smoothly varying inner product at each point on a curve. The elastic metric quantifies. The elastic metric quantifies the extent of bending and stretching to move a curve into another one, and it has been applied to a variety of biological shapes, including biometrics and human body shapes. And recent developments on elastic metric include efficient computation of the geodesics of the elastic metrics. So, here are our research goals. So, first, we want to use elastic. So first, we want to use elastic metric to quantify local deformations of the curves by evaluating how they bend and stretch. Secondly, we want to apply elastic metric to tumor cell images to investigate the elasticity of cell shapes and conditions. And lastly, we want to demonstrate the better performance of elastic metric over the linear metric on tumor cell images. Okay, so let's now introduce elastic metric mathematically. So suppose C is a smooth parameterized curve. H and K are two curve deformations in the tangent space of C, which can also be considered as spender curves. The N and T here are the local unit normal and tangent the local unit and tangent factors. Tangent vectors for C. And then the elastic metric, and then with two parameters, A and B, denoting the parameters of the family, we can define the elastic metric in the following way. It's in the form of a sum of two components. So we can interpret the first component. With the first component. So it is the projection of the derivative of f and k onto the local normal vector of c. So we can interpret it, the interpreted bit as how much to bend the curve. And then the second component is the projection of h and k onto the tangent vector of z, which can be interpreted as how much the stretched occurs. So intuitively, So intuitively, elements in the tangent space of C, so the T C C, represent infinitesimal deformations of C. So here, namely H and K. And the elastic metric quantifies the magnitude of such deformations with the two parameters A and B that can be interpreted as the weight penalizing the cost of bending and stretching. Stretching. And when A is 1 and B is 0.5, the elastic metric becomes the so-called square root velocity metric, which is efficient for evaluation. And in our following study, we used the SRB metric for analysis. And then we define alpha to be a regular parameterized path starting with C0 and ending with C. Starting with C0 and ending with C1. So we can interpret alpha as a prescription of bending and stretching over a unit time interval from 0 to 1. And then we define the length of alpha associated with the elastic metric in the following form. So it's integrating the velocity of bending and stretching over the unit time interval from 0 to 1. And then the elastic, sorry, and then the geodesic. And then the geodesic distance between the two curves is defined to be the minimum half between C0 and C1. So the figure here shows the geodesics between the two curves here. And the one with the shortest path is defined to be the geodesic distance. And it has been recently shown that upon a transformation that Transformation that maps the geodesics into straight lines, the geodesic distance can be computed as the altitude distance between the transformed curves. While the procedure to find such mapping is numerically unstable for general elastic metric, it is simple for the SRV metric. So we can rewrite the geodesic distance for SRV. Distance for SRE using the following formula. So it's a pullback of the L2 metric on the transformation of the two curves. And then we define the fraction mean of n curves to be the centroid of the curves. And we also provide the definition for linear distance and linear mean as our competitor to the SRV metric. Competitor to the SRV metric in those two formulae. And on the right-hand side, it shows a comparison of the fraction mean and the linear mean. We can see that the fractional mean is an element on the manifold, whereas the linear mean does not belong to an element on the manifold. Okay, so let's now talk about our data set and our results. We use the implementation from GeomeStats library. So GeomeStats is an open source Python package built for machine learning for non-living data. It's a field called geometric learning. So it provides object-oriented and extensively unit tested implementations for essential manifolds. For essential manifolds, operations, and learning methods with different execution backpacks, namely non-Py, PyTorch, and TensorFlow. So as we mentioned before, our dataset contains two more remote skills or coma cell lines, the DOM and DLM8. And for our following analysis, we only present the result for the DOM cell lines. So we first pre-process the data set by removing the outliers. Removing the outliers using DecoreMDS. So, DecorMDS is our recently published tool based on the geometry and statistics of synthesis formed by data points, which allows to detect oxorgonal outliers and reduce the dimensionality. So, after the removal of alpha fires, our dataset contains 400 cells with 200 cells in the control group and 100 cells in each of the controls. And 100 cells in each of the treatment groups. So, as we mentioned before, the gaswakinoline and cytotrellicin are two cancer drugs that differently affects the cellular morphology. Since cytotalisin D binds to the actin filaments and leads to and disassembled the and it also disassembles the actin filaments. So, this one leads to affinity depolymerization. On the other hand, the effect of just looking at light is less dramatic, since it leads to the formation of a more diffused action network, but without affecting the stress fibers. Okay, so let's now look at our results. So, we first study the result by visualizing the By visualizing the distances to the global mean shape for different conditions using either the linear metric or the SRB metric. So here, as highlighted by the red curves, we see that using the SRB metric, it detects more irregular cells for the 90th percentile. And also using the linear metric, it detects more irregular. It detects more irregularities for the zeroth percentile. So, this shows that the SRB metric captures more irregularities as percentiles go up. We then study the result by visualizing the histograms of the distances using the linear mean or the SRB fraction mean. So, here there are several observations. The first one is that we notice that the SRB provides a better separation for different conditions. So here you can see the peak of the blue distribution and the yellow distribution and the red distribution is more separated compared to figure A. And the second observation is that using the SRP battery. Is that using the asRP metric, the distribution of cytochalicin D is wider than the distribution of cytochalicin D this one is wider than just volkinolite. And this observation aligns with the biological mechanism that the effects of cytotalism D is more dramatic. And thirdly, on UCPSC. And thirdly, using the SRV metric, we notice the bimodal distribution for the control group. And this observation potentially suggests multiple cell states exist within the same cell line. And finally, we study our results by projecting the data onto lower dimensions using multi-dimensional scaling, where the distances Scaling where the distances in multidimensional scaling is defined by either the linear metric or the SRB metric. So, from the result, we can see that the SRN metric is better at capturing cell heterogeneity, as we can see that the control group cells are mostly centered in the middle, surrounded by just flakinolite treaty cells, with the chalicene E treaty cells. The chalicent neutrino cells be located even further. And we also study the stress statistics obtained for multidimensional scaling for all the dimensions we tested. And we observed that the SRD almost achieve a better stress statistic than the linear metric. And we know that for the figure that we generated here, so A and B, we're using And B, we're using dimension two. And you can see that in the figure C here, the stress statistic for SRT is significantly better than that of the linear metric when the dimension is 2. So this shows that the SR. Sorry, what is the stress distance? Also, it's a good statistic. Statistic and a lower statistic suggests a better fit. The smaller the number, the better is the fit. And so this analysis shows that SRV metric captures more informative problems when it comes to functionality reduction. So in this study, we used the SRV metric to statistically analyze 2D shapes from cell images. And we see that the SRV metric showed better performance over the linear metric for all the tasks we analyzed. Specifically, it shows better performance at capturing cell shape heterogeneity. It provides better separation between different cell groups when comparing their disance to the mean shape. Increases to the mean shape, and it provides better low-dimensional representation when it comes to dimensionality reduction. And in the future, we want to benchmark the SRV metric against the metrics including derivative information, such as the Hessian metric. And secondly, the development of the elastic metric as a tool for practitioners would require more thorough investigation of the morphological. Investigation of the morphological changes and other of the morphological changes observed for different cell types and conditions jointly with other features in the literature. And thirdly, we want to apply the SRV analysis to a larger data set consisting of chic embryocardial fibroblast time-lapse images. And a preview of the image is shown below. And finally, we want And finally, we want to generalize our results to the whole family of elastic metrics. And that's the end of my presentation. I want to thank my collaborators again. Thank you very much. Robert? Yeah, just interesting talk. Two questions. One, is there a particular reason why you chose to optimize stress in NDS? To optimize stress and NBS as opposed to strain? I chose overall. So when you do MBS, so whenever you do MBS, if you do a stress criteria, that gives multi-dimensional scaling, but if you optimize over inside the strain criteria, that gives you PCA. Is there a reason why you chose stress over strain? It doesn't have to be, I'm just curious. Oh, I I think we just pick stress randomly as a metric. As randomly as the majority to show the result. Cool. Other one, this is kind of more of like a high-level thing, and I'm also kind of shooting myself in the foot here. Do you think, just like looking at your shape variation, do you think it's reasonable to think of mean shape for everything that you have there? Because those are some pretty wild contours. Mean the mean shape of the entire population? At once, as opposed to sort of like clusters. So, like, oh, so recall that. Oh, so recall that we have two kinds of comparison. The one with many cell curves, with the, and some ones are highlighted in red. For that one, we use the mean shape for the global population. So that is just one mean shape. And for the second analysis, we use the mean shape for each condition. Okay. So we're adding both conditions. Yep, thank you. Thanks. So when you yeah, when you do the MDS, uh what's your features? Is that just a distance of every contour point? Or did you like a distance matrix, a correlation type matrix, and then I MDS? We just used the either the linear metric or the SRV metric as the distance in the MDS. We didn't use any correlation. Oh you mean like so for example first use the linear metric to get a pairwise yeah so pairwise across all the ships so as long as you have a template shape you'll be just thinking Like typically what we normally do is you do all L right together with some matrix in that do an L2 norm normalization. Okay.
