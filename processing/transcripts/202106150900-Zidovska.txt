It is my pleasure to introduce Alexandra Azidowska from New York University, who will talk about interface chromatin undergoes a local soul gel transition upon gel differentiation. Thank you very much, Eleni. Can you guys see my screen? Yes. Wonderful, wonderful. Thank you so much. Wonderful, wonderful. Thank you so much. Thank you so much for the invitation. I'm super happy to be here. Of course, I would be even happier to be in person. I was very much looking forward to going to Van for the very first time. But hopefully, very soon, we can be all there in person. So, I will be switching gears a little bit here in my talk in contrast to the previous ones. So, I'm an experimentalist, experimental cell biophysicist. Experimental cell biophysicists. So, I will now give you a preview into one of our recent stories or actually discoveries that we have made with respect to the organization of a genome inside of a cell nucleus. So, all of what I'm listing here in my title will be explained in greater detail in a bit. So, bear with me. Since, well, it's yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes. Since we have folks from many backgrounds here in the audience, so I prepared a short introduction to the system for you. So as you know, in eukaryotic cells, the human, the genome is housed in a cell nucleus. So the nucleus, right, for many of us is considered maybe the most important. It may be the most important cells organelle as it houses this genetic material in a form of DNA molecule. Is my cursor visible, Eleni? Yes. Okay. So in form of DNA molecule, and I'll be speaking about the human genome. So there, you can imagine two meters of DNA molecule are packed inside of a cell nucleus that is barely 10 microns. Is barely 10 microns in diameter, and then that nucleus is then inside of a cell. Um, the cell is at the order of about 30, 50 microns. So, here I wanted to give you a feeling for length scales. So, you see that this is a quite an engineering feat, how Mother Nature managed to pack actually so much of the genome inside of it, such a small nucleus. So, how is it packed actually there inside? So, the DNA. So, the DNA is not naked inside of the nucleus, but it's packed together. It's complexed with proteins, histones, forming these here in my cartoon in these little pearl structures called nuclosomes. We have heard a beautiful introduction from Wilma Olsen yesterday about nuclosomes. So, what you see is that overall, we have basically effectively this structure of so. Effectively, this structure of so-called chromatin fiber, which is kind of, we can think of it in a simplified way as a functional form of DNA in cells. So it's the DNA complex with the proteins, and you end up with these spaghettis. Now, as humans, we have, is the bottom part of my slides here visible? It's for some reason, my it is okay, on my screen, it's somehow not. So, as you see, so so. So, as you see, so in the human genome, we have 46 chromosomes, each of which corresponds to one single linear DNA polymer. So you can imagine an inside of a human nucleus, you basically have 46 linear polymers inside. So if such system were in thermodynamic equilibrium, this is how it would look like, right? The polymer mixture would be beautifully mixed, as illustrated by these colorful spaghettis. Colorful spaghettis. But this is not what you find inside of cell nucleus. Instead, it looks like this. So each spaghetti, each polymer sits in their very own, we call it chromosome peritory, right? So each of those polymers is called chromosome, and they sit demix in their own corners. So this is a first sign that this system is very likely not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Thermodynamic equilibrium. So, even more so, there is actually a detailed organization to it, how these chromosomes are organized inside of the nucleus. And this beautiful cartoon by Tomiskelli shows a few of these layers of hierarchical organization of the genome inside of the nucleus. So, it starts with this competent fiber here, as I explained, with the DNA and the nucleosome. So, this is this pearl chain. So, this pearl chain, if you wish. And then this pearl chain is first folded into these loops that form clusters. Those then form, they group together into domains. You might have heard about topologically associated domains. It's a very famous structure in the genome over the past decade. And then these are further grouped into compartments. And finally, here. Compartments. And finally, here you have basically each chromosome sitting in its own here, colorful again, territory. So that's basically each single chromosome. And as this cartoon already illustrates and mentions here in detail, there's a very variability at each level of this hierarchy. And that variability is first level of it is on a from cell to cell basis, but the largest ones, largest variability. Largest ones, largest variability comes from different cell types. So you can imagine that a genome of a neuron might be slightly differently organized than a genome of a skin cell. And we will be discussing it in a moment. Why would it be this way? But let's first think about how do we achieve these different cell types to begin with. So different cell types. Begin with. So, different cell types in our body are made out of stem cells. So, stem cell is a cell, I mean, all of you have heard about those, that is pluripotent. What it means, it has the ability to become any cell type you want. So, as here in this cartoon shown, so you start with a stem cell, and then upon a specific stimulus, it can Specific stimulus, it can actually transform into a specialized cell type. Now, as it specializes, what happens is that, you know, in stem cells, of course, when it's ready to hear what it faith will be, it has all genes transcriptionally available and ready to be used. But once it's already differentiates and it becomes, let's just say, a neuron, then it will not need genes that are used for carrying. Genes that are used for cardiac muscle. And therefore, those unused genes, the ones that are no longer needed, are being silenced. And they are effectively really picked away. So you can imagine that at these different cell types, different genes are being silenced and different genes are being active. And therefore, thinking back to the cartoon that I showed you before, how the organization, right, how these loops and TATs and so on are organized, that will be, of course, very That will be, of course, very closely related to the function and which genes are you using. So, this differentiation process, as you can already kind of intuitively anticipate, will be actually connected with a ginormous reorganization of the genome. Because you are starting with a genome, so with a polymer solution that is more or less homogeneously distributed in a Homogeneously distributed in a stem cell nucleus with each gene being ready to be used. And then you are undergoing this transition to being a differentiated nucleus where suddenly, as I said, you're packing away the parts that you don't need. So those are here this higher density parts, which are called heterochromatin. So we were hypothesizing and thinking that, well, if a system, if a genome undergoes this If a genome undergoes this type of major reorganization, this must be connected also with changes of its material properties, of its rheology, and therefore, right, of its physics as such. So, we started to look into that in detail. And specifically, the system that we employed for this study are mouse embryonic stem cells. So, what you see here, up this small nucleus, is a nucleus from a mouse embryonic stem cell with fluorescent. Stem cell with fluorescently labeled genome. So, we specifically have labels on those pearls on the histone proteins that I mentioned earlier. And what we can do, so we can experimentally beautifully control everything in our lab, where we can induce differentiation of these stem cells. Specifically, what we were doing, we were differentiating them into neurons. So, what you see is here, this is a neuronucleus. Is here. This is a neuronucleus that has formed. It's about two weeks later after you initiate the differentiation of this stem nucleus, and about two weeks later, you will have a neuron on your Petri dish. So it's very exciting. So we are basically following the same population of cells before and after. And what you can see already right away is that first there is a difference in size of the nucleus, right? That's clear. I'm putting them here to scale. Putting them here to scale. And the second thing, the distribution of the genome is very different, right? So let's use thick colors so it's easier to look at. So here, when you look at the intensities directly, you see that my stem cell nucleus is all at one color, rather low densities of at one red color, where you see these yellow islands of high fluorescent intensity that basically correspond to regions of many, many. Basically, they correspond to regions of many, many fluorophores of high compaction. So, you see, you're building these islands. We can also quantify that, right? So, you can actually measure this pixel intensity, and you clearly see here in these histograms that you see it is in the differentiated genomes that you start to see here these high-density states that are not present in the undifferentiated cells in stem cells. So, we started to look even more. To look even further into right now into the dynamics and rheology of these different states. So, to investigate that, we have used a method called displacement correlation spectroscopy that I have developed when I was postdoc with Dave Waits and Tim Mitcheson at Harvard. And that allows us to map displacements of the genome across the entire cell nucleus in real time. Cell nucleus in real time. And so you see, we perform here the DCS for the undifferentiated nucleus, for the differentiated nucleus. And then this is enormously rich in information, what we can learn from that. So let me show you. So first, if you look at local speed, purely here, spatially resolved maps of the local speed, you clearly see again that in the differentiate nucleus, you will have these yellow islands. Those are islands of low speed. Of low speed, so that are immersed here in this bluish regions that are moving with reasonable speed. Whereas you see for the stem cell nucleus, everything is bluish, everything moves actually faster. We can also extract local correlation length. So basically looking at the correlations of local displacements and measure basically the exponential decay of local correlation at every single. Correlation at every single displacement vector. And here you see a map for the same nucleus of this correlation length, where again, here now in yellow, I have places of the highest correlation. And you see, you have again these yellow islands then immersed in a pink sea of less correlated or uncorrelated genome. So how does that actually connect to the picture that I showed you before that we have actually That I showed you before, that we have actually compaction here occurs. So the genome actually starts to pack into this higher compaction islands. So we can obviously correlate and look at it as speed as a function of compaction, also correlation as a function of compaction. And what you can see here beautifully, so the magenta data here corresponds to our differentiated genome. So you clearly see. So you clearly see here that at high compactions here for differentiated genome, you have actually low speeds. As well here for high compactions for correlations, you have here high, high correlations. This phase node does not exist for stem cells. So you see here we have just a few data points. That's why the error bars are here so large. The stem cells basically they exist in this low compaction region mostly. You see that. Region mostly, you see that. So, this is a new phase that occurs here upon differentiation. And this new phase really is consistent with a gel, so with a solid-like phase, which has less mobile and correlated internal motions, which is in contrast of the surrounding phase where these solid islands are embedded, which has low compaction, high mobility, and uncorrelated motion. And we can think about it as sol or liquid-like. Sol or liquid-like. So we went even further, of course. So, this is already a first hint that the genome might be actually compartmentalized by a rheological phase transition. So, you have basically upon cell differentiation, this occurrence of this new gel phase. So, you have your genome organized by cell and gel phases. So, let's look further and see what else can we learn from our special. What else can we learn from our spatially resolved genome rheology? So, if we evaluate the displacements that we measure across entire nucleus for the differentiated one now, where we are focusing now on the presence of these two phases, this is how such a mean square displacement, we call it mean square network displacement because it comes from the DCS, since we are following pieces of patches of network, but it's mathematically, it's analogous to MSD. So, this is for the entire This is for the entire genome. So now we were wondering: can we see actually different displacements specifically also once we start to analyze those in those heterochromatin islands and so on? So we find these heterochromatin patches. We identify those and we measure the displacement of chromatin inside and look how it behaves. So this is how it behaves. And you see the difference was not really there. They're not really there. And that made us very, very, we were extremely puzzled by that. How is that possible? So, you have to consider here one additional thing. We noticed that these islands actually move as rigid body. And this is what I'm showing here is a trajectory of that island as a whole. So, when you actually track this island and compute the MSD of its centroid, this is the motion that it undergoes. That it undergoes. So, in order to reveal the true displacement within the heterochromatin island, we have to correct it for the translatory motion of itself, right, within the C of the ceramic genome. And when we do that, this is what you find. You see that the displacement inside of heterochromatin are basically here at short time scales, more or less constant. So it's very limited. So very, right? It's here, the curve is completely fine. Here, the curve is completely flat. So, you see that this is totally consistent again with a solid-like gel. And we can do a similar analysis also for euchromatin, where in euchromatin, of course, we don't have any island, but for comparison, what we have done, we have identified areas of comparable size with our heterochromatin islands and identified displacement there. And what you see here, that the these are actually here very nicely increasing with. Very nicely increasing with time, so consistent with a liquid-like behavior, right? So you do have motions as a function of time, and the displacement grows with time. So this is very nice. So it truly shows us that a differentiated genome is a biphasic material that contains this gel-like regions embedded within liquid-like regions. So, having this specially resolved analysis and seeing the presence of these two types of materials, we were then thinking: well, if that's the situation, could we actually extract this behavior, extract these two phases also from the bulk behavior of the measured dynamics of our two systems? So, undifferentiated, differentiated. So, here is what we. So here's what we have done. First, on the left side, you see the comparison of the achromatin dynamics in the undifferentiated versus differentiated, right? So we can measure these mean squared network displacements that I explained on the last slide. And you see that stem cells are clearly much more mobile in general, since they are in this liquid phase, right? And so the displacements are larger. It even grows here, the curve rate, much it's much steeper with the time. So you see. With the time. So you see that the dynamics is distinctly different. So, what we have done, we have extracted a bulk rheology from this data in the following way. We have employed the generalized Stokes-Einstein equation, which comes from the framework of a passive microoriology. And now, of course, everyone in the audience is thinking like, well, but how can you use passive? This is an active system. An active system. This is very, very much correct. So, the way how we go about it is the following: we account for the temperature as an active temperature, of course, but there's even one more trick that we need to account for, and that is specifically chromatin. It's in this context advantages because the temperature can be considered frequency independent, which is not true for other active systems. For chromatin, you can do that, and that is based on a previous work. And that is based on a previous work of us and also others showing that first short wavelength fluctuations of chromatin are thermal. And secondly, there is several models, several physical models of active chromatin dynamics were able actually to recapitulate hallmarks of active chromatin dynamics by accounting for activity in the form of isotropic noise. Noise. So, which of given all of this together supports our assumption of frequency-independent temperature? So, let's see what we see once we extract these complex discoastic modulus and here the elastic and loss modulus you see here on the right side. So, on the first look already, you see blue curves are undifferentiated. They're different from the red ones when they're differentiated. Can this difference? Can this difference account really for transition from one phase to a biphasic material? Let's see. So, we performed further analysis, and this is what we found. So, when we look closely at the undifferentiated genome, so when you look at the loss tangent, which is the ratio of your loss modulus to alphaastic modulus, you see that there is actually this beautiful omega to minus one scaling. Omega to minus one scaling. And this is a signature of a maxill fluid. So what we have done, we have then looked, can we actually describe this behavior by maximid with a single relaxation time? How does that work? And have a look. Here are the fits. Indeed, you can describe undifferentiated genome with a pure simple. With a pure simple Maxwell fluid. Now, of course, you can already anticipate that does not work for differentiated genome. There, it's not homogeneous. We have two phases there. This is here the maximum fluid omega to minus one scaling. You see, we're completely off, right? So, so how do we go about it? So, we were searching for a minimal model that would describe basically the emergence of the second phase there. And what we found that it's the Burke. Found that it's the Bergers model that is actually a serial combination of a Maxwell fluid and Kelvin solid, as you can see here in this spring dashboard illustration. So that actually accounts for a presence of a simple solid and a simple fluid. And in this way, we'll have a look. It has beautifully agreed and described our data here now with two relaxation times, right? So we see. So we see here nicely that undifferentiated chromatin can be described by a liquid-like salt phase. Differentiated chromatin clearly shows a existence of two phases, salt and gel. We were able to see them in the spatially resolved measurements as well. You can very nicely find them in their signatures in bulk measurements. And so the very interesting and important point here is that the Important point here is that that new phase emerges, right, upon differentiation of the genome. And that is basically the formation of the heterochromatins, so of the of where these silence genes basically group. And it allows us, by the way, even extract material properties, right? So I have not listed here these specific numbers, but by using estimates for both the effective temperature that we have measured in other previous. Temperature that we have measured in other previous studies, as well as for the size of the genomic domains, we can actually estimate the both effective viscosities as well as elastic modulus, which are, by the way, in a very nice agreement with the plastic micrology studies with injected particles. All right. So with that, I will conclude. So I hope I was trying to tell one concise story. One concise story here to share with you our latest one. You can actually read the details of it. We had a PRL coming out about the story last week. So it's a fresh of the press. And what we are presenting here is that we do have a new novel strategy, how you can extract rheology from intrinsic dynamic of the genome. Note that this is completely non-released. We were purely looking and we have We're purely looking, and we have a complete rheological characterization, right? So, there's no injection, there are no particles, no probes involved. We're purely looking at spontaneous dynamics. So, this is very powerful. And this type of approach allows us to extract and obtain material properties of the genome pre- and post-differentiation. So, showing that the genome compartmentalization indeed happens via rheological phase separation and Rheological phase separation. And that is actually super important because that tells you, right, the material, the local material properties in the genome are explicitly, basically controlling the time and length scales of genomic interactions. And these genomic interactions basically lead to genomic processes, as you know them, from transcription to replication and so on. And those are, right, transcription is at the heart of the central dogma. Central dogma of biology. So it's these, these basically the transcription from DNA to RNA that dictates and controls basically the time scale of all cellular processes. So anything, right, what happens in the nucleus actually impacts the entire cell. So therefore, basically understanding these nuclear material properties is extremely important. So with that, I'd like to thank my team. It's been a pleasure. It's been a pleasure and a lot of fun to work with them. I have been very fortunate over the last several years to nucleate a dynamic group of young chromatin enthusiasts. So you see, this is how our life used to look like. This is how our life has been over past year and a half. But I'm happy to report it actually since last week, we hold group meetings again in person. So we're back to in-person life. We're back to in-person life, even though we have to still social distance in the lab and stuff, of course. So, in addition to all current and past members of my lab, I'd like to thank also my collaborators, funding sources, and you guys for your attention. And I'd be happy to answer any questions you might have.
