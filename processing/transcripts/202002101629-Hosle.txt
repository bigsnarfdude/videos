Rn will just denote the standard n-dimensional of the Euclidean space. We'll use absolute values to denote the standard norm of the Euclidean space. V2n will be the closed unit ball. Sn minus 1 will be the unit sphere. And now we recall that a convex body is a compact convex set in Euclidean space with non-empty interior. And then we will also use absolute values to denote Also, use absolute values to denote the Lebesgue measure of convex bodies. And we will use omega n as notation for the Lebesgue measure of the unit ball. A notion that we will use later is that a convex body is in John's position if the unique ellipsoid of maximal volume contained within it is the unit ball and every such convex, every convex body has to have a unique ellipsoid of maximal volume contained within it. So there are several questions that relate to There are several questions that relate to how can we understand the volumes of convex bodies if we have information of lower dimensional measurements, in particular of sections and projections. A famous example is the Busman-Petty problem that asks if K and L are origin-symmetric convex bodies in Rn, such that for every hyperplane, the volume of the intersection of K with that hyperplane is less than or equal to the volume of the intersection of L with that hyperplane. Does it follow that the volume of K is less than or equal to the volume of L? So many people can. So many people have contributed to this solution. I list some names here. The answer is that yes if n is less than or equal to 4, and no if n is greater than 4. However, there is what is called the isomorphic Boostpoint-Petty question, which asks, can we get some constant such that volume of K will be less than or equal to this constant times the volume of L? Nilman and Peiar showed that you can take as such a constant the isotropic constant of K. Tropic constant of k. The best bound on this is currently of the order m to the one-fourth. This was the result of Plartagen in the end Vampala, who improved on an earlier result of Bourguin. The analogous question for projections is the Shepard problem. It asks: if K and L are origin symmetric convex bodies such that for every hyperplane, the volume of the projection of K onto that hyperplane is bounded by the volume of the project. Hyperplane is bounded by the volume of the L projected onto the hyperplane. Can we conclude that volume of K is bounded by the volume of L? In this case, the answer is yes if N is less than or equal to 2, so n equals 2, and no otherwise. And again, I also list names of people who contributed to this. What Ball showed is the isomorphic version, that you can conclude that the volume of k is less than or equal to square root of n times the volume of L. Moreover, he gave a construction using random. Moreover, he gave a construction using random polytopes where he showed that this estimate was sharp up to an absolute constant. So Vitaly Milmann asked the following variation of these questions. He asked, if K and L are origin symmetric convex bodies, such that now the projection of K is bounded by this section of L, does it follow that the volume of K is bounded by the volume of L? And now the hypotheses are stronger than those of the Bushman-Pettien-Shepherd problem because projections are always greater. Because projections are always greater than sections, or greater than or equal to sections. So you could suspect that it would hold true, and John Oppouless and Kodobski showed that yes, indeed, it is true. So the first question that I will discuss here is a reversal of Millman's question. It asks, if K and L are ordinary convex bodies, where now the section of K is bounded by the projection of L, how can we compare volumes of K and L? So now these hypotheses are weaker than. Now, these hypotheses are weaker than those of Vitali's question, but also of the Boostman-Petty and Shepherd problems. So, because the Shepard problem only holds in dimension n equals 2, clearly for higher dimensions, we can't conclude that the volume of k is bounded by the volume of L. However, even if n equals 2, we can perturb the unit ball and then show that we can't even conclude. Excuse me, what does it mean? So, we cannot conclude that the line of k is rather than... That the volume of k is bounded by the volume of L in any dimension. So even in N equals 2, there's a perturbation argument which shows that you can. It's a typo. Oh, sorry. Okay. So here is, I guess, this first result. Assume that we have our setup where the sections of K are bounded by the projections of L. Now let big R be the circumradius of K and little R be the in radius of L. Then we can conclude that the volume. L, then we can conclude that the volume of K is bounded by big R over little R times the volume of L. And as a corollary, if K and L are in John's position, then the volume of K is bounded by square root N times the volume of L. To see this, this is just John's theorem, because the in radius will be 1, and John's theorem states that the outer radius will be square root n. And I will remark that while our bodies are only in John's position, so this is not for all convex bodies, this does recover the square root n factor. This does recover the square root n factor that appears in the isomorphic Shepard problem, which is a nice fact. So here's the preliminaries of the proof. We recall what the radial function is. If we have a body, we take the distance and then we define it as follows. So that for any direction on the sphere, we take the distance from the origin to the boundary of the convex body, and this will be the radial function. So by simple polar coordinates, the volume of k. coordinates, the volume of k is 1 over n times the integral over the sphere of the nth power of this radial function. Of course, we can also arrange this formula in n minus 1 dimensions, and we have this formula for the section, so that we can write the section as this integral of now the radial function to the n minus first power, but over the sphere intersected with idol line. And we will want to relate these formulas, and we use this following formula, which allows us. Formula which allows us to go from understanding of the averages of f over these hyperplanes to the integral of f over the whole sphere. So now here's the proof. Since k is inside the ball of radius big R, we first write using color coordinates this line here. And now we pull out one factor of r to hit the second line. R to hit the second line. And now we use the formula on the previous slide to exchange this with this. I should remark that this is actually a special case of the fact that the Radon transform on the sphere are self-dual. In particular, so that the integral over the sphere of f times the Radon transform of G is the integral of the Radon transform of F times G, where in this case you would just take one of the functions to be one. So this is just a special case of that. And so now we use, you write this. You write this in terms of the section of k. So we have this inequality. And now we use our hypotheses. So now we have that the volume of k is bounded by this factor times the integral over the sphere of the projections of L. And this is precisely an opportunity to use the Cauchy surface area formula, which tells us that that integral is into this factor, the surface area of L. So now we have this inequality. Quality. And now we use a trick that has appeared many times. It's that since now we have this inclusion, we can write now the definition of the surface as this, liminf. And now we bound it as using this inclusion. Now, simply just pull out the 1 plus epsilon to the n, and we have this limit. If you combine now these two bounds, we get exactly our conclusion. The volume of k is bounded by big r over little r times l. Little R times L. Okay. Yeah, we can also have a different estimate which saves a power on this factor of big R over little R. So it will be an improvement when this factor is large. So to prove this estimate, find a parallel section function as follows. That's this, yeah, this one. And by Fubini, we can write the volume of L of K. The volume of L of K as this integral from minus R to big R, minus R to R of this Perl-Solution function. Now, K is origin symmetric, so this is maximized for T equals zero. This is just a consequence of Brune's theorem, because this is, if you take this to the one over m minus first power, it will be concave, and concave even functions will be maximized at the origin. Therefore, the volume of k can always be bounded by The volume of k can always be bounded by 2r times the volume of any section. In particular, we can take the minimal section. So we write this, and now we use our assumption to get as follows. 2r times the minimal projection. And now this last estimate is simply a result of ball that he did in this paper, which I already mentioned. So Milman and Peyor proved, I guess in the same paper where they described the isomorphic Boostman Petig. The special isomorphic Guzman-Petty question that we can always get this n minus first, this falling bound. Now we replace this by the maximal projection of L. If we now bound the maximal projection of L by its surface area and use the same trick that I had just done earlier, we conclude the following. So now we have two bounds. I will go back. So we have this bound. So we have this bound, and we have this bound, and now we multiply the two together. So we have this, and now we just reduces to this, which is our conclusion. Okay. So now I want to discuss an extension of the result of Janopoulos and Kodobsky to lock and cave measures, and for this I will need the notion of projections for measures. So given an absolutely continuous measure in K at convex body, we can define the general measurement. Define the generalized projection as follows: as essentially an average of the mixed volumes of scalings of K with this vector, minus theta to theta. And here, this is the mixed mu measure of A and B, so defined as follows. And this is a natural generalization of the formula which holds for the Beg measure. And to see why this formula is true, you can, it's not hard to see it for polytopes, and then the general case follows by probability. And then the general case follows by approximation. And I will remark that this notion was introduced by Galena. She introduced this in a paper where she then also proved a version of the Shepard problem for measures with this notion for measures with the positive degree of concavity and homogeneity. Okay, so here's our theorem. Let mu be a log-oncave measure with a continuous rate decreasing density g. And we'll define this later. Now if K and L are origin spectrum convex bodies, where now we have the Metric convex bodies, where now we have this generalized notion of projection as bounded by this measure section, then we can conclude the following. So if we have a convex body k, we can always surround it by some ball, and this will give us now two cases. So if the measure of k is between these two quantities, the measure of this ball, or one of e times the measure of this ball, we can conclude the following assumption about inequality. Assumption about inequality. And if the measure of k happens to fall below 1 over e times the measure of this ball, we can still conclude a result. So this allows us to conclude a result for every convex body. So I will outline the proof of this. Okay, so just definitions. Recall that a measure mu is lock-in cave if it satisfies the following. And a function is lock-incave if it essentially satisfies the same condition, that is, its logarithm is concave. And a measure with a log-concave density will always be log-concave. Will always be log concave. Now, a density is rate decreasing if we have the following. So you can view it as a measure which it has its cheapest maximum value at the origin, and then across down every line it decreases. So here is this, I call it the log-concave lemma just for the sake of this talk. So if mu is a log-concave measure and E and F are measurable sets, then we can conclude the following inequality. This essentially is like the log. This essentially is like the log log concave version of Minkowski's first inequality. So if you follow the proof of Minkowski's first inequality, you only use the fact that Lebesgue measures 1 over m concave. If you use log concavity instead of 1 over m concavity, you would get this. And another technical lemma I use is that if mu is a measure with a rate decreasing density, then we have these following two facts. First of all, this inequality version of the homogeneity condition, and then we have these two limits here. So if you take the mixed volume, Have these two limits here. So if you take the mixed volume of scalings of the ball with the ball over the volume, so we can do it as a ratio of surface area to a volume, then as you take s to infinity, you get zero, and if you take s to zero, you get infinity. So these will appear there. So there's this result of Dan, Paris, and Kuvovarov that I will use, which states that if we look at averages of f over k-dimensional hypersurfaces and take the nth power. Surfaces and take the nth power and integrate them over the Grassmannian of k-dimensional subspaces of Rn. Then we can bound them in terms, get a bound, get a bound in terms of the whole integral F over all of Rn. And here's the L infinity, this quantity is the L infinity of norm of F restricted to the K-dimensional subspace E. Okay. So here's the proof of part So here's the proof of part A. For T and 0, 1 and S to be chosen later, so just fix for now. We use our log and k flammer. We have this mixed volume, and we write it. That's we simply type of. Yes, we go from here to there using our log concave lemma. And then this first term we can simply write as t times the derivative of. Write as t times the derivative of mu tk. And now we integrate both sides from 0 to 1 to get the measure of k is bounded by s times this integral here plus this other term here. And now using Parseval's formula on the sphere and analog of the Cauchy surface area for measures can be proven, namely that we can write this integral as up to a constant, the integral of the generalized projection function. The integral of the generalized projection function over the sphere. Therefore, we conclude the following. Now we use our assumption. So we bound, so I'll go back one slide. We will start by discussing this term and how we can get a better bound on this. Okay. So we now use our assumption right here, and now we just do some normalization to make sure this is a probability measure, and now we just apply Emerson's inequality. And now we just apply Jameson's inequality, but it's false. And now we use this result I mentioned earlier, which allows us to write this integral as the integral of now, we can write as the integral of the density g times the characteristic function of L over this hyperplane. Now we apply their theorem to get the following boundary. And therefore, we have that the measure of k will be bounded by. We have that measure of k will be bounded by s times this quantity plus this plus this. And now we have two terms where we have an s, and we would like to choose the optimal s. And the optimal s will be precisely the s where this equality is attained. And now from that rate decreasing lemma, we know that this quantity will tend to zero on infinity as we go in different directions. So by continuity, an intermediate value theorem has to attain this value. has to attain this value. And now with this choice of S, R, as in the statement of the remembrance, recall that K is contained in the ball, or the volume, the measure of K is bounded by the measure of R times the ball. We may conclude the following. And once more we use the Locke and K lemma. Therefore, we have the following. Now this term we can bound using an This term we can bound using an application of Jensen's inequality to derive the following. And our assumption said that we had this condition, and therefore we conclude this as desired. So now I will discuss part B. So I just figured convenience, here's the statement. Since the measure of K is now bounded by 1 over E times mu of the of R B to mu of the of R B to n. For every t in 0, 1, there exists an f of t also in 0, 1, such that the measure of Rft times the unit ball is E times the measure of Tk. Now if we follow the same setup, I won't repeat it, we get the following. Now because of our choice of f, one term vanishes, right? This is now gonna be one and log of one is zero. Is now going to be 1 and log of 1 is 0, so this term can be thrown away. So we have this thing. And now we use our inequality version of homogeneity to conclude as follows. We write this, and now we just use the bound mu k is always bigger than mu tk. Therefore, we get that the measure of k is bounded by this term times this integral of this mixed volumes. And now we use the same whole argument that was used in part A to conclude this. A to conclude this. It sort of uses the theorem of Dan-Hauri's and Jovaro. And then this just rearranges to this. So this concludes the proof of part B and of this, therefore theorem. So I wanted to also discuss the Loomis-Whitney inequality, which is another famous geometric inequality, which allows us to go from understanding the measure the volumes of projections to understanding the volume of the convex body itself. The volume of the convex body itself. So let U1 through Un form an orthonormal basis of Rn, and K be a convex body in Rn. Then we have the following famous inequality, where equality holds if and only if K is a box with faces parallel to the hyperplanes. This was extended by Ball, who showed that if now they don't need to be orthonormal vectors, but if our vectors are such that there exist constants C1 through Cm, where we Through CM, where we have this is true, then we can conclude the following. This is the rank one projection onto the subspace perpendicular to UI. In our we provide an extension to positively concave and positively homogeneous measures. A function f is p-concave if fp is concave. is p concave if f p is concave t. And moreover, a function is r homogeneous if f of ax is a to the r times f of x, well, positive a. And now we will be interested in functions that are both s concave for some s positive and 1 over p homogeneous for some p positive. Such functions will then be both p concave and 1 over p homogeneous. An example of such a function, such as a constant function, is the following. Following. And this has the property shared by all such functions, other than constant functions, that they are supported on a convex column. And just a notation I will use later on is this. So we will look at g of x plus g of minus x as this g tilde. And I will mention that Milman and Rotem studied such measures in various properties different. So this is lemma due to Borel. Let mu be a measure with a peak. Mu be a measure with a p-concave density g. If now q is this quantity, 1 over n plus 1 over p, where μ is q-concave, then no, then mu is q-concave. So for any measurable ENF in lambda 0, 1, include the following. Moreover, our homogeneity condition for the density of mu also allows us to include a homogeneity for mu. Since it is 1 over p homogeneous, then mu. Since it is 1 over p homogeneous, then μ is 1 over q homogeneous. So that mu of t e is t to the 1 over q times mu e. Okay, so here's our theorem. Let mu be a measure with a p concave, 1 over p homogeneous density, g, and p positive. Then for any convex body k and orthonormal basis, ui, where now, our condition is that the support of g Support of G will always contain either UI or minus UI. And you can assess, so for instance, if the support of G is a hyperplane, we don't want one of the UIs to be the vector. So say if the support of G is U per, we don't want one of the UIs to be that U, as an example. And this is a technicality. And the theorem that we conclude is the following. That mu k now up to this factor is bounded Is bounded by this quantity. Where here now is the analog of the Loomis-Whitney inequalities. We have our projection to now these powers. Note that if you take p to infinity, you essentially recover the standard Loomis-Whitney inequality, except now we have a factor of 2 to the n here. This is, again, the reason for this is because our measures are always supported on half spaces. So we only can get inequalities essentially on half of our domain. Inequality is essentially on half of our domain, because concavity is a condition which only applies on the support of a function. And then I also will mention that I proved a similar version of this for Ball's inequality. Okay, here's an outline of the argument. Take our box Z to be this sum of alpha i times these vectors, where alpha i. These vectors, where alpha i is one over these projections. We use Minkowski's first inequality, essentially for Q-concave measures, but the proof is essentially the same. That allows us to conclude that the measure of K to the one minus Q is bounded by measure of this quantity times the mixed volume of K with the Z. And given how we chose our Z and the definition of the projection as mixed volumes, this will just Mixed volumes, this will just reduce to this. So it'll be, I think, 2 over q or something. And moreover, 1 of ui and minus ui will always be in support of g. So we will just say that ui is in support of g and then g of minus ui is 0. Define fi to be the face of z orthogonal to and then touching alpha i ui. So of this point. Of this box. And now, by homogeneity, we have this. So, why is this true? We have our box Z, and now we subdivide it into pyramids from the origin to all the faces. And since we have homogeneity, we can write the volumes of each of the pyramids as essentially the measure of the face. Where this measure denotes the integral of g over dn minus 1 dimensional set Fi. So it remains to find a good lower bound for these measures of faces. And here's the lemma, which then implies the theorem. So the measure of the faces Fi will always be bounded from below by this quantity here. Recall that alpha i is as follows. So Fi is defined as the phase touching alpha I UI, and then we have the other alphas that contribute to how it is. That contributed to this form. So we have this lemma, and I guess I still have a couple minutes, so I'll get the proof that I'm going to. Okay, so we consider the case i equals 1. So now we have, we have the, we want to, oh, sorry. We want to look at, we study the measure of this phase as integral g over f of i. So we So we write this as integral of gv, where v is now alpha 1 ui plus the sum, where our beta j's have to be bounded and absolutely valued by the other alpha j's, since that is a parameterization of the face. We now, this is an n minus one dimensional integral, we split this up as n minus one one dimensional integrals as follows, where As follows, where we have now essentially we have our face and we have divided it up into according to all directions, whether it's positive or negative. So this accounts for having a permutation of plus minus ones here. So we look at since we write it as follows. Or we now look at beta as positive and this permutation here. And we now just use homogeneity to pull out To first normalize these as follows, and I'm going to pull out this factor. Now we only look at the case where sigma is the identity permutation. And this explains the reason for the two to the n factor. This is the reason essentially because we can't get any bounds otherwise. Otherwise, because we can only use the concavity on the support, this relates to the point I mentioned earlier. So we have the following inequality. Or we have now thrown out all the terms except the permutation is the identity. You can see, if I hadn't thrown it out, you can see why the regular Lee must-Witten inequality holds without the factor of 2 to the n. And now we use p concavity to get the following: lower bound. And uh follows. Yes. And now this cancels out of the denominators here. So we have as follows. And now we want to normalize again, but this time, instead of normalizing these terms, we normalize the GPs, the g's of the p's. So we write it as follows, where now we have this factor which comes up, which appears in a statement of the Lemman theorem. And now we use AMGM and as follows. And as follows, now if you put this AMGM, uh, this product now under the integral, which then easily integrates rather than when you have sums, then you put it under the integral and you apply it AMGM one more time and then conclude the proof of the lemma and the theorem. And I think I'll stop here. Let's ask Johannes any questions. This is not the case, that's just not the case that's just a little bit of a test.
