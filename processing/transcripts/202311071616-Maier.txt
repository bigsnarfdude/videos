Mani's critical value component Hunter Sex system. Manius critical value is a tool that you use in finite dimensional magnetic systems and so we begin with recalling what a magnetic geodesic is. First of all we have a Riemannian manifold and then Y is a skew symmetric bundle endomorphism. Then we call gamma a magnetic geodesic of strength S. If Naples S if navela gamma dot is equal to s times y gamma evaluated at gamma dot. First of all, if you set s equal to zero, you have that whole part is zero, so you get a geodesic equation. The second thing, how I like to think about it, is it's the magnetic geodesic equation is kind of a linear deformation in gamma dot of the geodesic equation. Of the geodesic equation. So then we move on and go to an example. We have S3 equipped with the round metric, then we have here the standard contact form and its kernel is the standard contact distribution. Then furthermore we can split the tangent space of S3 at a point Z into the standard contact distribution and also I times I times the span of I times Z, which is the span of the ray vector field at that point. And then with dimension counting, you see the standard contact distribution is closed under complex multiplication because it's a complex subspace. Then we denote by pi xi the orthogonal projection from a tangent space to a standard contract distribution and then we see Distribution and then we see the Lorentzian force or the Lorentzian force we study here is I times the protection to the contract distribution. Then the magnetic geodesic equation reads as follows. Gamma Nabla gamma dot gamma dot is equal to S times I times projection of gamma dot to just standard contract distribution. So then first one short comment you can the same Comment: You can the same is true for all odd-dimensional spheres because we don't use it here anywhere. And also, the same is true for the L2 sphere, but due to time reasons we don't go into there. Then we move on and out of the I want to present you what's Manet's critical value on S3 for that magnetic system. So it's joint work with Peter Alvers, Gabriele Benedetti and myself. And myself. So there exists a unit speed magnetic geodesic in S3 of strength S connecting to the North Pole and 01 in S3 if and only if S is less than 2. So the first comment of that is that implication follows also from a way more general theorem from Contraas, but this holds only for finite dimensions. Only for finite-dimensional Riemannian manifolds and on them for magnetic systems. But we do our proof independently because I generalized it later into infinite dimensions. And the second comment on this, s equal to 2 is exactly Manet's critical value for that system. We computed it and it's exactly that and you see at the Manet's critical value the dynamics of the system changes. Changes. Then the next comment is: the same holds true for odd-dimensional spheres and also the L2 sphere, but again, due to time reasons, I can't go into that. So I jump to the most, for the most general generalization of that kind of system now, which is following. So I go to my first main result. We go to the League group GM, which is the semi-direct product of. Is the semi-direct product of the group of diffeomorphisms which fix the identity on S1, semi-direct product with all maps of suboleft class M from S1 to S1 where this S1 has length 2 and to some regularity reason we have M is bigger 5 over 2. Then we have phi, tau is magnetic geodesic in GS equipped with the round metric and Equipped with the round metric and some Lorentz force of strength S, if and only if U defined as phi T, where T denotes the time derivative, phi t composed with phi inverse and rho equal to cloud t composed with phi inverse, is a solution of the following non-linear PDE, which I call magnetic deformation of the two-component Hydro Saxon system. And let me allow some remarks to that. First, the first remark is The first remark is the magnetic deformation of the two component Hunter-Saxon system is a linear deformation of the two component Hunter-Saxon Saxon system, which is underlined red. And it's a linear deformation because, as I told you before, the magnetic geodesic equation is a linear deformation of the geodesic equation. So we should expect here a linear deformation of the PDE. Then for s equal to zero, we have For s equal to zero, we have phi tau is again a geodesic, and Leynels has proven in 2013 that geodesics and gm are solutions, then URO are solutions to the two-component hunter-section system. Then we have also the two-component, so the magnetic deformation of the two-component hunter-section system has as the two-component anti-section system also blow-ups. There's some geometric explanation, but I don't really. Explanation, but I don't go into there. So we have blow-ups, and now we try to fix them. With the following theorem, we go to the completion of our group G, which is the semi-direct product of M0AC with L2S1, where M0AC is defined through. We have M0AC is the space of all absolutely continuous functions from the interval 0, 1 to 0, 1, where f is non-decrease. 0, 1, where f is non-decreasing, f0 is equal to 0 and f1 is equal to 1, then it holds the weak magnetic flow in that space exists globally. And furthermore with the same trick as before, if phi tau is a weak magnetic geodesic in M0AZ, then u U composed with phi equal to phi t and rho composed with phi equal to tau t is a global weak solution. Is a global weak solution to the magnetic deformation of the two-component Hunter-Saxon systems. Also, to time reasons, I can't define what global weak solution is, but it's quite natural in that setting. Then, the first remark to that. For S equal 2, this was proven in 2011 by Markus Wunsch, which is a former student of Attenborn Konstantin. And now, really setting to the state the money critical values result for. Manet critical value result for that system. So that's theorem 3. It's Manet's critical value for the two-component Hunter-Saxton system. The first part is if S is less than 2, there exists for all GH in M0AC a weak unit speed magnetic geodesic phi tau of strength S in M0AC connecting the identity with our point. With our point gh. That's similar to the system before on S3, kind of. And then the second part is: if S is bigger equal to 2, there exists no weak unit speed magnetic geodesic, phi tau of strength S, in M0AC connecting the identity 0 and identity times the identity. I really like. I really like the result. And let me comment also for here we can't use a result like the result of Kondridas because that kind of result is limited to finite-dimensional remaining manifolds and I think that's not a finite dimensional remaining manifold. So, Dan, thank you for your time and Question? Yes. So do you have a local bell post theory? Local bell postman theory in the sense of Hannah Mahai as Guerra explained it today, your standard equation. So do you get local bell postmen in HS? I don't think so, but I'm also not an expert on volcano products. So what I get for free is For free is local existence of the local existence and also criteria for global existence. So, criteria for blow-ups, but for that, I'm not sure. But we can discuss if you want to. You mentioned that there were points 0, 1 and 1, 0 on a three-dimensional sphere. What do you mean? But maybe you could sketch a picture of that. Here. Yeah, I prefer something. So, on the freeze here, so S3, you can, S3 is equal to solid to ride and you glue them together. Then, you have on the free sphere, you have here the run ribsol, which is zero equal to them, and here that's the other ribsol. And it turns out on the free sphere, you can't connect that two lines, so the souls of the Two lines, so the soles of the two tori, with a magnetic geodesic if your magnetic field strength is bigger than two. But I thought there were just two opposite points on this field, like south and north pole. Yeah, that's this point and this point, but it turns out you can't connect every point on the field is too strong it just closes up to 'cause the the the Just the they're they they they they're close. I don't uh it's a uh I I think that those cores uh that you connect are just different uh circles of the uh of the hope bundle, so they're not opposite to each other. No, they're not opposite to each other. So we connect two different circles of the hope uh link. Yeah. So it's a hope bundle on a screen. But the magnetic geodesics on the sphere aren't they just circles of constant radius? Constant range. That are the picture downside. So, what you have is the magnetic geodesic upstairs, it spirals around the rib orbits, so like the blue one, and it projects down to a circle with given radius here. It depends on some angle and the magnetic field strength. And here C you can set equal to one. But what you see then, below the magnetic critical value, you get all you get. You get all you get circles with radius equal to zero, tilt circles equal to zero, the radius a half for fixed magnetic field strength. And so you can kind of cover the whole scale downside and that's why it's not. So what you described is the magnetic system downside, so on S2, but we are considering the magnetic system on S3. That's the difference. S3. That's the difference. And so it turns out that magnetic geodesics on S3 can project to geodesics on S2. And that makes it complicated. And then downside, you can connect that soul with that soul exactly if you can connect the North Pole with the South Pole with a projected geodesic curve. Maybe we wait until uh next talk. Wait until uh next talk. I think we have to start the next talk. Thank you again.
