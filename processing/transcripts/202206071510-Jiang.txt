Okay, so thank you very much for the kind of invitation and introduction. Good afternoon, everyone. I'm from University here in China. It is early in the morning here. It's my great pleasure to share with you our recent research on developing for the cell type identification based on single-cell colonial. Single cell colonial sensibility data. Our human body consists of about 50 training cells. These cells belong to different body systems, exist in different organs, and form a variety of tissues. Even in the same organ or tissue, the cells may be different in morphology and biological functions, resulting in different phenotypes. resulting in different phenotypes. Therefore, we usually define cells sharing morphological or phenotypical features as a cell type. The identification of cell type is crucial to both biology and medicine. In fundamental biology, if we could somehow know the evolution of cell types from a single cycles to the human body, our knowledge about developments will be Knowledge about governments will be quickly. Sorry, there's a very strong echoes. I don't know if it's from you or from somebody else. If you can just turn off your mic. Read you hear echoes? No, I don't hear you ask. Yeah. Not really. Maybe I just continue. I don't know what everyone else was muted. Everyone else was muted, um, and he was the only one talking, so it must it must be something on his end. Is it better? No, the same, I think it's better. Continue, please. Okay, so an example is a research about the several fish development cell by cellar in 2018, which is selected as the breakthrough of the year by science. In medicine, cell heterogeneity results in tumor cell types, and thus the identification of corresponding cell types could greatly facilitate the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. So, with such understanding, people have been figured out various means for identifying cell types, for example, with inclusion. Examples with including the emission of immunofluorescence and the single-cell sequence. Of particular interest is the single-tail sequencing technology. In the recent 10 years, sequencing has enabled not only the identification of the genome, the transcriptome, but also the epigenome and the spatial organization of TO. Of tissues, thereby providing a powerful means for identifying cell types. Let's say a very brief summary of methods used for cell type identification research user data. So according to the data involved, we cannot be classified as methods into those using single cell analysis data. Using single-cell army circulator, and polyomic data. With single-cell army circulator, the feature has gene expression, which is high-dimensional and sparse. With single-cell attack security, the feature is common accessibility of the peaks in the genomic region, which has the property of ultra-high dimensionality and ultra-high. Ultra high dimensionality and ultra-high sparsity. So, according to the modeling methods used, you can roughly classify the methods into the unsupervised, weakly supervised, and supervised ones. Unsupervised methods only use experimental data. Typically, we talk to cluster analysis to discover novel scale. To discover normal scale heights. Weakly supervised method also incorporates data with draft annotations such as the file sequencing data. So this class of method also results to cluster analysis to discover normal status. A supervised method uses favor with detailed cell types. The favor with detailed cell type annotations, such as cell atlas, and resource to a classification task to annotate known cell types. From unsupervised to quickly supervise to supervised ones, more information is used. In the recent years, my group focused on the development of developing methods for cell type identity. Methods for cell type identification with single-cell carbon accessibility data. Following the unsupervised formulation, we proposed a definitive model for the drone shape for density estimation and then developed SD depth for simultaneous crossing and narrative reduction. Following the weekly supervised formulation, we proposed RA3 and DC3. 3 and DC3 to incorporate reference sequencing data with draft annotations. The following supervised combination will develop FPNO and SQL for cell type classification. So, in the following slides, I will briefly introduce those methods. The hallmark of the single The hallmark of the single-cell common accessibility data is archaeological dimensionality and archaeological high sparsity. These characteristics suggest a demand for new theory and methods for dealing with this data. With this consideration, we propose a deep generative model for the drama shape for density estimation of high-dimensional data. The idea is to construct a bi-dimensional To construct a bi-dimensional mapping between the data space and a latent space, which is of very low-dimensionality. So the bi-directional mapping is constructed by using two sets of generative serial networks. Here is G is a G network, which is a neural network. neural network called a generator which is used to generate data from the latent space this tx is called a discriminator which is a neural network for distribution the generated data with the real data x similarly h is a generator for generating data from the data space From the dataspace, DA is a discriminator for distinguishing the simulated data from the reference data, from the latent, in the latent space, which is standard reference distribution. So, with these two sets of scans, we are able to utilize, further utilize the important sampling or approximation as made. Approximation as measure density in the latent space, which is in the low dimensional, and then map the data map the density back to the high dimensional data space. The performance of this geometric model is superior to several existing methods for analytic estimation. Estimation. This model is also applicable to sort of a variety of machine learning tasks, such as the supervisor classification, unsupervised functionality reduction, data generation, outlier detection, and clustering. Particularly, the application of round-free cell type identification results in unsupervised cell cross-stream methods. Set mastering method called SCDEF. This model encourages self-have labels labeled into the different space and thus enables simultaneous narrative action and cell clustering with some single-cell components data. So it demonstrated that the performance of SCP is superior to seven methods in. To seven dataset methods in four data sets according to three evaluation criteria. And this method is robust to different drawout rates. Besides a C is also capable of integrating paired single-cell anonymity data and single-cell latexic data. This can be done by simply concatenating gene expression and the chromium accessibility together to obtain the combined features. And the results show where agreement is true type annotations. So this unsupervised method only uses experimental data, and thus the requirement is low. However, this method may have a low-end. However, these methods may suffer from such data features as high noise and the batch effects in single surveys. And these methods are hard to identify rare set types. And the other hand we notice that in the past two decades, there have been abundance of sequencing data accumulated. And this data also contains summary information about the About the types. Besides, bug data are usually of low noise and low sparsity, and thus could be helpful to overcome the high noise and high sparsity problem of single study. So there have been some methods making use of bad data as a reference to complement single-cell data in setup identification, but most of this method assumes. Most of this method assumes that the biological variation is identical in single-state and reference data, and that reverse mathematical modeling. So, to overcome these limitations, we propose a weekly supervised generative model called RA3, which can decompose variation in data to three components. First, the shared biological variation between Shared biological variation between the single-site data and the reference bar data. Second, the unique biological variation in single-site data. And third, other technical variation. Specifically, these three components are equivalent to the linear model. So let's go with So we demonstrated that the performance of this RA3 method is superior to six existing methods according to both qualitative visualization and quantitative evaluation. Besides, the incorporation of reference data can generate to greatly facilitate downstream analysis such as the computer. Such as the filtering inference and the gene regulation analysis. The reference bug data can be obtained with high flexibility. For example, you can use bug textic data, bug genetic data, or even aggregate single-cell textic data to generate the reference data. To facilitate the generation of the reference data, we first developed a web server called FOPENLP, which can annotate computer accessibility regions with very high speed. So, this idea of weekly supervisor learning says borrowing information from bug segmentation. From bug sequencing data to help the analysis of single-cell data that is further incorporated into the construction of gene regulatory networks. So here we propose a matrix characterization method called DJ3. This method includes single-cell RNA-seq data, single-cell attack-sip data, and bug high-sheet data. High sheet data. So, through the deconvolution of the button data, this method performs cell clustering cluster inferring type-specific relationships, imagery with generating cell type-specific gene-related relativity networks. For example, some of correlated networks. Of correlative networks in the differentiation of mouse and prionic stem cells. As shown in this slide, we can see clearly that these networks are different in both the genes involved and their interactions. So, with physicalized learning methods, only means Learning methods only means reference data of rough annotations, such as they belong to the same teacher or same organs. But because the availability of such reference data is still very high, the weekly supervised method has a broad scope of publication. Nevertheless, in a weekly supervised method, only limited information is incorporated. Is incorporated due to the inequality size annotations. The other hand, recent development of various cell accesses have been making more and more coverage cell type annotations available. For example, this AECA, meaning a human-advanced cell address, is a cell address developed by Tsinghua University. In this address, over one meaning, human cells are assembled. Human cells are assembled into a cell by gene matrix. Sorting a joint, this is called a unified joint table called UCT and annotated with a unified hierarchical annotation framework called UHF. You have. But the detailed cell type annotations provided by such cell addresses, a natural question is how to make use of such information to annotate known cell types. Topic in this question, we propose a patient neural network called FPNO for cell type annotation. The best way to generative model is a supervised training model. A supervised training procedure specially designed for analyzing the cell data. So the model takes cell-by-peak matrix as the input, which is deducting from some pre-procession procedure. And this model assumes that the peaks are generated by a Gaussian-nich model in a latent space. In a latent space through a patient neural network. So the dimensionality of the latent space is far less than that of the original space. This model can give accurate and interpretable type annotations in our study. The performance of this method is superior to 11 baseline methods. Thanks to the supervised training procedure, this model can effectively table remove basic facts in the data. Moreover, the latent features are excellent in comparison. For example, in this table, we can see that either latent feature six or latent feature nine is enough for identifying the three. Identifying the three cell types in the data. The identifying cell type specific peaks show obvious features specificity. For example, in this figure, we show that this information too alone is enough for identifying extra side steps. With the beach network, we can map this feature to And this relates the feature to the peaks. So, from the bottom figure, we can clearly see the specificity of the peaks, but it is very different from the peaks of other cell types. So, sneaker engagement analysis ensures that these peaks are enriched in brain-related tissues. This observation also exists for other brain-related types like like here and here are not for background peaks. So these peaks are enriched in a variety of tissues, not specific to some specific tissue, specific organic tissue. This type specific takes also operators to this association. For example, we can see that the SNPs associated with six Associated with six neurological diseases are enriched in brain-related set types, but not in that one case. In addition, the set type-specific case show over higher overlap with enhancers specific to the same set type, like the diagonal of this matrix. Diagon of this matrix and also the interaction between these peaks to clear cell type specificity. This academic model is also capable of analoging newly sequenced data. For this result, we can see that the performance of this method is much higher than those of the other baseline method. Or the baseline method. Okay, so to the nature of the generative model, we can also use this LF animal model to simulate single-cell adaptive data. Now we can see that the data generated by this model is very similar to that of the real data. The quality is much higher than an existing method for generation. Existing method for generating smooth data. Ria, I think you should wrap up in one two minutes. Okay. In summary, we developed a series of developed methods for cell identification systems in cell component accessory data. The following idea of unsupervised weakly supervised and supervised learning. So along this line, So, along this line, the requirement for data annotation becomes higher, while the requirement for manual creation becomes lower. So, it is expected that our efforts in developing for cell type identification can also be applied to other fields, such as spatially resulted economics.

And uh great thank you thank you very much um and any questions uh for Ray quick questions okay great so we have a little time left I think Jesse Shapiro from McGill University going to lead a discussion of what we learned today a lot of really interesting talks Jesse if you are ready In talks. Jesse, if you are ready. Hi, everybody. Yes, I'm ready. I'm sorry I can't be with you in person. I'm here in Montreal. I certainly learned a lot. I use a bit of machine learning in my own research, not neural nets, and not single cell either. So I'm a definite non-expert here. So I will moderate the discussion, but I will probably. Moderate the discussion, but I will probably leave most of the talking to our speakers. So I guess are there any remaining questions or maybe questions for all the speakers in this afternoon's session? So maybe I'll start with one that could go for all the speakers. Could go for all the speakers is what do you think are the next challenges or the places that these methods need to go? Or is there new data that's coming down the pipeline that we need to be ready for? Is single cell sequencing is that the standard? Are we sort of in a plateau? Are we looking at people just sequencing? Are we looking at people just sequencing more and deeply? And the current methods are poised to work with that? Or is there new data, new challenges, new methods that we might need? So I'm curious where everyone sort of sees this field going next. And I guess that's a question I'm going to pose to. I am going to pose to any and all of the speakers. If there's anyone who is interested in commenting, I see Sarah and Nancy have turned their screens on. So not to end so has Jingyi. I don't know if that means you're ready to comment. Sure, I can say it's a comment, Challenge. I can say two common challenges that I see, and for sure to chime in others. So, one common challenge is interpretation difficulties. So, neural network models, I guess, historically, traditionally, they're kind of viewed as black boxes, although they don't have to be. But it's definitely more challenging to figure out what features and combinations of features are learned by complex model as opposed to simple linear models, because in simple linear models, you have Models, because in simple linear models, you have a coefficient and you have a statistical test for determining whether or not a coefficient is significant. You don't have an analog in that and some of these deep learning models. But I think that being said, I think there is lots of method development that are going on. There's actually like at least dozens of so different methods that are available. And we're actually writing a review on this very topic. So maybe you can check for the reviews that are coming. Check for the reviews that are coming up and application to genomics. But yes, I think that's one area that we need more work on method development. The second area is causality. So, I mean, our models are just finding correlations and data, right? And there's no, and if people actually, if you want to go further, we need to use, understand what they're making predictions about or the features that they're learning and do experiments on them. But if we don't have any. But if we don't have any indication of what has been found, it's causal, it's hard to prioritize experiments. So I think figuring out how to inject causality into these kind of models is a really important topic as well. Yeah, great. Thank you. Yeah, absolutely. Do you think that just a quick follow-up, and then I'll let other speakers comment as well. Is time series data something? I mean, I think often that's useful. I think often that's useful in establishing causality: you know, if X causes Y, then X should happen before Y. So I know we've talked about some, you know, spatially resolved data, different cell types, but I mean, is that a data type? Sure, I think like a common historical assumption was by Grainger Causali, so distance and time, but I don't think that guarantees that you have causal relationships in biology where you have lots of different variables and there could be underlying hidden factors. could be underlying hidden factors that you haven't measured. But definitely that's like kind of more temporal measurements will definitely help. The challenge that I see in biology is when we talk about time series data, it's often very sparse times, like, you know, three or four time points that things can be measured. I guess in single cell data, where you have pseudo times and things like that, there's a different story, but I guess traditionally, when we say we have time series data in biology, Have time series data in biology, we're really talking about three or four time points, and it's really hard to do something with that. Yeah, absolutely. I see a follow-up question from Celia, um, who says, RNA-seq and single cells, particularly immune cells, adapt to external challenges like infections. Will similar analytic approaches identify responses to specific challenges? Does the framework of cell type need to be expanded to include how a cell responds to a stimulus? I think this is a great, I also had. I think this is a great. I also had a question, a general question about, you know, what are these cell types? And, you know, in the last talk, we talked about supervised and unsupervised approaches. You know, of course, so you can, in an unsupervised fashion, you can define cell types. But I guess the immunologists have a sense of what these cell types are. You know, it could just be based on the expression of one receptor or something like that. But as Celia says, that can even be. Celia says that can even be dynamic in time or in response to the condition. So, any comments on that? I'm happy for others to chime in because these are really hard questions. Sure, yeah, yeah, no. Yeah, and I guess, you know, I think our thinking of what cell types are, not just mine, like as a field, I think, has really evolved. So, in a way, cell types could mean different things depending on what data you. Different things depending on what data you're using to measure what you're measuring to quantify cell types. So, historically, there's been things like cytokine or receptors and other immunological measurements, but based on like single measurements, we kind of quantify cell types. But I guess more recent data or more recent measurements show that there's different dimensions to that. So, for example, cell types between RNA-seq and intact-seq don't necessarily agree. Necessarily agree. And I guess, as method development people, to us, we always think about: okay, well, what's the common denominator? Maybe we need to combine them to find what is common between all these different data modality that explain the data. But I think from a biological perspective, maybe we need to think more broader. There's different, these data capture different aspects of cells and how they function, and they don't necessarily need to correspond to the same. Need to correspond to the same, I guess, functional units underneath. So, I guess, yeah, I don't really have a good answer to that, but I think we have to think about what we mean by cell type, depending on how we're measuring things. Yeah, yeah. I think Jing Yi has a comment as well. You're on.
