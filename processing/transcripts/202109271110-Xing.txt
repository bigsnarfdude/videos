Thanks for the organizer for this citing workshop. So, as Tom mentioned, I want to share our work on cell phenotypic transitions. So, a puzzle that's been really thinking a long time is: you know, I noticed eukaryotic cells like mammalian cells have different cell types, and they're very different both in morphology. And they are very different both in morphology, expression, and function, but they all come from a single fertilized egg. So, how this can happen? So, it means cells can change their phenotype. This happens in developmental process, like what I'm showing here specifically show this epithelial to mesochemo transition, the EMT, and also its reverse process, mesochemo to epithelial transition, MET, happens back and forth several times during the development. But those processes. But those processes also are hijacked by process like cancer metastasis, fibrosis. So it's a lot of biomedical reason why we won't study it. And another example is reprogram terminal differential cells like fibroblasts to induce the pluripotent stem cells, then differentiate in other cell types, or directly transdifferentiate from one phenotype to another cell type. To another cell type. Okay, so all this with the question is: how do cells regulate phenotypes and how we can control cell phenotypes? So let's take this example. This is a human A519 cells treated with TGI-beta. They will undergo EMT. So show here, cell change the shape after two days of TGI-beta treatment. And here we have a fluorescent labeling on Vamington. It's an intermediate filament, protein, and also. intermediate filaments, protein, and also mesochemical marker. So you see both expression and its texture feature being changed. So this is typically how a biologist view phenotype transition. But for a mathematical modeler, the language will be, okay, they're a network of molecular species. They interact with each other. So we can write down a set of mathematical equations and do analysis, like bifurcation analysis. So the analysis. So, the underlying reason for this is that we know that cellular processes are cells are dynamical systems. So, we believe there's a dynamical equations describe the cellular process generically like here. So, a central task in modeling mathematics studies to determine this function form. And this is the focus of my today's talk. So, you notice I haven't talked. Um, so you notice I haven't told anything about what is X, right? So, this is the first effort here I'll talk about is that we do life imaging. You want to really want to study how the dynamic, the dynamics. And here, we do have to really consider what to monitor. So that's X, right? So because it's a life cell imaging, there are a lot of constraints. We have to keep this cell happy. We have to find something that can faithfully reflect. Can faithfully reflect the process we are interested in. The first thing is candidate, we start to label some proteins. And actually, my lab spent a lot of efforts to develop a CRISPR technique to knock in. But then you realize it's very time-consuming, a lot of efforts. Then we come up with the idea, okay, we can just monitor some collective cell morphological features of cells. Of the cells. So, actually, you know, those morphological features have been already widely used in pathology and in other cells like phenotyping. So, here, I mentioned this morphology features in general form, really mean anything that we can easily monitor through like transmission light microscope or with a simple staining or labeling. So, then if you think about it, then it's kind of natural. About it, then it's kind of natural why we want to do collective features. Just think about you have a gas chamber, right? You can either describe the system by the particle, individual particles, or you use some collective variable like the pressure, volume, temperature, or things. So, yeah, here I want to write a very feature important conceptual difference between our efforts and that's existing phenotyping. Exiting so phenotyping type thing is we treat those features as dynamical variables, it's not just statistical quantities. This is a very important point to keep in mind. So then we have a lot of image. We need to do image analysis. The first step is that we segment individual cells. So we develop a deep learning-based technique and it's published. So I won't go to the details. It's only technical. So with the data, we need a The data we need to transform into quantitative information so we can do further mathematical analysis. So, the present like we have this image, segmented image, then we double this active shift model from video computer vision. So, the idea is that we place those image points uniformly on the periphery of a cell so we can approximate the cell shape. Then, so each point have x, y. Then, so each point have xy coordinates. Therefore, the cell shape will be represented by a point in this 2n-dimensional shape space. You can do further principal mode analysis from a complete orthonormal basis set, so cell shape. So, any shape can be expressed by a linear combination of the basis function. So, now you see the language start to seem familiar, right? So, for this human A519 cells, we have used this active sheet model to This active shame model to represent the cell morphology. And use similarly, we use this 13 hierarchical features to represent the vitamin and its expression and texture features. The overall pipeline like this. First, we do time-like image. Then we do a cell segmentation and track individual cells. We track the features and represent cell state in this composite morphology. It a morphology environment feature space. Then, so each cell, then with time lapse, right, we got this individual trajectories in this cell state space. We can then do further analysis using tools from chemistry and physics. So, here show you an example. So, this is one cell we just took from the real image, and the yellow is the vinyl. Image and the yellow is the vitamin. So you can sell it's two day long continuous imaging, and you see it cells change the shape and vamington change. So the right one shows the top of the shape. Here, this is the single cell trajectory we follow over time. And it's represented as a high-dimensional trajectory, but it represents in two leading PC space. So here, two typical trajectories, you'll rarely see they're very different, right? So this one is they first. So this one is the first varmington change, then followed by morphology change, and this is concerted change of varmington and morphology. So we have many of these trajectories. We can group them. We use this time dynamic time walking, which compare the similarities between trajectories. You can see indeed they separate into two clusters corresponding to two types. So in chemistry physics, we have accumulated a lot of techniques that a single Techniques that the single molecule trajectories. So we can apply similar ideas, techniques to analyze the single cell trajectories. So if I tell you, you know, a cell in some sense, like a molecule, you may think that's kind of, you know, they're two very different. But if you think about it, both are dynamical systems and they share some similar mathematical description, then you see the similarities. So indeed, so for cell phenotype change or chemical For cell phenotype change or chemical reaction, similarly in this cell state space, high-dimensional cell state space, we define the region, it's our initial state, and region and final state. Then we ask if how the cell or the system change from the initial to the final state, you got through the trajectories. And you may think about a trajectory start from the initial states, then go through on, then go back. That's what we call the non-reactive trajectory. That's what we call the non-reactive trajectories. If they go out, then end up in the final state, we'll call the reactive trajectory. So, we can find from example for reactive trajectories. So, we can do a lot of things like a transition path sampling, reaction coordinates, reaction reactive flux, reaction tube. That's something I'll discuss later. So, all these terms, we have been developed technique concepts in chemistry and physics for many years, and we can now apply. Years and we can now apply to single-cell studies. So, I was trained as a theoretical chemist where I always dreamed that one day I can really visualize how chemical reaction happens in an atomic scale. But now here, when it's very difficult, but now I can really observe a cell change in the high dimensions. One central concept in re-theory is the reaction coordinates, which describes how the progression of a transition process. The progression of a transition process, as you may remember in the introductory biochemistry course for physics, by physochemistry course, or for physical background, you may familiarize the Walking, you know, biology background, Wadington landscape, right? Talk about this. So you see this is cannalization, right? This is a valley, something related to this concept of reaction coordinate. So therefore, we can apply this concept in this our single cell study. In this, our single-cell studies. And consider region, start with region A, you go to B, and you make many trajectory connects them. Each trajectory has a certain probability. So we have given by action. And so you see clearly that lower action means higher probability. And those reactive trajectory, the ensemble of reactive trajectory, like they form a tube on this high-dimensional space. So the center of the tube can be used to find the reaction coordinate. Use to this find the Ragging coordinate. So, this is, therefore, we adopt this finite temperature string method developed in chemistry, chemical physics. So, the idea is I've shown here, we have a space space. We can have this is the reaction coordinate. You can first have a trial. So, then those points divide the whole space into this Veroni cells and the background are really the data, right? So, we tried for each Veroni cell, we tried. Tried for each bonus, you try to find the centroid of this vertical cell. So you do iteratively that you find what's the best erection coordinates from your real data. So here shows the two reaction path reactants we reconstructed from our data. So see, this is the, you know, so shown this representative trajectories, indeed, individual trajectory that fluctuated fluctuate around. That flags around, fluctuate around on this reaction coordinates for both paths. Furthermore, so we have life site imaging. We know the coordinate, we know its velocity, right, because it's a life site imaging. Therefore, we can try, if we assume this Ansas is a governing equation, we try to recover this governing equation. The idea is if we think about it, you can re-write this as a continuation equation, then this J. Equation, then this J is given by this, right? Either under Stradnowich interpretation, it's just F, then, or if you atal, you got actual term. So this immediately suggests how we can recover this F function from just the data. So let's make life easier here. We want to really just project the system only along the reaction coordinate. So it's one-dimensional. So it's one-dimensional. So this is reduced to this answer. So, and you see, we can define a pseudo-potential derivative. Pseudo-potential in this case, you see, is kind of equivalent in conservative system to the potential mean force. So here, what you can see is, so we have the Veroni cells, right? If you zoom in, you saw these data points. So these data points represent each as an image, the data from the image, and also its velocity vector. So for each Varuni cell, we just do the average for those velocity components along the reactant coordinated direction, the tangent component. Then you will get this defined, and you integrate, you'll get the potential. Pseudo-potential. You'll get the potential, pseudo-potential. So, it's a make sure it's a pseudo-potential, right? So, this is exactly what we got from the data. So, uh, and this is the two paths at the beginning. The epithelial state is residing in a high-dimensional attractor. So, when we treat TGI beta, this attractor destabilized, and then the system slide down to a new attractor. And interestingly, here, you see, you see this flat region, kind of remnant of. Kind of remnant of the existence of this Vamington attractor. So, indeed, we decrease the TGI-beta concentration, then this attractor becomes clear. Even you can see a matter stable state. My postdoc told me, he said, oh, I have found some very surprising result. If we treat it with one nanogram million load TJ beta, I see most of the trajectories go through. Most of the trajectories go through this concerted vibration path. But when I treated with four nanograms, then we found this path become dominant. So it's very strange. But then I told me, it's just like, you know, we like a blind people try to figure out how an elephant looks. We have to piece them together. Then a picture emerge. So here I will show you just the metaphoric potential system to represent, although the whole system, really the real system is not. System, really, the real system is not a potential system. So, you see, this what happens is at the beginning, without TGI beta, you have this E attractor, F0 attractor. Adding TGI beta emerge a new attractor and also unstable fixed point and two saddle points connects the two attractors. So, when we further increase TJ beta, the lower side of point collide with A point collide with this ego tractor, destabilize it, and so you see there's a possibility that episode cells will convert to this attractor, but the upper saddle point is still there. You further increase T-Di beta, then this saddle point also collide with the original E-attractor. Now you have both of the pathways can be populated. And turns out this is the outer one become easier to go. And so this is the same thing with a And so this is the same thing with a kind of a movie to illustrate the whole process, means how TGI beta can change the landscape of the system. So I want to show you this is, I feel this is a very cheap experiment. You see, I do just do DIC, you know, label transmission light imaging plus fluorescent imaging. But if we quantitatively analyzing the data, we see how deep insight. I'll go back to this satellite later. But first, I want to change the But first, I want to change it to change the gear. Well, you may say, Okay, you look at those things in this morphological cell feature space. Well, it's good, but cell biologists really want to talk about genes. So, here, like I talk about toy model, there's a two genes mutually inhibiting each other, self-activation, that toggle switch. So, typically, we model like this. We have two genes, then we write down this ODE equations, describe the interactions. We have parameters we determine, then those Then those dct actually form a vector field in my state space. So it tells me if I the cells in one specific state, where and how it will go next. So if we know the record field, we know how the system dynamics. Then the question is, so this is a small network, we know embedded in large network. Can we reconstruct a genome-wide white field? Well, you may think this is mission. Well, they may think you may think this is mission possible, it's crazy. Then, several years ago, there's a very interesting paper in single-cell genomics field. So those people said, okay, we know when we do single-cell RN-C study, you have to destroy the cell. You can only get snapshot cells. However, actually, we can get some snapshots, some information of the dynamics. So, think about the gene. Dynamics. So, think about the gene for the transcription, got unsuppliced MRA, then got the splicing, got spliced MRA, got degraded eventually, right? So, from the data, we can really read all this unsupplied MRA and spliced MRA. So, if you have found a way you can estimate this gamma degradation rate constant, then we can estimate this DSD from here. They call this RN velocity. So we have extended this framework in general, to be more general. Specifically, we show if experimentally we combine this tactic called the metabolic labeling, which use chemical to treat the cells, then induce some mutation and become sequenced. So that from there, we can directly infer the MRI turnover rate, turnover dynamics. So we can work out, we have worked out the framework to We have worked out a framework to learn all those dynamics, and we have a package to do this. Now we come to this question again, have this equation. Now we have x, we have the x dt. Can we learn this nonlinear multi-dimensional vector function? So this is again it's an inverse problem. So this is a collaboration with Jonathan Weissman lab done by Jonathan Wasserman lab done by his postdoc, Xiaoji, and student, my student, Yen Jiang. So we developed a procedure. So we do is in this reproducing kernel Hilbert space. So we started from input is this sparse, noisy discrete data points. And this is a continuous analytical function. We try to learn, express as a basis function, linear combination of basis. Basis function linear combination of basis functions. We try to learn the coefficients through this learning procedure with this regularization regularization constraint. So the end is we got analytical form of the vector field in high dimensional space. So it's typically found that 20 to 30 principal components modes will be sufficient to describe a specific set of data. But each PC mode is really But each PC mode is really contributing from many genes. So, with this analytical form, it will allow us for further analysis using dynamical system theory, differential geometry analysis. I'll mention. So, we have analyzed many systems, but here I just want to talk about one system as a hematopoiesis process. We know this is an extensive study system, but still a lot of open questions. Just how hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into different. Extent cells differentiate into different cell types. So, for this one, we performed a set of single-cell sequencing analysis on spontaneous differentiation of primary human CD34 positive hematopoietic stem cells used as metabolic labeling techniques. While once they definitely, you know, it's not me, right? It's our collaborator. So, this is the experiment done by the VG Sankura. The Vijay Sankara and Erica Landers lab aboard at Harvard. And we just have the human stem cells, then at different time points, measure, do the single cell RN-seq analysis from the data. So here I show you the R velocity. So you see, this is the original. They use slicing and splicing tumor. And this is with the metal labeling, our new form of velocity. Clearly, you see, this is Clearly, you see, this is much smoother than the other one. More than that, you see, those are kind of, there are several cell types. You see, the vector direction is completely wrong because you see, it's a direct from the differential cells to progenitor cells. You can try different methods, try different package, you always got the wrong results. While with labeling, you'll get the correct ones. Correct ones. So now you have this back field, just like when you do molecular dynamic simulation, you have the force field. So then you can do a lot of things. So here I show you this Jacobian analysis. First, let's start with the toy model. You see, we have two genes. Let's say this is X1 SPI1PO1 and X2 is GATTO1. We know there's two master regulators. And, you know, there are many studies, modeling studies on this system. Study modeling studies on this system, typically write down an OD like this. Then, if you look at this Jacobian, you can see, okay, for example, this term does give you a Jacobian field like this. So this reflects, it's come from this room, right? This reflects X1 self-activation. Well, you see, this is the first increase, then decrease. So this is the derivative of that sigma model shape you'll get for this activation. And for this term, I'll give you. And for this term, I'll give you x1, intubate x2, that give you this first decrease that negative, right? Decrease that then go back to zero when it got saturated. You may also notice specific for this function form, this is independent of x2 because the reason is we write it as a data form, right? So this is just specific for this form. Now let's look at the real data. So this data shows you the two genes. You, uh, the two genes, uh, so each dot is a cell, and we calculate, right? Okay, and the little calculates is a gobian, right? So, um, here you see this negative when we input IPR1 where it goes up and goes down. So, this reflects SPR1 inhibit GATTA1. And similarly, this GATTA1 inhibit XPR1. And also, you can see this SPR1 self-activation. You also notice. You also notice when we increase GATA1, then FP1 inhibition on GATA1 can be decreased. So it's very indebted mandate, very different from what we see in that point model. We have additive terms. So this will suggest the two interactions more like this competitive inhibition, right? So we have more GATTA1 while offset SP1 inhibition effect. SPL1 inhibition fact. And the same data, we plotted just the SPL1 versus this Jacobian. And so the color means how many cells you have that, right? This is distribution function. And we can also fit it, right? So this fit the mean and the shape. Then you can integrate to get effective regulation function. Then you see this one. Then you see this one. Well, here you already can see it, right? Because this XPR1 inhibition and GATA1, you have these thresholds you typically expect for this with a cooperative inhibition. And this one for GATA1 inhibit XPR1, you do not see it. You see, this is the peak at the beginning. So those are reflect by this effective regulation curve. So this has a Huel function form with Hule coefficient about two. With Hil coefficient about two, while this one about one, so this real data is very different from what we typically will assume for this system. And if you go back to literature, then you realize that the CAD1P1 inhibition, their mutual interactions, very complex. They involves protein-protein interaction, protein-DNA interactions, and highly dynamic. And this one, very influential. And this one, a very influential paper, they use a Luciferate reporter on PO1 transactivation, transactivation. So you can see the GADA1 inhibition on PO1 do not have a clear threshold. And this one shows one mechanism for GADA1 inhibiting PO1 is mainly block co-factor banding, the banding of co-factor. The banding of cofactor. And then recently, there are a paper talk about the PO1. It's even more complex, that there are different dimers involved, different affinity, different activity, or thing. So what means is, well, we typically, if you go to a textbook like Uran Long's textbook, we assume there's equilibrium binding or a steady state. So for a reprise. So, for repressor activity banding, we try to gather hill functional things, but the real in intracellular system environments dynamics are much more complex. While for our experiment, just with things like RC data, we can get this effective phenomenology relations. And not just this one pair, we can get different genes, how they interact with each other, even there's composite effect, combinatorial effects. Combinatorial effects. So, this is what says one set of experiments, things that are experimental, definitely have to be high-quality experiment data that can reveal the genome-wide regulatory regulation relation, quantitative information. So, this is something very exciting. So you may ask, why does that one T1 to be symmetric? Well, here I only give you a hand-waving argument. So, we notice in ASBC, actually, the Actually, the SPL1 concentration is higher. So, initial high. Actually, people they knock it down SPL1 by 20% still can lead to this corresponding lineage development. So, we suggest possibly why this GATTA1 have a low threshold or no threshold to include the SPL1 can offset this original population, higher populated SPL1. So, make sure always can have. So, make sure always can have the two leaders developed. So, we have the back field, we can do things. One thing we look at is this conversion between two different phenotypes. So, as I just mentioned, suppose you have two states, you want to know their different paths can connect them. So, each path have action. So, since we now have the whole vector field, we can calculate this action for each path and try to find the minimum. Path and try to find the minimum the least action path. So that's the most likely probable path. We just use you can view, we can use it to approximate the reaction coordinate with the reaction dynamics. And here I show you what we got from the trans differentiation between different phenotypes. For each least action path, we can examine the gene expression along the path. If a gene change correlates with the Correlate with this LAP progression, you may expect that the gene most likely kind of contributes to this development, to a change. So indeed, we do this analysis, we identify those factors, we suggest those potential reprogramming factors for those trans differential processes. Indeed, there are lots of processes that are being studied experimentally, and the instill identified for Identified reprobate factors indeed correlate, you know, confirmed by those experimental results. Now come back to this EMT. We have a set of data, MCF 10A data. So treated with seven days, then with different TDI data, then do a single cell R-seq. So my student Sophia analyzing the data using our Dynamo platform. And this is what she got. By platform. And this is what she got. So without TGI beta, you see this attractor, epithelial cells. And now with add TGI beta, you see this attract a new attractor. And also you notice that this is an unstable point. You may see this as a saddle point or sap refix, right? Well, before the increase of beta, you see this one, the lower one, that saddle point disappears. And also this E attractor also become unstable, you see. Also, get become unstable, you see. But while for the upper one, you still have this attractor, and you clearly can see there's two paths. So, this becomes very exciting, right? Because this is centrally what we got from lifestyle imaging, although from different cell line. So, last year, a panel of EMT researchers, including myself, we wrote a review. We say, we suggest. A review, we say we suggest it is possible that multiple ornate paths can operate to enable an epithelial cell to advance towards a masking state. So, here we use both life cell imaging and single-cell R-seq data analysis. We demonstrate their two paths. Well, what we're doing now is really snail down exactly what are the genes to form a network that lead to those different. Those different topological structures of in this network, you know, the fixed points and the paths. So, so you see, and all this stuff we see, what's continuous, I have a stable phenotype and how we can destabilize it so I can convert to another one. Mathematically, we know there's many mechanisms. One thing is, as illustrated by this vault in the landscape, is pitchfork application. So, you start from Application. So you start from stage, have a stable attractor. We change the parameter. So this tractor becomes less stable. Then there are new attractor emerge. Or there's another mechanism, saddle notification. So what happens? There's a new attractor emerged. Well, the old one is still there. Then the saddle just The saddle just collides with the older tractor, then the system becomes the older one becomes unstable, system relax to the new ones. So you may notice the fundamental difference between the two case is here. You have an unstable point, but the system undetermined, not where to go. Then there's different choices afterwards. Well, for the saddle notification, you see, there's one direction. You see, there's one direction from the side and out. That direction is distablized, but all other dimensions are still stable. So their system is directed, it's directed to move along one direction. So this is, you know, since I'm a biochemist by training theoretical chemistry, remind me somehow learning organic chemistry. So this is a substitution reaction. So there is a you see they have a molecule, you have one group of leaves, then another group of attacks from a new molecule. And there, there are two. Molecule. And there, there are two basic mechanisms. One mechanism is that first, this one leaves. You form an intermediate, undetermined. You can, right? It's a planar, symmetric. Then the new one can attack from different directions. So you can form two different products. Or this SN2 mechanism, you see, the leaving of this old one, old group, and the attacking of the new one, they happen at the same time. You have intermediate, like this here. They both exist. Like this, here they both exist. So we thought that, well, this happened for a cell phenotype change. Here, you will think about: oh, I have genes that correspond to the first phenotype. We need to silence them. While their genes for the second phenotype, we need to turn on them. Do they happen in a sequential way or in kind of a concerted way? Then you expect there will be an intermediate. You'll have both of the genes will be expressed. So we have this hybrid state. And also, we can define a term called frustration. We borrowed from condensed matter physics. The idea is that suppose I have a gene at my expression state, say it is active, but I also receive instruction from another gene, which tells me, say, to turn, to surprise me. Then you see this regulation is frustrated, right? There's a mismatch. So for EMT, we. So, for EMT, we already know there are existing this hybrid intermediate state called partial EMT. And this happened in many other phenotypes change. So we said, let's quantify this. I look at this one set of single-cell RN-seq data for AF5 for nine cells. So for this data set, there's only one TDI-bit concentration, but we have different time, as shown here. So we formulate the same problem, similar problem like here. But we want to make this lively. But we want to make the life easier. We say this is let's use a linear model. We have this force matrix, just constant matrix. We want to learn from the data. Again, this is a velocity, right? So we use this partial linear square regression and a local force discovery rate to ensure this F is a sparse matrix. And then with that force matrix, we can do further cross-screening like the EC gene to penalize 0, 1. gene to benefit 0, 1 become a boolean type, right? Because we're easy to easily facilitate follow-up study. So then we can define this frustration like this. You can either convince yourself if a minus one means the regulation received from the gene, the gene expression level expression, expression state and received instruction, they do not mismatch. They do not match. They do not match. So let's look at the data, right? So this is the data, each dot is a cell, right? And we can, again, we can define a reaction coordinate. And this is the sign cell, really the cells we perform this cube. So you see, the frustration really goes up, then goes down. And since we have this network, you know, the way to force me to. This network, you know, the force me to form a network. We can the network, we do this community analysis. So we divide into here for the four communities. We can summarize their inter-community regulation. We notice very striking thing is that their inter-community regulation increase during the process, then decrease. So this kind of help us to refine our picture how this phenotype change happens. So you can think of the system half from So you can think of the system half from a module, right? We know a biological network should be modulized because this is important for us to be robust against the global propagation. So if something happens in your module, it won't propagate globally. But during the process, the transition process, we have to reprogram this global gene spread profile. We have to coordinate their change. Therefore, we see the system in this case. See the system in this case, they really need to increase their communication to have lower modularity. But then at the end, when it falls into another stable phenotype, they increase their modularity again. So I want to ask, is this unique set or is it general? So we look at another two different sets. One is a mouse pancreatic and docrinogenesis. We observe a similar pattern, right? We see this inter-increate intercommunication trend. Increased intercommunication transiently, there increased the frustration and network heterogeneity. Tau there's a transient, there's some hop genes appeared. Similar pattern for this most advantage various neurogenesis. So we can see this is a general pattern that transiently increased intercommunity regulation characterized concerted self-finativity transition that's consistent with this kind of saddle-known bifurcation picture. Not a bi-focification picture. So here, I want to, this is my summary page. So, you know, people know me several years ago, I moved to Pittsburgh, where here I have a lot of great colleagues from Pittsburgh and CMU. They look at genomics, big data. They mainly use a statistical approach. I found those studies very interesting, informative, but also it's not really the type of research I Really, the type of research I'm familiar with. So, I always have a question: okay, the big data, how can we get the mechanism standing? So, governing equation. So, this is what I showed today is the efforts we made in the past several years. So, I always try to talk to my people, this is the age, we know people always talk about this big data age. So, this is quite kind of similar to what happened in history several hundred years ago. So, there we have in astronomy and the physics, right? Physics, right? There, but there, here, the only big difference here, you know, nowadays, a single set of day experiments, the information we get will be always matter more than what TikObari accumulated over his whole life. And now we, instead of a human intelligence like Kepler did, we have this artificial intelligence, machine learning help us. But at the end, we're really looking for, we still will look for mechanistic theory. Mechanistic star theory. I think this is what we really shoot for. So, with this, I will just acknowledge the page. You see, I already showed pictures for several leading researchers in different projects. This is really collaborative efforts between my lab and other people, other labs like Jonathan Wiseman lab, MIT, my colleague Yvette Bahar, Viji Sankura, and Eric Lender. Lender, um, they um on this uh single-cell genomic studies, and Simon working my colleague and Weigo on this LASA imaging, and also, yeah, many colleagues, the Kazu have this MCF-108 data cell and also funding agencies. I'll stop here. Thank you. Uh, questions? Well, I'll ask questions. Well, I'll ask questions as always. So, in my understanding, so what you say is very interesting. So, you take these kind of descriptive variables, right, which are kind of collective from multiple cells, maybe kind of averaged imaging. And you divide, you know, this is very similar to what Phil Benfi showed in a different setting, right? He had this map of, and so you kind of developed the mapping of how things go, these pathways. How things go, these pathways. And I think that the challenge, which I think you acknowledge, is that, you know, is there a mechanistic way that I can take a bunch of genes and make a network and kind of match, saying this network, you know, can I extract the dynamics from a network in a similar way and then say, oh, this matches the description. So therefore, there is a kind of a cause relationship between that network causing those that description. Is that something which you're looking for? Is that something which you're looking for? That's exactly what we're looking for, right? Yeah. So, so you see the big challenges, we want to study those dynamics. Then, life side imaging, by the life imaging, is give us the temporal dynamics. Well, this stepshot data, they give us the kind of steps out, right? And although in our dynamo already, maybe you can infer some dynamics, but how long-term, right? Real-term dynamics, we still have large imaging. We still have lights imaging. So we cannot get the full picture from either, just one of them. The question: Can we connect them? Exactly as you mentioned. Can we connect them? So there's a, we call this mapping between these two rep. This is the same system, two different representations. Can we establish a connection? And then we can use a life-side imaging to infer the dynamics really happens in this expression, the right gene space. So this is a so. So, this is so this is corresponding, you know, this is a big project, which ongoing projects. A dynamic system, right? Always is moving along a manifold. And it's typically a low-dimensional manifold. That's the hope. So, each one, we have a manifold. And this is in that feature space representation. This is in the gene space representation. Even the gene space representation, we already show you have this collective mode, a collective degree of freedom, the PC mode, where things that's only. PC mode or things that only have us, you only need a low dimension to reflect, to represent the system. Can you, yeah, that's a question. Can you establish the connection between the two? This is a lot of using, you know, then some genomics imaging, staining, or sequencing studies, the big effort is ongoing. So, a follow-up question is like I thought about this EMT system a little bit, right? So, let's say I'm looking at the bottom picture and there's two different pathways. So, is it consistent with the thought that there could be a kind of genetic diversity or phenotypic diversity in the cells themselves? So, if I think about half the cells or one-third of the cells will do one path and the other two-thirds will do the other path. So, let's say if in a Do the other path. So let's say if in the middle I reverse the EMT to MET, then you may end up, you kind of go halfway and can come back, but you may not come back to the same spot or same place. Not in this picture. But so is there a diversity? How do we reflect kind of genotypic diversity here? Yeah, this is again another very good point. So first of all, you see already in this space, the cell. Already in this space, the cell spread a lot, right? This is already a heterogeneity. And what I didn't show here is even if we go to a high dimension already show there's several, well, even here, there are several phenotype, they coexist with each other. So you suggest, well, maybe, you know, this faster one from if you have better resolution for our state, they correspond differently. We did analysis on our life cell imaging data. We could not really tell, right? You know, the cell. Right, you know, the cell starting from the two assume different paths, their initial condition, any difference. We could not tell this. So therefore, there's still a possibility, but we more or like think about this more, you know, see, they really have parallel paths they can take. And also for this basic system, my student analyzing the two paths. This seems to correspond, you know, her current data suggests. You know, her current data suggests this corresponding G1S rest or G2M rest. So, this is and we try to do more analysis. And also to address your question, it's hydrogenity, right? From life imaging perspective, we are trying to increase our state resolution. So, maybe if we further, just say, maybe just because we have a low resolution, then we have a distinct state, but it shows up. the state but show up as that's uh uh you know uh one one one group um we we try to find ways to to kind of uh uh have better resolution and then we can we can um you know get a better better uh idea what's going on this is a a big priority in what we uh try to use some um you know uh use some some techniques And use some techniques, non-linear dynamics, help us to resolve the states. And we, okay, really, the question is: how system, you know, I always ask the question: is the solar system more or less stochastic or deterministic? If we have better resolution? So, because what I didn't show you actually, you know, for last imaging found that the two sister cells, if you found their trajectory, they're very close. So, this is something very, very, very impressive, something in a way we. Something in a way we pushing to further study, for further study.
