Thanks for the wonderful conference. Happy to be here. So I'm going to talk about platinum limit flows and big solutions, which is a somewhat difficult topic, but I hope you get something out of it. If not, there's also an easier online talk from a few years ago. You might enjoy watching. Good. Okay, so let's start. Good. Okay, so let's start with some motivation of history. Equation I'm interested in is the Richard flow. A time-dependent family of the manifolds. And the metric evolves by this equation. So here the right-hand side minus twice-the Richie curvature. If you write this down in local coordinates, just roughly like the Laplacian of the metric, that's a geometric heat equation that deforms the initial metric, hopefully. It works a nicer one. Metric, hopefully, it works a nicer one. And so, by classical theory, you can solve this on some maximum time interval, which is characterized by the fact that the curvature blows up. So, as long as the curvature stays bounded, continue flowing, but then at some point, you typically will have some singularity, the curvature goes to infinity, and then it becomes much more difficult. And it's not a question one that usually asks for evolution equations is Evolution equations of questions now. Continue the slope, we have to start singing at a time. Just there's some good compactness theories of understanding the largest. So when around some points, they scale by sequence of factors going to infinity and pass to a limit. But for that, one needs some compactness here and then, well, if one has some past to weak limits, well, what's the regularity and structure of those weak limits? Singularity and structure of those weak limits. And loads of singularities is there some notion of weak solutions? If you have all that, then you can ask, well, does it exist? Is it unique? Okay, so in spade dimensions, there's a very satisfying answer. So for any, given any nice sphere mentioned, Many nice three-dimensional initial condition, there exists a unique Richie flow for singularities. So the picture here is a space-time picture, so here space, time goes up, so that sort of time slices are here, spin-dimensional manifold, and they fit together in this nice four-dimensional space-time picture. Is there some surgery or something? I thought it's Caroline, did Freechief flow in the surgery? Free cheek flow and surgery. Right, so that's what Perlman did, and then later on there were some further developments. So, uh, right, so Perlman cut along necks and glued in caps and continued the flows of the pieces. Then later it was shown that one can take a limit where one does the surgery on smaller and smaller scales. The limit where one passes the surgery scale to the scalar scale. So so here you've got flows for this neck pinch, so the singularity would just be one point in space-time here. And like technically I just talk about this incomplete space-time where this point is removed and you have some parameter conditions what happens when you come close to that point. After the singularity, it's just not the same minimal. Right, so here the top part of the. Right, so here the topology changes, right? So there's an entry dice connected, and afterwards there's two smooth pieces for a while. Yes, and then it pinches and there's the end. But yeah, so very roughly all that can happen is those back pinch singularities, which disconnects your manifold and cylinders into pieces. That's roughly how the space-time picture looks like. So this yeah, so this comes as a good Yeah, so this comes with a good compactness as partial regularity theory. In particular, it's almost every time it's just a smooth, compact spin-dimensional manifold. And also the behavior is uniquely characterized by the smooth part. So you don't really have to say whether there's a big solution because the singular cell is so small, so you can just solve the equation on the smooth part. And what happens is T. And what happens is T goes to intending? Oh, right, so that's that's complicated. Yeah, so there's still some open questions. So if you start with something like a space field, then it just becomes extinct in finite time. But if you have some other pieces, like some hyperbolic pieces, they might converge after rescaling one hour spare theta hyperbolic piece and then but then yeah, so in in in China. Yeah, so in general it's not quite known if in all cases you converge to the pieces from Selson's geometrization conjecture, but you don't really have to know that. Yeah. Okay, and then it had great topological applications. Yeah, so of course let Perlman 20 years ago, right? So here quite a quite valuable geometrization conjecture, but then there's But then those more recent developments, they allow you not just to flow one manifold, but you can take a whole family of initial conditions and flow them all together. Because it's unique, it depends continuously on the initial data. So then you get some other topological applications, like about differromorphism groups of manifolds and about the space of positive scalar power geometrics. So for that, you really need some notion of. Need some notion of singular flow where you can flow a whole family of just one metric at a time. Okay, so that's the three-dimensional case and under some special curvature condition that can generalize to higher dimensions, but without curvature assumption, higher dimensions is much more complicated. Very special in those cases that you only have those neck-pinch singularities. Good. Okay, so that slide is supposed to tell us higher dimensions is much more complicated. Okay, so yeah, so there's a bunch of things that can happen. So in four-dimensional rigid flow, there's some examples of singularities. There's blow-up limit. You don't get something like a shrinking cylinder. For example, you could see this richie flat. You could see this Ricci-Flatt metric, that's a non-flat Ricci-Flat metric discovered by Vikramson in the 70s, or you could also see some arbitrary singularities or finite quotient of your clearance space. And then if you move to dimension five and higher, then you can also get non-uniqueness. So kind of the toy picture to have in mind when you have. Picture to have in mind that you have a conical singularity that looks like a figure X. And then there is like even topologically non-unique ways of slowing out of such conical singularity. So you could slow out like this, or you could slow out like this. Maybe if you all have examples start in dimension five. Oh, okay, and uh yeah, but that's some other things that's a chest that. Other things that suggest that higher dimensions is complicated. Okay, so then we can ask: well, can one develop any theory at all in higher dimensions? And so there are some recent developments. So there was a recent face by Richard Bandler. So he came up with some compactness and partial regularity theory. I mean, a few years earlier, our Neyman was proposed some. Proposed some notion of weak solutions. The goal for today's talk is to give some introduction to Framla theory and then briefly recall the approach from the work of Erin and myself and then at the end reconcile those two approaches. Okay, any questions so far? Ah, okay, and eventually there will be heat candles and Bruno motions as well. But that takes a bit of time to get there. We'll be very patient. Thanks, I appreciate your patience. Okay, so yeah, so formula theorem is in the parabolic setting. So to motivate that, let me find. So, to motivate that, let me first tell you something about the elliptic setting. The elliptic setting, there's a theory called Chiger-Kolding CRA, so that tells you about when you have a sequence of manifolds, with which you bounded below, and let's say just Einstein manifolds, and which you're flat, just set lambda equal to zero, then well, then you can, once you fix a base point, then you can. Once you fix a base base point, then you can always, along with sub-sequence, you can pass through the metrics in the sense of metric spaces. So maybe I should give one example. So there are some, so in four dimensions, that's some picture flat manifold. Something like a Figuchi-Hansen metric, so that's a bitch-flat manifold, but that is not flat. So dimension four is the first dimension, there you can have something that's picture flat, but not flat. Schematically looks like this. And then what you can do is that you can build a sequence of metrics, right? So you can just take this one and scale it down. Take this one and scale it down. Then, as i goes to infinity, you this part here just spreads to a point. But you get here, and the limit of i to infinity is r4 step two, which is a cone over rpc. Oh, okay, so if you have, so there's some examples. If you have some examples of sequences of four-dimensional witch-flat guys, when they limit, you get a point singularity. Then you can, of course, also take this example times n minus 4, then you can get examples where your singular, where your singular set is n minus 4 dimension. Okay, there's the yeah, so there's some C array which tells you that it's essentially shut up. Sent you the shadow. So, okay, so you can, in order with longest subsequence, you can just pass a weak limit in the common falsehood sense. That's not too hard to pass the limit in the metric space. And then usually one assumes this volume non-collapsing conditions. Take some base point somewhere, and you want that the volume of a unit ball around this point is uniformly bounded below along the sequence. So that's to ensure that you are. So that's that's to ensure that your if you're starting with n-dimensional manifolds, that your limit will still be n-dimensional. Okay, non-this non-collapsing is a whole result of Toby Coling, that the volume measures converge to the host of measures. And then this limit, well, first it's just a metric space, but then one can decompose it into a regular part and a singular part and so on. So that regular part isn't. So the angular part is an open subset, which has a smooth Einstein metric. And so the full guy x-axis is just that metric completion of the regular part. And then the big CRM is the dimension of the singular set is almost n minus 4, which is sharp in the height of this example. And then the early step in the C of A is that all. The final step in the C of A is that all the tangent cones are metric cones. So then there's those limits. So you pick something at a point and so many of this point passed a limit and what you get is a cone. Okay, and yeah, so roughly speaking, what Bamla did, he developed the parabolic version of giga coding. Parabolic version of chigo-colding CO and stuff. So, in particular, what was quite tricky, he had to come up with some parabolic version of metric spaces, come up with what is good, limiting objects, something he calls metric flows, and he has some parabolic version of this, of this common fausless convergence. And then, so he puts some compactness here, and so any sequence of n-dimensional vatu. Sequence of n-dimensional ratio flows have a sub-sequence that converges to a metric flow, and then under some non-collapsing assumption, which in the flow setting is supernatural, because Kernman gave us some wonderful entropy functionality, tells us everything is non-collapsed. Under the non-collapsing condition, Bungel proved that this limit metric flow has again a decomposition into regular part and singular part. Regular part and singular part, such that regular part is what is called a smooth free flow space-time. That's like the picture at the beginning, then we cut out all the singular points. And so the spreadular part uniquely determines the whole flow. And the dimension of the singular part is again codimension 4. So here, space-time is n plus 2-dimensional because you have n space dimensions, and then time scales like distance squared. So that cancels. So that counts as two dimensions. And then also again all tangent flows are self-similarly shrinking. So in the leptic setting we have tangent cones, which are cones, and then the power value setting, the corresponding notion of self-similarized or self-similarly shrinking solid ones. When you say R uniquely determines X, is that a geometric way of knowledge? Geometric, yes. So then as a metric space, it can be extended easily from R. Yeah, so if you know the only part, right, then you have to take the completion for some points actually. Ah, okay, wonderful. Got some heat kernels. Absolutely. Good. Okay, sir. Okay, sir. So now, what we are doing, we have this digit flow that's our background space-time. In terms of standard, well, the fundamental tool is the heat kernel on this background. And so, well, usually when you think about the heat kernel, you don't have to be very careful, but what is here and what is here. It's one of those things, and it's kind of the same. So, for a rich low, it makes it different. The same, so for a rigid flow, it makes a difference because the background matter is evolving in time. As an argument of P and T, you solve the heat equation, but as an argument of Q and S, you solve this adjoint equation, which has this X plus scalar power job. So, you know, those things just come like so. How do you find an adjoint equation? So you take the The adjoint equation, right? So you take the product of two functions, differentiate and integrate by parts. Then you find the adjoint operators, right? And so Fabici flow with this little extra twist, so you have the volume l and n, right? But that's what I said. That's like the square root of the determinant of the metric, right? And then when you differentiate the square root of the determinant, The square root of the determinant, then you get like one-half times the trace of your dtg. So then the along Richiform, you get that the volume element evolves by minus scalar curvature times the volume. From the evolution of the volume element, you get some extra scalar curvature term, which appears here in the adjoint equation. Okay, so you have to. So you have to a bit more carefully distinguish between this point PT and the point spaced on point QS. So the picture to have in mind is to have space and then as time and then maybe here you have some point P T and some better space time point Q comma S. Then it's most useful to think about this. Most useful to think about this adjoint object, actually, because then if you think about it this way, then you can define those adjoint heat kernel measures just as k times d1 young, because the adjoint guy is the right side. When s is equal to t, that's a Dirac delta measure here, and but then if you go back in time, that that's that's random black it, right, right, like it. Well that's roughly the size, like the square root of the time, how far you went away. Okay, those those guys, because of this scalar curvature terms, those guys are probability measures. Only a hope that I choose. Why is there a relative sign change in the time derivative? Oh, just integration by pi. But I mean, what does that do to the equation? Usually, you can reverse the time in the heat equation. It's a terrible thing analytically. Well, you can rescale, you can read the time in time somehow. Time's running the other way somehow. I mean, you have to, of course, you have to solve a meaningful problem, right? So for this one, you can specify the initial condition and then solve it for another time. For that time, specify the condition at the final time. Specify the condition at the final time. Yes. You're not doing back then. No. No, I've got not yet. Good. Okay, well, important properties of the heat flow. So it satisfies this reproduction formula called McGonn consistency condition, or whatever you call it. And then it also comes with a shaft radiant estimate. So if you have a So if you have a one Lipschitz function and you evolve it, then being one Lipschitz is preserved. So that's, you know, that's the kind of computations. You know, you would compute like the evolution of the radiant squared, right? So radiant squared, that's just the inverse metric times di di your. When you do those computations, then when you have to interchange the Laplacian and the gradient, it gives you some Reich term, right? But then from the time derivative of the inverse metric, you get a Reich term without a sign that exactly cancels that one. So then you just get a nice inequality. See that between one lip shift is pretty simple. Be one map shift is preserved. I like that some sharper estimate in terms of the fundamental solution of the one-dimensional heat equation is Herisite initial conditions. Okay, so you have this, and okay, and that's essentially the data that Bungler uses to define a metric flow. So metric flow consists of those things. So there's a set X, which I should think of as a space. X, which I should think of as the space-time set, then there's some function which is called the time function. The final example is some smooth guy, of course. Then your space-time is just a product, n times the time interval, and your time function is just a projection onto the second factor. Okay, and then you have complete separable metrics on each time slice, and you have all those probability measures, and they And they all fit together, so such that this is the production formula and the Sharp player code. Okay, and the basic example is, of course, if you have this smooth solution, I have to t such as the induced metrics and the time slashes, and those guys are the X on T to Carlos measures, space time points, X equals T, T. Okay, and right, so then whenever wants to pull something, one needs some monotone quantities. And there's one which has been known for a while, it's a little nice observation of mechanical topping. So if you look, you know, for probability measures, you have this one Wasserstein distance, which to save some time, I just define it using Cantava-Wich duality. Let's just take that as the definition. Let's just take that as the definition, and then it's very easy to see that this plugin, if your measures are those HRM heat current measures, then that's a monotonous function of time. But yeah, so that's just like you just have to sit down and differentiate this guy and your test function f, this von Lipschitz function, you can flow it forward in time, it stays von Lipschitz, it's just learned, right? But then this other guy, the measure evolves better. You measure evolves by the etchant heat flow, heat flow times adjoint heat flow. That's a wonderful monotone coefficient. Okay, so that's very useful. So that times here, if you go back in time, those heat kernel measures, they don't spread out too much, right? So if you look at heat kernel measures centered at two different points, then don't move too far away. Don't move too far away from each other. Good. Okay. And then Bambler found a second monotone quantity, which is the variance. Well, that's a marriage. That's what I call it in the picture, right? So that variance estimate really tells you that this measure here doesn't spread out too much. So in particular, you get some kind of passive notion of center. So this point PT, here you really have. Point Pt, here you have a derived delta, but then at earlier times, like up to, if you go back by time tau, then up to some constant times square root of tau, you still know where this point going back in time. Good. Oh, okay, I'm done. Yeah, so once you have this definition of the monotonic quantities and of course it was a lot of work, but then you know what you have to do and uh go for compactness here and then Go by compactness here, then take account of a dense subset of times, pass the limit there, and then by monotonicity we can fill in all intermediate times. Like, you know, like one variable real analysis, if you have a sequence of monotone functions, it's not too hard to pass the limit, you just pass the limit at a counter-repend subset of times and run that. That one is, of course, much more work, but it's a similar. Much more active. It's a similar basic concept. Okay, so then to summarize the CRM one CRM, so let me recall, so there's this entropy functional discovered by Perlman. So you integrate log the the log of the kernel and of my measure was uh the kernel times the value measure. Times the volume measure. So that's like entry sort of dot k times k, that's like some Boltzmann entropy thing, right? And that thing is monoton along with ratio flow and it implies this volume, cross-volume non-collapsing. That was one of the key discoveries of PELMA. And so our main theorem of BAMLA is, well, give them any sequence of n-dimensional nature flows with some space-time baseline. With some space-time base points, the machift time that the base point is just time zero, and the matrix flow is defined in this backwards time interval. And then along a sub-sequence that always converges to a metric flow. So that's his compactness theorem. And then his structure CRM is FUS, and that is non-collapsing condition that the entropy is uniformly bounded below, which is perfectly natural, lot of Palmax and one or two. Natural light of Palman's monotonic formula under this non-collapsing condition, the limit as a regular singular decomposition. The regular part is a small switch of space-time that uniquely determines the whole metric flow. And the dimension of the singular part, the singular part is four-dimensional four. And that is metric flow, all tangent flows are possibly. Flows are possibly singular cells similarly shrinking solitons. Now it's a good time for questions again. What is the meaning of tangent flow? It's some parabolic version of tangent cone. So yeah. I like that. I like the the function cases. If you want if you have some function that satisfies the some heat equation or something like that, then you would consider those base tailed guys. Now you bascal x by lambda and t by lambda squared. Then you pass to a subsequent limit of those bascaled diet. That would be a tangent flow at the origin. Generally, you move your pick some space-time point, move that to the new origin, and parabolic you raise K and pass the limit. For example, if you do it by Mac pinch, then you just see a round tracking cylinder. So you assume we want the limit of the T T i is not in zero. Ah, yes, yeah. Thing is vacuous. How easy is it to control whether that actually happens? No, like not most of the time that will just be minus infinity. So, how you use it in practice, you have some flow rates, and then at some time you hit some singularity, and then you rescale by a sequence of factors going to infinity. So, those rescate guys live on longer and longer time anymore. So, your limit just will be ancient. So, those scale. You rescale. When it's a singularity, you do some rescaling. Yes, yeah, yeah. You always do some blow-up analysis. So when, yeah, for all practical purposes, that's in ancient Samotan define all the way, starting from time minus and so on. Good. Okay, so now very briefly, in one slide, let me tell you what Erin and I proposed a few years earlier. We found some characterization of the Friggie flow in terms of estimates on power space. So what we proved is that if you have a one-power net family of time-dependent manifolds, then it evolves by a richie flow if and only if you have this infinite-dimensional trademark estimate of passports. So, cancel here, here is the. Here E is the expectation with respect to Brownian motion, starting at this space-time point E, T. Okay, so Brownian motion is just the time that I'm telling you the probability, what is the probability, at time tau1, I mean set u1, and so on. And that probability is just given by this product of heat kernel measures. Okay, and then the right-hand side is a bit more complicated, so that's this. Is a bit more complicated, so that's this parallel gradient, which is defined in terms of the stochastic parallel transform. So the simplest example of this estimate is if you just plug in a one-point function, a function that just depends on your curve at a curve at one single time. If you plug in a one-point function, then here, what is this expectation value when you are just integrating? When you are just integrating with respect to the heat curve measure, then expectation value here that just computes your heat flow of your network. So then the left-hand side is the gradient of the heat flow that's less than or equal than the heat flow of the gradient. But that's what you also get with those more basic finite-dimensional computations. This inequality covers if and only if actually. If and only if actually some notion of the HFL. But then the main new idea was doing those SMS, not on the manifold, but on the path base of the manifold. We can actually see what is a solution, not just a super solution. If you plug in some well-coded two-point function, then you're able to find the other electronic. able to uh find the other electronic. Okay, so then the theorem together is a function choice that well those two notions are compatible with each other. So we prove that f a non-collapsed limit of smooth feature flows, as you get it by on Bundler's compactness here, is a weak solution in the sense of myself and Labor. Center for myself and my neighbor. Precisely any number of spatial limit flow x for any value of point, we have this estimate. Oh, okay, and in fact the argument it doesn't rely on the fact that here x is a limit of smooth skies. The same argument applies to any metric flow that satisfies the partial regularity properties. On the smooth part. So in particular, as a parallel, we also get that every three-dimensional singular reach if you will from a Klanar lap is always a weak solution in our sense. Okay, so now you've got completely lost. Now it's a good point to rejoin. Okay, so now we go back to my team slide before. Okay, so So, this theorem has somehow to do with my singular set. It's hopefully small enough so that the Crownian motion doesn't hit it, right? And so, let me talk a bit about Brownian motion and small sets, right? So, you can ask the question, well, you do Brownian motion and you have some set. Now, the application is the singular set, but it could be any set. And you can ask, well, how small should the set be that I don't hit the The set be that I don't hit it with probability, but I hit it with probability zero. Okay, so that's a very classical answer. A set doesn't get hit by browning motion if and only if it has vanishing capacity. Like, you know, capacities. And you think of like in terms of electrostatics or whatever, like how much electric charge can. How much electric charge can you put on a set per unit voltage? That's very, very small than the first dimension capacity. Oh, okay. And so that's a very nice CIM, because I exactly characterize this, or small. But one disadvantage is it can't be upgraded to a quantitative estimate. So you also want to say whether it hope to say. Well, you can hope to say, well, this probability is small if the set satisfies something, or I cannot get too close to that set, this large probability of something. And that you can never do with this Newton capacity, because one way to see it, well, this side here depends on the initial point x, right? Well, this side here doesn't depend on the starting point x. Because if you set this very far away, then the probability should. And the probability should be smaller. Okay, so one way to fix this is instead of the Newton capacity, one can look at the so-called martin capacity. So that depends on the base point. So, okay, so yeah, not base point is just the origin, but in general it would be like y minus x0. Okay, and so with the mounting capacity when it's actually a sharp estimate, so when kind of Some quantity that is estimate, what is the probability that one hits the set is like up to this factor, factor two is given by this parting capacity. And the factor two is actually sharp because if I just consider those two examples of a sphere, I can get the factor one, and if this sphericality shelves, then I get a factor one half in in nuclear space. Okay, so that one, I see yeah. One, that's yeah, that one is easy enough to just put the groove on a slide. You have Brownian motion starting at the other chain, and then you want to estimate the probability that you hit. Estimate the probability that you hit your set A, and from the radius start, is you fix some other point Y and some little ball of radius delta around that ball. And first you just ask, well, what's the probability that you enter this little delta ball, right? But that probability is given by some little neat formula, right? You know, since Newton says decay like this does to the n over 2 just the formula, right? Just to formulate particular delta is equal to the distance, then that probability becomes 1. Okay, and then this probability is bigger equal than the probability where you first go somewhere to A and then go from A and go forward. Okay, so that probability you can again write down like using that formula. If we have this If we have this computer new and we hit the set A in finite time, we just integrate over the set A like an formula that we just learned there. So this guy is bigger or equal than that guy, and you can just cancel the delta to the n minus 2 and pass delta to 0, so then this integral here just becomes an integral over a. You get this, and you rearrange it back. Rearrange it and back and use the definition of capacity and see that capacity is founded we know by this measure, which was exactly the probability we wanted to compute. Okay, so that's the one inequality, the upper bound. And so for the lower bound, one has to do some second moment estimates. So maybe I skip that, but you have your same nice functional formula for the probability of hipping that. Formula probability of hitting the Bohr likely. You can consider this random value like this, yeah, this one normalized so that it has expectation one, and then you compute the expectation of c squared, then the other inequality pops up. Okay, and so we so the main thing for what did this function was to prove some hitting estimate for. Some hitting estimate for Ratshift low. So Hitting estimates as well. If you have this Reichshift flow, which is entropy grounded below, then the probability that Brownian motion of this Reatshift flow background comes close to the singular set is bounded by epsilon to the constant times epsilon to the two minus delta. Okay, so here this epsilon. Okay, so here this epsilon singular set, you can think of it like an epsilon tubular neighborhood of the singular set. But that's a quantitative value, not just the singular points, but also all the points where the curvature is bigger than 1 over epsilon squared. So that estimate is non-trivial, even for smooth slides like so. It helps you cannot come too close to the high curvature parts. And then, right, so this exponent 2 minus This exponent 2 minus delta, you can, of course, guess the answer by looking at like the Bumble has Bummer proved the singular set is co-dimension 4, right? So then typically curve of Barner mode looks like two-dimensional. So yeah, you think, well, okay, you should get epsilon to the two minus delta here. Okay, so you know what to expect, right? So then actually proving it was quite hard because like all the known All the known proofs from the literature, in particular this one, they use two-sided heat kernel bounds. Bavici flow, that's just completely false. There are no lower heat kernel bounds. Because well, if you flow through some singularities, then your manifold can become disconnected, right? So you can never have a lower bound if you can't even communicate with some part of your manifold. But okay, so we had to come up with some new approach that doesn't use any lower heat current. Doesn't use any lower heat current bond. So they maybe compensate for this by using this space-time geometry that I'm learning that use. Okay, finally, there's a few open questions. Okay, I've got big open questions, existence. So now we have to at least have some notion of excellence inside but so in the dimensions three we have existence, but in in higher dimensions there's a But in higher dimensions, that's a big and difficult open question. Can one continue? Can we construct some flows with similarities? And other typical question in PDU is this uniqueness, but weak solutions at least provide a framework to discuss this question. Sorry, that one I couldn't even write down the question. Okay, then when in three dimensions uniqueness holds by lack of bundled line dimensions. I mentioned in the Became Act, but also as I mentioned, Angel and Laknov have those examples in dimension of five and higher, where you get non-unignous conical singularities. And then I would conjecture in general that flows for cylindrical singularities should be unique, but flows for conical singularities should be non-unique. So that's motivated by So that's matter rate just by the cork data x times the geometry for the mean coverage. I don't have a second. Any questions? You had heat kernel samples on the previous slide. What it is. The previous slide, what it is. The last behind the middle. Oh, the centers. Oh, oh, that's that's what I explained a little bit.
