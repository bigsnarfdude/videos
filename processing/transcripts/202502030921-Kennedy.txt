Okay, so I think it's important to actually to understand the classical case if you really want to understand the general case. So I'm actually going to start with the classical case where there's a really nice picture. And so an operator system in the classical case is called a function system, or sometimes an Archimedean order unit space. In order unit space. So here's the idea before I tell you the definition. We want to capture the properties of a subspace of a commutative C-star algebra. So I have some subspace F, which contains the unit and the self-adjoint. And it's a subspace of some unitive unital. Unitive unital C-star algebra. So some C of X for X is compact in Hausdorff. And we can actually replace these C of X spaces because they always embed faithfully into L infinity spaces. We can always actually replace these with nice commutative von Euben algebras if I want, where I should say here I mean the discretization of text. So the obvious embatting is a fake. But the obvious embedding is a faithful embedding of state x. So this tells us that we're trying to capture the abstract properties of subspaces that embed into L infinity spaces. So here's the actual definition. So a function system is a triple. So I have my space, I have some. I have some notion of positivity, and I have a unit. And I'll tell you what these things are. So, f is a star vector space. F plus is a positive cone, the positive cone of positive elements in F. And we want it to be proper in the sense that if I intersect f, f plus with negative f plus, the only element in there should be the zero element. And finally, this element E, the unit, is an Archimedean order unit in the following sense. This means that, first of all, it satisfies the Archimedean property. So for every self-adjoint F, so since we're in a star vector space, there's a natural notion of being self-adjoint, which means when you take the star, it doesn't change. And I want, there should exist some natural number n. n such that f is between negative n times e and n times e. And the other thing is that I want my Archimedean order unit to determine the positivity of an element in the sense that if let's say nf Less than or equal to e for all natural numbers n. This should imply that my element f is negative. So this is the abstract definition of a function system. And what I'd like to do is I'd like to consider the category of these objects. So the objects are function systems. And the morphisms are unital order homomorphisms. What I mean by this is just simply that if I have two function systems, I can talk about maps between them. And I want, if I have a positive element in the domain, I want the image to be positive. That's what I mean by order homomorphism. Order homomorphism. And I need to tell you, if I want to have a good notion of isomorphism, or more generally, a good notion of embedding, I need to tell you what I mean by that. So an order embedding is we're in an analytic category and you need to specify some notion of embedding. What we mean by this is that phi goes, say, from F1 to F2, this means F2, this means that phi of an element f is greater than or equal to 0, if and only if f is greater than or equal to 0. And then an isomorphism would be an order embedding where you're also bijective. Now, once we have this abstract structure, well, we actually have a little bit more than it seems. We actually have a norm structure. And the norm is. And the norm is defined in the following way. So if I have an element f which is self-adjoint, I can define a norm by saying that the norm of f is equal to the infimum over all real numbers lambda greater than zero, such that this kind of Archimedean type property holds with respect to lambda. With respect to lambda. So I actually have more than just this sort of ordered vector space structure. I actually have a normed space. And this norm actually encodes positivity, and positivity you can read off of the norm. So this is for a self-adjoint element. I can use the C star identity. To extend this to non-self-adjoint elements. So, what I mean by that is simply if I have an arbitrary element f, I can simply define the norm of f to be the norm, square root of the norm of SRF. So, this this is the abstract setup. Yeah, we're having multiplication. Yeah. Uh yeah, yeah, it's true. I will in a second. Yeah, you can read off the, once you know the norm on self-adjoint elements, you can recover it on the whole space. But yeah, that's a good point, actually. Let's pretend that PD. We can do that for now. Okay, so let me give you an example. An example of a function system I'm going to give you is really prototypical. So let K be a compact convex set. So it's a subset of some vector space where, say, locally convex, where it makes sense to talk about convexity. We have some topology so that it's compact. Compact. Then I can talk about the affine functions on k. And I'm going to write fk for the continuous affine functions. So f goes from k to complex numbers, and it's continuous in affine. And I'll remind you what I mean by affine. Affine just means that you respect the convex structure in the sense that f of a convex combination. Of a convex combination is equal to the convex combination of f applied to these points. So that's what alpha means. And this is a function system, and there's a natural A natural way to see this as because I'm talking about continuous affine functions, I can see this as living inside of the continuous functions on k. And there's an order structure on here, and the order structure on this space fk is just the restriction of the order structure on here. The unit is affine, so it belongs to this space. The Archimedean properties are satisfied by this unit. And by the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, the affine By the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, the affine functions on k actually generate C of K. It's easy to see that this space separates points, self-adjoint, so still Meier source kicks in. And conversely, if I have an abstract function system, then what we're going to see is that I'm actually. To see is that I'm actually always isomorphic to a function system of that form. The reason I introduced the norm topology is because I want to be able to talk about the state space of a function system, and I want it to have a notion of weak start topology. So let's write. So let's write S of F for the states on F. And what I mean by that is the functionals, let's say, what was already. Yeah, let me write. Eventually, I'm going to want to think of these states as points. So I'm going to write the, I'm going to use x. So I want functionals on f. Which are positive in the sense that they take positive elements to positive numbers. And I want them to be normalized in the sense that they take the unit to the identity. And we equip this with the weak star topology coming from the norm structure. And when we do that, we see that this is actually a compact, convex. Is actually a compact convex set. It's compact because it's obtained in the unit ball of the dual. And there's a natural map for math to the affluent functions on the space. To the Apple functions on this space. And moreover, the image of these functions is going to be continuous. And the map is defined by taking f, f goes to f hat. K is s of f. Oh yeah, sorry. Yeah, thanks. S of f. And the map takes f to f hat, where f hat Where f hat is point evaluation. So f hat of x, remember x is a functional, so you simply plug in f. This is familiar to us from the theory of commutative sistages, for example. Sorry, is there a question? With respect to other weak star topology. Okay, and then there's this really beautiful theorem of Cadison, sometimes called Cadison's representation theorem, which says that actually this map is an isomorphism between the function system f and the function system of alpha and continuous alpha and functions on f. So, this tells us that every abstract function system is actually isomorphic to the continuous affluent functions in a compact, convex set. Let me introduce another category because I want to restate Kaddison's representation theorem in a slightly different way. So, the category I want to consider is the category of convex sets, compact convex sets. So, the objects here are the compact convex sets. And the morphisms are the continuous affine maps. And I mean affine in the same way, it means that they preserve convex, they respect convex combinations. Donations. So let me restate Cadiz's representation there now. I want to think of this map from a function system to the continuous affine functions on the state space of f. I want to think of this as actually giving us a contravariant function, functor. That implements an equivalence of categories. So the contraband functor that takes k, compact-convex set, to the continuous affine functions on k, which is a map from compact-convex sets to function systems. This is actually implementing an equivalence of categories. So what this tells us is that thinking about operator systems in the commutative case or the classical case is actually exactly the same thing as studying compact convex sets. So that's what I meant when I said, even if you think you've never used operator systems before, you actually have. You've probably just been working with the dual instead of the operator systems themselves. So, what I'd like to do for you today is talk about the non-created setting. Before I do that, though, I want to say a couple things about this dual equivalence. So if you're familiar with this kind of thing, you'll know that when you have a dual equivalence, and this is about as nice as it gets because, in a sense, these are both, on both sides, you have very natural objects. And they really provide useful, each provides its own kind of. Provides its own kind of useful perspective. I think our intuition for the geometric structure of a compact convex set is much different than our intuition for, say, the structure of an ordered vector space, yet we're studying the same objects. And so what I was going to say is, you know that it's often quite hard to translate between what a property on this side corresponds to and a property to what properties on the other side it corresponds to. To what properties on the other side it corresponds to. That can be a hard thing to translate, but in principle you can. So I want to say a little bit about that, and I want to talk about the representation theory, or at least a fragment of the representation theory of function systems. The representations I'm going to be interested in are the embeddings of f, let's say, into the commutative c sub algebra c of s. A commutative C sub algebra C of S. So we can assume now by this representation theorem of Cadizon that f is isomorphic to the continuous alpha functions on some k. We know k is really the state space of f. So let me say that and Say that. And it turns out there's a very nice description of all these embeddings. They correspond exactly to closed subsets that are in between the closure of the extreme points of our compact convex set and the entire compact convex set. Convex set. So specifically, we have a minimal embedding. So a equals x. I say, oh yeah. I didn't require, though, that I do want to require this. So of course, if I have an embedding into a C-star algebra, I can always take that C-star algebra. A C star algebra, I can always take that C star algebra and embed it into a much bigger C star algebra. So to sort of keep things manageable, we're interested in the case when it's embedded into something so that it has the property that its image generates it as a C star algebra. And then we have this correspondence. And yeah, this should be an X now. So there's a minimal such embedding. So F always embeds into the closure of its The closure of its extreme points, that's a compact convact, or sorry, it's a compact host of space. The fact that this is actually an embedding, you can see that because of the fact that affine functions always peak on extreme points. That's a very easy exercise. On the other hand, there's a maximal such embedding, and I'll tell you the sense in which I mean maximal, minimal, the precise sense. But it's clear that this is an embedding. It's clear that this is an embedding. The Afghan functions, as I mentioned, generate C of K by the Still-Meier-Stress theorem. And we have, so my mean, minimum, and maximum in the following sense. So I always have this embedding into C of K and this embedding into C of the closure of the extreme points. Let me see if this. And it's supposed to have another embedding. Have another embedding in C of X. Then it turns out that I always have a surjective star homomorphism from C of K to C of X and a surjective star homomorphism from C of X to C of this minimal embedding. And we often refer to this. The C star algebra, C of the closure of the extreme points. This is the C star envelope, which is a name I really dislike, but we're kind of stuck with it. I like C star min, minimal C star algebra, generated by our function system. And C of K is the maximal C star algebra that is generated by this function. Algebra that is generated by this function system. So, what I'd like to do is talk about all these concepts in the non-commutative case, the general setting of an operative system. Because it turns out that all the things I just told you have very nice non-commutative analogs. So I'm going to talk now about general operator systems. And the idea now is that we'd like to capture the properties, abstract properties, of self-adjoint unital subspaces of non-cummutative C-star algebra. Me, the sister of course. So I'm going to write S typically for an operator system now. A here can be any arbitrary C-star algebra, but since every C-star algebra embeds into some Since every C-star algebra embeds into some B of H, I could simply talk about unit old self-adjoint subspaces of B of H, where H is some Hilbert space of some cardinality. So formally, an operator system once again is a triple consisting of a star vector space. Some kind of a notion of positivity, which I'm going to say a little bit more about. I'm writing this, so this is indexed now over the natural numbers. It's a sequence of columns, we're going to see. And then I want a unit that satisfies certain properties. So here are the properties of these objects. So S is a star vector space again. Star vectors fix again. For each N, the set SN plus, this is a subset of S, I want this to be a, sorry, it's a subset of Mn of S, by which I mean the tensor product of Mn and S. Of Mn and S. You can think of this, of course, as matrices over S, and by matrices over S, but formally I mean the tensor product, the algebraic tensor product. This should be a cone, which is proper in the sense that the intersection of S n plus and its negative only contains the zero element. Element. Sometimes people call that properness, but they will say it's properness for other things. And I want what I'm going to call EN, by which I mean the tensor product of the unit E and the identity on Mn. I want this to be an R-commedian order unit in the sense that we talked about earlier. For Mn of S. Thinking of Mn of S as a function system. Because notice that each level or each of these Mn of S's is an addition because these objects will satisfy the properties for a function system. You can think of it as a function system. And in particular, this makes sense. In particular, this makes sense. So, this gives me a category now of abstract operator systems. So, my objects, of course, are operator systems. And I need to tell you what I mean by morphisms. There's a natural notion of morphism. I just want the maps that preserve this structure, respect this. This structure, respect this structure. So, specifically, what I want are what we call complete unital order homorphisms. What I mean by that is that if I have a positive element, for the keyword here, The key word here that makes this differ from the definition for function systems is that we really need to take into account the matricial structure over the space S. And the way that that translates in terms of these morphisms is we want, so I'll write, yeah, if I have a morphism, say S, sorry, phi from S1 to S2, I'll write phi n for the morphism. Which is the tensor product of the identity map on Mn with phi, which is a map from Mn of S1 to Mn of S2. And what I require is that each of these higher order maps, these phi n's, should itself be a unital order homomorphism. Remember, we're trying to capture subspaces of non-caded C-star algebras. It took a great deal of work actually to realize that the way to do that was to capture this matricial structure. Metricial structure. So, we want some compatibility between the cell process, or is it heat? Yeah, thank you. I missed that. Yeah, that's really important. So, we've got these sort of levels, and right now all I have is I have a sequence of function systems, but I want some way to tie them together. The way that we tie them together is I don't have any room here, so let me add the missing axiom here. I want this property to hold. So, if I take the f. If I take the F level and I hit it by some, show me these Greek letters, because there's a Greek person in the audience. But I guess this is just A for you. So if alpha is a matrix, like an ordinary complex matrix, let's say N by M, then Should preserve positivity, and these levels should be closed under these kinds of compressions. That's the compatibility condition that I need. So this is for the alpha and m and m. Ready this for the n by m complex matrices. That follows once you have a colour. Yeah, I don't think I need to. Yep. Probably be convenient if you wanted to actually work with that, but I don't need that for now. So there's again a natural notion of norm, which I can actually define in the same way, because I have this order structure on each level. I can use the same formula that I used for function systems. I'll just say same idea. And now let me give you an example. Okay, so remember my example for the commutative case was when you have a compact convex set. And we want to do the same thing here. We want to do the same thing here, but we want to capture sort of matricial levels. So I'm going to introduce the notion of a non-commutative convex set very briefly. So compact NC convex. So NC here stands for non-commutative, as I might have guessed, set. Now let me tell you what this means. So each of these Let me tell you what this is. This is going to be a disjoint union over cans. And I need to now tell you what these cans are and what properties they satisfy. Yeah? Sorry, just with the NORN thing, I was just thinking back with the function systems. There's a number of potential different ways to define NORN for a non-selflich, like a non-self element, right? But you don't have that issue in operator systems, I guess. Is that like. Operator systems, I guess. Is that like something you can create for the computer or matter at all? No, because I'm going to want, I'm just avoiding writing down the 2x2 matrix trick of Ernst. Not because I don't like it, I think it's great, but I just didn't want to get into it. So you can define it on the self-adjoint elements. There's a clear canonical way to do that. And then there's a way to figure out what to write down for non-self-adjoint elements. Let's stick with that. But let's stick with that, just because I don't have that much time. There are many ways to extend the norm. Yeah, I only care after equivalents. That's right. Okay, so what are these KNs? Well, each KN is itself compact and convex. Convex. So that's what I mean by compact here on this disjoint union. I mean that each of these Kns is itself compact. And not only that, but I want these to have some compatibility in the sense that Kn is a subset or subspace of the tensor product of Mn over some common ground space E. I'm not going to say so much about what. I'm not going to say so much about what E is. Just think of some space where it both makes sense to talk about convexity and makes sense to talk about matricial structure over E. Typically, E is going to be an operator space or star vector space or something like that. There's going to be a canonical choice for E that I'll point out in a minute. So, right now, we have just layers of compact convex sets with no compatibility between them, just like this puzzle. Between them. Just like this positivity structure, where I needed to specify this compatibility condition, I need a compatibility condition here. And the right compatibility condition is that I want this set K to be closed under what we think of as non-commutative convex combinations. And so what I mean by that is that a sum of the form, say, alpha i star x i alpha i, if these If these alpha i stars are scalar matrices and these xi's are all in k, and in addition, this is a convex combination in the sense that these add up to 1, then this should still be in k. So the difference here between classical convexity and what I'm doing here is I'm allowing my coefficients, in classical convexity, we allow scalar. In classical convexity, we allow scalar coefficients, and I would typically write my alpha i on the left-hand side. Here, we're actually allowing for matricial coefficients. And of course, that requires some compatibility in terms of the matrix sizes. So if xi comes from, say, the nth level, and my output is going to be on the mth level, then I'm going to need to specify particular sizes here for ni. By particular sizes here for Ni and Mi. But let's not get too much into that. The idea is that there's some very natural notion of convexity in this non-commutative setting. And once I have a notion of convexity, like I always tell my my students when I'm teaching linear algebra, I always say, you know, a vector space on its own isn't that interesting. It's only interesting when you start to introduce some notion of function on the space. Of function on a space. I think the same thing here is true. So a function on K, and I should say an NC function on K, is a function of F from K, which remember is this disjoint union of Kn's. And the image is going to be in this disjoint union of M n's. And the properties that I want to have to satisfy. And the properties I want F to satisfy. So, first of all, F should be graded in the sense that it sends elements in Kn to Mn. It should respect unitary conjugation in the sense that it should be able to pull unitaries out. So, if you're familiar with Wittgalescu's theory of, well, if I should say Taylor Woodkalescu's theory of free analytic functions. Of free analytic functions. This is very reminiscent of that. So the functions that they work with are actually NC functions in this sense. But instead of being holomorphic or analytic, what we're interested in here is being affine. I want a notion of affine function. So if, in addition, f respects these NC convex combinations, in the sense that, well, the natural sense, Natural sense Then we say that f is affine. We can talk about affine NC functions. Now we have a topology around because we have a notion of compactness. That means there's this topology lurking in the background. That means I can talk about continuity. That means I can talk about continuity. Of all NC functions, actually. What I'd like to do now is I'd like to show you that this picture in the commutative case, once we have these notions, actually carries over to the non-commutative case. Carries over to the non-committed case. Okay, so let me just add some notation. I'm going to write FK. So K here is an N C compact NC conduct set. NC conduct set. I'm going to write Fk for the continuous affine functions. I'm going to write C of K for the continuous NC functions. And let me just state a couple facts. State it as one fact. First of all, f of k is an operator system. C of k is a c star algebra, where we equip this with point-wise multiplication. And actually, we can even say more than that. It's actually the C-star algebra like this. Say it like this. There's a natural embedding, of course, of the affine continuous functions into all continuous functions. And more than that, we actually have that the continuous affine functions generate the continuous NC functions. This is not an easy result, but as you can probably tell, I'm not really too worried about giving everyone credit. I'm just telling you a bunch of Telling you a bunch of stuff. This is a theorem. It's really a kind of a non-commutative analog. It's a special case of the non-commutative Still-Meier-Strauss problem, because it's not known in general whether the non-commutative Still-Marsstrauss theorem is true. But in this case, it is true. So now we have a category, a new category. Oh, let me tell you one more thing. So if I have, go back to my absolute Go back to my abstract operator system S for a second. There's a very natural notion now, a very nice generalization of the notion of a state space, which we call the NC state space. And by this, I simply mean the NC state space of S, this is the set of all UCP maps from S into M. From S into Mn, where I'm actually going to allow N here, I won't get into it too much now, I guess, but N here should be allowed to be an infinite cardinal, in which case you should think of Mn as V of H. It's convenient to use the same notation for infinite cardinals. And of course, you need to worry about cardinality issues. You need to worry about cardinality issues, so you only really want to take n up to a certain, you know, some fixed cardinal, but let's ignore that. And now we have the natural map. I'll also just say the topology on this is the point we start topology, which makes sense because on the right-hand side you have a dual space. And with this topology, each of these layers is compact and convex. So this is an NC compact. So, this is an NC, compact NC compact set. And there's a natural map from S to the continuous affine NC functions on K. And there's a nice theorem of Webster and Winkler. Think around 2010-ish. 2010-ish. So these were PhD students of Efros, and they proved that this map is actually an isomorphism. So that this is really an analog, an uncommon analog of Cadison's representation theory. And as I did before, I want to make this a little bit more categorical. So let me introduce the second, fourth category, I guess. So I want to talk about the So, I want to talk about the compact NC convex sets. Morphisms here are the maps between compact, non-commutative, convex sets, and they're the maps that respect the affline structure in the obvious way. In the obvious way, I want the continuous athletic maps. I'll say NC maps. Because you have to respect not just the structure on each level, but actually the structure that ties it together. And then we have an analog of this contravariant duality. Say the functor from NC con to operator systems, which takes k to the operative system of continuous affine NC functions on k. This is an equivalence of categories. I should say it's a dual equivalence of categories, because it's Says the dual equivalence of categories because it's contravariant. So, what this says is that if you're studying operator systems, you're really studying NC convex sets, and vice versa. Now, just to finish off, I'm going to do two things. I'm going to briefly mention this picture, this representation theoretic picture, where we can characterize all the embeddings. Where we can characterize all the embeddings. So I'll just identify S with the alphanum functions on its NC state space. I'm interested in embeddings into C star algebras generated by the image. So as before, So, as before, we have this nice picture where there's a natural maximal and a natural minimal embedding. And everything in between is an image under a surjective star homomorphism. I'm going to use this suggestive notation. You want to make sense of what this means. You need to sort of take into account. To sort of take into account the right non-commutative analog of a C-star algebra on a set of points. I won't get into that now, but I'll just say these are really representations of this big thing. So you're sort of compressing to, you can think of your universal C-star algebra as a direct sum over the representation space, and you're sort of compressing to this, to the image where you're only taking the project, or the representations. Taking the project or the representations in this set. There's a good notion of extreme point. Again, I don't have time to get into it. Good notion of extreme point. All the usual results you're familiar with from convexity theory, like for example the Kran-Millman theorem, Millman's partial converse, separation theorems, all these things. They all work in the non-commutative setting actually quite well. It was a bit of an ordeal to prove a lot of these results, but most of them are now known. So this object is the maximal C star algebra of our operator system mass. And the thing on the bottom is our C star envelope. What this says is that you can realize your C star envelope in terms of the extreme points of your Hency convex set. Maybe let me think. Maybe let me finish with an example. In the commutative case, it's sort of easy to see why this dual perspective might be useful because there's lots of really interesting convex sets around. I claim the same thing is actually true in the non-commutative case, but we still need to develop a lot of our theory and intuition about these anti-convex sets. Let me give you one example very quickly. So let K be the distribution union of sets of the form Of sets of the form, I want d tuples of operators in mn with the property that the norm as a row is bounded by one. Less than one. So this is an NC convex stat. So this is an NC convex set. It's the, I like to think of this as the non-commutative ball. In fact, it is the non-commutative T-ball. And people that do NC function theory, like NC analytic function theory, they think about this object. It's kind of like the most natural, like the unit ball in C is the most natural domain to consider holomorphic functions. This is the most natural domain to consider NC holomorphic functions. And I can just tell you that the affine functions on this set as an operative system, this is isomorphic to the operative system spanned by generators of the Kuntz algebra. So, here, what I mean by generators of the Kuntz algebra are that they satisfy these relations. So, they add up to one. They satisfy these relations. So they add up to one, the ranges add up to one, and pardon me? I cannot see that. And S1 primarily is a product there, in general. Sir? Is it when you write the span, one is it a product or oh, does that mean comma? Yeah, thanks. And let me just tell you, this minimal C star algebra, this is actually the Kuntz algebra. Kuhn's C star algebra degenerates. So we have this geometric description of the Kuntz algebra. It's the continuous functions on the back. Continuous functions on the boundary of this compact anti-convex set. And there are lots more examples we know. I should say this. Yeah, I think I'll stop here. Thank you. Very much.
