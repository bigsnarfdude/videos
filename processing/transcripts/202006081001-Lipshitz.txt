With mountains in the distance and the wonderful high-altitude air, and sounds like grizzly bears growling in the forests and all of that. Takes a long time to get here, but once you hear, it's just wonderful. So, I want to tell you today about some joint work with Shu Shri Sharkar showing that Kavanophology detects split links. Showing that Kavanophomology detects split links. I'll give you the statement of the theorem in a few slides. It's a little bit difficult sometimes to follow slide talks or Zoom talks in general because the text disappears. So if you want to follow along, the slides are at pages.uoregon.edu slash lipshit slash slides slash burrs2020.pdf and maybe somebody who types fast can stick that in the chat so that um Chat so that people can click on it later. I'll hang on a sec in case you want to write down, get open the URL. Perfect. Thanks, Alison. Oh, and it's wonderful to see so many, so many people, you know, friends and acquaintances and people who I look forward to meeting here. The plan for the talk is I'm going to I'm going to just, you know, as an introduction, talk about history of detection results and cavanophomology briefly, and then tell you what the theorem I'm going to talk about is. Then a short overview of the proof. And then I'm going to focus on three ingredients in the proof. So three of the main ingredients. The first is a little bit about A infinity modules that's sort of in some sense well known, but maybe not familiar to everybody. And then Familiar to everybody, and then talk about the base point action Kavanaugh homology and two different actions in Hagard-Furhomology and how they're related. That'll be maybe the biggest part of the talk. I think this talk has unfortunately few pictures for a topology talk. So I thought, well, it's an internet talk. The internet is for cat pictures. So I'll add some cat pictures. So let's try to open the Let's try to open the package and see what to talk about what Kavanophomology detects. There's a long history of detection results in Kavanaugh. Oh, I meant to turn on... Ah, there's this. Sorry, I meant to turn on subtitles. So if. The recording has stopped. Oh, really? No, no, no. Don't ignore that. Sorry about that. Great. Let me know if the subtitles that Microsoft is generating. That Microsoft is generating automatically are distracting. But otherwise, maybe it's helpful if you have trouble hearing or your audio is not going well. You'll see some of the spelling of mathematical terms is not great. Anyway, so here are the results that I could think of about Kavanophomology detecting things. And if you know of others, I'd be interested to know, and you can post them in the chat and berate me for not having mentioned them or. Not having mentioned them or just let people know about them. The first one for co-anophology that I know of is a theorem of Elie Grigsby and Stefan Vali from 2008, which showed that if you take any non-trivial cable of a knot K, then the Kavanophomology of the cable distinguishes your knot from the unknown in the sense that the total rank of Kavanophomology or the dimension of Kavanophomology over F2 is bigger for any. Is bigger for any cable of a non-trivial knot than the corresponding cable of the unknown non-trivial cable. Pretty quickly after that, Matt Hedden gave another proof for the case of two cables, a more direct proof. Okay, then the next result I was aware of is Kronhar and Rofka showed that Kavanophomology itself detects the unknown. If you have a non-trivial knot, then the dimension of Kavanophomology is bigger than the dimension of Kavanaugh. Karanophomology is bigger than the dimension of Kavanophomology of the Adnanad. Shortly before that, Matt Hedden and E.N. showed that the Kavanaugh homology also detects a two-component unlink, provided it detects the unnaught. So after the Karno-Rofka theorem, they show that the graded dimension detects a two-component unlink. The total dimension doesn't because for a half-link and for an unlink, the total dimension of both is four. Is four. Okay, the next result was showing that the module structure on Kavantophology detects an unlink of an arbitrary number of components. That was head and knee again. And that's going to be sort of in a similar spirit to the kinds of results that I'm going to, the new result I'm going to talk about in this talk. Okay, the module structure detects it, and that was improved by Bats and Seed to show that the graded dimension, the bi-graded vector space. Vector space detects the unlink. Then there was a pause for a while. There weren't any more detection results that I could think of for some time. Great. But the next result was Baldwin Civek showed that the cavanophomology groups detect the trefoils. They, I think, use both the two torsion and the free abelian part. Abelian part. Then Baldwin Shivik and E. Zhi showed that Kavanaugh, the greater dimensions, attack the hop flink. Oh, whoops. Yes. And then that the Kavanaugh, then most recently, Yi Ji and Boyu Zhang showed that Kavanophology detects forests of hoplinks on. So the links with Links and unknots. So the links with minimal dimension of Kavanophomology are gotten by taking some tree and hoplinking together unknots at the edges of the tree and then taking a distort unit of a bunch of those. Oh yeah, I forgot about the T26. Ina points out that Gage Martin showed colonomology takes T26, which is another great result. And then also extremely recently, Josh Wang showed. Josh Wang showed that Kavanaugh detects trivial band sums among all band sums. Okay, great. And I apparently missed another one, which I don't know how to state because I didn't notice it, I guess. That's great. So these are all beautiful theorems. Essentially, all of them use the strategy of, well, you take something that we understand geometrically better. That we understand geometrically better, usually it's instanton fluorhomology or Hagar monopole fluorhomology, and you construct a spectral sequence, you use a spectral sequence from Kavanophomology to it, and then you use properties of the target to say something about Kavanophomology. And the theorem I'm going to tell you today fits into the same strategy, so no difference there. Yeah, if you're bored, you can count how many different ways my Different ways Microsoft decides to write down Kavanaugh homology. Okay, so the main theorem today. Well, first, let me give a construction. Suppose I've got a link L, and I've got two base points on L. So I don't know. Whoops, I can draw. Sorry. So I've got a link and I've got two basics. So, I've got a link and I've got two base points, P and Q. Then you can take the reduced homology at P and view it as a module over F2 adjoin x1 x squared using the base point q. So what that means is at the base point, whatever circle has a base point p in it, I require that to be labeled, say, x. And the base point containing q, there's an action by merging on a small unknown at that base point. On a small unknot at that base point. And so the theorem is: okay, first version: given a link and two points on the link, there's a two-sphere separating those two points. So the link is split separating those two points, if and only if the kavanohomology of the link, reduced kavanoformology, is a free module over f2 brackets x mod x squared. By the way, I'm going to suppress. By the way, I'm going to suppress. This is with Kavanophomology for me is with F2 coefficients for the rest of the talk, and I'm going to suppress the coefficients usually. The way we prove the theorem is actually sort of complicated. Four things are equivalent. So let me tell you what those four things are. Given a chain complex of R modules over some ring R, though for us is F2 brackets X1 X squared. brackets x1 x squared. I'm going to call it quasi-free if it's quasi-isomorphic to a bounded chain complex of free R modules. An obstruction to being quasi-free is you can take, well, over this ring F2 brackets x mod x squared is you can take this big complex. So you take just a bunch of copies of C star with A bunch of copies of C star with maps X between them and ask: Is this acyclic? Does it have trivial homology? If C star was free, then this complex is acyclic. So you take a spectral sequence where you filter by the grading on C star and everything dies at the E1 page. So we call this the unrolled homology. If the unrolled homology is non-trivial, then C star is not quasi-free. Quasi-free. And so the more, the longer version of our theorem is that C star is quasi-free. Sorry, is that, so there's a two-sthere separating P and Q. The Kavanaugh homology is a free R module. The Kavanaugh chain complex is quasi-free. That is, again, quasi-exported to a finite complex of free modules. Or the underworld homology of the Kavanaugh. Of the Kvanov complex or Kvanov homology is trivial. And the proof is going to be: one implies two and three, two and three both imply four, either of them implies four, and four implies one. Okay, so I'm going to say that again now in the overview of the proof. Oops. Sorry. Is it your cat in the picture? It is my cat in the picture. That's really beautiful. Cat in the picture. That's really beautiful. Thank you. She agrees with you. Her name is Willa. So I moved the statement of the theorem up to the corner so that we can refer to it. Here are the ingredients in the proof, and then the next slide I'll put them together. So the first is: okay, Shumakovich shows that the Kavanophomology of a not is a free module that also follows an argument in odd. It also follows an argument in Oddkavana phomology. And in fact, we cite the Oddkavanophomology who weren't aware of the Shimakovich theorem that we should have been. And then, okay, base point independence. The others, the next statement I need is that the Kavanaugh complexes depends only on the component containing P and Q and not the base, which point where on the diagram P and Q are exactly. And together, those two obviously give us that one. Give us that one implies two and one implies three. Because if you take a disjoint union, well, I'll say it on the next slide again, but if you take a disjoint union of two diagrams, then by the first statement in the Kuhner theorem, for Kavanophomology, the Kavanaugh Mmology, the Khanov complex, they both give you free modules. Okay. The next ingredient is: okay, this is an Auschwitz spectral sequence from Kavanophomology, the HF-HADA, and the branch of a cover. Really, there's a mirror somewhere. Really, there's a mirror somewhere, but I'm going to drop those for the talk. And that respects the R module structure. Actually, it respects the A infinity R module structure. Okay, then I need to, then there's a relation between the unrolled homology for HF hat and a different version of Hagard-Fleur homology, twisted Hagard-Flohrhomology with Novikov coefficients, certain Novikov coefficients. Certain Ovakov coefficients. And then it was already known by work of Ni and Hedeni mostly and Akamali Shahi and Ni a little bit that the Novikov coefficient for homology detects two spheres. So how do these get put together? So, as I said, one implies two and one implies three. For a split diagram, that's immediate from freeness of the Kavanaugh homology, and then for a general diagram, it follows from base point independence. Two implies four, and three implies four. This is just algebra. So, for two implies four, you need to know that you can compute the unrolled homology from the Kavanov homology, not just the Kavanov complex, and that follows from some A infinity thing that will say. And that follows from some A infinity thing that I'll say in a few minutes. For 3 implies 4, you just filter by the grading on C star, and it's at the E1 page, the spectral sequence vanishes. And then the main work is 4 implies 1. So for 4 implies 1, first we'd use the fact that the spectral sequence from Kavanaugh Mology to HF hat, the fact that. The fact that that respects the A infinity operations means that if the unrolled homology for Kavana homology is trivial, then the unrolled homology for HF hat is trivial. That tells us that the Novikov coefficient fluore homology is trivial, and that tells us that there's a splitting sphere. So that's how the ingredients are put together. Maybe I should pause for questions briefly before I go on to the individual pieces. So I'm going to talk about three of the components to this proof next, but if they're quick questions, Next, but if they're quick questions, I'll try to answer them now. Are we going to explain the X-action on Haggard Philhermology? That's a great question. I am going to explain the X-action on Hagar Philhermology. It's the H1 mod torsion action, but then we're going to have to upgrade that a little bit in order to get what we want. But yeah, I'll explain that in a few slides. Thanks, Paula. More questions? I didn't hear that, so I'm going to assume that that was background noise and not a question. If it was a question, try typing into the chat. Thanks. I'll step forward, but we can step back if questions appear. Okay, A infinity background. This might be a little bit boring to some of you who are comfortable with A infinity algebras. So, an infinity module is a vector space together with some multiplication maps, and M1, which just takes the element of vector space, and M2, which takes the element of vectors and element of the ring, like the usual action of a ring on a module, and then some higher ones, and satisfies some compatibility condition that's not very hard to state, but that I'm not going to state. For the special case of the ring, we're looking at f2 brackets x mod x. We're looking at f2 brackets x mod x squared, and when we're looking at what's called a strictly unital infinity module, the only information is in how you multiply by a bunch of x's. And what that satisfies is that the sum of all ways of multiplying by the same number of x's twice, I mean, it's this in trees. This is the condition that this so if you So, if you put in a bunch of x's and you sum over always with, for example, five x's of multiplying by them, then you get zero. So there's not a lot of information in an A infinity module over this ring. The operation M1 is a differential on M, so you could think of this as a chain complex M, or differential module M with some differential vector space M with some Space M with some extra actions. In particular, a chain complex of R modules gives you an A infinity module where M3 and M4 and M5 and so on are zero. So any chain complex of modules is a special case of an A infinity module. Two properties that we're going to need about A infinity modules. The first is that called transfer of structure or the Called transfer of structure, the homological perturbation lemma. So what it says exactly is if you have an A infinity module and a chain complex, just of vector spaces, and a chain homotary equivalence of them, just of F2 vector spaces or K vector spaces, if you're ever some other field K. Then there's an induced A infinity structure on the target N, so that this is actually a homotopy equivalence of A infinity modules. So you can push forward A infinity structure. So you can push forward A infinity structures, which is not something you can do for, for example, differential module structures. In particular, there's a homoto, we're working over a field like F2. So the homology of any chain complex is quasi-isomorphic to the original chain complex. Sorry, is how much are equivalent to the original chain complex over F2. And so the homology of a chain complex of R modules inherits the structure of an A infinity module. The second property that we're going to need is that homotopy equivalence and quasi-isomorphism for A infinity modules are the same concept. They are equivalent. So if I have chain complex of R modules, they're quasi-isomorphic if and only if they're A infinity homotopy equivalent or also A infinity quasi-isomorphic. So if I want to show that two chain complexes are quasi-isomorphic, sometimes it's easier to show that they're A infinity homotopy equivalent. And that'll be the Homotopy equivalent. And that'll be the strategy we use next. Okay, and the last thing in this general A infinity stuff is I want to point out that this unrolled complex makes sense for an A infinity module. So I think focus first on the picture. So if we have an infinity module M, I have a whole bunch of operations. I've got a differential M1. I've got a differential m1 that goes from m to itself wherever the string, this is, I should say, m is over f2 brackets x mod x squared. And so we can multiply by x, that's the m2 arrows, I can do the m3 with two copies of x, that's the m3 arrows, and so on. And this gives me an infinity module structure on. module structure on, sorry, not name. This gives me a chain complex. So using all these A infinity operations, this is a chain complex. So it's a generalization of the unrolled homology. This is invariant under A infinity homotopy equivalence. If I have a homotopy equivalence, you just write down infinity homotopy equivalence, you just write down a map down. It's the same as quasi-isomorphism. Okay. There's something a little bit tricky there. It's important that I complete in one direction. So there's an action, y here actually. There's an action, Y here acts just by translating everything over one step, and it's important that I complete in the positive direction there. Fine, so the precise definition is up above, really, not the picture. Great. And then two implies for that the Kavanaugh homology free implies that the unrolled homology is trivial is obvious because if the Kavanaugh homology is free, all you have If the Kavanaugh model is free, all you have here is the M2s. All of this other stuff goes away, and the M2s are isomic, you know, whatever. Easy exercise to see that the thing is acyclic. Everything's either whatever. You'll figure it out. And three implies four, you filter by the grading on M. Okay, the base point actions on Kavanophomology. We're going to have two base points involved. So fixed points P and Q on a link L. That makes the Kvanov complex of L into a bimodule over F2 brackets double. two brackets w mod w squared and f2 brackets x mod x squared. So I've got a base point p and a base point q and you can merge in an unknot at either point and those merge maps give you a module structure on the Kavanaugh complex. Okay, sorry, keep going. So ahead in the So, Het and Knee mostly showed, and then we finished showing, that up to quasi-isomorphism, this bimodule doesn't depend on where you put P and Q in the component. It's also invariant under Ridemeister moves, moving, you know, Ridemeister moves, because you can then move PQ away from the place you're doing the Ridemeister move. In particular, I can, as a module over, I can, as a module over either one of the two, f2 brackets w mod w squared, f2 brackets x mod x squared, say f2 brackets w mod w squared, the Kavanaugh complex is free. Not over both, but over one of the two it's free. So you can tensor over that with just f2, and that's the same as getting the reduced complex. So the theorem implies that the module structure over f2x x mod x squared on the reduced Kvanov complex is also well defined. The way we're going to prove the theorem is we're going to say that if you move Going to prove the theorem is we're going to say that if you move a we're going to show that if you move one of the base points through a crossing, that gives you an A infinity homotopy equivalence between the modules. The proof is essentially local, so I'm going to do an example, but the example is really the whole proof. I mean, well, two examples is really the whole proof. The two sides here are basically the same. It's just whether you The same. It's just whether you're moving. So I'm moving Q through a crossing, and you can move it either on the under strand or the over strand. So let's focus. Whoops. Let's focus on the left picture. At the top, so what's all of this stuff? The black arrows are the differential on the Kovanov complex. Complex. The red arrow is the action of W, that's at the base point P, and the blue arrow is the action of X, that's at the base point Q. So notice that the red arrows are the same on the top and bottom because we didn't move the base point P, but the blue arrows are different. On the left side, it's the same because Q ends up on the same. The same circle when you do the zero resolution. But when you do the one resolution, Q moves. So here the blue arrows go like this, and here they go like that. Okay, and so we want to see that these two complexes are homotopy equivalent. What do we do? We just write down the homotopy equivalent. So at the first order level, it's just the identity map. Level it's just the identity map, so the chain map F010 is just the identity map. That doesn't quite commute with the x-axis, it commutes with the w action, but there's a homotopy between the x-axis before and the x-axis after. That's given by these green dashed arrows. And the fact that this is actually an A-infinity map just corresponds, so all the higher operate maps are zero, and the fact that this is an A-infinity map corresponds to checking that certain two-step paths. Certain two-step paths cancel. For example, if I look at two-step paths from one tensor one to one tensor X, how can we get there? We can get there by doing F 010 and then a blue arrow. I can't get there by doing a blue arrow and then F 010. That's because the x actions are different before and after. Different before and after. So that's a failure of the map F010 to respect the x-action. But then the homotopy takes care of it because you can get there in that path followed by this path. So the proof that the base point actions are independent of the position of the base point, you just stare at this and check some. You just write down the infinity maps, and you check that it's an infinity map by checking that some squares cancel. Okay, that's all I'm going to say about the base point action being well defined because it really is just a direct computation. Questions about this section so far? Excellent. On we go. Okay, the main new ingredient is understanding, or another new ingredient. Understanding or another new ingredient is understanding the module structure on Hagrad pharmology and how they relate to each other. So, by the way, that's not my mathematics. Two different kinds of twisted of sorry, two different actions on Hagard Fleur homology. So, okay, fix a three-manifold and a homomorphism from its second homology to Z. Aujar Sawa constructs two things from that. The first is they construct an action of the exterior algebra on untwisted HF hat. I'm going to review both constructions in a minute. So the next couple of slides will be reviewing both of these constructions. It's in their first paper. And they also construct a twisted version of HF hat, which is a module over F2 bracket, over Laurent polynomials. Laurent polynomials. This is the group ring of Z, so this is the same as F2 bracket Z or a completion of that. And sometimes I'm going to want to talk about the uncompleted version, sometimes the completed version. These are known, so different things are known about these two things. Firstly, knee and hedon knee and Akram and I showed that this This twisted version, when you do the completion, so here it's important that you have the double bracket, vanishes if and only if there's a two-sphere that omega evaluates on non-trivially. Second, so that's great, that's one tool that we need. On the other hand, for the first one, we had an action of ft raised x mod x squared on Kavanaugh homology. Raise x mod x squared on Kavanaugh homology. So we can relate, we can hope to, and in fact can relate these actions. Again, that was mostly done by Het and me. So the spectral sequence from Kavanaugh, HF hat, respects this F2 bags x1 x squared action. In case that statement makes you very nervous, that's actually not what I'm going to prove. I'm going to say something about filtered complexes because module structures on spectral sequences are a little bit fiddly. So in order to prove So, in order to prove the theorem that we want, what we want to do is relate these two actions, because we have one property we want, detecting spheres for one of them, and the other property we want, relation with quantum homology for the other. The relation is going to look, it's sort of an extension of earlier work of Shudsvit Charkar when he was talking about base point moving maps, and then more recent work of Ian Zemke, as you'll see in a couple of slides. Okay. Okay, let me remind you how the H1 mod torsion action works. So the differential on HF hat, what does it do? It counts holomorphic disks in the symmetric product with don't cross the base point Z, that's the hat, going from X to Y, mass of index 1. So I'm just going to run the example of S2 times S1 because it's easy to draw for both of the actions. So, but we'll use a more complicated hegemon. So, but we'll use a more complicated Hagar diagram eventually. So, here there are, whoops, come on, you here, there are two domains of holomorphic disks. There's one there that goes from x to y, and there's one that goes in the back from x to y. So, in particular, the differential differential of x is 2 or 0 times y, which is 0. We're working in characteristic 2, so no signs. And the differential of y is 0. The action of zeta, so zeta is say, is an element of h1 of y. I represent it by some curve on the surface, that's the green curve here. And it looks almost the same as the formula for the differential, except we pick up this term, the intersection number of zeta, with the alpha boundary of the homotopy class. So here, for this first disk, when I go along. This first disk, when I go along the alpha boundary that's there, there's one point where it intersects the L, where Zeta intersects the alpha boundary. So this contributes a copy of Y with coefficient 1. And the disk in the back is disjoint from Zeta, and so it doesn't contribute. So we no longer have a cancellation. We get x times 8 is y, and y times, okay, y times 8 is 0, so no disks. Great. Okay, that's just moving the formula around so that we can say some more words. Equivalently, you can think of this as counting holomorphic strips in the symmetric product with a mark point at the point here's one, zero. And the mark point is required to go to zero. Required to go to zeta. Okay, or one point over the mark point goes to zeta. So why is x times zeta times zeta equal to zero? Well, there we consider a moduli space of holomorphic strips with two marked points on the boundary. One of the two we're requiring to map to zeta, the bottom one, and the top one we mapped to a push-off of zeta. Want to be mapped to a push-off of zeta, zeta prime. And again, the zeta prime has to come, it has to map to that later than zeta. When the distance between these two marked points, so that distance, goes to infinity, I just get x times zeta times zeta, this term. And then you can show that when that distance goes to zero, you get zero. In the example S2 times S1, there are no such disks because it would require the same point to be. Because it would require the same point to be in two different places at once. In general, there's some argument that they cancel in pairs when the distance goes to zero. So these are two ends of a moduli space and therefore they cancel. Well, okay, not quite because that moduli space has some other ends. In particular, what you actually get is a homotopy by looking at disks where the Um, disks where there's a point mapping to zeta and a point mapping to zeta prime at some finite height difference. So I thought I should give you an example of that if we have enough time, which we sort of do. So here's just, here's the still S2 times S1 on the right. It's just a more complicated diagram. I wrote down the differential up here. So for example, A goes to B in two different Goes to B in two different ways. There's a disc in the front here going from A to B. There's also a disc going around the back going from A to B, which is quasi-undrawable, but it goes around like this. So there's a disc there from A to B. There are two disks from A to C. Let me point out the one that's in the front. So the one that's in the front is there, and there's one that's in the back again. One that's in the back again. Okay. There's one disk from C to D, that's there. There's one disk from B to D, that's there. Great. Let's look at the action of zeta. So A times zeta, I get a contribution of B from there. From there. That's because the alpha boundary of this disk intersects Zeta in one point. There's also a contribution from the back disk, but the back disk intersects Zeta in two points, there and there. And so that gives me two more copies of B. So I actually get B three times in this picture, but that's just the same as one square over F2. And similarly, Two. And similarly, A times Zeta has a copy of C in it, and I won't draw those disks. B times Zeta, if I look at a disk from B to D, that again goes through Zeta on the boundary once, so I get a copy of D once. By contrast, C times Zeta, that goes to the, so the disk from C to D goes to zeta zero times, so that gives me zero. So I have a problem with the fact that zeta squared. I have a problem with the fact that zeta squared is zero. If I take a and I act by zeta, and then I act by zeta again, I get d, not zero. But on the other hand, zeta squared is supposed to be zero. So we don't quite have a module structure. Fortunately, this homotopy kicks in. So if I act by zeta twice on A, then A. Then, okay, there's this disk from A to B, and along the alpha boundary, I see zeta and then zeta prime. And so that contributes to the M3 operation I was defining over here. But if I, okay, fine, so that gives me a copy of B in M3 of A, zeta, zeta. There's also the back disk from A to B. Let's just somehow. Be but it's just somehow interesting. So let's just look at that briefly. There I go through zeta, zeta prime, zeta prime again, and then zeta. So there are two ways to get a configuration of the sort I drew here. You can take the first zeta with the first zeta prime or the first zeta with the second zeta prime. So that contributes two copies of B. Okay. So in all we get B. So, in all we get B. So, there's this fine, this is A infinity action. And the higher ones are defined similarly, you go through Zeta at some discrete set of, you know, a bunch of push-offs of Zeta in some sequence of times. Onwards. Twisted coefficients. Twisted coefficients is more familiar, I think, to people and simpler. Actually, equivalently difficult. So, fix for us, fix a hub. Um, so fix for us fix a homomorphism from h2 of y to z. I'm going to represent that by a curve zeta on sigma. So it's my intersection number with zeta of the alpha boundary. So here's my zeta. And then the twisted differential, you take t to the number of intersections of zeta with that boundary component of the with the alpha boundary component. So here, This disk, the boundary intersects eta once, that gives me the t to the first, and the disk in the back intersects eta no times, that gives me the t to the zero. Okay, the first thing one notice is if you just set t equal to one, you get the untwisted differential. That's a rather unsophisticated observation. Great. What about getting the zeta action? So, if we compare the twisted differential, that's the first line, with the zeta action, that's the second line, what have I done? I've taken this exponent of t and I've brought it down, and then I set t equals one. So, this is the derivative at t equals a one of the twisted differential. So, this is derivative of the differential shows up in this. The derivative of the differential shows up in this earlier work of Sharkar and work of Zemke. Great. I also want to get M3 and M4 and so on. I can't say take the second derivative because the second derivative of any polynomial, if you're working over F2, the second derivative vanishes, because when you take the second derivative of a polynomial, you have even coefficients. But there's something called the Haase derivative, which is the analog of 1 half d squared dt squared, and more generally, 1 over n factorial d to the n dt to the n. n factorial d to the n dt to the n, which makes sense in and over any field, in any characteristic. And what you would expect is true. So these higher actions by zeta are the Haase derivatives at t equals one of the twisted differential. Okay. So using that, it's not hard to show. Using that, it's not hard to show that if you take the unrolled homology of Cf hat using all of this A infinity structure, what you get exactly is the Novikov-completed twisted coefficient floor homology. So it's just a small step from here to get the relation that we wanted between the unrolled homology of CF hat or HF hat, it doesn't matter, and the twisted, the Novikov twisted for homology. Just for tidiness, I want to point out a second relation. Tidiness, I want to point out a second relation between these two things. So we don't actually need this for the argument, but it's sort of nice to know. So I can do F2 as a module over F2 adjoin T inverse T just by making T act by 1. Then you can look at the X algebra over this ring F2 adjoin T inverse T of F2 with itself. X is like comm, so these are like endomorphisms of submodule. You can compose endomorphisms as an algebra. And then untwisted HF hat is the tor of twisted CF hat or twisted HF hat. It doesn't really matter. Twisted CF hat with this module F2 over this thing. So this is a module over F2 adjoin X1x squared. In fact, it's an A infinity module F2 adjoin X1 X squared. And this captures all of those higher operations we were just talking about by Zeta. Operations we're just talking about by zeta. Then the proof is: well, you see that the algebra of taking a free resolution of F2 and then tensoring with it exactly turns into the Haase derivatives that we talked about on the previous slides. So that's a sort of nice bit of algebra. Okay, the last ingredient to prove the result is: I need to know that the auto-solar spectral sequence respects. That the auto-saw spectral sequence respects the A infinity module structure. So again, saying a spectral sequence respects the A infinity module structure, you don't want to say that each page has a module structure as compared to something because you take an associated graded when you do that, and that tends to change how the modules interact. So instead, we say, well, there's a filtered A infinity module C, so that is an unfiltered module, it's CF hat. Module at Cf hat. The differential strictly increases the filtration. At the level of modules, it's the same as, forget the differential in the infinite action, just the module is the same as Kvanov complex. And then the first order, the differential agrees with the Kvanov differential, and the zeroth order, the operation M2 agrees with the action of X. And that's enough to see that if the unrolled homology of the Kvanov complex is trivial, then the unrolled homology of Cf hat is also trivial. Cf hat is also trivial, which is the relationship that we needed. So, in that case, by this relationship between unrolled CF hat and the Novikov coefficient fluorhomology, we see that the branchial cover has a homologically essential two-sphere, so L is split. So just to summarize, one implied two and one implied three were immediate for a split diagram from Freeness, that's his theorem of Shimakovich and the Kunis theorem. For a general diagram, it falls on the base point independence. Two implies four, and three implies four. This was just some algebra. You look at some filtrations and futz around a little bit. Four implies one was a combination of using the spectral sequence that showed that the unreal homology of corona complex being trivial implied the unrolled homology of hat was trivial. That's used in its filtration on this previous slide. The fact that the unreal homology is the same. Homology is the same as the Novikov twisted flow homology that was via these Haas derivatives. We involved the Haase derivatives and then the fact that that detects spheres, which was this theorem mostly of E and Madden E and then Akron and E. And that's all. Thanks very much for your attention. All right. This meeting is being recorded. Questions for Questions for Robert. Faolo and I have a non-math question. What is our chance of seeing Willa in person virtually? I can see if she wants to come to the next session. So the chance is pretty good if you come to the discussion session. If you come to the discussion session, awesome more questions? Can you comment on why unrolled was needed? Yeah. I wanted, so another possible path would be to work on the Kovanov side and construct a Kovanov homology over F two adjoint T T inverse by doing some duality there. By doing some duality there. But the point as I'm presenting it is: I understand, Kavanaugh model is a module over F2 brackets X mod X squared. So I need to use that action and relate that to something in Hagard Fleur. And that's the exterior algebra action. And then, but what I know something about is sphere detection over using this Novikov coefficient for homology. Using this Novikov coefficient for homology, not a result using the exterior algebra. Now, in fact, there's a version using the exterior algebra action to detect spheres that I think we also put in that paper. Adam points out that if L0 is ribbon-concordant, L1 and L1 is split, then L0 is split in the same way. That sounds great. How do you? I would like. Sounds great. How do you? I would like to know how to prove that. If you know that the Kavanaugh homology of L0 injects into the Kavanohrmology of L1 as a direct sum and, which is what Ian gives, what Ian and I give you, or if you do the same thing just using Hagar's homology, and you say that a direct sum and of a free module is free over this ring, which is true, then you deduce that the thing that the submodule had to be free. And therefore, this living. That's great. That's beautiful. So if we. That's beautiful. So, if we have naturality or functoriality with respect to the module structure to do that? Oh, yeah, I guess so. Maybe that's a little well. That's true anyway. Is it right, right? And certainly on the Kavanaugh side, that shouldn't be a problem. So, you have a surface induces a well-defined map with respect to the module structure? So something is clear, and something else takes a bit more work. If you think about the module structure as merging on an unknot, then you can just follow that unknot through the whole thing. Now. There's a map, yeah. There's a map, and that's all that Adam needs for the argument he gave. Knowing, and then, I mean, like, I think that the strategy. I think that the stronger version of naturality actually follows because the forgetful functor from modules to vector space is faithful. If you have two maps of modules which are the same map of vector spaces, then they're actually the same map of modules. Anybody else have great theorems to prove? I have a question. So is the action of X that we talk about an instance of action of quantum homology with symplectic manifold and Logan floor homology? Did I understand that correctly? What an excellent question. Yes. Okay, sorry, bro. Hang on. Let me. Let me let me let me uh think and actually give you an a correct answer. Um for for Hagard fleur, it's the homology of the Lagrangian acting on the Lagrangian intersection of homology. So there's also a, I mean, there's There's also a, I mean, the quantum cap product. There's one that relates to the homology of the ambient space. There's also one that relates to the homology of the Lagrangian itself. You know, you're just counting. Again, you're keeping track of the boundary of the disk. But actually, I think you can get it the other way, also. Maybe not. Maybe not. No, I think you can get it from the action of it. So the H1 of the Lagrangian injects into H1 of SIMG0. So the way I phrase it was in terms of the action of homology Lagrangian. You can also get it in terms of the homology of SIMG sigma acting. So you're completely right. You can then ask: is the analogous thing true for Kavanaugh homology? I think it's right that if you take I think it's right that if you take this base, this Hilbert scheme, and you look at there's an element of H2 that will give this action, I think, but I don't think that's in the literature, and I could be wrong. Right. Is it also possible to see that x squared is zero in common in one of the quantum cohomology of the modular space? Yeah. For the symmetric product, it is because we're looking at sigma minus z, we're doing hf hat, and so there are no spheres at all. So the quantum cohomology is the same as the ordinary cohomology. And for HF minus, okay, there is a sphere, but it for some reason must not contribute here. I mean, probably the moduli space is in the wrong grading to contribute here or something. The wrong grading to contribute here, or something. But I haven't actually thought about it for HF-, so I could, I don't have an, I mean, I might be saying something slightly wrong. What is the rest of, I mean, do you get any other interesting action from the rest of quantum cohomology? That's a good question. You get, if you're doing HF minus, or you're looking at SIMG sigma, you get U, which is there's a class in H upper 2. And then the cohomology of the symmetric product is generated by. Symmetric product is generated by these classes in H opert1 and H opert2. So I believe. So I don't think you get any more anything else by looking at the quantum cohomology acting there. And changing coefficients wouldn't change the story. So for any coefficient ring, you would get this? That's right. It's free. So the homology, the symmetric product is homotopy equivalent to a To a, if you take the punctured service how it's equivalent to a skeleton of a torus with the usual CW structure, and in particular, the cellular chain complex is perfect, and there's the no torsion homology. Nice. Thank you, Robert. Does that change? That's a great question. Yeah, that's somehow disappointing. You'd like to do something clever. Here's something you could do. Here's something you could do for Zeidel Smith that Mohammed pointed out at some point. There's Mohammed has this loop space fluorhomology construction, Abu Zayed. I should, you know, big call should say who I'm talking about, as this loop space floor homology construction, giving an action of the homology, the loop space of the Lagrangian on fluorhomology. For Hagon, fluorhomology, Lagrangians are tori, so the loop. Are tori, so the loop space is not so interesting. You'll just see the same information we just talked about. But for Zeidel-Smith, the Lagrangians are S2s, and the loop space of S2 does have some interesting homology-cohomology. So it would be really nice to compute some examples and see if there's something interesting coming from that loop space construction. And God help you, try to find an analog of that in combinatorial Kavanaugh homology. I'm pretty sure. I'm pretty sure nobody, including Mohamed, has done that. Right, okay. Any more questions for Robert? All right, let's thank him again. Let's thank him again. Thank you, Fox. Really appreciate it. Fox.
