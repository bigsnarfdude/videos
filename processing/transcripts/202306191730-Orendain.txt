Yeah, thank you. Let me share my screen. All right. Okay, so okay. Well, thank you, Carlos, and thank you to the organizers for putting the workshop together. And of course, for the invitation. So, again, Invitation. So, again, the title of the talk is Compositional Quantum Field Theory and Homeomorphism Extension. So, just very briefly, compositional quantum field theory is a framework for reasoning about quantum field theory. It's part of a general program for studying physical theories for following certain principles of locality and compositionality and using the language of involve symmetric monodal categories. So, the whole program. So, the whole program is still under development, and I would say as a theory, it lies in between applied category theory and quantum field theory foundations. So it is pretty far afield from the main subject of the workshop, and the style of the talk will be very different. It'll be more of a talk on foundations and quantum theory. Quantum theory. And, but well, it turns out that the way we think about quantum field theories compositionally in this framework always gives us a criterion for or a non-criterion for the extension of actions of groups on hypersurfaces to regions bounding those hypersurfaces, which might be of, or hopefully is, of interest to some of you in the audience. Of interest to some of you in the audience. One of the things, just a small caveat before starting a talk: one of the things that makes the theory of quantum foundations very different from any mathematical theory that I know is that on purpose, people do framework first and examples later. So there's an obvious, there will be an obvious lack of examples in. Be an obvious lack of examples in the talk. This is sort of by design, but if we want to apply what I'm going to say to specific examples of equivariant to actions to hypersurfaces, for now it will be a bit difficult. So that will make, by nature, the talk a bit speculative. So, well, with that in mind, hopefully, I'll say some things that might be interesting to some of you. Okay, well. Okay, well, oh, yeah, right. So, again, compositional quantum field theory is a framework for studying quantum theories compositionally. So, compositionality here describes how information about complex systems can be pieced together from information about their simpler components, just very generally. And computational quantum field theory is just an axiomatic system. Is just an axiomatic system describing quantum field theory following those principles. In a compositional model for quantum field theory, we should be able to study states, amplitudes, observables, measurements, etc. on a quantum theory on small regions of space-time in such a way that when two of these regions are glued into a more complex region, then the physical information of the larger region can be deduced from the physical information in the smaller ones. Information in the smaller ones. So, this is a pretty general comment, but that's just basically the idea that we follow. So, pictorially, suppose you have two blobby regions, x1 and x2. If we know the physics of these two regions, whatever that might be, then we want a framework in which we are able to deduce from the physics of the blobby regions X1 and X2, the physics of the composed blobby region. The composed blobby region X1 glued to X2. Now, what do we mean by the physics in a region here? So, in this talk, mostly I will mean state spaces and amplitude maps, just to touch with topological quantum field theory. So in topological quantum field theory, compositional quantum field theory, etc., state spaces are associated to boundaries of regions and more generally to hypersurfaces, or while I'm not sure that's more general. Or, well, I'm not sure that's more general, but we want to think of state spaces as being associated to hypersurfaces without thinking of them as the boundary of a region. State spaces should compose in a way compatible with the way we glue bounding regions. So what I mean by that is that suppose we have a drawing like this. We have two bended intervals or whatever, two hypersurfaces, small hypersurfaces. So if we know the state spaces of these two hyperfaces, Know the state spaces of these two hypersurfaces. We should be able to reconstruct from that information the state space of the larger glued hypersurface here obtained by gluing along corresponding boundary components. So this is basically this drawing that we had before. So in here, we have the blobby region X1, the blobby region X2. We have some physics in there, and in the boundary, we have state spaces. And then we want to glue. Then we want to glue X1 and X2 into another blobby region. And we want to compute amplitudes and state spaces on the composite blobby region in terms of amplitudes of states in X1 and X2. And so we should be able to compose states in X1 or pieces of the boundary of X1 and pieces of the boundary of X2 along bluings as we just described. So, yeah, that's the idea. So, yeah, that's the idea. So, well, I mean, models for or inspired by quantum field theory satisfying some of these ideas are basically everywhere. Algebraic quantum field theory, for example, describes observables compositionally, but usually assumes a fixed space of states or no explicit compositional description of state spaces is provided. So think here of rational. Of rational conformal field theories. For example, I know a lot of people in the audience like to think about these things. So these are when you do conformal field theory in this way, you just fix a Hilbert space, a state space, and then you throw at it different Bonamian algebras parametrized by intervals in the circle. And this Bonamian algebra sort of behaved well with respect to the gluing of intervals. But yeah, so we want. But yeah, so we want to describe not just observables or amplitudes, but also state spaces compositionally. Now, TQFT provides say compositional models for state spaces and amplitudes. Well, I mean, extended TQFT provides a compositional model for state spaces. And amplitudes are compositional in TQFT, whether the TQFT has corners. The TQFT has corners or not. Yeah, well, TQFT we all like and love, but if you're doing, if you're interested in quantum foundations, then there's a couple of things that people don't quite like. One of them is the in and out structure of borders. Here, compositionality or locality is coherently directed. And so in space-time regions, there is sort of like this time evolution direction that people. Evolution direction that people don't quite like. And so, most importantly, one thing that we like if we do TQFTs or we do invariance for closed manifolds is that the category of boardisms is rigid. And so state spaces are finite dimensional. I mean, that's always good. But if you're doing quantum theory as a foundationalist, you really don't want that. Computational quantum. Compositional quantum field theory is a sort of mathematical formulation or categorical formulation of a different framework called the general boundary formulation or the GBF that is sort of inspired by some of the ideas of TQFT, but sort of circumvents some of the things that people don't like, that people in foundations don't like. TQFT as functorial quantum field theory or TQFT describes a correspondence between space-time pieces. The correspondence between space-time pieces and algebraic structures, describing interactions between the physics and local space-time compositionally, of course. So, what do we mean by space-time pieces? Just being a little bit more formal now. As we do in TQFT, we just fix a dimension n, which we interpret as the dimension of space-time. And so spacetime region now is a compact orientable manifold of dimension n, so topological manifold or a smooth manifold. Topological manifold or a smooth manifold or whatever of dimension n, we don't assume a Borders and structure on the manifold. So we want to think of state spacetime as being formed by patching together spacetime regions. The second piece of space-time information that we're interested in is hypersurfaces. So, hypersurface is a compact-oriented manifold of codimension one in this formalism. So, yeah. So, yeah, this is sort of the geometric background, the most basic geometric thing we consider. So, compact-oriented manifolds of a given dimension and compact-oriented manifolds of co-dimension one. Now, we have that, but we're, as I mentioned before, we're also interested in describing things compositionally through gluing. So we use this different formula. We use this different formalism of gluing functions to describe gluings of spacetime pieces or of regions and hypersurfaces. So yeah, suppose sigma and sigma prime are compact oriented manifolds. A gluing function from sigma to sigma prime is a continuous orientation preserving identification f from sigma to sigma prime, such that f restricted to the interior of sigma is an embedding. So a continuous function observes. So, a continuous function observe, or we know that a continuous function f between compact-oriented manifolds is an identification if and only if it is continuous, rejective, and closed. So a gluing function is a continuous orientation preserving closed or rejective function that only identifies points in the boundary of its domain. So, the idea of considering gluing functions is the following. So, we usually describe gluings as co-limits defined as universal objects. Defined as universal objects up to isomorphisms. Now we want to consider gluings on the nose. So this is something people actually do in TQFT in some big references in TQFT. For example, in those Tolson-Teitners Ducey paper, when they describe their remanion in conformal TQFTs, they do gluings on the nose, and then there's some ambiguity, and they manage that through double. Manage that through double categories and double functors. In applied category theory and the theory of open systems or open petrinets or things like that, people do the same. They want to deal with gluings or compositions on the nose, not up to isomorphisms. And when you do that, then you have to deal with the ambiguities or the extra isomorphisms somehow. And you usually pack this categorically in some sense. So, yeah, we want to do that. We want to do that. So, considering co-limit projections and not isomorphism classes of co-limits, when we consider gluings, what we do when we do that is that we consider gluings on the nose, we don't hide extra symmetries, and it turns out that this has nice categorical properties, which is what I'm interested in in particular. So, gluing functions, you want to think of them as projections and regular gluings where gluing is performed on the boundary and. Is performed on the boundary and on the nose. We will describe gluings of hypersurfaces and regions through this notion of gluing function. Yeah, so what we're thinking about is the following. So suppose here you have two open intervals, this wavy intervals O1 and O2. If you glue them along the sort of terminal and initial point of O1 and O2, you get a longer wavy interval, and then you get a projection, and that projection is what we're interested in. Projection is what we were interested in. That's the cooling function here as well. So, suppose you have another wavy interval O, and you glue P along P and Q, then you get an abstract circle or a wavy closed string or whatever, and then you get a projection, and we're interested in the projection, that's our ProN function. Another example is this. This is something that we use. So, we can get sort of this boundary of the dented disk by gluing three. By gluing three bended intervals. And so when we do that, we get a projection, and that's our gluing function. Yeah, so that's what we use to describe gluings of hypersurfaces. Now, it turns out that the axioms for GBF or CQFT require a little bit more detail when gluing regions. And so we use this notion of gluing function to model something a little bit more complicated. Something a little bit more complicated for gluings of regions. So, this is a relative gluing diagram. So, suppose you have x and x prime regions, and so we want to describe a specific gluing of the region x into the region x prime. So we basically want to describe something like this. So, we have x1 and x2. That would be our x, and we want to glue that into the composite blob x1, x2. And the way we want to do that is by gluing along. Do that is by gluing along a piece of the boundary of x1 and x2, or a piece of the boundary of two pieces in the boundary of x with opposite orientation. And we want to keep track of that, and we want to keep track of the remaining part of the boundary, the composition of the domain manifold or region. So, suppose we have x and x prime regions. Suppose sigma and lambda are hypersurfaces, and you have a gluing function alpha from sigma. This join you. From sigma, this John union sigma with its opposite orientation, this John Union lambda, into the boundary of x, because that's a Gluen function. That's a boundary decomposition of the boundary of x. Sorry, a boundary decomposition of x, displaying two hypersurfaces that are homeomorphic or isomorphic or whatever, with opposite orientation and an extra hypersurface. So we're thinking something like this. So here the two straight intervals would be the two copies of sigma and the bended interval. Of sigma and the banded interval would be lambda. So suppose you have a boundary decomposition like that, then a gluing diagram on x relative to alpha is a pair of f comma beta, where f is a gluing function from x to x prime, and beta is a gluing function from lambda to the boundary of x prime, such that the gluing function f, so the gluing from x to x prime, is a co-equalizer of this diagram here, which Which really just means that x is glued into x prime by gluing along the two copies of sigma with opposite orientation. And we also require that this gluing function beta makes this diagram here a commute. So what this means is that when we glue along f, and we have this sort of leftover piece in the boundary decomposition of x, lambda, then if we take that through. Then, if we take that through the gluing function f, then we get a boundary decomposition of the glued region x prime. So, yeah, basically here I'm saying the same thing that I just said. So the condition of the gluing function f from x to x prime being a co-equalizer just says that the function f glues x to x prime along the two copies of sigma with the opposite orientation appearing in alpha and the condition of beta making the second dialogue. And the condition of beta making the second diagram commute, so this diagram here says that the restriction of f to lambda provides a gluing decomposition of the boundary of x prime. So we basically, yeah, we summarize the data of a relative gluing diagram, f, beta, by a commutative diagram of this form. So here, if this is a diagram, a relative gluing diagram, I'm sorry, then this is our gluing function here. So we're gluing the region x. So we're gluing the region x into the region x prime through gluing function f, but we want to describe this in a specific way in the boundary. And so we do that through a large detailed cospan with legs and x and x prime and apex this hypersurface lambda. So the bottom part here just says that f is gluing x into x prime by identifying. x into x prime by identifying these two copies of sigma and the top part just says that the boundary of x prime after applying f defines a boundary decomposition. Sorry, x prime gets a boundary decomposition through lambda after applying f. So yeah, a couple of drawings will make things a bit more clear, I think. So again, the drawing that we wanted. The drawing that we wanted at first was this. So we wanted to describe the gluing of two blobby things, x1 and x2, into a second blobby thing, x prime, along two open intervals. So the union of x1 and x2 would be our region x. The gluing function, we have it described here, the codomain, the glued thing would be x prime. And then we would want a And then we would want a boundary decomposition first of X as three things glued together, displaying two copies of the same hypersurface with opposite orientation. That would be the red sigma and the red sigma with opposite orientation. And the lambda would be the disjoint union of the blue intervals. So we have that here. So this is the first piece of information on our relative Boolean diagram. The second would be The second would be a decomposition of the boundary of x prime in terms of this lefto lambda. So this would be this gluing function here. Yeah, and the whole diagram looks like this. So we have our x here at the bottom and x prime, we have our gluing along sigma and sigma with its opposite orientation. We have the inclusion of the back. We have the inclusion of the boundary of x and x. Then we have this gluing function that we started with describing the decomposition of the boundary of x in terms of sigma, sigma with its substitor orientation, and lambda. And so again, all of this just says that x prime is glued from x by identifying sigma and sigma with its substitute orientation. And this top part here just says that the boundary of x prime just decomposes says. Just decomposes lambda after applying beta, which is the same thing as applying f. Yeah, so yeah, when we do Bordisons, this looks quite trivial. So let's see this example here. So suppose we have our X and our X prime. So X would be the union of the pair of pens, a cup and a cylinder. And then we glue the cup. And then we glue the cup and the cylinder to the two pairs, to the two bottoms of the pans to get a cylinder. And then we would have, we would need a gluing function, which is the gluing projection. We would need a sigma and a lambda and A decomposition. So we have our sigmas there, which are the red circles. Sigma is the circles on the left, then sigma with its opposite orientation circles on the right. And lambda would be the two circles at the leftmost side and the rightmost side. Most side and the rightmost side. And then the gluing functions appearing in the gluing diagram are just trivial things. So yeah, the boundary decomposition here is trivial in x. So we just describe the boundary of x as the disjoint union of lambda, sigma, and sigma with its opposite orientation, which is this part here. This would be the identity, and we have the inclusion of this here, and then we'd have f. Of this here, and then we'd have f. And then, again, so after applying the gluing to the boundary parts of x, we just get just a standard inclusion. So this thing of relative gluing diagrams is sort of a way of talking about gluings of regions with sort of corners without really using the language of borderisons with corners. Yeah. Yeah, anyway, yeah, we won't really use our relative blooming diagrams that much on the talk. So that was a bit of fluff. So you can, if you didn't like that part, you can just forget about it. Well, not quite, not yet. There is another. So we have hypersurfaces, regions, we have gluing functions, is gluing between hypersurfaces and relative gluing diagrams, which allow us to talk about gluings of regions. And then we have a third piece. And then we have a third piece of geometric data in compositional quantum field theory. So, this is slice regions, which in this topological setting is quite trivial. So, I just want to say here that what we're trying to do is to find a sort of synthetic way of talking about gluings and certain regions that we're interested in. So, this sort of describes, I'm just describing sort of the geometric setup for compositional quantum field theory in this very specific case of topological. This very specific case of topological manifolds, but we want to talk about CQFDs just in general. And so we just want to find out what are the formal properties of a gluing theory that allows us to talk about compositional quantum field theory. And so one of the important pieces are slice regions. So suppose sigma is a hypersurface, then a slice region and sigma is a pair S, S, larger S, smaller S, where S, larger S is a region, and smaller S is a gluing function. Is a gluing function from sigma with its opposite orientation, this joint union sigma into the boundary of s. And we assume that that satisfies the polling gluing triviality condition. So a gluing slice region is just a region where the boundary is decomposed in terms of two copies of R sigma, one with opposite or with two opposite orientations. And we assume that this satisfies the Guin triviality condition, which essentially says that this behaves. Says that this behaves, gluing regions, sorry, sliced regions behave sort of like cylinders formally. So the gluing triviality condition just says that for every region x, hypersurface gamma and gluing function beta from sigma disjoint union gamma into the boundary of x. So for every decomposition of the boundary of x for any region x as sigma glued to something else, then there exists a gluing diagram like this. So we get, oh, sorry, we get a gluing function. Get oh, sorry, we get a gluing function from S disjoint union X. So if we start with X, we glue to it the slice region on sigma along sigma, and then we get the same X that we started with. And so this part here just says that, so S has two components, sigma with its opposite orientation and sigma. So these are the two things here, and X where Two things here, and x, we're assuming it has a copy of sigma and something else. And so, if we glue along these two copies here of sigma, then we get x again. And yeah, this top part here just says that the boundary of x that we started with just stays the same. So, this looks better with drawings, although this is a bit trivial. So, for example, if sigma is the circle with its size. The circle with its opposite orientation. I'm sorry, so here the orientations are switched. Then the slice region on sigma would be the cylinder on sigma. And the gluing triviality condition is just this. So if we start with our X here, so we start with a region X. We have S with its boundary decomposed as the disjoint union of two copies of sigma with opposite orientation. If X has Orientation. If X has a boundary decomposition as a copy of sigma and something else, then we can glue S to X in order to get X with the original boundary decomposition being unaltered. So more interestingly, if we have an interval like this, then the slice region on the interval would be the disk with its globular boundary decomposition with two copies of sigma, one with its opposite orientation in the bottom. Its upstate orientation in the bottom, and oh, sorry, and a usual copy of sigma at the top. And the gluing triviality condition would be like this. So if X is anything that has a copy of Sigma in its boundary, here, a cylinder with a piece of sigma on its boundary, then we should be able to sort of glue S along that sigma copy and then push it in and get the same thing that we started with. So those are slice regions. So, those are slice regions. So, again, you can kind of forget about this if you didn't find it too interesting or appealing. So, we're only going to be interested in this homeomorphism extension part of CQFT in hypersurfaces and just the bit of regions, not really this compositional part, which is very important for the general program, but not for this talk. Anyway, oh, right. Right. Um, yeah. So, oh, I don't know what I did. All right. So, okay, what is a CQFD? So, a CQFD of compositional quantum field theory is the following. So, first, so it's the following data. So, first, state spaces. So, a CQFD associates to every hypersurface sigma a complex super vector space H sigma, the state space of sigma, and we assume that the state. Sigma, and we assume that the state space of the empty set is the complex numbers. Number two, we get a graded involution. So we, for every hypersurface sigma, we get an antilinear graded isomorphism Yoda sigma from the state space of sigma to the state space of sigma with its opposite orientation satisfying this equation here. So this is just a sort of a weak, strong in the categorical sense. Strong in the categorical sense, but non-strict, not on the nose way of implementing, reflecting the operation of changing orientation into state spaces. Then we also get a graded tensor isomorphism. So for every sigma one and sigma two hypersurfaces, we get a graded isomorphism from sigma H sigma 1 tensor H sigma 2 to H sigma 1 disjoint union H sigma 2. So we get sort of a weak or strong Of a weak or strong way of expressing locality in hypersurfaces. And we also get a graded gluing epimorphism, so a graded epimorphism gamma F for every state space H sigma to H sigma prime for every hypersurface gluing function F from sigma to sigma prime. So if we have sigma and sigma prime hypersurfaces and f a gluing function from sigma to sigma prime, then we get an epimorphism gamma f from the state space. Gamma f from the state space of the unglued hypersurface sigma to the glued hypersurface sigma prime. So, yeah, these are the co-dimension one axioms for CQFT or the hypersurface version of the axioms for CQFT. So we get state spaces as we do with TQFT, but now we don't assume that our hypersurfaces are closed. That our hypersurfaces are closed-oriented. So it would be something like an extended TQFT. We get a graded involution, which is different than TQFT, which this is implemented by duality, by rigidity. And we get a graded tensor isomorphism. So this is monoidality or symmetric monoidality, but a strong version of this or laxer version of this. And we get a graded gluing epimorphism, which is just Which is just compositionality with respect to gluings. And this is just the idea that if we have two hypersurfaces and we glue them together, then we can always glue states on each of the hypersurfaces into a state in the glued hypersurface. And finally, we get a region part, which is the graded amplitude maps. So we get for every X region, a graded linear map, rho x, from the state space of the boundary of x to the complex numbers. And we just assume that the And we just assume that the amplitude of the empty set, the empty manifold, is the identity NC. So, yeah, this is the data of the CQFT. So we have codimension one data, state spaces, involution, tensor isomorphism, blueing epimorphisms, and for every region, we get an amplitude map, which is the analogous of the linear map that we get that we associate to abortism in TQFD. So the codimension one part of this satisfies the obvious coherence condition. So for example, the tensor isomorphism and the gluing epimorphisms are associative. So that means what it should mean. So tau being associative just means that if we have sigma one, sigma two, and sigma three hypersurfaces, then we can we have two tensor isomorphisms from their tensor, this tensor product. From this tensor product of the state spaces to the state space of the discharge union, and the two isomorphisms are the same. And for gluing functions, this just says that if we have a commutative square here, let's say sigma one, sigma two, sigma one, two, sigma one. What was this? Oh, this was sigma. I'm sorry. Uh-huh. Sigma one and sigma one two. And this is commutative. And this is commutative, then after applying gamma, you get a commutative square. So, yeah, this is the sort of axioms that we get in CQFT. We also get compatibility axioms. So, for example, the tensor isomorphism and the Bluing epimorphism are compatible, which just essentially looks like a commutative square like this for every sigma 1, sigma 2, sigma 1 prime, and sigma 2 prime hypersurfaces where sigma 1 is glued into. surfaces where sigma 1 is glued into sigma 1 prime and sigma 2 is glued into sigma 2 prime. And then we get tensor transformations and just everything commutes. And yeah, also, for example, the conjugation transformation, the Boolean transformation are compatible in this sense that this square always commutes. Yeah, so as I said, the region stuff is a little bit more complicated, but we don't want to focus too much on this. So the hypersurface stuff is works really nicely. So we can put this in terms of involved symmetric monodo functors, which is really nice in my opinion. So it didn't start like this. So this is sort of a mathematical reformulation of the GBF axioms, which had nothing to do with category theory and nor involve symmetric monodo functors. Or, well, they were sort of inspired in part by TQFD, so they should have something to do with involve symmetric. Should have something to do with relative symmetric monoidal functors or symmetric monodal functors, but yeah, so this is how that works. So, if we write M hip for the category whose objects are hypersurfaces and whose morphisms are gluing functions, then this joint union and the empty manifold makes M hip into a symmetric nodal category. Now, orientation change makes M hip into a strict involitive symmetric nodal category. So, an involitive category is So an involitive category is a category with an involution which is an endo functor such that the square of that endo functor is naturally isomorphic to the identity and that natural isomorphism satisfies coherence conditions. And an involitive symmetric monodal functor is that such that the involution and the involution isomorphism are monoidal. Also, super vector spaces, SVAC is a category of super vector spaces and graded linear transformations. Linear transformations, the usual graded tensor product and the even complex numbers make SVEC into a symmetric monodal category, and cojugation of supervector spaces, complex supervector spaces, makes that into an evolutive symmetric monodal category. Now, we can prove that the codimension one axioms for CGFT are essentially the same thing. Not essentially, they are the same thing as a strong semi-strict and relative symmetric monodial functor from MHIP to supervector spaces. So there is a lot of. Spaces. So there is a lot of, there is like too much, too many axioms, and too many words before. You can just write this down as an involved, semi-strict, involved, symmetric monoidal functor, strong monodal functor from this category of hypersurfaces to supervector spaces. So CQFT is strong, semi-strict, and relative symmetric monoidal functor with some extra fluff or extra stuff involved in regions. What is this extra stuff? So yeah, let's not get too much. So, yeah, let's not get too much into this, but basically, the amplitudes are compatible with tensor products and conjugations. And sort of the difficult part is this version of the Chapman-Kolmogorov formula that describes how amplitudes behave with respect to composition. So, I'll just spend a little time on this. So, suppose you have a relative gluing diagram like this. Yeah, so you have X region, X prime another region, a gluing. x prime another region, gluing f from x to x prime, and then you have all of those things that just tell you that x is glued to x prime just by gluing the two copies of sigma and sigma bar, sorry, of sigma with opposite orientation. So suppose you have that, then there exists a non-zero complex number, the anomaly of the relative plane diagram, such that the amplitude on the glued region can be computed. Can be computed as follows. So we have in this relative Bluing diagram a decomposition of the boundary of x prime in terms of lambda. And so every state in the boundary of x prime can be written as gamma beta of a state in lambda. So we have this formula here. And then this is basically the gluing anomaly plus this sort of Chapman-Colmogor E formula. So we have the state on lambda. We have the state on lambda, and then we choose an orthonormal basis for the state space of sigma, and then we just take the sums here. And yeah, so this is just some grading thing that doesn't matter. So yeah, that's the way amplitudes behave with respect to composition of regions, which is, yeah, basically, this reduces to the composition formula for TQFTs in the finite dimensional and borders in case. Now, extra stuff. There's other extra stuff that is actually very important. Yeah, people that do quantum foundations want Filbert spaces or Krine spaces or whatever. They want an inner product. And our co-dimension one axioms didn't mention any inner product at all. So it turns out that under this way of thinking about quantum field theories, we can get Theories we can get the inner product on state spaces from evaluating amplitudes on slice regions. So, suppose sigma is a hypersurface, s comma is a slice region on sigma, and then consider this morphism here. So, we start with, we had from the slice region part, we get a gluing function, a gluing decomposition of the boundary of the slice region as two copies of sigma with opposite orientation glue together. And so we get a gluing transfer. Glue together, and so we get a gluing transformation from here to here. We get an amplitude here, and we get a tensor transformation. So, we get this function here, that pairing, and that turns out to be non-degenerate and hermitian. So, that defines on H sigma the structure of a superprine space. So, the super part here is just that we're considering what are known as Fermi theories, but we can also consider boson theories and talk about Hilbert spaces. Or, yeah, so the Hilbert Yeah. So the Hilbert or Trine space structure on state spaces, the way we think about them, is just some region stuff that we deduce from the axioms. Yeah, so the state space part. So the state space part of a CQFT or the codimension one part of the CQFT is again a relative symmetric Monado functor from hypersurfaces and gluing functions to supervector spaces. But if this hyper state space Hyper state space part is part of a larger complete full CQFT, then this state space functor actually lifts to an involitive symmetric monoidal functor from hypersurfaces and gluing functions to supercrant spaces. In the bosonic case, we would have an involitive symmetric monoidal functor from hypersurfaces and gluing functions to vector spaces that would lift to a functor to Hilbert spaces. A functor to Hilbert spaces. So, yeah, if we can make ad hoc modifications on the codomain category of codimension one parts of CQFT. So, I mean, this language of involve symmetric monodal functors just allows us to say, yeah, we'll say that a codimension one part of the CQFT is just an involitive symmetric monodal functor from the category of Bluetooth functions to whatever category of state spaces we want. Either vector We want either vector spaces, super vector spaces, crine spaces, super crine spaces, or whatever else you might think of, which is pretty nice to have if you're thinking about writing down a set of axioms that works for every quantum field theory version of quantum field theory. So we should be able to do the same thing for the domain part of the state space part of the CQFT. So the space-time pieces used to describe CQFT so far are obviously very simple. Car are obviously very simple. So just consider topological manifolds or smooth manifolds or whatever. So we should be able to consider more regions and hypersurfaces with more structure. So for example, in area-dependent TQFT, one considers regions with area, or we just might just want to do conformal structures, metrics, or whatever. And so the idea of this whole thing is that this framework of involved. Of involitive monodal symmetric monodal categories should allow us to describe all those cases in sort of the single framework of involitive symmetric monodal functors. So also what people do in quantum foundations is that they define CQFDs, well, sorry, quantum field theories partially in sort of regions of interest. And they don't want to care about certain gluings or certain regions or whatever. And so we just might consider instead of might consider instead of the full category involitive symmetric minoidal category of hypersurfaces we might just consider subcategories of that or involitive symmetric minutal concrete categories over subcategories of that and that might just work but the idea is that this language of involve symmetric monodal functors essentially tells us that we're doing what we're doing and that's the idea of this so anyway this is work in progress and i don't know now okay now the main thing that i wanted to talk about um Main thing that I wanted to talk about. So, what does this have to do with homeomorphism extensions? Yeah, so this is just a couple of observations on the axioms. Again, remember that we have the axioms divided into two parts. State spaces that was essentially an involitive symmetric monodo functor, and some extra region stuff. That was for every region, we had an amplitude, and that amplitude satisfied. Amplitude and that amplitude satisfied a bunch of things that doesn't matter, that don't matter for now. So now, if sigma and sigma prime are hypersurfaces and f is a homeomorphism from sigma to sigma prime, then f is a gluing function. And that's just the definition of a gluing function. So a gluing function is an identification, continuous or smooth identification, such that it doesn't identify anything outside the boundary of sigma. And obviously, homeomorphisms do. And obviously, homeomorphisms do this. So, homeomorphisms are precisely the gluing functions that do not identify boundary pieces nontrivially. Now, another observation is the following. So, if sigma is a hypersurface and f is a homeomorphism in sigma, then so f is a gluing function, then we can apply to it the gluing transformation gamma of f, then gamma of f is also an automorphism of the state space of sigma. Of the state space of sigma. And that is in any category of state spaces that we might consider. Moreover, so or written differently, or just using another part of the axioms of codimension one data of CQFT, the gluing transformation actually defines a representation or an action of the group of homeomorphisms of sigma on H sigma by automorphisms in any of the categories we might consider. Categories we might consider. So, yeah, if we have a CQFD or the co-dimension one data of a CQFT for every hypersurface sigma, we get an action of the group of homeomorphisms of sigma in H sigma, whatever that might be by automorphisms. And finally, we have the following proposition. If x and x prime are regions and f is a homeomorphism from x to x prime, then obviously f restricts to a homeomorphism in the boundaries. To a homeomorphism in the boundaries of x and x prime. And so we have a gamma of f restricted to the boundary of x. And that would be an isomorphism in whatever category we choose from the state space of the boundary of x into the state space of the boundary of x prime. Then the proposition just says that this triangle here commutes. So this commutes with amplitudes, or amplitudes are invariant under the action of homeomorphisms. The action of homeomorphisms. So, the way you prove this is you basically write down the definition of or write homeomorphisms down as relative Bluing diagrams and then apply the quantum Chapman-Kolmogorov formula. And then you just deduce this thing here. It's yeah, part of the axioms. So we get the following theorem. If sigma is a hypersurface, X is a region such that the boundary of X is equal to sigma, G is any group, and alpha is an actual. G is any group and alpha is an action of g on sigma by homeomorphisms. Then, if there exists an extension of alpha beta, an action of g on x by homeomorphisms, such that, yeah, beta restricted to sigma is alpha, then this equation holds. So for every, oh, this is, yeah, not the, yeah. So, yeah, okay, it should say here G. Say here g um sorry, should say g for g and g. Um, yeah, then for every state c in sigma, then the amplitude of c in x is the same thing as the amplitude in x prime. Sorry for the mistakes here, x prime after applying gamma beta of g of c for every g in g. So if we start with And g. So, if you start with a state in sigma, then hit it with this action of g, then the amplitude will be the same thing. So we can just rewrite that like this, very succinctly. Yeah. And so this seems pretty innocuous and I don't know if interesting, but basically what we're doing here, what I'm saying here is that, oh, before that, we need to say what. That we need to say what the proof of this is. We just use this previous proposition here in the case where x is equal to x prime and where the f here homeomorphism is of the form the action beta on an element g of the acting group. Yeah, so the way I want you to think about this is suppose you have a good CQFT that you know well and that you can do computations on. Do computations on. Suppose you have a hypersurface sigma and you have a region bounding it, and you have an action of a group G on sigma, and you're asking the question of if that action extends to X. And so what you would do is you compute the state space of sigma, number one, number two, you compute the amplitude of X, and then you compute the gluing transformations or the image under the Gluing transformation. Or the image under the gluing transformations under gluing transformation of the action of G. And then if there exists an element of G such that that does not fix the amplitude, then the action of the group does not extend to the bounding region. Yeah, well, so I suppose the question is when and where you can use this criterion. So this is work in progress. This is definitely not, compositional quantum field theory is definitely not designed. Of quantum field theory is definitely not designed with this in mind, but it turns out that this is sort of embedded in the way we think about quantum field theories. So yeah, the thing here is that we don't have as many examples or very few examples as I mentioned in the beginning. So our only sort of fully developed or developed to a satisfactory degree is 2D quantum Yammill's theory, where regions are Where regions are a little bit more interesting, they're regions with an area function. So, in that case, there is a continuous family of amplitudes on every region. So, if you start with sigma hypersurface and x, a region, then you would have an area function from the set of connected components of x into the real numbers, assigning an area to every piece. And then you would have an amplitude for each one of those, and then if you have an actual For each one of those, and then if you have an action on sigma, then a non-criterion for extending for the extension of the action to x would involve infinitely many tests. So one for each area function. That's good. But yeah, I said this is sort of developed, but we don't yet know how to extend to general gluten functions, which is kind of not a good thing. But yeah, as I said, to a mathematical Yeah, as I said, that to a mathematical audience, this is very jarring and to me as well. But as I said, when you're doing quantum foundations, you kind of do framework first on purpose and then examples later. But yeah, this doesn't mean that this won't happen. So this is just we're doing this, we're working on this problem and saying exactly what quantum Yam-Miels in dimension two is on blowing functions and so on homeomorphisms. Yeah, interestingly, classical field theory admits a CQFT type formulation. And so it also contains, if you think about it in this way, and a non-extension, non-homeomorphism extension criterion. So yeah, the way you think about a classical field theory as a CQFT is as follows. So you would first have to have an involve symmetric monoidal functor from hypersurfaces and gluing functions. Functor from hypersurfaces and gluing functions into something. There'll be sort of the states of a classical field theory. And then to every region, you would have to associate something. Yeah, so the way you do that is you start with sim star, the groupoid whose objects are symplectic manifolds and whose morphisms, isomorphisms are symplectic isomorphisms. Sim star is the Cartesian symmetric medical category. So the tensor product is the Cartesian product and the tensor unit is the Tensor unit is the final object. And the operation of flipping the sign of the symplectic form makes sim star into an involitive symmetric monoidal groupoid. And so a classical field theory is an involitive symmetric monoidal functor L from hypersurfaces or angling functions or something related to this involitive symmetric monoidal group of symplectic manifolds together with that plus some regions of. That plus some regions of. So if sigma is a hypersurface, then this thing that we associated to sigma, L sigma, is the, we interpret this as being the space of boundary conditions of the theory on sigma. And the region stuff is the following. So if x is a region, then we associate an L x, that's something having to do with L boundary of x. That's a Lagrangian submanifold of the symplectic manifold L boundary of x, and that's the space of computation. L boundary of x, and that's the space of configurations of x. So, this is quite familiar, but not in this way where there's fluence of regions and stuff. But this has been done, though it's not as popular. But yeah, you can write things down in this way. So if you do that, then if you say that a classical field theory, a compositional classical field theory, or whatever is this, then we get a similar Ethereum. Sigma is a hypersurface, X is a region such that the boundary of X is sigma. G is a group. Of x is sigma, g is a group, alpha is an action from g on sigma by homeomorphisms. Then there exists beta, sorry, there exists an extension beta, an action of g on x by homeomorphisms, extending alpha. So there's a typo here, I'm sorry. So beta extends alpha, then gamma or whatever, the image under gluing isomorphisms. Uh, gluing isomorphisms on isomorphisms of the form alpha of g with g and g leave the Lagrangian sub-manifold of space configurations fixed. So again, if you believe this, which is, yeah, I understand a big leap, that this is a classical field theory, and again, I'm not giving you any examples or anything. Then, if you knew one of these things, you had a hyper search. One of these things, you had a hypersurface, a region sigma and x, action of g on sigma, and you were you suspect that this action does not extend to x, then you just compute the space of boundary conditions of sigma, the Lagrangian sub-manifold of configurations of x. If you find a g that moves LX inside L sigma, then the action does not extend. And that's, yeah, basically the idea. Examples, yeah, we don't have. Examples, yeah, we don't have that many examples, but yeah, so and this is also, we can do this in other versions of physical theories. There is this thing called the positive formalism, which is a kind of generalized probability theory, which is sort of more closely related to the way you do physics in sort of a practical way. And this is sort of like the cornerstone of the general boundary formulation. And you can say what a positive theory in the positive form. What is a positive theory and the positive formalism in this way, exactly in the same way as we did before? So we just need a symmetric monodo co-domain symmetric involve symmetric monoidal category. This will be the category whose subjects are partially ordered real vector spaces and whose morphisms are cone-preserving linear transformations. This category has, there is a subtlety here that this category has many different symmetric monado structures. We just choose one and One and uh, yeah, with that, and the identity, so you make that into a trivial involitive symmetric monodal category. So, involution is trivial, and that is an involitive symmetric monodal category. So, theory in the positive formalism or generalized probability theory is an involitive symmetric monodal functor P from hypersurfaces and gluing functions into this category of partially ordered vector spaces, together with, again, some region stuff. So, if sigma is a hyper surface, So, if sigma is a hypersurface, then what we associate to sigma is what is known, we interpret, as the space of generalized boundary conditions. And to a region X, what we associate is a partially ordered real vector space, the partially ordered real vector space of probes on X, which is sort of intuitively describes the way we probabilistically interact with the region X, or with the physics of the region X. So, now if we have X a region and the boundary of X is equal to sigma. Of x is equal to sigma. The way px and p sigma are related is that we have a pairing, non-degenerate positive pairing from px tensor p sigma into the real numbers. If b is a generalized boundary condition and b is a probe in x and sigma respectively, then this pairing measures the compatibility of this sort of probe or experiment or interaction that we do with the region and the boundary condition that we chose. That we chose. And so we get a similar theorem. So if sigma is a hypersurface, X is a region, G is a group, alpha is an action of G on sigma by homeomorphisms, then that extends if and only if we get an equation like this for every generalized boundary condition small b and every probe x. So, and we can play the game that we just mentioned again on the positive formalism. And yeah, that's. And yeah, that's all I wanted to say. So, these are some of the references on this. So, we're currently writing a second paper on this where this involved symmetric monodal functor is contained. And if some of this sounded interesting, somewhat this long paper has a lot of the information, main information on this. And yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much, Juan. Yeah, it's very interesting, all this composition at TQFT. Questions from the audience? So I had a question about, so when you were talking about kind of like the more geometric versions of different, I guess like categories that you'd want to consider in terms of the like field. Consider in terms of the field theories that they'd model. So, like you mentioned, that you could maybe generalize to like conformal structure and stuff like that. So, I thought that that is like where, in terms of the like kind of TQFT functorial field theory approach, like that's where it becomes really difficult to include that like extra geometric structure. And there's like all these things that like you have to have color neighborhoods that you glue along. So, it's the idea that in your approach, it's like the gluing diagrams that like keep track of. Gluing diagrams that like keep track of that extra information, and so that's why it shouldn't be that complicated to generalize to that more geometric setting. Yes, exactly. That's the idea. Yeah, you usually get this sort of topologically, everything works quite well and you can sort of talk it under the rug. But once you start doing more serious stuff, then you kind of have to survive with this color stuff and make everything really complicated. And this idea is, well, our idea is to just make things a little bit more complicated. Idea is to just make things a little bit more complicated from the get-go, but you get a formal framework for talking about anything, conformal structures, remaining structures, whatever. And this, the idea is that they should follow the same formal properties that I just mentioned. Yeah. Cool. Thank you. Yeah, thanks. So I guess I'm a little confused about the distinction between your CQFT and R. CQFT and are so are TQFTs examples of these things, just to confirm? Yeah, well, I didn't, you're right to be confused because I was not clear enough about, I was not clear on this. And it just requires a little bit more on the sort of domain category of our involvement symmetric mineral functors. But when you consider categories concrete over gluing functions, then yeah, one of the extra structures that you associate. Of the extra structures that you associate to hypersurfaces and regions are can be border some structures. So, yeah, definitely that's the case. TQFDs are should be, I mean, this is again work in progress, but the idea is that they are special cases of CQFTs. Okay, because somehow my intuition is like your theorem about homeomorphisms, it's surprising to me. It somehow doesn't feel in the case of like a digraph witt and d. Case of like a digraph written TQFT, it seems like it would not be true that when you have a G-action, that all the amplitudes have to be preserved on the nose. That's very striking to me. So I'm probably not parsing something correctly. Well, yeah, that's a, that's, I think that's pretty good intuition. So the thing is that the so the equivariant part of the, of whatever TQFT, that has to come from the gluing functions part. Come from the gluing functions part when you interpret them as coming from, sorry, as homeomorphisms being interpreted as gluing functions and then applying this gamma thing. So. Oh, okay. Yeah. So you kind of, you kind of, so you have your action and then you make that go through all of that structure. And then you get the criteria. Yeah. Because often like you get mapping class. Because often, like, you get mapping class group actions on surfaces that are interesting actions that have maybe are projective. And yeah, but I guess I see what you're saying. Thanks. Yeah. Well, also mapping class groups actions come from identifying things like homeomorphisms. So that's basically the point that we're trying to get these theorems that we have, but we don't have mapping class group group presentations. Mapping class group group presentations because we're doing everything, yeah. Okay, great, thank you. Yeah, thanks. Hi, uh, this is similar in spirit to Laura's question, but in the functorial formulation of topological quantum field theory, you often want to consider functors out of a higher category into maybe some target infinity and symmetric. And symmetric minoidal thing. So, without getting too technical, you were telling us a sort of co-dimension one story about the category of hypersurfaces and gluing functions. So, is there some higher categorical formalism that you expect with your compositional QFT as well? Yes, we should expect that, but we don't know exactly what that should be. That's pretty far off as of now. So, yeah, we should definitely expect. So, yeah, we should definitely expect some higher categorical thing going on. To well, you want to associate, so we're talking about like codimension one corners, and we have, but we're gluing through code dimension two corners. That's what our gluing functions are doing, but we're not, we're not associating anything so far to this corners. What should we associate to this? We don't know, but we should associate something to this, and that should be higher categorical, definitely. Oh, definitely. Oh, thanks. Yeah, thank you. Well, just a last question, Juan. I think it's equivalent to consider instead of these compositional embeddings and homomorphisms, the mapping cylinders, and just you take some coverages. Cover this now. Well, I wouldn't say they're at least for omeomorphines. Instead of considering the omeomorphism, you can take the mapping cylinders and then you consider as omeomorphisms. Well, in that case, you do, as we mentioned before, you get a mapping class group representation, right? And not an actual proper homeomorphism representation. So there is some homotopy. So, there is some homotopy stuff that you're sort of mixing in there. And so, here we're doing this on the nose, and then we get honest homeomorphism representations, not mapping classwork representations. And last thing, I don't know if you saw or if there's some connection with SK wordings, yeah, because well, some person here works in SK relations and they Scale relations and they they have some spectra when you have some direction of embeddings, yeah, two directional embeddings, and they they can work with that and then they arrive, for example, for the to the Bogomodal multiplier. And that could be an example, yeah, because here there are no examples. Yeah, yeah, that could be an example. That should be the well, the sort of the way you do. Well, the sort of the way you do scan things is sort of directed, which is kind of one of the things that we're trying to avoid. But if you do things sort of in an op-ared kind of way, well, there is direction, but I'm not sure. But yeah, that's a pretty good idea. I think, yeah, scan things are pretty nice. And that would be if that were an example. All right. Thank you very much, Juan. Yeah, I think. So, so well, that's the last talk, and we'll see you tomorrow.
