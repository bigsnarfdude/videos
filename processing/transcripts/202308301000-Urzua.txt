But you saw the same title except for this name. And that name that for this was for only for one singularity. And that work without the many and also with the many was together with Julie Rann with St. Lawrence in University of Lauren University Lawrence University in Appleton. Lawrence University in Appleton. And now with the many, and that means arbitrarily many singularities, is with Fernando Figueroa. And together with Julie Ran. And this is in the archive, appeared like two weeks ago. So I will talk about the motivation at the beginning. And of course, I will define these singularities. Course, I will define t-singularities, stable surfaces, and everything. So, motivation. So, for that, I need to talk about this moduli space of surfaces of general type. So, you have this M K square I. This is a moduli space of surfaces of general type. General type with invariance k squared. So, this is the self-intersection of the canonical class. And this guy, so k squared is self-intersection canonical class of the surfaces that you parametrized here. So, that is fixed. And also, chi is the this is one minus irregularity plus. Irregularity plus geometric genus. So it's the sky of the structure chief on the surface. And so you have a moduli space of such surfaces. This was constructed by Gieseger. But then after that, we wanted to have some compact modular space, so a way to compactify this. Think about the modular space of real. Space of Riemann surfaces of genus G bigger or equal than two, and then you have this compactification, the Link Manford. So we would like to have the same, and there is such compactification. So there is a geometric, this is a geometric compactification. Here you define the stable curves, which are singular curves that are degenerations of the curves that you have here. And if you have any Cursor you have here, and if you have any arbitrary degeneration, you can go to some of a unique. So, if you have a one-parameter degeneration, you have a unique way to complete that family using these stable curves. We have the same here. Well, not exactly the same. This is done via GIT, and here you need to use the MORE theory. But here you have a MK square I bar, and this is the colour Scheffer Baron. So this is the main paper and then Alexiv to have a projective scheme modular space of stable. Of stable surfaces. So that is the stable surfaces. And so sometimes we don't use this stable, we use K is BA surfaces. Okay, this space is a projective scheme in general, you have several In general, you have several components, different dimensions, very singular, non-reduced components. But there is a universal family? Like, no, because you also have this automorphism problem, maybe like a stack. There is a universal family, but not, you know, here you cannot have as a variety, like a universal family. There also, you cannot. cannot k u square i cannot read what is ks sorry the k squared what is k s self intersection of canonical class so the so for the for the smooth surfaces this would be the first churn class square so more or less we're fixing the churn classes of the tangent bundle here so you fix that you have this modular space and there is this compactification now this is a projective scheme and now you have so then Then there is a finite list of possible singularities after fixing k square and chi. Now, this is not any singularity, these are the semi-log canonical. Canonical singularities. So if the stable surface is irreducible, this is just log canonical singularities. So there is a list. But we would like to know, and here there is a finite list after you fix these invariants. And the main question here is what is that list explicitly. And this is very hard. In general, if you give me a surface here, I don't know how to degenerate really to a stable surface. So what kind of singularities do I have? To define K squared is also very hard because it's not this is no, for example, right. Yeah, so but you have several components, yeah, yeah, and you might have several components, yes. Might have several components, yes. But say that we restrict ourselves to irreducible surfaces, then you have a canonical class outside of the singularities that you closure, and this is my canonical class. Yeah, yeah. And that k square is going to be the same as the k square that I fix here, right? All the all the surfaces have the same k square, but then that kind of deformation is very particular for those singularities. Yes, K squared, can you compare if the let's say that the one can you comp K square is the man for intersection number or is something else? Yeah, it is the man for intersection number. And in this case, if I am talking about like a compactification of this modular space, this is an integer. So it happens that you are expecting to have a, I mean, you have an integer as a self-intersection. An integer as a self-intersection. And also, k squared here is always bigger than zero. Because here, well, I didn't say that, these surfaces, the canonical class, is ample. And that is why here we have a finite list after you fix the k square and chi. And now the question is: what is this list explicitly? But, and this is hard. I will, and then I will. Uh, I will and then I will take a subset of these uh log canonical singularities, and these are the T singularities. So we will consider only T singularities, and there is a list of motivations for that. For example, typically they They define divisors in the KSVA boundary. So they define a big piece of this compactification, or they are used to understand deformations. Of rational singularities. Or let me say maybe of quotient singularities. This is inside of the paper of Colar and Sheffield-Barron. These are the singularities used in the rational broaddown. Technique of intuitive term, and that is the way to produce exotic, a way to produce exotic for manifolds. Well, there is a bunch of more. There is this Horikawa problem. I'm mentioning this Markov conjecture, etc. There are a lot of problems. There are a lot of problems in mathematics related, turns out that they are related to these singularities. But maybe the main motivation and how they appear for the first time is via this modular space. They were defined by Colari and Schofer-Baron, but Jonathan Wall was studying them. I will explain that in a moment, but let me define these singularities. So, I mean, maybe, you know, there is a definition as these are the quotient singularities that admit that Q-Warnstein is moving. That is how Colarchoffer-Barron defined them. But then they classify them. So let me put the classification. So T singularities are exactly ABE singularities. These are the rational double points. Double points of dual singularities. And then, plus this type of cyclic quotient singularities where the order of the cyclic group is D times N square. And then the exponents are 1 BNA minus 1. So very particular numbers. And A is between 0 and N, and they are co-prime. D, any integer. D any integer. So, what is this? Maybe you don't remember simply quotient singularities. So, you have a, in general, if you have integers q and m co prime, and you have c two to c two, and you consider this action, xy, and take a primitive root of unit of order m. root of unit of order m to set root of one and now you act like this xy goes to set x set to the qy so that is my cyclic action on c2 and then you quotient so let me say that this action this that automorphism is t then the j then t is is this cyclic group Cyclic group and C2 over that at the origin is the definition of my cyclic singularity. Let me write it like this. So for T singularities, we want this exponent and that order. This means this plus A D E I know. So is the ADE simulators or this was infinite? Yeah, union. So for me, really, the T singularities that I want to bound are really this. You know, we look at them, I ADE, like these are smooth points. These ADE singularities appear already on the surfaces that you parametrized here. These are not only smooth, but these are canonical. So you need to accept to have canonical singularities. To accept to have canonical singularities. The other ones are the ones that really appear here. So I will bound. So these singularities are going to be for me really these ones. Now, this is not a good way to think about them. A good way is to resolve these singularities and think about the chain of P1s in this resolution. So let me record the resolution, the minimal resolutions of this type of singularities. So you have something. So you have something like this. This is 1 over m 1q. You have the singularity, and now we minimally resolve. And then you replace this point by a bunch of P1s. And these P1s have self-intersection minus E1, minus E2, minus Minus E2, minus ER, and this E1 up to ER. If you do the Hirsenberg-June continuous fraction like this, you know this historic geometry. I bet you saw this before. Then you get M over Q. And you know, if you have a rational number that is bigger than one, then there is a unique such continuous fraction. This is the Here's. This is the Hirsenbruch June continuous fraction. Okay, so that is the way you resolve this singularity. But now these continuous fractions, which I will denote like this, are very particular for T singularity. So this is the way to think about T singularities. You have D equals to one, D2, and so on, D3. So on these three, four, and so you start with the four, and here three, three, and now you insert some twos in between these two threes, like this. This is like step one, and where n is two and a is one, and these are the d's. And now we have this algorithm. This algorithm, if the t-chain, so this is going to be a t-chain now. If m equals dn square and q equals dna minus one, then this is, I will call that singularities. Why the letter t terminal because of terminal singularities? You have a threefold and there are terminal singularities. Are terminal singularities but not for the surface for the threefold? So there are there is a Q-Worenstein smoothing, then you have a threefold, and the singularity that you see there is determined in the total, yes. That is the so these are going to be called T chains. So T chain is the way you resolve a T singularity. You might think that way. So these are the T chains for this invariance. And now if you have a T chain. Now, if you have a T chain, say E1 ES, then this is the algorithm. You might add one at the beginning, then E2, ER, 2, and this is a T chain. And also, you might do like, you might put a 2 at the beginning, then continuity 1, ER minus 1, and then ER plus 1. And then ER plus one. And this is also T chain. And then the theorem is that any T any T chain, for any T chain, you start with one of these, and then you apply this algorithm, and you will get it. So an example. So it's very simple to see that something is a T chain. Say that you have here six and then two, I don't know, three, two, two. Three, two, two, something like that. And so you eliminate twos, like you erase this and this, then this becomes two, erase that, this becomes two, erase this two, this becomes four. So you are here. So this is a T chain. When D is one, there is another name for the singularities. These are the wall singularities. In case you see that name. And these wall singularities, when D is one, are D is one are the cyclic quotient singularities that admit and smoothing with million number zero. Exactly, those and exactly those are the ones that have to do with the rational blowdown here of integer. Okay, so how so now we have the t-singularities. Now, how do we bound them? So, the idea is to try to get some sort of list of these t-singularities after you fix. These singularities after you fix case that piece of work, yes, is it understood the torsion part of the homology of the midnight driver? The torsion, yes, yeah, so we can come. Yeah, that is classic. Yes, yeah, it is set over n the h1 is of the minnow, yes, of the minnow fiber is very explicit. I can give you the smoothing and why this is h h uh h1 is set over n. So you can see that there's working on more general T singularities that you can use to any number. Yes. Or maybe I can say that. When you have a T singularity and you think about the deformation space of a T singularity, you know, in general, for a cyclic quotient singularity, you have many components, but we understand them through the Understand them through the paper of Colar Chef-Baron. So here we have many components. But there is one component where you have these Q-Gorenstein smoothings. And the dimension of that component is exactly this D. So in the case of wall singularities, D is one. You have only one dimensional way to have a smoothing with Milner number zero. Have a smoothing with Milner number zero is if and only if this is Kubernetes smoothing. So, so to think about T-singularities in this compactification of the modular space, we need to think about this type of deformation and not those. We choose to take these ones. These are the ones that keep the k-square constant. With the other ones, you jump. Okay. Okay, so now how to bound. So we will bound. So the strategy is to bound the index. And this index is very simple, is the end, the end that appears in the definition of this singularity. But let me say this: so, how to bound the me say this so how to bound the the index so it turns out that if you consider the fibonacci numbers are in this way so say f minus two is f minus one equals one so if the index you mean the n times the canonical noise means yes so so if you consider this and you and locally here you have this canonical class and you and this is not Cartier. You, and this is not Cartier, but it's coup Cartier, and you are looking for the smallest integer so that when you multiply that canonical class, it becomes Cartier. That is the index. So, this is a way to bound the index using the invariants d and the length of this t-chain, r. So, r is the length. And it turns out that we have this. These are the Fibonacci numbers. You start 1, 1, and then, you know, F series 2 and so on. Then 3, 5, 8, and then the index is bounded by F R minus equals. This is the bound, and this is an optimal bound. So, and there are infinitely many T singularities where the index is. Where the index is exactly this Lionacci number. Okay, so then the point is to bound this with respect to canonical class. Then we want to bound R minus with respect to K square and K. Now there is a sort Now, there is a sort of noether inequality for chi, and then you have a bound for this invariant with respect to k squared. So really, we want to bound k squared. I mean, we want to bound r minus d with respect to k squared. And also, d can be bounded using the log-bog-molomi-yau-ga-yao inequality. And so, at the end, what we are bounding is the length of these t-chains with respect to k squared. With respect to k square. That is what we want. So now, what we know. So now coming back to the talk in Cuernavaca, what is known. Yeah, but now maybe to really talk about this, let me. To really talk about this, let me put the setup. This is the general setup to study this. So, say W is a stable surface with only these singularities and say that they are exactly L. That they are exactly L. So, this is the number of these singularities. And now you have this W here. So, the canonical class, this is an irreducible surface, projected surface with this type of singularities, and we have L of them. A picture like this. Canonica class here example. Take the minimum resolution of all of them. And here, this is sigma, and here you take pi. And pi is going to be the contraction of all possible minus one curves to get a surface S with no, so there are no like a minimal model, but maybe w is rational, so you are choosing where to to land in case of the if if if here you have a kind of If here you have a canonical class in F, this would be a unique process. But this S has no minus one curves. Okay, so this is the setup. And then the theorem, by them, where Navaca was in 2017 with Julie and me. Mean is that we have the following in a quite the following if so the canonical class is ample say that L is one so we have only one singularity then we have this bound r minus d for that singularity maybe I put a one here is smaller or equal than four or equal than four times Kw squared minus Ks square plus a number. This is a number like one, two, I don't remember now. Fixed number, maybe it's one minus the image. So let me put here that inside you have C, which is about have C which is a bunch of T chains Ci from one to L C i the T chain so these are the T chains that are all disjoint because you have L singularities you resolve you have these T chains this is the exceptional divisor of sigma and so you have this blowing down to S. Blowing down to S, we look at the image of the C. So you know, here you have a bunch of rational curves, these are chains, and now you take these blowdowns and you have an image here. The chain will not disappear. You will have a configuration of rational curves. This pi of C is a configuration of rational curves. I will give you an example in a moment times the canonical class of S. Okay, this is the type of inequality we would like to have, and this is optimal. In what sense that we can classify, you can achieve equality, and also we can classify when you have equality here. In the case, well, this is general. Well, this is general. I don't have any hypothesis on W, but in the case when W or say when S is not rule, then we can classify equality here and I can tell you what kind of surfaces you have. Also okay. Here there are two observations. Observations. The first one is that this becomes really a bound if this number is positive. So here you have a bunch of curves intersecting canonical class. So if canonical class is an f, this number is positive, you're subtracting. So this is really a bound that depends only on kw squared. Kw square. Okay, so if Ks is nef, then this is optimal down. But is known F. Well, it turns out that this implies it's not difficult to see that W and all the W and all the surfaces involved here is rational. And then we need to understand how to impose a bound here for this intersection number. So we have new problem of bound bounding this intersection. This intersection. So the configuration of rational curves with the canonical class. And we don't know how to do that. This is open. This is an open problem. Now, one has to be careful because, in the rational case, say that you arrive here to P2 and you have a plane curve. So this is a plane curve with several components. We are in P2. With several components, we are in P2. And now you can use, and we provide that example in the paper of Cremona transformations to go from this configuration to a more complicated. So you can increase and increase the degree. And if you do that, then this could go to infinity. So to really approach that problem, you need to consider a sort of minimal degree for the curves that appear. For the curves that appear, so after you fix k squared here, for the curves that appear in this p2, for that k square. And that is something that we don't know how to do yet. So this is open. The second observation is that Johnny Evans and Ivan Smith by that time. By that time, did something similar using syplectic topology and found a bound. So, found a bound that they are really using rational blowdowns when this one. So, we are taking into consideration only wall singularities, but and And L arbitride. But the thing is that in symplectic topology, if you have the surface with several wall singularities, you might smooth all of them except one. And so you can analyze the case of one singularity and maybe go back to what we did here. And more or less, that is what is happening. So they don't really take into consideration the interaction of the singularities. The interaction of the singularities in this projective surface. And that is key for the thing that we do with Fernando and Julie. So they arrive to some very similar inequality like this, like R minus one is smaller than 4k squared plus some number, maybe seven. Very similar. And W, not Russian. So, when you have W rational surface, that is really the problem here. Okay, so now I will show you how to study how to find bounds for R minus D in the For R minus D in the case of arbitrarily many singularities. You know, in algebraic geometry, we don't have these complex smoothings for free when you have a projective surface. You need some conditions. You need to construct something. It's not for free. There are obstructions, and typically obstructions are not zero. If we have a way to have a way to to just smooth uh in the case of many singularities then i can provide so for the case of ellie arbitrary i can provide a bound like evans and smith did but even in that case you don't have this interaction between the singularities there is something going on between the singularities so what is this so i will explain it with the setup we have a situation like this We have a situation like this, and remember that we have here the C that is the sum of all the T chains, T chains. But now I will consider the spy and I will consider the EIs. So what are the EI? The I. So here you have a composition of many blowdowns, like from say that. Say that I did m so pm by minus one and so on. You know, you are blowing up points, smooth points. So say that we stop in the in the I blow up, and then the EI is the pullback in that step of the minus one curve. So So it might happen that, so in general, this is a tree. It is non-reduced in general, tree of rational curves. But they have the property that EI squared is minus one, and EI, so they behave like you have different. Behave like you have different points in a smooth surface, and you blow up, and you have just different minus one curves. And so the self-intersection is minus one. And when they are different, this is zero. But typically, it's not the case. You need to do several blow-ups over points. So you have these trees. And the key to give a bound is to understand. Understand EI dot C. This is what we want to understand. And so imagine that you have the T chains, many of them. And on the other hand, you have the EIs, which might be part of the T chains. Maybe you did several groups. Maybe you did several blow-ups and it becomes like very negative curves, but then you have some minus one curve like this, you know, something like that. The yellow are the EIs and the C is the Y. And this is the interaction I'm telling you, the intersection of these EIs, the yellow, with the C. This is what we need to understand. Let me give you an example of something of general type. So consider an example of a W. So consider the situation of an elliptic vibration with sections from a pencil of cubic. From a pencil of cubics. So in P2, you have a pencil of cubics. So that you resolve the pencil. And so now you have this elliptic vibration. So over P1. And so you have these sections, which are minus one curves. And say that we have these singular fibers, and maybe more, but I'm just drawing the singular. But I'm just drawing the singular fibers that I will use in the construction. Let me call this surface set. And now from set, I will blow up in a very particular way. And this is more or less the art of constructing these W's. You just do not do blow-ups at random points. You need to do it in specific points. Do it in specific points, and you need to have something in mind. You want to achieve maybe some k square, which is positive, say, one. And also, you want to achieve to have a canonical class sample for the singular surface. And it happens that here we have an example from this configuration. And this will be the configuration I was talking about. Maybe you want to blow down this configuration to P2, and you have a plane curve here. I will blow up here, here. So it will blow up here, here, here, here, here, here, here twice. If you do that, well, maybe I will use this thing, you will get this minus three, minus two. So, maybe now I can tell you that we have a computer program where you give a configuration of rational curves, and the computer can search for these type of surfaces. It's not clear how you, if there is a recipe, so if you give me a configuration of rational curves, what to do to get a surface like that for a k squared that you are trying to find. You are trying to find. K-squares that are high are difficult to find. Low k-squares are more easy. So you have something like this. And now in a blow up, you have something like that. And this is a minus two curve that I will not use. So now what you see is this minus four, minus three, minus two. Minus three, minus two, minus six, minus two, and the same configuration here. So there you have three T chains. So there is C1, which is the four, C2, which is the two, six, two, three, and C3, which is the same type. Okay, so I have a situation like that. So, I have a situation like that. This is going to be the x there, the x, and now you contract the t chains. This is arting contraction, and you get three wall singularities. And this is my w and you can check that here w has canonical class sample in case. And k square of w is one. So, this is an example of maybe for s, you can go directly to p2, just to have an example on the board. Now, this is a rational example, so these are the difficult. So these are the difficult rebounds that will be part of the open problem. Why do you need the decided object? Yeah, that is a problem. This is an open problem. If I fix a k square and say rational surface, I don't know what are exactly the configurations that produce those kind of surfaces. I don't know. It's open. That is what. It's open. That is why we wrote a computer program to search for these surfaces. And you have thousands of them. It's very impressive. Okay, so let me define this. So I said that the keys to study this situation, the intersection of the EI. Intersection of the EI with C. Let me say this. So first, let us look at EI dot C out. I want to look at this number. It's going to be bigger or equal than zero. C out means intersect EI with C, but with the curves that do not belong to EI. Maybe. Maybe something like, well, maybe you understood. Like, you have the C, which are these T chains, but maybe there are some components that belong to EI. I eliminate them, and then I intersect with EI. That is why this number is bigger or equal than zero. Okay, for example, when this is zero, means that the some components. Some components of C are contained in EI, and the rest are disjoint. So, a situation like you have these D chains and all of them are contained and the EI has maybe some curves, but now you have others and you don't touch them. A situation like that, but with canonical class ample. But it turns out that that cannot happen. Let me define SH. SH, which are going to be the number of EIs so that EI dot C out is equal to H. Okay, the first thing that you can prove, not so hard, so lemma. The first thing that we do in the paper is to prove that S0 is to prove that S0, as I said there, is 0. So it's impossible to have this equal to 0. And S1 is also 0, which is a similar situation. So this is all contained in EI, but maybe you have some curve that touches one component of the rest. That would be h equal one. That is not possible. And remember that this positivity is key. If you eliminate k. key. If you eliminate Kw ample, then this is not true. It's very simple to give examples. Positivity of this implies that these two numbers are zero. Another lemma to show you the optimal bound. So if S2 equals dot dot S A equals zero for some A bigger equal than For some a bigger equal than two, then you can write down this bound. So the sum of the ri minus di. So remember that this is the thing that we would like to bound, and the ri minus di, but we put them all together in a sum. And then we want to put less or equal, that's something related to k squared of w. And this is the thing. A over a minus one, and this is the strongest bound that you can find. Again, you have this difference between k squared of w and k squared of s and then minus a minus two over a minus one, and here you have l and then minus 1 over a minus 1, and the intersection again of this configuration with Ks. So, for example, if A is 2, then this is not there. And here you have a 2, and here you have this term, and that is optimal. Okay, so if it happens that S2 is zero, then this is the best. Then this is the best possible bank. But in reality, that is not zero. And here you have an example. So right here, if you contract this minus one and then you contract this other curve, you will go to the node to this point. And that chain is an ER. chain is an ei so that dot uh c out this is two so right here you you start to see and this is very typical we have these situations so unfortunately this s2 is not really zero in general in general S2 is not zero, so then we need to analyze the EIs so that EI dot C out is two. It turns out that these are the same as the EIs if you analyze this situation. If you analyze this situation, it's the same as EI dot c equals one. Okay, so we would like to know and to know everything about the EIs that intersect one with C. And our theorem is a classification of them. And this is with Fernando, Julie, and me. And this is two weeks ago. There is a classification. A classification of such EIs in nine families. What I mean by that is that, for example, you have a, you know, when you have an elliptic vibration, provide a data classification of the possible singular fibers. And you have. And you have several types, the type EN, EN star, and so on, maybe related to ADE singularities. Well, here we have nine families that, like nine possible ways to have a EI in this blow-up, in this X, that intersects C equals to one, in general, with no restrictions. And I cannot show you the tables, but there are tables. You, the tables, but there are tables in the introduction where you can see these nine families. One of them, one of the families corresponds to this EI, where you have a D chain. So maybe let me give you an example. But there are several others. This is the type, one of them. This is the C1 type. So in these nine families, you might have. Families, you might have, you might need to consider three T chains, two T chains, or one T chain. In this case, you have only one, so you have the T chain like this. D chains always have an ending curve, which is a minus two curve. So let me put it like in yellow, maybe up to here, some dots. Some dots here, so these are all minus twos, and now there is a minus one curve connecting some other y curve, and this is minus one. This is a situation, this is one of the nine families that produce an EI, and the EI is the yellow. So, EI dot C is one. This is one of them. So, after that, when you now have a classification. When you now have a classification of the bad part for that that breaks this bound, that this bound cannot be used, then how to do this, how to use them to have a bound for the complete picture that is different. And that is the theorem how to obtain In the case S2 different and zero, and then there is an analysis that is divided in two. So one, there is a local analysis of the situation. Say that we put these T chains as vertices. So this is a T chain. T-chain. And now you analyze how the interaction with all the T-chains. So, what are the possible interactions with all the T-chains? So, this local picture, like we are looking at one T-chain and how the bad EIs that we classify interact with this T chain. And then we get a bound of RI's minus EIs in relation to the interaction. In relation to the interaction, right? Let me say this is the bad part. Okay, local, this is not difficult to do. We can just go and take our classification and do it. But now the global part is the difficult part because you have these local inequalities and you want to put them together to get an inequality like this. So, how to do that? And then there are some tricks related to trees. So, here use, it turns out that we use tricks. This is very combinatorial related to particular trees. So obtain the following theorem. Maybe I will close this. And then the theorem is something like this. You divide the situation into components because you always care about the interaction of EIs with the C, but the connected component, because there might be some T chains that interact with EI, but there are others that do not. So we divide these into components. So we divide this into components, connected components, and then the theorem is something like this: we have the sum, but now we need to put a weight. And this weight, a weight with respect to the connected components. Here, there are graphs that we call GI. So there are several components. And now here we put the RI and DI. The Ri and Di, put it like this. This is the sum of the Ri Di corresponding to this Di, and then we sum all together. And now this is more or equal than two. And again, this Kw squared minus Ks squared appears. Then there is some number that depends on of the components. And again, we have this intersection here. This intersection that is always present in all possible bounds, and so to get this bound, we need the hypothesis that Ks is net. Okay, we didn't work out the case when we have a rational surface. When we have only one singularity, we have a more general inequality. We didn't care if the canonical class was nef. But now, here from the beginning, canonical. But now here from the beginning, canonical class isn't. And we have this. Now it's kind of hard to. This is asymptotically optimal. We can construct situations that are combinatorial where you achieve a sort of so you asymptotically go to the left part goes to the right part. But if you want something really optimal, like in the case of one singularity, then it's very, very hard because these local bounds. Hard because these local bounds that we find could be arbitrarily horrible, like there is no control, it's difficult to explain. But we took the case of L equals to two, so when you have two singularities as an application, and we said everything in that case, we explain all what you can have with two singularities. But if you go to three, it will be very difficult. But at least we have this. Okay, I think. Okay, I think that I stop here. Thank you very much for your help. Yeah, any questions from comments? Ah, yes. Okay, yeah. I want to test if I understand well what are the T singularities. So you take a family of projective surfaces that have each of them one isolated singularity. Okay. And now after finite base change, you make semi-stable resolution. And you can assume that in the general member you That in the general member, the resolution is minimal. This is something that can be done. And now you apply the minimal model program, relative minimal model program to terminal singularities. And now T singularity means that if the central fiber is irreducible, only T singularities can appear. No, no, when it's irreducible, you can have all the list of log canonical. That includes also elliptic singularities. Also, elliptic singularities cast quotient of the corporate. But the total space is terminal. In that deformation, the total space is terminal and it gets a smooth. Yes. But still, you might have this other singularity. So what then what is a t-singularity? So you think the internal way. So this singularities, okay, in the log canonical, right, you can say the really log canonical, the strictly log canonical, where some discrepancy is. Law canonical where some discrepancy is x minus one, right? Street. So, but this singularity is not that the total space is terminal and the general fiber is the in the situation that I have described, the total space is terminal and the general fiber is smooth. Yes, that also can have so you might have an elliptic singularity and smoothing where this is happening. Where this is happening. So the irreducible central fiber, a smoothing, yeah, elliptic or cospidal, there are many possibilities. But in the case of T-singulatis, so you have the strict log canonical union, the log terminal, where you don't have this discrepancy equal to minus one. It's between minus one and zero. And those are exactly the quotients in your life. So, if you think about, well, I would like to think about a surface with quotient singularities in this modular space so that I have a smoothing. And this is all happening in this modular space, then those are the T singularities. So, in particular, if you have cyclic quotient or any quotient singularity, so it turns out only you see cyclic quotient singularities of that type. What I think it is of that type, or AB and not other if you have this model. Thanks.
