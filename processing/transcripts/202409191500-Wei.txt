Unfortunately, my talk is about local problem. So, this and it's arise from physics, analytics, and geometry, but it's a local problem. But you're going to see some non-local energy. The problem is local, but it's non-local. So, the problem I'm going to consider is a very simple. consider is a very simple uh second order uh is in is uh simple equation defined in two r2 so it's lava v plus h is v and there's a direct source and today i will consider the effect of the dilapid source so we can get rid of the direct force by adding this uh by adding this log and so you have this uh x to the power Have this x to the power 2 alpha and some function and e to the u. Okay, so this is the equation I'm going to consider today. Very simple equation. And first, some bygrounds. So this problem is called is a new vehicle problem with a codic single left. So the classical numbers problem is this one. But if we consider coding You know, coding singularity, the measure has a cordial singularity. Then, locally, this problem is this. So, this is the geometrical background. And there are many, many physical backgrounds. This is called the mean field equation. And in particular, in all the applications, the source is always The source is always quantitative. Quantized means the source is always an integer. Okay, there's no fractional. And so, our study actually is very relevant in applications because in all the applications, the source are always quantitative. This is the one we want to consider. And so, when the source is quantitized, and this has close ties with the Todar system, algebra geometry. The Todar system, algebra geometry, integral system number theory, and the Manji-Ampa equation, and so on. And it has been studied by Chenlin, Yosta Wang, and Makiodi Patoluchi Tantano. And also, at least three massively from this audience initiated the study of the multi-component mean field system. And they have System and they have done some fundamental work for these systems. So, today I'm only concentrated on the single equation. Okay, so let's look at three cases. So, alpha is the single out. Let's suppose there's no single out. Okay? So, so you have you don't have a single error, yes. You don't have a singularity here, so just some function here. And this function, this is supposed to be a boundary formula of OSH because we put a singularity in front of the function. And assume the total mass is finite, and I assume we have a block. Then the fundamental theorem is the following. All bubbles are The following, all bubbles are simple. And this is some initial work by Brazil and Mel, but then Brazil and Lee and Chaffrey almost solved the problem, and Lee and the Chaffrey, and finally, and the Ni in 1995. So the result is all about the simple. So let me now explain what I mean by simple. What I mean by simple. What do I mean simple? Okay. So if we plot the problem, so if we do block analysis, and you're going to see this is a new wheel. Okay. And so by result of Qing and Lin, Ni, without all solutions for destiny wheel, they look like a bubble. Look like a like a bar. And you have some parameter. So the solution has a spike, okay, and it's really symmetric around one point. And also the mass is quantitative. Mass is quantitative. So what Ni proved in 1995, and based on the result of Princes Ni and the Chafre and the Neil Chafri. Really and then nearly shall free. What he proved that if you have a local bubble solution, and this is the usual assumption assuming that the maximum is the center. Okay, you can also do this. You can shift your domain and assume the mass is bounded. And you assume that you don't have bubble outside. So outside is a hologram. Outhoes is comparable. Parable. Under these three conditions, and we prove in 1995 that the solution basically is given by the global solution. So you subtract this global solution, then the difference is order one. So it means you can basically use the global solution to characterize your solution. So this means. So this means, so this is precisely, we mean the non-simple. So we say a black is simple if you can characterize by the global solution. Okay? And or in another way, this more analytically means this plus two times this is about it. Okay. But this is a simple one. But this is a simple one. So, what I mean by block is simple. It can be characterized by one block. Okay? Physical. Physical block. And the block is non-simple if it cannot be characterized by one bubble. Okay, so this is a very simple. So you cannot use the global solution to characterize your bubble and this quarter. And this is called a non-simple block. All right. So, why are we interested in simple block? Because once, if you go back to the mean field equation, once you know all bubbles are simple, then you can do all kinds of things. Okay. For example, you can show the at each point you have only one bubble profile and the height of the buffer. Profile and the height of bubbles are roughly the same, and the energy is concentrated. You have a refined estimate, and then you can define the topological degree, Larry Shadow degree. This is Yen Li. You can define a topological degree. And then with this topology degree, with this, because your bubble is simple, you can use the one, the global bubble to calculate the bubble, so you can compute the top. Calculate as the bubble, so you can compute the topological change. And in this way, you can even compute the total degree in terms of topological quantity. And this is changing underneath. And so what I want to see is once you know the problem is simple, you are done. The problem is done. Okay, so you can do all kinds of analysis, computing the topology degree, compute everything. So this is. So, this is the lungsome with the low singularity case. Now, second case we consider singularity, but let's assume that the singularity is not a quantitative. So, the singularity is not an integer. And for this problem, the result is C. You can show that all bubbles are simple. So, if a bubble is, if for non-contact has a singularity, all bubbles are simple. And this is, and so again, if we go to the go to the problem in the entire space, in this case, you have a classification of all solutions. And this solution is also reading the solution. In fact, you don't have a translation. In fact, you don't have translations because you're already the singularity is your block point. Okay, so this is the Prajapad on the Tarantano, and you can also compute the total mass. And so this is the Bartolushi, Qing, and Lenin under Tarantano in 2004. And they showed that in the Lang point case, Point has case, you that all above us are simple. So you take out the global solution, the rest is what the one. Okay, the same result like a yearly or near and the shape frame. Okay, the same, the same result. And with this, you can compute the topological degree. Okay, you can compute the total topological degree for the long quantitative case. So, the most difficult part is that hundred has a single net. Okay, so when alpha is integer, then you have non-simple product. So, first, let's look at the global solution. Let's look at the global solution. Again, by Project Part and Taroto, all solutions can be characterized. But and I could And like the non-contact case, here you have a new parameter case. Okay? Now, this parameter is not a translation parameter. It's a parameter, but it's not a translation parameter because this is z to the m plus r minus plus r. And you have also another parameter which is lambda. Okay? So you have three parameter family of. So, you have a three-parameter family of solutions. So, let's look at this solution. So, if you choose your casi go to zero, and if you choose your lambda go to infinity, this solution will have like n equal to one, you're going to see two bumps. Instead of all the previous case, you only have one bump, and this one, you already see two bumps for the global solution. So, even for the global solution, it's not. Solution is not is a non-sample. It's a non-sample. So, in this case, for the quantitative singleity, Go and Elin, Mattanouchi, and Tartano, they show that if you have a non-simple block, then you have m plus one local maximum point. And after we scaling, this m plus one local maximum points are Plus one local vector points are located on a regular polygon. Okay, so for example, if a equals two, you have an equilateral triangle, and a equals four, a into three, you have a square. So the vertex are a regular corridor of scaling. So the So, the main question we want to show is how do we identify long-sample block? And can long sample block hyper. And this is really a difficult problem which has been, you know, has been exist for 10 years, at least. And really, we don't know how to go to this problem. And in the last five years, with my collaborator. With my collaborators Naison and Teresa Darapo, and we are able to completely almost finish the program, the non-simple block. Okay, so let me now show you what is the result in the non-simple block case. So this is six case. So you have seven maximum points. So the first result I will obtain with liaison is a foray. Lay it on is a full rate. You have a lung smoke, then the gradient must vanish. Okay. But we also showed the Laplace also vanish. Okay? Now, the gradient finishes, we know this is a classical. Even for the long single case, the gradient must finish. But this one is new. But what's new? What's new surprise for us is we just finished it recently, that not only the breeding vanish, all the second order difficulty vanish. So the hershing, the total hershing must vanish. Okay? If n greater than one. And furthermore, if n large enough, you have to be able to enjoy. You have more higher water financially. Okay? And so for N large, for N large, this potential must be very, very flat if you want to have a non-simple plot. And and even for A equal to one, what you need all the second order difficulties. Difficult function. Okay, second order DFG function. And this is quite different from the non-contact case. Because the non-contact case, we only know the if the block is simple, you only know the gradient varnish. Okay? But now, for non-simple block, what we showed is not only the gradient varnish. The gradient vanishes, all the higher-order density must vanish. So, if you want to have a non-simple blob, you should have many, many orders of vanishing order. And this operate with n equal one because we have a counterexample. We have an example. We construct the first simple block, non-simple block with this example. And in this example, you see that. And in this example, you see that your financial order starts from four. Okay? It starts from four. And under some conditions on these coefficients, you have one non-simple problem. This is the first result. And the second result, let's look at the Deutsche problem than you will with the Deutsche Boundary condition. This and if the source is not an integer, we know that all the bubbles are simple. Okay? So with Teresa, we look at the problem, the simplest problem, we look at the disk and the singularity is zero. And we look at one source, only the source at the dirt. And we want to construct And we want to construct a non-simple blob for this problem. And we thought that the non-simple blob will exist. But by our construction, we found if you fix your singularity, you fix this one in here and you don't have. But if you allow this one to vary, you'll have a long sample problem. So our conjecture. So, our conjecture in this paper is that there should be no long-term problem for this problem. And recently, we completely solved the problem. So, we showed that if you have a usual boundary condition, all problems are simple, even with the quantitative single level. Okay, so if you have a different bound condition with this quantitative With this quantity with any source, all bubbles are simple. So, this is a very, somehow the dual body condition is pushing away all the long simple problems. Okay, all the long sample problems. So, as a corollary, and we showed that there's a lot of block when Long small block when in the disk. Okay, our third result is also very funny and very interesting. Okay, and so if you have a long sample block, okay, so we have a few blobs. If you are locally, you see, and what we show is this blob, if a lung simple block must be unknown. Be alone. Hegeli, just like USA. United States is the only power, okay, in the world. If a long simple block, you cannot have another long simple blob. You cannot have another blob, simple blob. Only itself, only this one must be a blob. Only the long simple block. Only he is alone. Okay? So this is very, very so. So, this is very, very so. So, long if you have a long simple buff, it scrolls all other blocks. Okay, you only have one, you cannot have two blobs. So, long simple buff must be alone, must be lonely, okay? Must be by itself. So, you cannot have other power to fight with the lungs in. So, in summary, we look at this very simple problem, right? And we have the financial order, which is higher order financial order. And we have non-existence of lungs of a block. And we also have the lungs of the block must be lonely, okay? Must be the only one, okay? Must be the only chosen one. So, with this, we have now a complete program of analyzing the non-super problem. And we have a tool, okay, technical tool to analyze the non-super problem. Now, it's a remaining time, so let me now share what is the difficulty, how we get around the difficulty, how we apply these results to other problems. So we have So we have m plus one spikes. And so we have two quantities. One is the maximum of u, which goes to infinity. And another one is the distance from the spike to the center, to the singularity. So this is a delta under mu. So for two quantities, two quantities. So, locally, if you look at the issue of the block at the issue of this point, you send your will. You have a new will, new will, and then you will. Okay? And the problem is how this new will talk to this new will, how they talk to each other. Okay? So, So, the main difficulty is these two quantities, you cannot impose any relation between these two quantities. Okay? These two quantities are two quantities. And you cannot say which one is smaller, which one is larger. No, these are two quantities because even in the host. Because even in the whole space case, you have two quantities, lambda and cosine, they don't talk to each other. Okay. So the problem, how do different bubbles talk to each other? And they talk to each other non-local. They talk, each of the spike talks to all the other spikes. Okay? This is a long-local interaction. So how do you see the long-local? So how do you see the long-local interaction? And so we do a lot of local analysis. And what we found is the following. So this is the rectangle. This is the regular polygon. You look at the perturbation of your point from the regular polygon. The perturbation, they talk to each other, talk to the source, they talk to each other by this matrix. This is how they communicate each other. They talk to each other by this matrix. So, issue of that, if this one moves a little bit, all the others will move by this matrix, by this interaction. Okay? Of course, this is, I will simplify with this because our proof is each paper is at this 56 page. That is 56 pages. And finally, for the dealship balance condition, why the due ship boundary condition impose the lung existence? Why the dealship balance prevent lung simple plot? And the reason is if you look at long simple blood and if you look at the boundary value of the long simple block, and what you're going to see. And what you're going to see is high-order Fourier coefficients only. Okay? You cannot see low-order Fourier coefficients. So which means with the dual boundary condition, the high-order Fourier coefficient will be long-term. Some low-order Fourier coefficient will be long-term. And so this is the main reason. So the boundary data for the Lang Simple imposes some. block imposes some uh uh uh uh restriction and the precisely the dual shipment gives you the restriction okay give you the restriction uh and uh so uh my time is up so finally uh with some applications now we can classify for example because we know that all bubbles are non-simple uh are simple now we can classify all solutions with a singularity okay and Single level. And one can also generalize this result to four dimensions to four decays, which is the Q capture. And in this case, it's no longer a polygon, you have a tetrahedral, and you have all the other stationary configurations. And my time is up. Thank you.
