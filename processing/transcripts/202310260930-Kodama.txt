Okay, so this is my title of the talk. And also, this one, in the last part, the application to say to gas is very preliminary. So I just described what type of application I'm thinking, and then I think that will be the end. Okay. All right. So next one, because, oh, how does it go? How does it go? Oh, yeah. Okay, let's start with this picture. So, this picture, actually, the target I'm going to explain. So, what's going on here and so on. So, if you look at the left-hand side, it looks very guessy, right? So, a lot of random things are going on. And then, there are the parameters. So, this is actually the social Kp equation. You can find the class-based solution. You can find the quadratic solution on the Saturn Greenman's surface, and it's not hypoeptic. And this also is Abenda and Grimovich, 2017. And they are studying all the K-P soil solutions, but by starting from some algebraic curves, and they don't really specify how to pinch it and so on. But okay, so this is a numerics, of course, this is a quadratic solution. Then you start. Then you start to pinch some of the cut, then you get into the genus zero. So genus 4 go to genus 0. Then, if you see the middle part B, then you see there are some lines and then they're the curious. So there are some trivalent vertices and some crossing. And if you make much smaller the epsilon, so this is epsilon. I cannot redo it. Yeah, Ipshion is here, that's over here, right? So if you feel minus. Over here, right? So it's from minus 10 to each equal 10 to the minus 18. Then it becomes very clear. So locally, you see the line solitons. So the soliton, bunch of solitons actually sitting inside of this screen and they are interacting very interesting way. So that's what I call the resonance. So there are a lot of resonance happening here. And the second line is just a three-dimensional picture. Okay, so before Picture. Okay, so before I go, maybe I should explain the very simple example. So if you consider SL3, a fine tota. So this is just a saying periodic tota, C by 3 matrix. So Lux operator L is you can write down. Okay, so this is, I think Fuzz coordinate. I don't know, V1, V2, V3. Then you put A1, A2, and the 11. So it's like a constant style. Then you put the side. Constant style, then you put some parameter Z, and then you have A3 and Z inverse. So you have this L, L depends on spectral parameter Z, but then you always you consider L minus, say, Z lambda I, right? Okay, then you got the spectral curve, the lambda Z dependency, right? So this one, okay, if you calculate, you will get that here. But if you calculate, you will get that here. P of lambda is determinant of this guy with some extra time. But essentially, that does not depend on z and plus or minus plus maybe. So this is z plus a1, a2, a3 over z. So that's equals there. That gives you that. This is hyper elliptic curve and genus 2. So rank of the matrix actually gives you. The matrix actually gives you genus two. Then now, okay, okay, so genus, okay, anyway. So, genus two, meaning right here, right? So, you can easily construct this one from this spectral card. So, this is a hyper uptake. You have a three cuts, right? And this is just a square it. So, you just make the some sphere with three holes. The three holes, then you prepare another one, right? And you get the glue together, then you start pinch. So pinch is the one. So let's pinch here, let's pinch here. So you have like this one. Okay, so this picture is not precise. So there are two singular points. Then you do the designularization. What is called a normalization? So in this case, you take. So, in this case, you take two points together, two points together, so you get the nodal singularity. And that is actually here, and you have a two p1, p2 point. And so those are my singular things. And then you can actually map the pi, and then normalization tells you that the two points actually you identify. So maybe I should say. So, those two points you can realize here. So, this I call the view. Here, so this I call the B1C1 and B2C. You see those things, right? So this map is actually called the normalization map, and pi inverse actually identify B1, C1 together, you get this one, and B2C, you get this here. Okay, so this is the basic insight, and then we like to see how this quasi-bedding solution ends up to solidarity. Okay, so one more data I'd like to give you. Data I like to give you. So maybe this is enough. Well, so many people know the elliptic solution, that's a genus one, right? Genus one is just the equation. And genus two is just one more times, yeah. So this is genus two. But this is very bad, right? So it's not precise, it's not mathematical. Okay, so what you do. Mathematical. Okay, so what you do is reality, all the interaction is non-linear, right? So you have to amend something. Okay, so reality, you get phase shift. You get the phase shift. You get the phase shift, you get the phase shift, right? So of course, I'm writing this phase shift. Of course, you can write this phase shift as well. But there are two types of phase shift up here. That's also you see. All right, then those quests actually. All right, then those crests actually become like here, right? So this one becomes like here, then this is a famous hexagon all up here. And now, when you take a limit, what do you really see? This is this line you see, the two lines intersecting, and that's one possibility. Two, sorry, tone solution. It's just no interaction, just a phase shift. But the other Action just a pay shift, but the other choice is here. Okay, so for example, if you take a look at here, and this is really resonance, and this actually boom into the dissolution, and this is the resonance solution. This is called Y type. And this is actually coming from Grassman 1.3. So, why we have Grassman 1.3? I'll tell you the more detail. And this portion is upside down. Portion is upside down, but they live in a different cells. So this leaves were small, two, three, right? And that's it. So you can't see any. So if you start with Kp soyton, then try to get some periodic solution. So what I'm suggesting is you prepare two, right? Then you just connect, then you get this picture, the periodic extensions. Yeah. Okay. And actually, why we have two? actually why we have two great one three glass mod one three okay so this is uh toda actually you have a two tau function in this case rank two meaning you have a two tau function and each tau function is coming from like this one right so in the third term limit so if you work on the limiting one just s3 to that right that's actually gives in flag flag variety which is flag variety which is SL3 over model subgroup and actually you can do the embedding to the this is called the diagonal embedding one three and cross Rosman two three right so Rosman one three actually take care this guy Rosman two three take care that guy and you see this so this is a story and this one oh all the picture is gone now Oh, the picture is gone now. Can I see the picture behind? Yeah, so this is genus four, they claim. But the essential genus is actually three. And there are a lot of resonance. So its meaning is here. So original one is like this, and maybe small phase shapes. But total case, actually, you will not get this one. You get only this type. Because size. Type because size is three, you cannot go four. If you have two, you get that, you need to have Russian two, four to get the disclosed. Okay, so this is the genus too, which means you don't have another time scale, but that's really that the bushinesque. The bushinesque has resonant solution. So, all the things is inside. Okay, let's go. Yeah, I don't think I. Let's go. Yeah, I don't think I have more time. Okay, so now next page, please. Oh, I can do it. Okay. Oh, I go skip. Okay, so this is the contents of my talk. So first I just remind you what is the element theta function. This is the elementary setting. There's nothing to do with algebraic curve or anything. Just usually define. And also, this is a single one. Then next was M data. Then next was M theta function. The M stands for Manford. Manford is, I believe, the first one to write the theta function on singular variety. And that's why I said m data function. And also, if you take the double cover, then you get the print data function. That's also explained. And also, this formula happened to be the very nice formula using vertex operator. Formula using vertex operator and that's is not the usual vertex operator the integral system people use so you'll see but then i just of the do the review of kp solutions and then you'll see what kind of pattern you can get okay then the next one is the applications so first soyton gas is phase shift so so bunch of lines now you have like a g soton so you You have like a G-solute translation means you have a G-phase, right? And each one is a cross-section that take a cross-section. And then you assign what kind of phase shift you give. So if you give the random phase shift, you have randomness in that picture. And maybe the second one saying the so you don't just pattern the what random pattern. So this one is the stationary patterns. It's nothing interesting. But if you have Nothing interesting, but if you hire genus, all the patterns change just like we saw in the picture. Then you have to recognize which pattern appear often. Or in some sense, you give the measure, right? You get the weight, then you just do the ensemble, then try to find what pattern is most likely. So that's the okay. So those are very, very elementary. I'm just talking. Elementary, I'm just talking, and there are no concrete results yet, so I'm sorry. Okay, so let's start. So, lemon data function, and everybody knows this is the sum of exponential 2 pi i, then particular things m is a g-dimensional integer, the vector, and mt is a transpose, then omega is g by g, symmetric matrix, and imaginary part of omega is positive. So, it's really mean. So it's really means any real vector, you that what the what's called the make the inner product, then the imaginary part is always positive. And that's what it means. All right, so you prepare these things, and this is not KP yet. This is just the general theta function setting. Then we have to identify what is omega, what is z, and of course, it's hard problem is now. Problem is now just satisfy the KP equation, then you need to find the relation among the period matrix. B cos omega cos period matrix. And there are a lot of things you have to work out. This is just a very formal. So next one, the summous compact surface, there uses the homological cycles A and B, and omega 1 and omega ch is a normalized homologic difference. Normalized the homomorphic differentials, not the very standard textbook stuff. And then the normalized meaning is omega j is just delta ij over a cycle. A B cycle, you get the period of it. And you can draw like this picture. Okay, now the pinch. So mount actually constructed the theta function as a single card C of this is a geometric genus zero. So originally you start from genus G. You start from G n G, then pinch all the handle to make the one point, and then you resolve two points, and that's process is here. So you have the normalization called the pie map, and that is identification. Okay, so those are all written in the Manfold famous book, start a lecture, second volume. And then this is a kind of picture. You have that cycle, a cycle pinch. So you have a So you have the one maybe pick the residue, and the other one gives you some integral from Bj to Cj. So you just cook the all the homomorphic differential after you pinch. The homophic differential becomes, of course, metamorphic, and even that becomes sad kind, not the first kind anymore. And that's easy because, for example, And that's easy because, for example, it's a square, right? You pinch, then it becomes a square, then you take a square root. So, normal the holomorphic differential you write down right here. So, this is okay. So, for example, hype by f t case, you have some x minus something, right? So, or the say j is something, then you put together, then you get the okay, y over some polynomial of x, dx, right? So, that's the homomorphic one. So that's a homomorphic one, but this becomes now just the x minus lambda degenerate one. So those that appear. And you see. Okay, so this is the omega j goes here. And they have a z minus v j, z minus c j. And after limit, you get this nice formula. I think many people recognize this is actually the This is actually the coefficient when you change the vertex operator. So, vertex operator, you write down in the normal ordering, then you get the just factor. So, what I'm saying is, oh, go back. Oh, did I push? Okay, so this picture, this one, right? You can see the description. Okay, and now the before, so if you take the So, if you take the just limit of this theta function, oh, maybe, yeah, okay, let's go here. Okay, so if you don't make a shift, then you take a pinch. Type functions become just one. There is a boring solution, right? But if you shift, then you get a lot of. And this is again very familiar formula. Okay, so after you shift, then theta. shift then theta function becomes here and shift appear mj mj minus one then you have a choice choice now either zero or one right after you take omega j goes to infinity then of course you get this formula and this is the famous kida g solton solution and i didn't specify what is g j and so on but a gj actually gives you the phase okay so this is two to g times and So, this is 2 to z times, and this certain solution, if you put in some gj in that some x, y, t coordinate, then they are just lined with phase shift. So nothing happened like a resonance. And how the resonance occur? And as I told you, this is a phase shift. You put something infinity, this goes straight. And that's the process you see. Okay, so now the remark is now I just say it. So Kp. I just say it so Kp equation: if you choose the 2πi gj, that's pj n times minus qj to the power n times tn. And that is actually the vertex operator up here. Okay, but in terms of the Grassmania or classification of the Kp solute, this is the smallest non-trivial solution. There are a lot of solutions actually appear. A lot of solutions actually appear. And this first one is kind of boring. Those line, line, line, and phase shift, that's it. There are no patterns in a sense. Okay, so second one. Now you can write down, okay, so maybe, yeah, okay, so just remember: set of G has the vertex operator, the interpretation. Okay, so this is again the Okay, so this is again that you you see that this phase factor, right? Okay, so the what I'm saying is the resonance occur if this becomes zero, right? So omega j k becomes plus infinity in the imaginary direction. Then you start see the resonance. All right, and the third one, this formula also you can put in the gramian. So gramian is actually the key. Grammy is actually the key to connect the tau function, what I'm going to construct in terms of Ronsky N, and just go to Grammy. There are many works, but keep tracking the total non-negativity is not easy. But I start from total non-negative or regular solutions solution. You can directly get this Gravian form. All right, so then also you consider double cover. Also, you consider double cover, so you prepare the two omega, I mean the differential, the third kind, actually coming from the first kind, and then you get the Papyan form. So it's the same data by choosing different period matrix, you get a lot of expressions. The one is the determinant, otherwise popular. All right, then we have another KP. All right, then we have it now. KP is already done. This is just a review. I think I have enough time. Yeah. Okay, so KP equation: I pick the coefficient minus four, six, and three. And then you can have the nice equations. So first you prepare Fj, the L set of the the independent solution of the linear system. So that's something called heat hierarchy or something, right? The heat hierarchy was right. So, this is just a linear equation. Then you put in F1 to Fn, you take your own skin in terms of first X derivative. Then that tau actually solves the Kp equation. And of course, this is not the general solution, but this is many solutions you can pick. And so the solution is actually coming from this formula, by particular choice of F, a function. So that is, I think, means. So that is, I think, easy. Okay, so now take the some n by n matrix Aij, and that's coming from totally non-negative, the graph minion. The meaning is, okay, so A is n by m, n is smaller than m, then you calculate all the maximal minor, n by n minor, choosing any set of n column vector of the a matrix, then you calculate minor. They call it minor. If the minor is non-negative, and that is called totally non-negative, they cross minor. And that's it, right? Okay, and also we fix A to be the reduced equation form. So that's unique, remember. Okay, so and also maybe that you hear the irreducibility. So irreducibility meaning is the Grassmann N M. Sometimes some matrix is inside of N M, like say n minus one m. Like say n minus one, and also fit, and so in this case, you are losing some columns or you're losing some rows. So, this is saying no zero column and no, which has only pivot. And if you have another one, it's okay. So, if only pivot, then you can always factor out and reduce the size of glass mining. Okay, then tau function is just the long scale. Is just the Wronskian form turns out determinant of this one. So E is exponential C1 and CJ is just kappa JX, Kappa J square Y, Kappa J cubed T. So this is a pretty explicit formula. Okay. So now the Abina Co C actually you can expand it. You got two matrix n by n times n by n you just expand it, then you get the disposable. So there's a MA, it's called matroid. That is the integer, M set of integer, you choose N, the subset, and then you calculate minor, and it's all the minor is non-zero, in this case, a positive, and that's called MA. So there's a smallest one, and the next one, you can do the rectangle graphical order. The smallest one is all taking the pivots. All right, so that's the form. All right, so that's the formula, and we have the sum of exponentials. So exponential is just the sum of Ci1 to CIN. Okay, so this actually guarantees that the tau function is sine definite. Actually, in this case, the positive. Then any solution is regular. So this necessary condition is fine, but it's sufficient. You can prove the back one. You can prove the button. All the regular solution must be coming from the totally non-negative gas money. All right, so that's the next one. So first lemma is now you take A, the matrix, then this parameterized by the derangement. The derangement is nothing but permutation without fixed point, that's a derangement, right? So there's a one, two, so you can. So there's a one two, so you cannot say the one two one two is just a two one. So one two three, you cannot repeat the number one two three becomes three one two or something. Okay, so the so every time you give a the irreducible matrix A, you can always parameterize by the derangement by. So now this is actually the game. So I give you the a, you get the circle solution, right? You get a certain solution, right? Then A is parametrized by the permutation. That means the solution itself is parameterized by the permutation. So random permutation means you have random patterns, random solutions. Okay, and the theorem saying, so if you calculate the Kp the solution, then it's end up like here. Okay, maybe. It ends up like here. Okay, maybe next page is better. So, all the asymptotics, you start to see a lot of lines, solitone in the y positive, a lot of solitone, y negative. And each one is actually marked by i pi i permutation. So, one soliton has the two index, and that's just permute. The next one, you permute, then you end up with this, something like okay, then go around by negative. Okay, then go around y negative, you have this. So if the image of the permutation is bigger, then this one always appears upstream. An image is less than the original one, then this soliton always appears downstream. So if you rotate around, you get a permutation. And the inside one is the most interesting one. Does all the pattern appear and y and x and the x meaning is just The X meaning is just this one, so with, and Y means like this one, all combination you can see. Okay, so example is Grassman N4. So N is one, two, three. Then what type of pattern you see is actually the first one is just one, four, and one, two, two, two, three, three, four. So this kind of bifurcate. Okay, and that's it. Okay, so now that A is coming from Grassman. That A is coming from grass 14. So one soliton upstairs, right? And three soliton downstairs is exactly like you. And you can have a code, it's called a core diagram, which represents the derangement or permutation. And that's the sign, I said, 4, 1, 2, 3. And that's the genus actually 3, not the genus 4. This phase is 4, but genus 3. Because of the resonance. So n equal to Right, so n equals to now. You have this is top cell of the Grossman 2.4. That means all the parameter you can put it in on the star mark. Then there are a lot of parts up here. Like first one looks like that one. And that's, I think you have seen already in that's the original, I mean, the first picture I showed. And the B also here. Okay, so another interesting thing is those are just a part of. Those are just a part of it. So, this guy actually appears over there in the right-hand side. This part is there, the same thing. And this part is left-hand side, and they extend negatively. So, all the other, the smaller cell is actually coming from the big one. So, if you have big, I mean the top cell, the solution, then you just do the Then you just do the periodic extension. Then you start to see the flux structure. And that is one of the things. So all things are just listed. So this case, you have seven different patterns we can get. So last month, something four, then you can, oh, sorry, this case more. Seven, eight, nine, nine cases. Right. Then we have now, okay, so now connection to. Okay, so now connection to the theta function. So we have the mampod theta function. Now I told you what the tau function from total non-negative cells. So there's a direct connection. So first things is that you just normalize by the first member that's coming from lexicographically minimum set. So that is delta IZ equals one. Oh, sorry, that's not E, A, right? A, right? The mistake. So delta I0 A, not E, right? That is one. Because this is showing just you correct the pivot. So A matrix, okay here, pivot, Pivot, Pivot, right? They you pick this one. This is actually minimum. Then take a determinant, that becomes one. Okay, so that mistake. And then you can normalize it. Then you can start from one plus. You can start for one plus something. So at least this is a looks like Gramian. But now you have to deal with those delta IA and how the delta IA decomposed. Okay, so the main things is I read here. So you have a normalization map, right? So singular point two divots, the singular, I mean, okay. So this precise statement is compactly massive. Precise statement is compact Liemann surface. Then you map into the singular one. And compact Liemann surface we have is just a Liemann sphere. And two points start identify by doing normalization map. So you have a singular point and you have to identify B and C. And that B and C can we read from here. And that's the whole point. So Serial saying the type function I have is actually equal to have is actually equal to the data function. So you have to choose xyt from the z and what is the period matrix. You can compute from here. Okay, so this is the idea. So g tilde, that's a possible the genus. And this turns out the okay, you take the matrix I, so that's it's saying non-zero minus. So you have a lot of non-zero minus, and that's appear in tau function. Tau function, you expect. function right power function you expand and non-zero minor is a coefficient of exponential those coefficients is the index of the coefficient is just i and the intersection between i and minimum one is only one. So this gives a permutation. One index changes other index. And that structure is just happened to be like here. So for example, you take the A matrix, this is pure. A matrix. This is pivot. This is a pivot. This is a pivot, right? Then you have non-zero element here, non-zero element here, and so on. And then you start count. This is the first one, this is the second one. You have n1. And then next line, you get n1 plus 1, then n1 plus n2. Now you know how to count, right? Okay, so this is just counting and just labeling. Okay, so once you did these things, then Then now you have phi that is two pi i z. I have to remind you, right? 2 pi i z I call phi j. That is actually phij, right? Okay, so j index, you have a lot of stuff. The g k minus one hat plus l. This is simply, I'm counting the first law. The first law, you have N1 many, second law, you have N2 mini, and just other, and that is GK minus 1. So GK minus 1 is N1 plus N2 plus up to NK minus 1. Then you have another L is from 1 to NK. And that's the numbering. And this is the case row. Then people is IK, then you just take it. So this is a whole scheme. So, this is a whole scheme. So, I identify the GJ. So, I publish J. Right now, you have to identify what is B and C. So, this is a map. So, normalization. So, we have the here, B and C that goes to one point P, right? So, B and C, then normalization map actually identify two points. identified two point so b and c you have to identify so b and c is coming from kappa k kappa j l k right so that's a number okay so we are almost done now you just compute the coefficient of the what exponential or this period matrix okay so period matrix just compute like this cjl is easy to pi i o another mistake yeah that's okay Yes, okay. So yeah, last night I was a bit tired. So 2πi, this omega. Okay. This year. Sorry, not C, C dp. Okay, so then this is a coefficient. Then, okay, so there are some numbers K and M and K dot prime M prime that you can write down this one. This is already given. Okay, then it's done. Let's go to the example. So first example. So, first example is Hilta force origin solution. So, which means you have a pivot one, two, five, six, five, seven. So, okay, pivot in terms of derangement is one, two, five, seven. And upstairs, you always go this way. One goes to four, two go to three, five go to six, seven go to eight. That is the computation, right? So eight go back to seven, six go back here. Six go back here, yeah. What you can do? This is called the secret code, and then this is actually saying no crossing type. So there are a bunch of non-crossing, the what, the derangement, and that is actually a catalytic number. So the Hirota's formula appeared so many years ago, and Norman crash points or typed Hirota form. What type of heroes are formed? It turns out they cut down the many possible configurations. And that's all coming from combinatorics. Okay, the next example is this one. This one we saw already. This is a permutation is one was three, two goes to four, three equals one, so three, four, one, two. That's a permutation, right? So in this case, now I can identify the B and C. Identify the B and C. So first one, B1 is kappa one. I'm reading here. So kappa one, kappa C. This is B1, this is C1. And this is B2, this is C2. B3, C3, B4, C4. And those all coming from here. Phi one, I just marked you, one, three. And next wide, there are three, sorry, one, three, one, four. Next wide. Next slide, the two, three, two, four, right? I wrote down everything here. Okay, now you calculate the all the what the intersection number or intersection coefficient. Then one, two, one, two, because of the common here, B1 and B2 is common. That's become zero. Immediately, you can see. One, three is kappa three. So C1, C3 is common, right? So that's why, because there. Common, right? So that's why it goes here. Then 2-4 also, 2-4 is 4-4. That's easier. And 3-4, 3-4 is 2-2 is common. That's zero. So there's six, the what's different? Because 4-2-2, right? Six intersection point, then only two points left. Okay, so now, what are those? Actually, here, for example, here is one, three, coefficient is zero, that's why you get. zero that's why you get the y junction here and this is t four that's why you get the y and this is one two here and three four here and okay one four is not zero because one and four has no intersection and two three also two three this might intersect but at the herototype just small phase shift as they just go through and that's the the picture so you you get all the So you get all the ingredients here, then you just go back. So what can you see? So that's red, the blue one, blue one, red one, red one, and that is just like one section. And seems like this one is a periodic extension of just mark blue, red, blue, red, and this just the tiling up, the periodic tiling, then you get this picture. And even you can recognize what is a blue one, what's the red one. What is the blue one? What is the red one? I just do the exercise. So it's a okay, you got the pattern, then you do the periodic extension, then you get the flag structure, then you get that the mumped data function. Then you can see a lot of the patterns up here. So that is the at so now the possible model of the KP surface. So first one. So first one is here G so it's and forget all the resonance is nothing is a resonant that means just a crossing with a small then you can see that what one has signs right for example there's a four lines yeah then you have now say this one two three four and one two you have she one two which is not zero but you have the positive sorry this case is Sorry, this case is bigger than one or less than one. And that is very important. So, this is phase is actually decreasing, but phase is increasing. So, positive phase and negative phase all appear by calculating C12 here. Then this one is C13. And this is C14. You calculate, of course, you cannot put in totally random. There are some restrictions, but you can. Restrictions, but you can put a certain amount of randomness, input those points, then they just evolve. Then you start to calculate what is invariant and what is the measure, and there are a lot of things that you can do. So the hint I got here is many people, not many people, some people working on one-dimensional soliton gas. So you have a random soliton is here, then you send it, this is just. You send it, then it's just jump, jump, jump, or something. But the KDB has only one sign, the phase shift. So this is negative phase shift or positive phase which way. But that's not really interesting. So one dimension, you have a plus, minus, plus, plus, plus, so it don't actually start bending or something. But if you do that two-dimensional pattern, it's quite rich. There are a lot of things. Right, there are a lot of things within here. Okay, the next one is: I say the so each solitone solution, I mean the Kp soliton solution is parametrized by the permutation, right? So you give the random permutation, then you get the random solitons, and that's each Grossman solution. But you need a flux structure to put all together, then you have many, many. So this is how it's going. This is how it's got. I am embedding the flag into the product of just mining. And those are tau 1, tau 2, tau 3, you consider all of them. And this is almost a periodic structure here. So each one doesn't have, but you can do patching and making tiles. Then you see a lot of patterns inside. And then you do kind of statistics. So several people are doing that, like I said, you put some sure measure on certain. On certain permutation or even kind of young diagram. This case is not young diagram, but it's even more. It's called the Lay diagram, decorated the Young diagram. Then you just prepare for random things, right? Then you can do the statistics. Okay, so this is, I think, about it. Yeah, okay, so one more. So this is the final comment. So I was taking the The diagonal part of the period matrix going to infinity, take all of them. But if you take only some of them, not all of them. And then the first part, the taking limit one, you can recognize as the vertex operator. So this is saying, so I pinch L many, or ideal set, J say one to L, then you have this part. And if you don't pinch, you left out here. pinch you left out here and then this omega n is a smaller size g by g g minus n by g minus n the period matrix and they keep the similar structure the most difficult part of this why whether this function satisfy kp or not of course you really have to work hard that uh i think the dajun zhang worked so hard to give the explicit formula Express formula. So if you have the genus one, of course, elliptic the function up here, then he calls elliptic soliton. Those, I think, has the genus structure like this one. So in terms of vertex operator, it's much nicer. And a recent work by Nakayashiki, and he actually approved a couple of months ago this scheme. And he is using the Sato Ross Many. The set of verse minion theory to prove this tar function, this data actually satisfies the KP. So, normally, of course, you have to go through the short KP program and then identify a lot of the conditions. But here, I just telling you the general structure, maybe like this. Okay, so maybe that's the end.
