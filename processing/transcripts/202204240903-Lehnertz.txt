It's great to have you back for our Sunday session. Our first speaker is Klaus Linas today. He's joining us from Germany and he's going to talk about evolving functional brain networks with epilepsy as an example. Please, Taus, go ahead. Okay, thanks, Jorn. And good morning, everybody. For me, it's almost night. Yeah, as Jorn already mentioned, I will talk about evolving functional brain networks. And I will take epilepsy as an example. And just let me briefly give some brief introduction into what. Give some brief introduction into what is actually epilepsy. This is basically the oldest disease that is known to mankind, and roughly at the moment, 1% of the world population suffers from this disease. Epilepsy is typically characterized by some kind of strange event, which is called the seizure, which is also then the Greek term from epilepsy, where people behave kind of strange, but that's it. And typically, some That's it, and typically, some seizure like this that lasts for a couple of minutes. Um, question is: why do I consider epilepsy as a model disease for network research? There are many aspects going in this direction. The first one is that there was a paradigm shift almost something like 25 years ago, where people had the former idea that epilepsy originates from a specific region, so-called epileptic focus from the brain, if it's a focal epilepsy. And this concept has been challenged already. Concept has been challenged over the last 25 years, and today the International League Against Epilepsy, this is this abbreviation here, considers in general epilepsy as a network disease. And what we are talking about now is the so-called epileptic network. What is not clearly defined as exactly the same as with the epileptic focus, an epileptic network, we have to consider different spatial scales, but also temporal scales. I will come back to this. The good news here is that, good news in quotes, of course, that. Good news in quotes, of course, that if we study the dynamics of the human epileptic brain, we have many, many advantages. We have a coexistence of the physiological states, the many physiological states, and also the pathophysiological states. That is not just the state, but also the brain tissue. So we have brain tissue that reacts normal, but it could also react abnormal. We have this spontaneous state transitions into and out of this extreme. Into and out of this extreme event seizure. And what is also most importantly, and this is also for network research: once we have invasive recordings from pre-surgical candidates, we can go from the microscope down to the microscale. That means we can measure basically the gross electrical activity of the brain, and we even can go down to the single neuron level. This is something that we are currently doing, not in combination. Combination. So, that requires some time in order to set up the whole system, but at least we have already some kind of data and going in this direction. Most important is that this is if we talk about EG recordings, so the electroencephalogram, we can go for continuous multi-day and multi-channel recordings. And this is, of course, important if we're talking about evolving networks. Here we can assess data that is typically covered over weeks, if in some cases, even months. Cases, even months. We also have, as it's typically in human, then also interaction with the disease-related issues with the higher cognitive functions like cognition or memory or whatever is of interest here. And of course, there are many, many aspects going in the direction of prediction, control, modeling, and many, many more. The problem is, of course, now, how can we infer the networks of this brain? And the typical example, if we go for a structure, and I think this is something that Go for structure, and I think this is something that you heard already many times during this conference. If we go for the small scale, we can consider nodes as neurons and edges or links as the synapses between neurons or other cells. So it's not necessarily that we can talk about neurons because there are many diseases and also the normal functioning is also subserved by the glia cell, which is typically not considered in many cases. Direct access to the small scale is hard, at least. Hard, at least the question of single neurons, maybe not all of them, but maybe in the future, a fair amount of them. And also the measurement of what is going on on the synapses or the visualization of synapses. This is something that can be done probably in the near future. And then we have a gap. The medium scale is typically not assessed. Why? This is not clear. Maybe we don't have the techniques for this, but still there is this medium scale gap. On the other hand, This medium-scale gap. On the other hand, if we go for the large-scale recordings, there's, of course, many, many techniques available. We consider typically nodes as brain regions and links, then some kind of fiber bundles. And this is something that can be quite easily assessed with high-resolution MRI, with DTI, and all these different techniques. You probably know these nice figures here where you can show or visualize the fiber bundles coming from DTI measurements, but it's something that is mostly missing in. That is mostly missing in these data here is namely that the DTI is not able to visualize the fibers that run perpendicular to the in parallel to the cortical surface, which is most of the connections that we have. And this is something that is still not solved. So what you basically have here is just some part of the connection structure of the brain. And the most important one is missing. If we go for function, then it's a little bit easier. Then it's a little bit easier, although it's not clear what we are talking here about, what is actually now the function, and how can we assess this. Again, on the small scale, we can go down to the single neuron or the gliodynamics. And then if we talk about the links, we can talk about some kind of synaptic interactions. I mentioned here in brackets, other they could be electrical interactions, it could be chemical interactions, it could be any kind of interaction between different brain regions. Again, we have. Again, we have this medium scale gap, and then we can only go up to the large scale. And large scale is now that we consider the nodes, which are then typically associated with some kind of sensors. And sensors could be some kind of an electrode, as it's, for example, done here with the EG or with some intracranial EG or with the SQUID systems. If we go for MEG. And also, if we talk about fMRI, we consider a node as a voxel for. Consider a node as a voxel, for example. Yeah, what are the links in these cases? These are basically interactions that we need to somehow measure, and this is then the way we then set up weighted and or directed networks, or if we do some kind of thresholding, then also binary networks. And for this, we need, of course, then time series analysis techniques. And yeah, the issue is, of course, how can we assess couplings in the brain? What is typically done, and this is also something What is typically done, and this is also something that is being used in electrophysiology or in neurophysiology, is typically the probing. So you perturb the system, let it relax, and then look at the relaxation phenomenon, what is then called an evoked potential or an event-related potential. And some people then say, okay, we can learn something from this. The issue here is that you need to do some repeated measurements. It's not just easy to identify single traces. In some cases, it is possible. It depends on the experiment that you. Is possible, it depends on the experiment that you do, but you typically end up with a very limited number of data points. And some people also say that is this really the true dynamics that we are talking here about? If you can't probe, you do basically an observation, and this is then related to some kind of time series analysis of the ongoing activity. And here we have, of course, also some big clash, namely the oscillatory view versus the one over F brain view. So basically, brain. F brain view, so basically brain noise. And yeah, the question is: what means more? What is better in these cases here? In this case, we have, of course, then a large amount of data that we can analyze. We need to take care again about non-stationarity. And we might have a large amount of endogenous and exogenous drivers. And this is something that has mostly been forgotten, actually, in the field of network research: that many people actually do not take into account that there are. Actually, do not take into account that there are something like rhythms that are also effective. And most people only just consider very, very short time scales, typically in the order of a few seconds, to make some claims about brain dynamics. The issue here is that we need to get some characteristics of couplings. And what we would like to typically have is the strength of the coupling, the direction of the coupling, the coupling function. And this, then everything. And this, then everything in some kind of temporally and spatially resolved spatially and temporally resolved, highly resolved matter. And of course, as recently shown, we also would like to go for higher order interactions in order to get rid of the many, many problems that are still not clear how this can be handled if we talk about functional brain networks. If you ask what is good, there is nothing that is actually good. We have a large amount of Good. We have a large amount of these different time series analysis techniques ranging from statistical approaches down to something that is based on the Crammos-Muial expansion, where people try to understand even interactions in stochastic systems. What you need to do, take into account is you would need to have some kind of a Swiss army knife in order to assess everything that you would like to have. But this is exactly the issue of what needs to be done already before on what kind of aspect. Before, on what kind of aspect do you concentrate here? Do you believe in the oscillatory view, or do you believe in the brain noise view? Then you need to have different types of time series analysis techniques to assess different aspects of the dynamics, different synchronization phenomena that are known. Many, many more details coming from the dynamics. Also, what needs to be taken into account is robustness if we go for real-world measurements. Take into account that the strengths and the direction of the current. That the strengths and the direction of the coupling is typically something that is not assessed within the same technique. It comes from the same class, but we typically find different types of analysis techniques that only assess the strengths or only assess the direction. And the question is, of course, how good are these techniques in order to really identify these different characteristics of a coupling? And the same, of course, holds for the coupling function. If you look at techniques that have been developed to identify coupling functions. To identify coupling functions, as far as I know, there's something going on in the direction of phase relationships, but that's all. And yeah, many of these techniques that I mentioned here also need to be taken into account that we have, of course, that large computing times, and particularly if we want to go for field data analysis, this is something that needs to be taken into account. And then the final issue is the interpretation or interpretability. What you read typically in the literature, people talk about Typically, in the literature, people talk about direction of couplings, they typically talk also about causality, and this is something that I would not touch in these cases because there are too many, many confounders, be it direct versus indirect interactions, or if you talk about the EEG, the impact of common sources and many other aspects that would need to be taken into account here. If you do a comparison between, let's say in this case, here, a phase-based approach or information theoretical approaches, this is data here. Approaches. This is data here that we have analyzed from 35 patients. On average, 114 hours of EG recording, and we only consider the data from the seizure-free interval. If we are measuring the strengths of interactions between different functional modules, and we are talking here about now the clinically defined epileptic focus and its neighborhood and other brain region, what you typically find is some kind of gradient that the highest strength is, of course, within the epileptic focus, and then it grades. Epileptic focus and then it gradually degrades if you go far away. Similar pattern can be achieved with this information theoretical approaches. Also, again, on average over a large group, and you see that there are strong correlations between these different approaches. So it is basically Argusto. If you say this is better or that is better, it depends on the application that you have. The same holds for the direction. This is exactly the same finding that we have here. So interactions between the different functional modules, between the focus and nature. Functional modules between the focus and neighborhood, others. And what you typically find is that each of these structures appears as a driver. There is nothing like there is actually a responder. And this is something that should make you nervous because where is the responder in these cases? Something that is still unsolved. And I think that goes back to the issue of direct and indirect and also of higher order interactions. It would need to be assessed in order to get rid of all these problems here. So coming back to evolving brain networks. So, coming back to evolving brain networks, what do we know already in these cases about epilepsy? There are lots of observations where people have shown that the epileptic brain networks differs clearly from the non-epileptic one. And this is not just the structure and also not the function, but this is something that can be observed on various scales. This is, of course, something that is to be expected. That if you have some kind of a malstructure or a malformation in the brain that is then also related to some malfunction, that there Related to some malfunction, that there should be some kind of a difference. The good news is you can measure this. And this is, of course, for diagnosis, of course, something quite strongly interesting. We also know that cognition can modify evolving brain networks and not just in the normal human brain, but it can also modify the evolving epileptic brain network. And this is, as it turns out, And this is, as it turned out, it was capacity dependent in the epileptic brain network. And this is then, of course, something that can also be considered if we go in the direction of control of these networks. If you look at what is going on during seizures, there had been claims that the epileptic brain is something like a small world network. We don't have this indication for this. What we find is that the epileptic brain, if you do this in some kind of a time-resolved manner, you find that the Manner, you find that the brain network is assortative, so it's harder to synchronize, less vulnerable against attack. And this is also something that is known from the clinical setting, namely that if you want to control these brain, or if the seizure is already starting, you have no chance to do this. So you need something that needs to be done quite prior to the seizure. And this is also something this is an ongoing research for almost 20 years now, or more than 20 years, where people try to understand why this. Where people try to understand why it is actually the beginning of the seizure. Where does it start? Why does it start? What is the mechanism that leads to the seizure? But the same also holds for why does seizure stop. This is also something that is not clear. Typically, as physicists, we would consider the idea that there is something like energy depletion, but if you measure energy depletion during the seizure, you find nothing. There is no energy depletion. So, what we observed here is that the What we observed here is that the really a counterintuitive example, namely that the network synchronization increases prior to the seizure end. So that means that this increase of synchronization is probably a mechanism for seizure termination. So you need to have a specific amount of basically in-phase behavior in the brain in order to stop the seizure. If this is true, this is not clear right now. This is just an observation. Clear right now. This is just an observation. There's still this ongoing discussion about the epileptic focusing, coming back to this old concept. Is this probably some kind of a central node in the epileptic brain network? And this is something that cannot be observed. You can observe this quite rarely. Interestingly, you can't even observe this during the seizure. During the seizure, the classical epileptic focus is one of these nodes that is highly irrelevant if you consider this in terms of centrality. Consider this in terms of centrality, for example. Yeah, and then, of course, then, and this is one of the reasons why you can't really tell is the epileptic focus a central node or not. It depends on the time scale that you are looking at. And if you take the long-term network dynamics, you see that there's a really a strong influence of many physiological rhythms. And this is something that I would like to come back in a minute. Just briefly, precede state: what is the current knowledge here, what we have observed. Here, what we have observed in many data here from almost 40 subjects and in a large amount of seizures from continuous recordings that lasted over weeks. What we see is that there is something like the pre-seizure state is characterized like a network reconfiguration, reconfiguration in the sense that if you look at important structures, again, we talk about here about functional modules, if we consider their interactions directed and indirect. Directed and the strengths of interaction, depending on which kind of centrality you observe, you see different types of network reconfigurations, namely, depending on who is basically the first structure that generates a possible precursor and where does it evolve to. And this is somehow summarized here: namely, that most of the precursors that you can observe in this in the epileptic brain is not from. Epileptic brain is not from the seizure-generating structure, but it's basically somewhere in the normal tissue. And then over time, you see this gradually increasing influence towards the epileptic focus. And what is going on during that time scale here is that the apparent structures that are still there and nothing happens effectively lead basically to some kind of a formation of bottlenecks. And this is probably one of. This is probably one of the mechanisms underlying the generation of seizures. The big problem here is that if the pre-seizure state is not being generated in the structure that is typically presumed to be the seizure generator, but it's somewhere off. And if you want to do some kind of control, you would need, of course, then go into these structures. But this is then something that is not easy to perform because in these cases, Uh, to perform because, in these cases, you would need to do some kind of a perturbation of the normal brain tissue, and this is, of course, something that most people would not consider. But this is an ongoing discussion. Coming back to this long-term dynamics, if you look at data that has been published on long-term dynamics of epileptic brain networks, what you see is mostly that you have an up and down of some metric. So, that leads for the, for example, here for the cluster coefficient and for the path lengths, what you see is depending on the What you see is depending on the time of day that you are measuring something, you might have an indication for the small worldness of these brain networks. But if you take the data an hour later, it completely disappears. And this is mostly due to the fact that we have a very strong influence here of the circadian rhythm around 24 hours and also for shorter rhythms. And interestingly, this is now something, and we will go into details later. This is something the 12-hour or even shorter time. A 12-hour or even shorter time scale, so the ultradine rhythms. This is something that is highly location-specific and depends on what you're actually doing. Interestingly, if you are considering, for example, the Glamour's Mural coefficients in order to characterize or derive a model for the EEG, then it depends on the time of day, which is actually a good model that you can take. So, this is actually something that is not easy. The same holds for if you measure, for example, centrality of different brain regions. Of different brain regions. You see again this up and down, and here some list of many other characteristics, not just the centralities, but also the assortativity and many other characteristics that show a typical clear-cut indication of an influence of exogenous and endogenous rhythms. And that brings me now to this impact of something that would need to be taken into account, that there is an impact. This is known for more than 50 years. And we have different. And we have different rhythms that extend over 11 orders of magnitude. And the most studied one is, of course, the circadian rhythm. And this is something that is clearly defined. We know how this looks like, but this is only something that has an impact on brain oscillations. But what about the general brain dynamics? If you study the literature, you find nothing. If you ask for interactions between different brain regions, how these are being affected by biological rhythms, nothing. And if you go for brain networks, even And if you go for brain networks, even this is something that is completely missing. Here's an example from two dated subjects: a male subject, no epilepsy. We did some scalp recording over seven days. And here's another subject that has epilepsy. We implanted electrodes here in these cases, and we have a recording that lasted for 14 days. So we have continuous data lasting for several days. And what we did now was that we used a moving window analysis. Was that we used a moving window analysis? We subdivided the continuous data into 20 seconds segments. And then for each of these segments, we estimated many, many matrix, for example. So in this case, we studied some kind of univariate approaches, for example, statistical moments. In order to check many of the assumptions that you do, if you apply many other techniques like the data is Gaussian distributed, does this really hold? So look at how the variance, the skewness, and the quota. How the variance, the skewness, and the kurtosis change over time. We studied bivariate approaches. So we looked for pairwise estimates for the strengths of interactions. And here we use the phase-based approach and the classical Pearson correlation coefficient, something that is also known in the field of network research as functional connectivity. And you will see later on that even this is highly dependent on what you are studying in order to find some kind of a relationship. And then also look for network approaches like the clustering code. Look for network approaches like the clustering coefficient and some centralities here, also for nodes and edges. Some recent proposals from our group for centralities of edges were also taken into account. So let's first have a look at the univariate approaches. So how the variance, the standard, the skewness and the kurtosis, how they change over time? Or what is the impact actually of different circadian rhythms? Or yeah, not circadian. Rhythms, or yeah, not circadian biological rhythms. Sorry, what is interesting here, if you look at the different recording, the dependence of the power spectrum that we estimated here from this, from the evolution of these different characteristics, how this depends on the different locations. And you see that you have mostly a stronger impact of different rhythms at front or central areas. So, if you have an impact that comes from outside, so there's the comes from outside. So the cycling of the sun, why should this not affect the whole brain? But why are some brain regions more affected than other brain regions? This is something that you can't find in the literature. So people have never thought about this. What you mostly find here is that the rhythms that act here depend also on how you record something. If you take, for example, the sculpt EG, you find is the The scalp e.g., you find a dominant rhythm also for the 24-hour cycles, but you also see then harmonics and the subharmonics and also then other rhythms that are typically classified as ultradine rhythms. If you go for an intracranial recording, you have again some very clear-cut dependence on the location, but in these cases, this is more variable, but this depends on how you implant the electrodes. But you can go down here to something like four-hour scales, but you're missing the. But you're missing the typical shorter ultradiene rhythms. It's not clear why this is the case. What you observe here, though, is that irrespective of what kind of data you have, you have always strong deviations from Gaussianity and mostly during daytime. So any kind of experiment that you would do in these cases, the red circle here, the red dot would indicate the data that you expect for Gaussianity. So any kind of measurement that you do over... Of measurement that you do, or what any kind of experiment that you do where you assume stationarity, take into account that this assumption might not be valid. If we go now for interactions, then again, you see some kind of an location-dependent effect of the different biological rhythms. And this is also quite interesting that the impact on short and long-range connections that you have is completely different. And also, something that And also, something that we have no idea right now where this comes from: it is not just a single peak that you can observe here, but there are triplets. So, something that is closely related to the circadian rhythms, but sometimes you have also peaks that show up at shorter period lengths or longer period lengths. No idea where this comes from. Also, interesting, global synchrony is weaker during nighttime. This is something that most people would not even expect because sleep. People would not even expect because sleep is always related to a higher synchrony. This is something that you find in the literature. But if you compare this with the data that you then have also during daytime, you see that this global synchronization level is much more decreased. The same also holds for the intracranial data. Also interesting here. If you look, for example, the dependence on the different estimators for interactions, if we talk about phase recognition. Interactions. If we talk about phase synchronization or you take the Pearson correlation coefficient, it is interesting to see that within the diurnal cycle, the mean phase coherence is something like three to six hours ahead of what you can observe for the Pearson correlation coefficient. This is, of course, also something that would need to be taken into account if you compare different types of experiments. As far as I know, many people do their experiments either in the morning or in the afternoon. Morning or in the afternoon, availability of systems. If you talk about fMRI systems, this is something that needs to be taken into account. And if you do repeated measurements and you ask how high is the interrator variability, you find this typically to be extremely high. The retest variability is extremely high, but nobody asks why. And one of these reasons could be a strong impact of biological rhythms. Okay, if we see already some impact here already on the interaction level, then you can, of course, Interaction level, and you can, of course, expect that you see many, many other effects also on the network level. And just in some example here, depending on how you set up the network, depending on how you define links, either by the Pearson correlation coefficient or you take the mean phase coherence and you're studying the impact of the biological rhythms, for example, here on the clustering coefficient, tremendous differences, not just for the surface EG, but also. For the surface EG, but also for the intracranial EG. And the same also holds for the different types of estimates of the vertex centralities or edge centralities. I just want to just show some examples here. I don't want to go into details, but even here, it's not just that you see these triplets, but you can also go for quartets. So you see some kind of a splitting of the power that comes from. The power that comes from the different biological rhythms. And I haven't seen this in the literature so far. We are currently running many new experiments in these directions in order to identify what is actually what and where does this come from. Okay, Jan asked me to be in time and not to go too long. I haven't talked anything about multi-layer networks or multiplex networks. And for me, this is just one reason because there are too many, many challenges that are already. Too many, many challenges that are already on the single-layer network. Node identification: what we did so far is we just assume that some sensor represents a network node. Is this really true? If we talk about links, we always assume that we have some characteristics of an interaction that we say this is some kind of a link. Is this really true? And if we talk about structure-function relationships, this is an inverse problem and that has no unique solution. This is something that we know since Helmholtz. We know since Helmholtz, but how well can we approximate this? And particularly if we go for multi-layer networks, what we would need to have is something like a method that allows us to compare networks. And for me, I am not sure if there is something like this. If you want to somehow have some kind of a metric that allows you to compare matrices of different sizes and where something like edges or links can change over time or can disappear over time. How will you compare them? Disappear over time. How will you compare these? I have asked many mathematicians and they said, hmm, no idea. There's probably one idea if you go for network surrogates. That is something that needs to be done in the future, in the near future, because there are, as far as I know, not many surrogate techniques that would you allow to at least compare the data that you have against some appropriate null models. On the other side, time series. On the other side, time series analysis. Some people say this is done. This is definitely not done, particularly if we want to go for causal relationships, if we want to go for directed networks, we need to take this into account. And this is probably not your issue, but if you take into account that many of these measurement techniques that we currently have do not give you the full access to the whole brain network, this is also something that needs to be taken into account. And then, of course, this big issue of higher order. Of course, this big issue of higher-order interactions. So, skatebridging, this is something we haven't touched yet, and this is to be done also in the next future. But I will stop here, and I'm looking forward to your questions. Thank you. Thank you, Klaus. I have to get rid of Too many screens and cameras here, but thanks for the very nice talk. We have time for questions. We have Bajit, is that a question? So I have a question. You have to speak up very loud. Thank you very much for a very nice summary at the end of your talk. I wonder, you know, the summary you make in the challenges, has it been summarized in a single paper or review paper or perspective? There are many review papers already available. The ones with the biological rhythm, this is just published last year. And good that you mentioned this. There will be another conference quite soon, end of July. No, end of September. We had to move this. There will be another workshop on inverse network dynamics where we try exactly to go in this direction, namely to see what actually can we resolve. How what actually can we resolve or what can we learn about structure if we only consider function? And we will take here into account many, many different approaches, not just people that come from the brain. Thank you. We have one question online before we go to Aaron. Michael, you want to go? Klaus, a very nice talk. I have a question. At the beginning, you mentioned that now people are considering that the onset of seizure or seizure focus is not localized. But on the other hand, you know, people do surgeries, yes, and they You know, people do surgeries, yes, and they cut out a piece of the brain, and from time to time, they do help, yeah. So, so you know, you don't cut the whole brain out. So, so, how this can be connected, those two things? The point is you disrupt something in the network. This is one issue. But at the same time, you set a scar. And if you now consider data concerning seizure improvement in what do we have. In what do we have now, something like 50 years? What you observe is that the seizure comes back. And of seizure freedom that was claimed prior before, a long time ago, if you do a really long-term follow-up of these patients, you will see that they come back. So what is actually what you are doing here? You make some kind of a hopefully grateful degradation of the network. But the question is, what are you taking out? What are you taking out? And the other issue, and this is something that I haven't touched upon too close here, but the brain is made for learning. So even after, say, 20 or 30 years of epilepsy, you have probably learned of what would be a good dynamics for your brain. And if you try to de-learn toothbrushing, you know what it means. Perfect. All right, thank you. We have a question here in the audience. Erin, speak up. Yeah, thank you. Very cool talk. This isn't my area, so forgive me if this is a naive question, but I read that one of the very old treatments, very long-known treatments for epilepsy, is to eliminate carbohydrates from the diet. So ketogenic diet. And so that seems like that fits in very nicely with what you're. Seems like that fits in very nicely with what you're talking about in terms of biological rhythms. Do you have any comments on that? Yeah, there are some new approaches that go exactly in this direction. It's not just ketogenic diet, but there are also some more diffuse approaches to activate the brain. For example, if you go for the vagal nerve, and this is something that we are currently studying: how an external diffuse diffuse. Diffuse activation of the brain, does this lead to a modification of the network? And so far, what we see is that they do modify the brain network, they make them more stable, they make them less synchronizable. But what we don't have right now is the observation about how does this follow over a longer time. But again, we have to take into account what I've shown here today, is that also the biological rhythms interfere with these kind of intervention techniques. These kinds of intervention techniques. So, this is a long way going in this direction. But, ketogenic diet is also something that goes along these ways. Yes. We have any question online, Darwar. Hi, great talk. I just wanted just a quick clarification because I did find it so surprising when you mentioned the global synchrony is weaker during the nighttime. So, it's nighttime, but they are, it's not sleep, right? Is that correct? It is sleep. Correct, it is sleep. This is the full night time. What we haven't done is that we split this up into the different sleep phases because data for sleep scoring. It was only comparisons night versus daytime. But in these cases, what you can see already, if you take, for example, where is it? One example here. Yeah. Typically, these patients they go to Typically, these patients go to bed at something around 10 to 12. And then they wake, because they're in a clinical setting, they are woken up at six o'clock in the morning. So this is typically sleep time. But what you see here is that, and also in these cases here, even with an intracranial recording, much higher information, much higher level of degree of synchronization over the daytime. That's very counterintuitive. That's very counterintuitive. It is counterintuitive, yes. I found actually one paper back in the 70s where people studied also with the correlation coefficient from scalp recording and also in relation to sleep stages that it's not the case. Global synchrony is lower during sleep. Cool, thank you. Okay. All right. Are there any final questions either online or in the? Either online or in the room. So let's thank Klaus again for this very nice talk. Thank you. John, one short advertisement here, if you are interested, there is a new journal out now for almost a year, which is The Networks and the Brain System in the Frontiers Journal of Network Physiology, where we combine not just the brain, but the whole organism as a network, which is a completely new approach. If you have something A completely new approach. If you have something to send there, please do it. Thank you. All right. Thanks so much, Josh. All right, so we're moving on to the next talk. Are you ready to share your slides? Can you hear me, Edma? I think you're muted. Can't hear you. Philoff, no. Yeah, I think it's something with the microphone because you're not muted on Zoom. Sometimes it helps to disconnect and then reconnect. Looking at the screen here.
