I see a big one with comments. Yeah, but we'll wait another minute. So I don't think I'm back.  Oh, it was okay. Oh, it's been five minutes. So, welcome to the second day of the workshop. So before I introduce the break, uh let me just mention that this morning we have three calls. The last call of the morning could be a short one, thirty minutes, and it would be at 11.30. So on the schedule to list that lunch is first. Lunch is starting at 12. Sorry. I don't know. So we will list a smarter first and then go to lunch. And with that, so it's a great pleasure to have late. But Guru will tell about the complexity and several complex parameters. Thank you to your Yeah, thank you to the organizers for getting this together and allowing us to come to the beautiful damage. It's been great so far. I'm looking forward to the rest of the week. So myself or Seoul in 30 years we are more sort of complex analysts. So Mike Lloyd Pole and you talk to sort of introduce some of these more fundamental aspects of several complex variables, maybe some history. So, it was sort of born as a generalization of geometric convexity. And there's a lot of sort of analogs between introduced pseudo-convexity and classical geometric convexity. So I just want to introduce this notion of a dot defining function, because we will, for some instances, require some of the regularity of the boundary, and this is just a neat way to do it. So we're just assuming omega is a smoothly bounded domain, so we're like domain. So, like domain connected. And we want to put some regularity on the boundary, like I said. So, we want to introduce this notion of a finding function. So, we want to realize our domain as a sub-related set of some real-value function rho. And we want the gradient to be not zero on the boundary, because of course we want the boundary to be a manifold. And so there's this classical, so this is called defining function. Defining functions are not unique, but most of their important parts. You know, not unique, but most of their important properties are. So they have this classical theorem of geometric convexity, which says the following. So all of these are equivalent to geometric convexity. You have this condition that all the curvatures are positive. Whereas if you take the sort of real Hessian of rho and then you apply it to tangent vectors on the boundary, only tangent vectors, you should get something positive, or non-negative at least. Positive, or non-negative at least. Two is saying that you get a strictly, a smooth, strictly convex exhaustion function. So convex, of course, meaning that this is a positive definite function on all vectors at every point. And it can exhaust the domain from inside by these strictly convex domains, essentially what they are. Yeah, I forgot to mention that this one is great. I mean, one of course requires regularity to the boundary, which is Requires regularity to the boundary, which is sort of a loss, but it's great because it sort of allows you to localize the idea of convexity to the boundary, talk about convexity near a point. And also that you can also talk about strict convexity, because instead of requiring it to be positive semi-definite, you require it to be positive definite. And so, two is saying you can approximate any convex domain bounded submit by any strictly convex domains. Convex domains. And then three is sort of the most important characterization of convexity, the one we'll sort of get the most out of this talk, is this convexity with respect to a family of functions. So another characterization of geometric convexity is that for every compact, you have this hull defined this way. So this hull is compact as well. So what this hull is doing is it's looking at all the points, which the value at that point is less than the supremum of the linear. Of a linear function for all linear functions. And so, what this turns out to be is the actual just geometric, convex, geometrically convex hull, the standard hull that you would imagine. And so, really what this is saying is that we have a domain, it's open, right? And it has this property that for every convex, sorry, for every compact, the hull is also open. Yeah, so what does this have to do with several complex variables? Why is this useful? It all started in like 1906. Started in like 1906, I believe. Hartogs, it has to do with this extension phenomenon. Hardogs, really interesting if you haven't seen it. So, consider this domain. So, if you look at the definition, it looks complicated, but it's actually very simple. This domain has circular symmetry and each of the two variables. This domain here is just sort of this rectangle. This domain here is sort of this square. And of course, this is a in four real dimensions, so you can't really Four real dimensions, so we can't really imagine it particularly well, but we think about it in absolute space, which we can afford to do because there's circular symmetry variables. So a point here is sort of literally like a torus. And so the interesting thing about this domain is that if you have a whole work of function on this domain, you can actually extend it into the whole flybys. And this is how you do it. You have you have a whole work of functions up on your work of functions on your domain here, this original domain. You pick a delta between R2 and 1, and then you write the Cauchy transform in the Z2 variable. So what this function will be, at least a priori, is a, so it's going to be a holomorphic functions on this piece, sort of by delta. And you know, a priori, this doesn't have to be any sort of. A priori, this doesn't have to be any sort of extension. However, whenever z1 is less than r1, you're actually integrating over a disk like this. So what you get is actually just the Cauchy integral formula for f in the z2 variable, which is of course just equal to f. So you have a function defined on this little piece here, which agrees with f at least here. So by sort of standard analytic function theory, the identity Analytic function theory, the identity principle. You have two holomorphic functions which agree that in a neighborhood point, they must be the same everywhere. They're both defined. So this is honestly an extension. Does that make sense? And so you can sort of see here that there's some sort of convexity in play. There's some sort of it's sort of like the complex analysis doesn't really care about this is sort of an artificial thing we're taking out of the the biodisk. The biodisc. So, this is sort of done through biholomorphic mapping. So, you have one of these frames, which is essentially just this piece. And you think about the image of one of these frames being in a domain. And so, if you have a holomorphic function on the neighborhood of one of these domains, so this is by holomorphism, if you have a holomorphic function on the neighborhood of one of these frames, you can sort of pull the function back through by holomorphism. Pull the function back through my holomorphism, do the same analysis we were talking about, get an extension here. So anytime you have one of these, they call it hard tox frames. Anytime you have one of these hard tox frames in the boundary, then you can extend to the sort of image of the interior holomorphically. So the very interesting thing about this extension phenomenon. And so you can define a notion of being some sort of convex, maybe with respect to extensions of functions or something. Extensions of functions, or something like that. So, one way to define this notion of pseudoconvex, this is probably the first way it was defined, was you say, okay, every time one of these frames, by whole image of one of these frames, is in your domain, then the by whole more picture image of the interior must also gain the domains. Or you can define it in a very, very similar way. You say for every boundary point, so you pick a boundary point, there's a little neighborhood of that boundary point and a whole more mortgage function. In a holomorphic function defined in a plasma domain nearby that you can't assemble what. So, the sort of birth of pseudo-convexity was all about this is the extension of Holmorphic functions. These are sort of like the natural domains in which we will do Holomorphic function theory because, and I'll get into this later. The idea is that, well, if your domain is not too vets, just go to the the biggest one, work there. Why wouldn't it? Because of all your whole morphic functions then. And that that idea is not so simple as we're talking about. Idea is not so simple as we're talking about. Does that make sense? And they also have the levy problem. So, what I define as superconvexity is sort of a weak version of superconvexity at least formally. And they have the levy problem, which is at least interpreted in traditional interpretations that is this notion equivalent to the existence of a whole market function, which cannot be extended past any boundary point. So now instead of a whole market function just being defined low. Now instead of the whole market function just being defined locally, you have a whole market function in your whole domain. It's called D in this picture, but it's really omega. Bullmark function defined here, which cannot be the same as any value. And it turns out these are equivalent, but it took about 50 years of work to really flesh out all these details. So how do we characterize superconducting to see this as sort of a classic problem at the problem of the subway? And like I said, this is sort of analogous to some type of convex domain. This is sort of analogous to some type of convexity. So, if I go back, we want the sort of naive thing to do, at least, is you want to look at your standard notions of convexity and then which ones of these can be generalized for holomorphic functions. Well, the third here is actually very extensible. You know, you can just sort of, instead of linear functions, take some other family of functions and then you have some convexity with respect to those functions. And so that was at least sort of the ellipse, I suppose. Sort of the ellipse, I suppose. For holomorphic convexity, essentially. So there's various holomorphic generalizations of convexity. And so like I said, they consist, you take this family of holomorphic functions, and you define some notion of convexity. So instead of linear functions in the definition, you have this wherever the family is compared to all members of the family. And of course, these are complex value things, so you need absolute value. Of value. That's an inequality. And, but convexity is defined in the same way. So some examples for certain families of functions. Polynomial convexity is just, you take omega to be all of Cn. We'll be working with just in Cn for a while. And the family are just all the polynomials. Rational convexity is the same thing, but it's a polynomial. Same thing, but instead of polynomials, you have rational functions. Maybe there is an extra consideration here in the definition about the poles of your rational functions. But you can sort of view the poles and then their consideration as well, because if there's a pole, you can just think about what means as being infinity. But there's also an extra technicality with indeterminist instead, so I'm not going to want to get into. You can sort of naively think about this as just being. About this. It's just being comparing rational functions. Another sort of obvious generalization which applies more to the level problem and all that is holomorphic intensity. So omega is just omega, and f is your handle holomorphic functions. So you're taking omega VC names of these examples. Well, the polynomials are sort of only naturally defined like we can see. Sort of only naturally defined CN. I guess you could think about convexity with respect to the polynomials restricted to some domain, but it's sort of the natural domain on which the polynomials are defined as all CN. And you can, sorry. It's most naturally some compact and absorbed. Yeah, and yeah. And actually, if you take omega to be CN, Take omega to be cn and f to be the sort of entire functions, you get the same notion here. Because this is sort of you have an entire function, then if you take a high enough Taylor's member of the Taylor series, then you'll pop it on the hill. That works. I'll pop that more if I have time. Other questions? Okay, so the closing ball is sort of a very simple example of one that's F convex for all the panelines I just mentioned. And it's just a ball. What we want to do is you want to take a point outside. It's at zero maybe. And then you want to show that there exists a whole market function in the family such that each value at that point Value at that point, so this is sort of a negation. Just call this you want to show that there exists a holomorphic function, well, a function in the family whose value at that point is larger, extremely larger than a supremum in the uniform normal rather than the closed ball, closed balls being compact. And so the sort of natural choice is: well, we can rotate to where this is sort of. We can rotate to where this is sort of going to be the z squared act z z2 axis. And then this function. Obviously, it's linear for all members of the family. Z2 is a polynomial, it's a whole it's a rational function. An example of one that is not F convex for any of the F above is pick the ball. As you pick the ball, the either moon, sort of a smaller ball, it's called that sort of a spherical shell. In C2, however, yeah, I did mention it's in C2, this argument only works in C2, but if you have a polynomial rational function, or even a holomorphic function, I'm listed here by this Hartabs extension phenomena I just talked about. Extension phenomena I just talked about, you can actually extend any three of these into the domain. So, any into the whole thing. So, if you pick a point here by the sort of maximum principle, this will hold for any function in any of the families. So, for polynomial and rational convexity, you have this. For polynomial and rational convexity, you have this, maybe the place to start is in C1. So you have a compact in C1, then K is ration convex for any compact. So really the sort of idea with rational convexity in one variable is this is compact. The idea is: well, if you pick a point, The idea is, well, if you pick a point outside zero, we want to find a rational function or we want to find a polynomial whose zero set who passes through this point while that uploads your compact. And in one variable, this sort of obvious polynomial is a So, how does that relate to this definition? Well, you just take 1 over z minus z sub 0, and it's sort of infinity at this point, and it must be sort of finite here. So it sort of negation satisfies the negation. And for polynomially convex compacts in K, well, this would be an example of a compact which is not polynomially convex. Is not polynomial convex. Now, the polynomially convex fall is actually this one that the whole is filled in. Again, it's the sort of same idea here. If you have a polynomial above the maximum unscale, any point here must be bounded above by the normal here. That's very probable. So at least the sort of intuition, at least in one variable, and this sort of assists the higher variables. just the higher variables is that if you have a if you have a compact okay about this is a compact polynomially convex compacts means that if you take a point in the complement you can sort of push it off to infinity rationally convex at least in c1 is sort of trivial just because it's false for any point there's a but for polynomially convex convex you can sort of it's saying for every point in the company you can sort of In the company, you can sort of push it off to enter. And if you remember your one-variable complex analysis, right, this is similar to this idea of pole pushing for one to student. So sort of saying polynomially complex compacts, you can sort of do this pole pushing. And holomorphic convexity, before I move to the next slide, is really tied to this idea of forever. For every, so suppose you have a holomorphically convex domain now. This is close to the idea of, well, you take, for any sequence running off to the boundary, you can find a whole mortgage function on that domain which blows up along the sequence. And it's very closely tied to this idea. It's actually equivalent to that statement. And so this should be sort of consistent with what I mentioned with pseudoconvexity. Pseudo-convexity means that That for any boundary point cannot extend past holomorphically. So if you have a holomorphically convex and we take a sequence which runs out to this boundary point, you can find a holomorphic function which blows up along that boundary point. Therefore, that holomorphic function cannot be extended as. Okay, so back to Pollen and the only rational convection. Rational convention. The sort of motivation for defining these is, again, in one variable. And it's sort of a Rungus theoretical. So remember Runner's theorem said if you have a compact, then any holomorphic function in a neighborhood of that compact is the uniform limit of rational functions with, of course, poles off your compact. So if you have anything. If you have a neighborhood sort of. So if you have a holomorphic function in a neighborhood that's compact, then you can approximate a holomorphic function in a neighborhood by rational functions with the whole sort of in the holes. So that's the way they say it. And by whole, I mean a bounded component of the compact. If your compact has no holes, or it's more like this, then you can actually take these approximating functions to be polynomials. And the sort of idea, like I sort of mentioned here, is that a priori your approximating functions will have. Your approximating functions will have poles outside, you can sort of push these further and further out to get polynomials. So yeah, notice the difference between the consistency between how Runge's theorem applies and the different notions of following Lucas Rationalex. RPGs. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, so this is sort of a shorthand. So Rk means the closure of the rational functions in the uniform norm on K. Rational functions. And let's take the closure. Okay, and so this is saying to say So I meant to say okay. Otherwise it would be AK. Yeah, I talked about that. Did you say the CFK should be OK? Yeah, CFK. At least for this statement, CFK should be OK. That's right. It has a relationship between these two, but yeah, that's my thought. I think I'll talk about it here. And it's just an O of case containing them? Because it could be more. So the statement should be like O of case containing. Oh, right. Oh, right, yeah. But the the upshot just from this statement is that you can approximate polymer functions and uniform norm by rational. So the multi-dimensional version of this is the Opera theorem. So if you have a column as a convex compact or rationally convex compact angle or function in a neighborhood, then you can again approximate these functions in the formula on your compact with On your compact with rationality. It's true if you say rationally convex and rational functions, and we can probably support the word rational with polynomial, a polynomial approximation. And then likewise, if you have a holomorphically convex domain and a holomorphically convex compact in your domain, then you can approximate any holomorphic function in a neighborhood of that holomorphically convex compact by. So you can sort of get approximation by smaller things by bigger things in the square. And so sort of a partial converse is true, and this is sort of what the confusion was. I was thinking about this, is that if you have a compact with the property that any continuous function can be approximated in polynomials, or say the same thing with rationals. Or, you know, say the same thing with rationals. And this is polynomial or rational context. And well, this is a little bit different because such a domain must have empty interiors, like the perfume state. Because if such a k, so suppose you have a k that has a non-empty interior, then um pick a k with non-empty interior. K with 9 is the interior, sort of interior point. You pick a continuous function which has a sort of strict maximum at the interior point. There's no way you can approximate this by whole mode of things because maximum principle says that you can't do this with a whole model of functions. But there's also this sort of interesting example, at least in the case of rational approximations, this Swiss cheese example. So, yeah, there exists a compact with empty interior. So, the sort of converse of this is not true. There exists a compact with empty interior where it is R of K. It's not C of K. So the idea is you sort of take a ball and you take out a ball and you take in a ball and take out a ball. And it's sort of like a cantor set construction. You start taking out the largest ball possible. And what you get is a compact that has a ball. Is a compact that has empty interior. Yes. RP is not sort of an interesting example. So interesting now we have Oga Vale established, sort of an interesting consequence. An interesting consequence of this is that if you have a polynomial of convex compact, then every component of K is polynomial convex as well. So suppose K, we write this as two connected components. Just you can sort of see the idea if you just If you just have two connected components, so suppose k can be decomposed into two connected components, then you have this holomorphic function, which is one here on k prime, and zero on k double prime. Then over bail, there exists a polynomial. There exists a polynomial. So, this is a holomorphic function, a sort of obvious extension of this is holomorphic. It's just sort of two disconnected components of this being a holomorphic function in a neighborhood. So, Ogabale then says that there exists a polynomial such that in uniform norm, you can approximate this to the sufficient, which implies that implies that p is less than 1 for 1k dump prime and 1 minus p is less than 1 force on k prime. So the polynomially convex hull of k double prime, any point in the polynomially convex hull, your value must be less than 1 fourth. Value of P must be less than 1 fourth. However, for points in K prime, P is 1/4 close to 1, so that's impossible for points in P, I mean points in K prime. So this says that the polynomially convex hull of K double prime is disjoint from K prime. K prime. Since the polynomial context call of K double prime must be contained in K because K is polynomial context. It must be just equal to. So no more room. Uh, does that make sense? So the converse is actually much more complicated than the first that we'll talk about. So now it's time to go back to a little more for convexity, talk about pseudo-convexity. So in order to really talk about all equivalent formulations, I need to define putters of harmonic. So we say upper semi-continuous function, notice how we allow this function to take values at negative infinity. This is upper gets semi-continuous, which could possibly take values at negative infinity. Could possibly take that as a negative thing. You can call Plursilmonic, get a station short, on omega if for every point in omega in every complex vector, you can restrict a function to a complex line, essentially. You get something subharmonic, because now it's restricted to a complex line, it's sort of like a variable. You get something subharmonic, or identically there and so just as long as this is defined, we want something subharmonic for. This is defined, we want it to be separate mind. That's why I had this term here. Equivalently, for C2 smooth functions, you can say a DDC is normal, which of course allows us to define strict plays of subharmonicity is strictly vice versa. So examples of this, the sort of standard example, is the logarithm of the Olmeric function. Morphic function, a power level morphic function, just a positive power at least. And so another interesting example is a point-wise supremum of a family of Player Silhamonic functions. Given that this point-wise supremum is upper-semi-continuous, this will be Player Silhamic play with some of the arguments. And of course the harmonic functions, or well, in one variable harmonic functions, and you have this notion of pluriharmonic, which are sort of like real quarter total workflow functions in several variables. So here's sort of a big theorem with pseudo-convexity. So suppose we have a smoothly dumb domain with defined function following our equivalent. Omega is holomorphically convex, is equivalent to pseudo-convexity, and sort of that connection. To see O convex D, and it's sort of that connection I mentioned before, that O convex domains have this property that as you run out along the boundary, you can find a whole morphic function which blows up as you run out along the boundary. So obviously that cannot be accepted fast. It's highly non-trivial to show some of these things, but at least that's sort of the connection. Two says that sort of complex curvatures are positive. So the idea being that if you have a domain with negative these complex curvatures, you can sort of fit one of these hard dogs figures in there. Extent past. Which would make it not super x. And so this is saying, so instead of the real hash in here, we got what's called the complex hash in here and you have x bar. That's a bar for all boundary points, and then you can compare it against all complex tangent vectors. So a complex tangent vector means that so this is just a vector C such that this is true. So it's just like a real tangent vector, but instead of x, j goes at j. And of course this gives us an opportunity to find This gives us an opportunity to define strict pseudo-convexity, which has a lot of better problems to complete. Three is equivalent to the existence of a strictly platoon model exhaustion function. So again, just like the geometric convexity, you're saying you can sort of approximate from the inside by a strictly plural model, strictly suoconvex domains. And then number four, I only mention, I won't really talk about, but I have to mention it because it's so important. That's so important. 2 convex E is equivalent to being able to solve the D bar equivalent, uh the D bar operator uh D bar equation. Sorry. At this sort of 4 because D bar is 0, you want to find P in the seat within any category at all on those. So I wanted to talk about this, but I'm not sure if I have time, so I'll move. About this, but I'm not sure if I have time, so I'll move forward and come back to it afterwards. So, let's again, we're going back, we went to polynomial convexity, now we're going back, we went to whole mode of convexity, now we're going back to polynomial and rational convexity. Some interesting things about a polynomial and rational convexity is that if we have a bounded domain and its closure, its closure is a convex set, its closure is rationally convex, then the domain is actually pseudo-convex. then the domain is actually pseudo-convex. And this is actually true for polynomial or convex as well. Rational with polynomial, you get the same equation. And the sort of former is pretty easy to show because you take a domain whose closer is your At a domain whose closed zero is rationally convex, you have a certain spherical point, sort of find the positive mail whose zero set goes through that point, but avoids the compact. And you can do this for every point in the complement. So what you do is, well, at least for one of these, if you take a you take Cn and you omit outputs variety, right, then this thing will still be strong. And this thing will still be strong. So, what you're doing is you're really sort of you intersect this domain with the complement of this domain, the complement of this, so you just do this very large intersection of all these CN's modulo variety. Does that make sense? And so, yeah, it's not entirely obvious that if So yeah, it's not entirely obvious that if you have a family of pseudo-convex domains, that the intersection will be pseudo-convex, but it is true provided that the actual interior is not conceivable. Okay. So now again, we're going back to holomorphic convexity. So going back to sort of the initial for this flow, we find pseudoconvexity. So I sort of mentioned earlier that pseudo-convex domains are sort of the natural domains in which we want to do full-boarded function theory. The idea is that, well, you pick, well if you have a non-pseudocomplex domain, then you can sort of extend everything to a little bit larger domain. So just include that as part of the domain. Okay, and then you might be doing this thing a little bit more, so include that part and that part maybe. And sort of the idea, well, what's the sort of And sort of the idea of, well, what's the sort of largest domain to which all homomorphic functions extend? And it's actually sort of an interesting phenomenon because it turns out that such a idea doesn't really make sense in the class of Euclidean domains. It's inspires, which is called Steiner domains, of course. Alright, so this is the idea of an envelope of Holdmurphy. So I have this picture that you see a little bit of. But intuitively, what the envelope of Holdmurphy of a domain is, it's a fairly simple, at least albeit a little naive idea. It's the sort of largest domain containing your domain to which all homomorphic functions extend. And it turns out this is not quite a well-defined concept, at least. Quite a well-defined concept, at least in the class and reading domains, like I said. So we want to think about this domain here, this domain here. So I've tried to draw a little bit of a picture of it, but it's pretty difficult. So this is the Z1 plane, and this is an honest Z1 plane. However, the Z2 plane is still in absolute value, so it's still got this symmetry, this rotation of symmetry in the Z2 variable. It's defined in a little bit of a complicated way, but this is sort of the picture. Way, but this is sort of a picture. The idea is that this sort of curve, notice how it connects right here, but it comes around and doesn't connect here. So suppose you have a holomorphic function defined on this domain. Then, as we talked about, this sort of piece that looks like the head of a nail or something like that, any holomorphic defined on this piece can actually extend into the full cylinder, which we've talked about before. Cylinder, as we talked about before. So if you have a holomorphic function on this whole thing, then it can sort of extend into here at this morally. However, the problem comes into play whenever, well, the function is already defined here, so this extension might not be consistent with the original definition. You want to have an envelope home morphine in such a way that sort of distinguishes between these two pieces. So an example of such a function would be Z1 minus I squared. So if you go back on the original domain, Z1 minus I, and the original domain is perfectly well defined because you can never have a loop of winding number one around I, and this is this original domain. It's perfectly well defined. However, in this sort of, if you try to extend it, it's going to clash here. Um it's gonna clash here because it will sort of the argument would be off. And so this sort of shows that the envelope of hole is not really a well-defined concept here. So this motivates the definition of a Steiner. But the sort of theorem is: well, okay, we can't find it on the in the classic Euclidean domain. You have to sort of go into. Domain, you have to sort of go into sort of higher-dimensional work abstract structures to find one. So, this is the sort of boiled-down version of the theorem. It says if you have a domain, you have an unlocal homeomorphy, that is defined as a complex manifold and a local homeomorphism pi, which is sort of its projection. And this complex manifold sort of contains your original domain in the sense that you have this. Original domain, in the sense that you have this phi going from your original domain to X, the property that when you sort of compose it with the, you should think about this V as sort of an inclusion map. When you compose it with the projection, you get the identity map. And furthermore, any olomorphic function on your original domain f extends to x in the sense that you pull back through this sort of map. You can find holomorphic functions. You can you can find a hole in the function so that if you pull back to this inclusion draft, you get your original holomorphic function. And it's also maximal in a very similar sense to maximal in such a way that the heat projection map sort of can be Yeah, and in such a domain, you know, if you have such a manifold, it should be you know the idea is, like I said, is you want to extend to the largest pseudo-convex domain sort of. To the largest pseudo-convex domain, sort of. And so this manifold should be pseudo-convex in some sense. So that sort of inspires the definition of a Stein manifold. So you call, maybe some of you are familiar with this definition, you call a complex manifold Stein if X is holomorphically convex. So we sort of get this definition from the fact that this is equivalent to pseudoconvexity. But we also want your complex method. But we also want your complex manifold to have many sort of holomorphic functions on it. So 2 says that holomorphic functions separate points. Of course, this rules out the idea that a compact, complex manifold can be Stein, because any holomorphic function on a compact is constant, so you can't separate points. But we also need this extra property that for every point, you can basically find a coordinate system made up. A coordinate system made up of functions defined on the entire alphabet's being recorded. And a theorem is sort of that the envelope holomorphy of a domain is shine. An observation is that every complex hypersurface without every sort of non-impact hypersurface, well, every complex hypersurface without boundary and CNHI. Sort of where two and three sort of the definition sort of came from is looking at complex hyperservice without boundary and stuff. It doesn't have to be hyperservices, it should only be semantic without. Right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean hyperservice, I guess, in a very generalized sense. And then, sort of the converse is that if you have a holomorphically complex narrow pole, that does Complex miracle that does not contain any non-trivial compact complex miracle in its job. Okay, so this observation here, every complex hyperspace without boundary is Stein sort of inspires the question. We have this sort of abstract definition of Stein manifold. Definition of Stein manifold, can every Stein manifold sort of be realized as sort of a surface in some very large CN? Can you embed a Stein manifold properly into any Stein manifold? And this turns out to be true. Every Stein manifold emits a proper holomorphic embedding into some Euclidean space. So if the number is large enough, you can embed. The number is large enough, you can get your Steinmannfold in the sum equal to instance. And so for a while there's what's the sort of minimal dimension? Well, it turns out that the minimal dimension is sort of here, where this is the floor function. So it's actually, it's not fully solved because this is only the minimal dimension is only sort of known when when your the dimension of your Stein manifold is greater than one. Greater than one. So, in the case that you have a shine manifold of dimension wise, if you open them on the surface, it's actually unknown. You can embed them in C3, but it's unknown whether they can be embedded in C2. So, an interesting corollary of all this, so there's like one of these things in complex analysis where you Where you sort of use all this complex analysis to answer a question that has sort of a priority nothing to do with complex analysis. So, sort of corollary of this is that every real analytic manifold emits a proper real analytic embedding into Rn for some kind of purely real analytic idea. The idea is sort of if you have a real analytic idea. The idea is sort of if you have a real analytic manifold, you just define and sort of complexify this real analytic manifold. And then you can take a little neighborhood of your real analytic manifold to shine. So this, you call this Q sorta sort of smaller. Little neighborhood. There's a little shine neighborhood. Then what you do is you embed that little shine neighborhood U into C in. So what it looks like in the embedding is, well, it's a well you embed this and then you sort of get a totally real embedding. Get A was totally real embedding into CN. So if you restrict the embedding, it's a viable orphan embedding, restricted by LOL Orphan embedding either real. So it's one of these very interesting things about how complex analysis has tools to real analysis or real analytic problems. This is the only way I think you can prove this. I think with the historically proved that you have smooth embedding, but smooth embedding but the only proof known of this is through these uh the stein machine does that make sense how much time do I have left a little bit late yeah so since I have a little bit more time I'll go back to um we talked about About equivalent properties of pseudo-linear pseudoconvexity. So at least without four, the connection between these, at least very cosmetic sort of levels, would be sort of clear. Um right you said holomorphically convex means that you can go along a boundary point and find a homeorphically function which pulls up as you go ahead. Function which pulls up as you go to that boundary point. This means sort of isn't satisfied to sort of fit a hard talks figure in there. So the connections between these two, these three are sort of clear. The only one that's maybe a bit mysterious is one implies three. Three implies one is making it sort of intuitively displeasable. Where one implies three, you have a, or maybe just a pseudo-convex domain, and you want to show that there exists a smoothly, strictly placed. Just a smoothly, strictly placed a remote exhaustion function. So, like, where do you pull this exhaustion function? Where does it come from? You're not really given anything to work with too much. So, it's sort of like you're sort of doing all these equivalencies. Finding a stripper plurus of Relonic expression function. And what you look at is the negative log of the distance function to the boundary. Log of the distance function to the boundary. So you take the distance function to the boundary. This is sort of like a defining function, right? And of course, as you get closer and closer to the boundary, this is going to become zero. You take a logarithm of it. So this is then, it's going to negative infinity, so you slap a negative on it, and so it's pulling up to infinity along the boundary. So it's some sort of exhaustion function. But it's actually totally submaric on A pseudo-so A. So the key here is you want to write the distance function in these ways, sort of the infemon of these sort of what would you call this, directional distance functions. So if you have a domain, you sort of, you fix a vector, you fix a direction basically. A direction basically. And so you're looking at the distance to the boundary in this direction, you know, it doesn't really change. And so you pick a point here, right? And then this is not the distance to the boundary, it's the distance to the boundary along the vector, right? The idea is you show that this is pseudo-sorry, this is pluris of harmonic for every choice, for every direction. And then you can sort of, and it turns out that when you take a V negative, When you take a negative logarithm, this turns into a supremum of families. So you have a family of place or a lot of things, and you take a supremum of place. But why this is true, well, you sort of idea why these sort of negative log delta functions should be true. Very loosely speaking is, well, you want to show that the distance to the boundary of the function, the log of it. Function, I'll get log of it. Along this direction is clear to Ramind. So, what do you need to do? You need to take a complex line and show that it's subharmonic along that complex line. And it turns out that the property of being subharmonic along this complex line is actually sort of equivalent to the prop to being able to fit a sort of a Hartoff's figure in like that. Might like that script. And at least intuitively, that's the idea. Different formulations of sub-normal functions, but it turns out that if you have sort of a it's non-pseudo-convex, you still have a hard top sort of figure, but it'll sort of look like that, sort of the outside. Sort of the outside. And so being super convex says that if these points are in the domain, sorry, like this. On the so it sort of says that, well, if you have a hard chops figure, then certain internet as well. So the key is sort of So the the key is sort of the key key is sort of directional. That makes sense. And sort of exhaustion functions, at least in general, we tend to think of as blowing up as you go along the boundary, go out toward the boundary. But D-Drick and Point Answ actually showed that if you have a pseudo-convex domain with C2 boundary, then this sort of almost Then this sort of, you can almost forget about this, at least morally. Instead of a negative logarithm of the distance function, you have the negative distance function to some really small power. This should be strictly plurusodomatic in a neighborhood of the boundary. And then you can sort of bash this together to get a pseudo-convex domain s to get that uh pseudo convex domains with C2 boundary admit bounded strictly plays of harmonic functions. Yeah, it's sort of maybe a little bit mysterious how you go from here to here, but sort of sort of makes sense if you think about it. Like the negative logarithm is just sort of trying to be x to the 0 kind of, right? So if you have some property with logarithms, it might be at least feasible. Maybe take a really small power that has some similar property. That makes sense. Any questions for Mike? Just to clarify this remote service question for anyone, so it's you said it's not known if any non-compact remote service embeds it to C2 or some of them do, but not all of them. Not known if they all do that, yeah. This will work. You can embed this function PC to Although it's not trivial. But if you have some weird boundary, then it's not so quick. Is there any simple example where it's example where it's platinum and where it's some country? I mean, of course, there's no counterexample. The only known cases are where you have finitely many. Where you have finitely many one smooth jaw anchor. So if you have like a remote surface with a finitely many case, that is normal. I think even if you take like data domains with punctures, more than like three punctures or something, then you don't know. So like disk with three punctures or something, right? Oh well, it's not known but disk with three punctures. Yeah, I think it's known for two some two punctures, but not not more than two. It's expected the answer should be better. Sorry? It's expected the answer should be yes for everything or can you? I don't think anything's expected. Where did should they do the media three versions? Yeah, yeah. Three the only versions. C two? Let's thank Luke again. Next talk is in 43 minutes. I remember that there's a two o'clock this morning.
