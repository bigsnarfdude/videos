Yeah, good. Can you speak loud, please? Yeah, yeah, hello. Can you hear me? Yes, we can. Okay, okay, yeah, good. Okay, so let's continue with the next speaker, Chami Shashmao, and he will talk about frontal paths and biofringed patterns in flow in horse media. And the floor is yours. Okay, so is my screen visible? Yes. Yes. Okay. Yeah, so first of all, thank you to the organizers for giving me this opportunity to talk about on a topic, which I would say it's quite old, but I think it has gained a lot of attention recently due to the advancement of microscale experiments as well. uh microscale experiments as well as well as numerical simulations so uh so yeah so i just listened to the talk of uh one so i think i'm in the also same line so i think our investigation also um have gained the kind of same kind of conclusions but anyway i'd like to point out some uh you know uh uh some some actually aspects Some actually aspects that maybe would be helpful to understand the flow of viscosity fluids through porous media. Okay, so before going into the details, so I just want to acknowledge to my PhD students, two PhD students, Vilal and Anand, who did most of this work. And also my host Institute, Ayat Rupar, for giving me the funding to carry out this work. Giving me the funding to carry out this work. Okay, so yeah, I think you might have heard about lots of applications about this particular flow, like flow of histoic fluids through Kuras media. I just don't want to repeat those things again, but just to so just to motivate myself at least. So, yeah, so the best example is the flow through in the enhanced oil recovery, where actually we used to. Where actually we used to flow the viscoelastic fluids like polymer solution or surfactant solutions to displace the oil from the porous rock. And if you understand the microscale physics at a small scale, then I think it would be better to control macroscopic aspects like pressure drop or flow rate. So it's very important to understand the microscope physics, flow physics. And another example. Flow physics. And another example is like a flow through a pack bed reactor, where also people often use physicalastic fluids. And if some reaction is happening inside the pack bed reactor, which can be again influenced by the corresponding flow dynamics inside it. So again, it's very important to study the flow dynamics. There are some other applications like soil remediation, filtration, etc. So yeah. Now, if I talk about a real porous media, so it looks like So it looks like this. Okay. So it has millions or billions of micropores which are interconnected with each other. This is like a typical same image of this forest rock forest structure. And you can see there are so many forests present with different shapes and sizes, which are again interconnected to each other. Now, if you want to particularly investigate the flow dynamics inside it, so experimentally it might be. So, experimentally, it might be challenging to do. So, that's why what we do, we take a relatively simpler geometries which are called model porous media. There actually we take some like a simple microchannel and then we put some obstacles like micro pillars with different shapes and sizes. And then we study the flow dynamics inside it. And also, sometimes we use like the glass pipe, and then you put a glass spheres inside it, which is kind of mimic. Which is kind of mimic a three-dimensional porous structure. And lots of work are going on using this kind of porous structure by Professor Shivinda. Okay, so now using this kind of model pura structure, people have come up with kind of defined observations, particularly in excellence. So which actually in the first of my talk, I'm going to just summarize what actually people have observed in the excellence. Okay, so I would say. Okay, so I would say those observations like kind of peculiarities, okay, which because these are not seen in the flows of simple Newtonian fluids. So first, actually, I would like to talk about the formation of preferential paths. So this is like the experiment which was performed almost 30 years back by Muller et al. And this is like a model, again, model porous structure, which is a glass pipe. And then they put the glass spheres of the same. The glass spheres of the same materials, and then they did the experiment with two fluids: one is only with solvent like paraffin oil, which exists like neutrino-like fluid. And then they also use a polymer solutions. And then they float those solutions through this model porous structure. And in case of neutron fluids, you can see that based on their experimental observation, they just drawn these flow paths. And you can see that in case of meat solvent, only solvent, all the other. Solvent, all the flow paths, you can, in all the flow paths, you can see the fluid is flowing. But in case of polymer solutions, you can see there are some paths where actually the flow intensity is higher than the other paths which are available. And these paths again become time dependent as the flow rate is increased. So, these actually they called differential paths, which actually they observe in their experiments. And then we will. We build it more sophisticated experiments using this kind of model structure, which is like a micro channel, and then they put micro pillars in it. This is like group from Professor Paddy. And you can see that again, so this is like their experimental observations. So this is the subfigure A actually represents the results, the flow profiles of simple neutrino fluids, which is like a brand solution. A brine solution, and this is like for surfactant solutions at different two different flow rates. So you can see that in case of brine solution, which is like a nuclear-like fluid, the flow paths actually are kind of straight lines and the flow is kind of uniform through all the paths which are available. But in case of surfactant solutions, there are some paths where actually the flow intensity is higher. Okay, and as the flow rate is increased further, you can see that these flow paths become or at the flow intensity is higher, they become time dependent. Okay, so this again shows the formation of differential paths through Provost Media when a stoastic fluid flows. Now, recently, I think this definitely many of our colleagues discuss. Our colleagues discuss about this work. So, again, I am also going to talk about this. So, Walcama et al., so there is what they did recently. So, they actually took a model again model porous structure where actually they take a initial kind of stagger configuration. So, this is their unit lag structure. And they introduce the disorder in this initial stagger, like regular stagger structure by changing this parameter beta. By changing this parameter beta. And what they observe is that as they increase this disorder parameter, the formation of frequential paths is accelerated. As well as what they observe that as the disorder parameter increases, what they observe that the flow fluctuation which is arising in the porous media that is actually supported. The Puras media that is actually suppressed. So, this is like the same video which one was showing. So, this is like for regular stagger structure, and this is like the after introducing some disorderness in the porous media. So, you can see that it's like it's showing the chaotic fluctuation, which is kind of elastic, wavy nature, kind of showing. And here, actually, you can see the fluctuation is totally suppressed. But there are differential parts where actually flow intensity is higher. So, that's why there. So that's why they actually concluded by saying that disorder suppresses kinetic fluctuations. And the title actually was very catchy. So we actually, this is the one actually which actually, you know, gave the motivation to do the numerical solutions for us. And then subsequently, what Professor Emison group, what they did, they actually did the same kind of experiments, but with two configuration. One is With two configurations, one is staggered like Valcom et al. And but they also use this aligned configurations. And based on so, what they observed that in case of aligned configurations, as we increase the disorder parameter beta, the cathodic fluctuation actually increases with the oil number as well, as well as the beta. So, and based on their observation, particularly on this aligned configuration, what they concluded that What they concluded that the chaotic behavior inside the porous media is controlled by the number of stagnation points. So, this is the number of stagnation points which already one mentioned. So, these are the points where actually COTL will have zero velocity, high extensional flow field, and where the stimuli diverges. So, in case of perfectly aligned configurations for which beta is zero, all those stagnation points are screened out. So, that's why we will have a list. So that's why you will have less fluctuations, but as you introduce disorder inside the porous media, so those stagnation will be stagnation points will be opened up and they will face the flow and as a result the chaotic fluctuation will increase. So these are the kind of experimental observation that people have. So then what we did, we actually did the simulations and we found out some further insights. Further insights in this peculiar behavior. So, first, I would like to talk about the preferential paths. So, in order to do that, so again, I would like to mention a beautiful experiment which was done, performed by again, Professor Emission group. And this is the experiment where actually, instead of using many micropillars, they use just two micropillars in the microchannel. And then, what they did, they defined a parameter which is called gap ratio G and they use two values of this gap ratio. Use two values of this gap ratio. And what they did, they increased the flow strength gradually and they found the formation of different flow states inside the system inside this flow setup. So when the flow strength was low, so they actually found steady and symmetric like flow state, like Neutronium-like flow state. But as gradually increased the flow strength, what they observed is that the fluid actually is passing through the gaps between the microchips. Between the microstrain wall and the standard wall, but it is completely avoiding this gap between the two micropillars. As they further increase the flow strain, then what is happening that the fluid is flowing only through the gap between the microchannel wall and the cinder wall, and is completely avoiding the space between the two micropillars and other gap, and it becomes time-dependent. Okay, so they this they termed as asymmetric diverging state or. As asymmetric diverging state or eddy state, and this is the term as diverging state. But once they increase the gap ratio a little bit, then what they observe is that instead of fluid flowing through the gap between the microstrain wall and the cylinder wall, now the fluid is flowing through the gap between the two micropillars. And this is actually the term as converging state or C state. Okay, so what we thought that so this might be the So, what we thought that so this might be the precursor of the formation of differential paths in porous media, and that's why we perform simulations with kind of similar geometry, but with different gap ratios, but we qualitatively reproduce the same observations that Professor Emmin's and group actually observed in their experiments. So, this is our corresponding numerical simulations, and you can see that as we increase the value of IRO number, so you can see the formation of this divergent state and then this. And then this asymmetric diverging state in case of gap ratio 0.28, but as the gap ratio is increased to 0.5, you can see that the formation of converging state or C state. So these are some videos which actually shows the formation of these different flow states. This is the diverging state and this is the asymmetric diverging state and this is the converging state. Okay, so we qualitatively kind of reproduce their experimental observations, but Observations, but what is the mechanism behind the formation of this different flow state that actually we explained in terms of calculating these bioreacting strengths of high elastic stresses, which also Johan talked about a lot. So what we found out, like in case of Gabriel 0.28, okay, so this kind of this birefringent strand of high elastic stresses, they actually combine together and they form a single strand downstream of the cylinder. Single strand downstream of the cylinder and upstream of the cylinder, they actually are connected with each other. So it is kind of obstructing the flow to flow through the gap between the two micropillars and allowing the fluid to flow through the gap between the microchannel wall and the cylinder wall, cylinder wall. So this is the kind of diverging state. And once the original number is further increased, then what is happening? The stance actually itself becomes time independent and fluctuating in nature. So if you think Then and fluctuating in nature. So, if you think at one instance when the strands go downward, then what will happen? It will block the fluid to flow through this gap and it will allow the fluid to flow through the other gap. Okay, so which actually basically forming the asymmetric diverging state. Now, if the fluid shows shearthening area, then what will happen? Once it starts to flow through this gap, the shear rate will increase, the apparent distribution will decrease, resistance will decrease. So, it will prefer to flow through this file. This, so it will prefer to flow through this pile only. So, but once we increase the gap ratio to a little bit to 0.5, then what is happening? These strands actually are not coming with each touching with each other. So, now what is happening, they are blocking the fluid to flow through the gaps between the microsynal wall and the cylinder wall, and it is allowing to flow the fluid through the gap between the two micropears. So, this is the formation of converging state. Now, so the Now, so the steps behind the formation of this differential path is that definitely the formation of bi-filter-derived bi-repend stands of high elastic stresses, elastic instability definitely will appear, and then flow will be bifurcated. And if there is any seriny behavior in the fluid, then definitely that will promote this formation of these flow states. So, after that, what we did, we actually carried out the full-scale simulations using out the full scale simulations using that kind of bigger geometries where actually we are now having more microcolors inside the microchannel and this is like the aligned configuration of the porous media so so we have carried out the simulation for different values of disorder parameter and different vision number and you can see that in case of perfectly aligned configurations so this is the velocity magnitude plot superimposing the streamline profiles and this is the root means where velocity magnitude plugin Root mean square relative magnitude fluctuation, and this is the polymer extension, which is related to the stress of polymer. Okay, so and you can see that in case of perfectly aligned configurations, the fluctuation is definitely less, very less. But as you gradually increase the disorder parameter beta, then you can see that the formation of differential paths also is accelerated, as well as the fluctuation in the velocity also increases. Now, as Wuhan also talked about it, so you can see that as we increase the value of beta, so definitely this bi-definition standard of high elastic stresses actually are forming. And you can see that as we increase the value of beta, so their length as well as width, those are also increasing, which is also kind of facilitate the origin of elastic instability and subsequently elastic turbulence, and that actually. Turbulence and that actually, you know, kind of increasing the chaotic fluctuation inside the porous medium. So, here actually, I would say the number of stagnation points, what actually what Professor Emission group proposed that definitely kind of working. But so, in order to further ascertain the You know, further ascertain their kind of proposal. So, what we did, we again we did this particular kind of simulations where actually we took the perfectly aligned configuration and then we just put one micropillar along the path. And what we observed that you can see this formation of biodiversity strands of a larger length and width. And again, this actually is facilitating the formation of this kind of cavity. Kind of chaotic fluctuating flow field inside the porous media. So, the number of stagnation points explanation based on these definitely works for these configurations. But then, what we did, we did the simulation for stagger configurations. So, this is like beta zero. This is the initial kind of regular staggered configurations. There is no disorder, and you can see that so then we can increase the. So, then we can increase the disorder parameter beta. And here, again, you can see that as we increase the value of beta, so the formation of preference paths also is actuated, as well as you can see the relation fluctuation also increases inside the porous media, which is like in contrast what actually Walgam et al observing the experience. So, here in this case of in this tiger configurations. case of in this staggered configurations what is happening that the flow fluctuation actually increased likewise we have seen in the aligned configuration with geometric disorder so the number of stagnation point cannot explain this trend which actually what we have seen now uh so now i just want to discuss some of the kind aspects which might be responsible for responsible for these defiles and why we should work more so Why we should work more. So, first of all, I just have just compared like three works: okay, Walgamma at all, Howard Atoll, and President or Present numerical simulations. This is all the geometrical parameters which I have listed here. Okay, so in case of our present simulations, so it is 2D definitely. It's not 3D simulations. So, in case of Howard at all, you can see all these parameters. The D is the diameter of the micropillar, L is the length of the channel, H is the channel. Is the length of the channel, h is the height of the channel, uh, w is the depth of the channel, s is the lattice constant, and number of pillars is 300 in case of how it all uh in case of algae et al. It would be around like this, although I didn't find out the number, exact number. But in case of our numerical simulations, the number of pillars is 50. And but the most important point here is that the number of pillars is defined, so the flow area is defined in all these studies, at least in all. Depending on all these studies, at least in our simulation and the experience. So it may influence the flow physics, particularly the formation of bioefficient strands. So that could be one aspect. And different H by D ratio or effect of confinement, which will come into the picture. For instance, here our H by D ratio is 10 in simulations, but here it is like in case of Howard at all, it is, I think, 24 around, and it is here in case of Volcan at all, it is 80. Told it is 80. So, it's different in all these three studies, which again can influence the formation of these strands. So, the effect of confinement may also play a role. And also define depth ratio. So, our simulation is 2D. So, definitely there is no kind of dimension in the neutral, in the J direction or neutral reactions. J-direction or neutral reactions. So it's purely two-dimensional emissions. But in case of hard atom, you can see that depth is kind of 1000 microns. And in case of alkali atom, it is 50 micron. So it's huge difference. So this can also the flow dimensional because one can expect that once elastic turbulence will emerge in the geometry. So it will definitely the flow will become definitely three-dimensional. So that can also influence the formation of this bi-reference strands. These y-differential strands, which again can influence the cavity fluctuations. Okay, so what then we can kind of conclude or wrap up. So in case of all gamma at all, what is happening? That's so in their experience, it was staggered configurations. So they observed suppression of chaos. And what they propose that it's because of increasing shear-dominated region. And that might be true because their fluid is also like shear thinning in nature. Fluid is also like shear thinning nature. So, when those preferential paths are formed, might be the shear thinning properties of the fluid is dominating and because the shear will be high in those regions, and which actually is maybe suppressing the flow fluctuation. So, so we should think about this chaotic fluctuation is like the competition between shear thinning and strain-adiening properties of polymers. So, because the shear thinning properties of the polymers have a tendency to suppress the The polymers have a tendency to suppress the chaotic fluctuations, whereas the stain-hardening behavior of the feed have a tendency to increase the chaotic fluctuation. This is very important to study the competitive influence within these two properties. So it's better that's why I could do maybe some experiments with perfect elastic fluids like Voger fluids, which may provide more insights. But unfortunately, I think all the experiments they did, those fluids actually. Uh, they did those fluids actually show some kind of uh shear thinning being used now. This formation of reversal paths. Now, I have divided into two kind of things. One is shear thinning dominated, another is strain-hydrating dominated visualastic solutions. So, in case of shear thinning-dominated solutions, the prevential paths may be suppressing the chaotic fluctuation because there the shear thinning property will be dominated. So, which might be suppressing the chaotic fluctuation. Suppressing the chaotic fluctuation. But what may be happening in our simulation that the parameters that we have used may be straightharding dominated. So that's why the chaotic fluctuation is increasing in our simulations, even in the case of standard configuration. And so it might be then better kind of, you know, better to say like biochangent standard highly elastic stresses may be a suitable way to explain this oral chaos inside. This overall chaos inside the porous media, but the point is that this biorefinance stands depend on many factors such as polymer concentration, solid volume or fluid volume fractions, rheumatic disorder, self-assembly. And if you are dealing with surfactant solution, then breakage and recombination, all those will come into the picture, which may influence the formation of this birefringent strand. So we should may need to do more investigation on those aspects. And then three diagrams. And then three-dimensional simulations, those actually may provide further insights into the flow dynamics. So, currently, we are doing those things and an experience with Google Fluids, as I already told, yeah, this could be a good idea to do because it can then provide the insight kind of on the explicit elastic effect of the fluid, that how it can influence the chaotic fluctuation on the The chaotic fluctuation on the porous structure. And if I had solute or volume fraction, also, we should do that because it can definitely influence the formation of these bidependent strands. So at the end, yeah, in reality, the viscosity pulse media flow is much more complicated due to the complex metric structure that I already showed. So I'm sure there are many experimentalists present here. So we'll be happy to, you know, get. Know, get more kind of results in the future so that I being a simulation person can provide more insight into those observations. So yeah, so that will be will be the future, futuristic thing. Okay. So yeah, that's done. I think I'm done. Thank you. Thank you all for your kind attentions. So if you have any question, I would love to answer. Thank you.
