Okay, so this started quite a while ago from talking to Jordan Feld and Sonia McFarland, who is a clinician, talking about some clinical issues with usage interference, type 1 interference alpha in a clinical setting, and those issues became And those issues became mute since then, but the interesting problem remains. And it was done over the years by a number of students. It was started by Postdoc, Chicha Nayak, and then it was continued by Sepper and Berjot. And more recently, most of the work that I'm going to be talking today was done by Duncan Kirby and Julie Amidroni. And Gregor did all the experiments by himself, I have to say. He by himself did all the experiments. To say. He by himself did all the experiments I will be talking about today. So, in general, my group has been interested for a very long time and somewhat single-mindedly, I have to say, in the mechanisms of specificity and selectivity on multiple scales, from molecular scale to essentially organismal scales, in crowded and in situations where. Crowded and in situations where there is lots of different signals going in parallel and they interact with each other, there is lots of crosstalks, there is lots of non-specific interactions. And one of the systems we were working very a lot, which was main interest of our lab for many years, the nuclear power complex, which regulates all the transport between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and all the karyotic cells. And it has to selectively transport various molecules in a very crowded environment, multiple interacting signals. Interacting signals, and that's sort of on a molecular and cellular scale. And in another extreme, one of the projects we'll be working on is with the bioengineers of the group of war in China at the University of Toronto, whose interest is developing nanoparticles for drug delivery. And one of the big questions there still is still, how to make targeting, how to actually target them to the right organs. And it's an unsolved problem because often they end up, for instance, in macro. Often they end up, for instance, in macrophages instead of their target cells. And so the question, although the physics and mathematics is quite different than this, but conceptually they're similar. So it was very natural for us to be interested in how signaling systems, in the immune system and in other systems, work in the presence of crosstalk, which is entirely ubiquitous in all signaling systems. And by crosstalk, Systems. And by crosstalk, I mean a situation when multiple different ligands either share or partially share the same receptors and also downstream signaling components. And these are two slightly separate problems, crosstalk on the receptor level and crosstalk on the downstream level, but they're very, very similar. And the examples are numerous, of course, all the cytokines in the immune system, the JAC stat systems, the schemokines in the immune system. The schemokines in the immune system, the TGR beta pathway in development, and many others. And TCR signaling also belongs, it's a variant of the same problem, although it's slightly different because in many cases the question is how do you decode the signal from a combination of multiple ligands? And TCR, it's a sort of an extreme variant of this problem, where every multiple ligands go through the same one, same receptor, and still some decoding needs to be done. And it turns out Needs to be done. And turns out that type 1 interference is another example of that sort of in a sense TCR-like problem where 16 different type 1 interference, so 12 to 14 different subtypes of interference alpha, interference beta, and for some reason kappa, epsilon, and omega, they act through the same dimeric receptor, and it's very important, it's a dimeric receptor actually, where the binding of interferon to the both subunits. Of interference to the both subunits, the dimers is the receptor, after which two JAC kinases, which are not shown here, get phosphorylated and then phosphorylate intracellular STAT. Molecules in the classical pathway for type 1 interference is STAT1 and STAT2. It forms STAT1, STAT2 dimer, which then goes into nucleus and activates transcription of all kinds of responses. Plus, on the time scale of hours to days, all kinds of feedbacks that Today's all kinds of feedbacks, negative feedbacks that eventually shut down the response. I'm sure most of you know this. But it's been so classical pathway in type 1 interference signaling has been the STAT1 and STAT2. But recently, not even recently, it's been known for quite a while that like all other cytokines, they phosphorylate not only their canonical stats, but pretty much everything else. For instance, if one knocks out STAT1, they will be gingerly phosphorylating STAT3 and STAT5, and even in the presence of Stat 5. 5 and even in the presence of STAT1, there is still some sort of crosstalk happening. So, here the crosstalk is happening both on the level of receptor, where multiple eigens bind the same receptor, but somehow induce different effects in downstream cells, which can be measured on the level of function, plus there is some crosstalk on the level of intracellular signaling. So, I want to step one step. I want to step one step back and introduce the problem. So, even without thinking about how it distinguishes multiple ligands in mixtures, even having the situation where different ligands bind to the same receptor is already problematic because you, in a classical monomeric receptor with Michaelis-Menthen saturable response curve, you cannot really distinguish two ligands in. To ligands independent of concentration, because you can always compensate for the lower binding affinity with higher concentration and recover the same result. So you cannot simultaneously determine which ligand it is and how much of it is there. And it's really a fundamental problem which will come up everywhere, that you cannot determine two inputs, in this case concentration and let's say affinity or the residence time, from one. Or the residence time from one output, which in this case is the receptor occupancy. So multiple inputs maps onto the same output. So the receptor, the dimeric nature of the receptor sole provides some partial solution to this because it turns out that the dimeric receptor, and it's been known in a while since Perelson and De Lizi in the early 80s, that unlike monomeric receptor, dimeric receptor doesn't plateau on the same level, which is independent. On the same level, which is independent of the affinity, but the plateau level also depends on the affinity. So, if you're trying to discriminate in this sort of limited situation where you're trying to discriminate between two ligands, there can be a region where this level of activation is produced only by a higher affinity ligand. And so, if you're measuring something in this regime, then you know it came from that ligand. So, we wanted to test if it's a feasible mechanism in reality, and for that, we needed to have. Reality, and for that, we need to have a reasonable model which, because to measure what happens on the receptor level, is kind of hard, it's much easier to measure. Phosphorylation is reasonably straightforward to measure, especially if you have graduate. But of course, in all these models, there are lots of steps, there are lots of binding and binding reactions, phosphorylation. Because forlation, it's not really known even in what sequence they occur and what are their rates. So, we try to find a So we tried to find a really minimal model which simplifies all this into something very similar. Once a receptor is dimerized by the ligand, it starts phosphorylating stat. And all these biochemistries included in this very aggregate step KP. And through a lot of mice and a lot of work, the model works very well, both in the time course and the dose response curves, both interfering alpha and interfering beta. And of course, you can If you're beta, and of course, you can say, well, if you have enough parameters, and we don't have too many parameters, because most of them actually can be measured, you can fit anything you like, but there is more data points here than parameters, that's number one. And second, we actually bootstrapped it in some sense, and after fitting it to the Gregor's data, we also went and make sure that it reproduces all the experimental data which is already in the literature. So we have a basic substantial. Have a basic substantial confidence in our model, which we can use to try now all kinds of conceptual questions. Yes, Roger. What time did the experiments collect the data? Oh yeah, excellent question. So all this is for short time response. It's two minutes, five minutes. We also had 10 and 20, 10 and 50, and 20 and 60. So it's up to 60 minutes before any of the feedbacks kick in. So, no, I'm gonna talk about the I'm going to talk about the feedbacks in a second, but just to parametrize the model, it's only a short time. We can introduce SOCs, I mean, with reasonable parameterization, that's fine, we can do that too. We did it, but I'm not showing it here. This is just up to 60 hours precisely to avoid that problem. There is also internalization of the receptor, which I'm not talking about, which can also be included in the model, and we have reasonable confidence it works. So you inferred all the forward and backward. Inferred all the forward and backward rates or just KDs? So, all these rates are reasonably measured. The binding and binding and association rates, they're reasonably measured. Not all of them, but enough. So, basically, we're inferring just Kp dephosphorylation and some other rates like rate of internalization and things like that. So, that's the fitting parameters? There were several, obviously, fitting parameters, but not too many, actually. Maybe, I don't know. I can show you the table, but not too many fitting parameters. But not too many fitting parameters. So, okay, so the problem is that if you look here, there is no this region of absolute discrimination. In interferen beta and interference alpha, at any time point, they pretty much saturate to very similar levels, at least within the noise and within the fitting accuracy of the model. So we didn't see that region of absolute disc. Region of absolute discrimination, but it can appear, so probably just was unlikely with those particular mice or those particular interference. For instance, in a mutant which has different binding affinity to one of the subunits, one does recover this region of absolute discrimination. And also, the group of Ignacio Moraga, for many years and in many different systems, similar systems, not necessarily interference, like EPO, which is another. Which is another cytokine-like ligand, but they also saw pretty much what's predicted that you can recover this region of absolute discrimination between different ligands, which differ by different affinity. So that provides some limited possibility to distinguish at least between two ligands based on their affinities, unconfounded by their concentration. And in the interference system, it also can be induced by one of the long-term negative feedbacks. Term negative feedbacks, so-called USB-18, which appears more like after 16 hours and persists for 24 to 48 hours, which inhibits, which binds to one of the subunits and inhibits the amerization of the receptor, which means it effectively reduces one of these lateral binding constants, and then you do recover the region of absolute discrimination. So, at a given time point during immune response, how many of these cytokines? Response. How many of these cytokines are simultaneously present? Excellent question. So, excellent question. So, what I was talking about is just distinguishing between the two when they are present separately. So, at least we can know if it's interfering alpha or interferon beta, unconfounded by the concentration. Now, in reality, they could be present in a mixture, and the question is, what do you do then? This is, I think this is a, it would be nice to know. Is a it would be nice to know to answer to this question from people who know these things better. How many cytokines actually do appear together under different situations? Because that depends on the situation. How many cytokines the system sees together under different circumstances, that's not clear. So, in this case, it's actually possible that it never sees interferon alpha and beta together because they appear at different timings or in different tissues. But the general problem. Issues, but the general problem is there. So, what happens if you first have mixtures? But even before that, if you don't have mixtures, but you have a receptor where you're trying to distinguish not only two ligands, but a receptor which can bind, let's say, arbitrary number of 50 ligands and which is essentially an infinite number of ligands. And then you are back to the same problem that you cannot distinguish, you cannot You cannot infer two quantities, both concentration and affinity, from just one number, which is the output of the receptor. And that can be framed in the Bayesian language, what is the probability of concentration of the TD given the output. And I want to reformulate the problem specificity a little bit different than it's usually thought, not as a ratio of responses between two different receptors, but the problem of estimating. But the problem of estimating the KD from the signal output. And like I said, the problem is then that this posterior or likelihood it doesn't have a single minimum because in the CKD space many different combinations of Cs and K D's, like I said, will give you the same receptor plus noise. Receptor plus noise, also a little bit of a problem. So, what is the solution? So, and probably there are many solutions, but one of the solutions is there's nothing you can do about this. Maybe you can. Maybe I don't want to make too categorical statements. Maybe some very clever computer scientists can come up with something, but sort of as a pedestrian, it's a fundamental problem. You cannot infer multiple variables for measuring one variable. And the trivial solution is: well, you need more variables. So, for instance, So, for instance, you can, and that is where the point of crosstalk on the level or pleiotropy on the level of output of signaling output comes in, because it potentially provides the multiple variables for you to infer multiple inputs. So, there is a bit of a trick here. You cannot just add multiple studs to the receptor and have it done. And have it done because they have to be functionally dependent. So it cannot be that they're just all proportional to the occupancy of the receptor. But there are a number of ways to have functionally or dynamically independent outputs from a receptor. For instance, one of them is F21 classical sort of output where the bound receptor just keeps oscillating the output some rate. And another one is GPCR-like, which is pre-bound to the receptor and then unbinds when the ligand binds. Binds, when the ligand binds, and what the first one is counting the time the receptor is occupied, and the second ligand counts the number of times the binding and binding events occurs. And these are two dynamically distinguishable signals. Another way to get dynamically independent signals, a very classical thing, is the KPR, which is here not used for the purpose of enhancing discriminability, but solely provide dynamically independent output. So if in state one of the kinetic perfection discrimination. 1 of the kinetic profrading scheme produces one input, and in state 2 it produces another one, then one can have a reasonably, under some conditions, unambiguous mapping from the set of inputs to the set of outputs and vice versa. And then again, in the Bayesian thinking, this posterior is now well defined. You can infer these two inputs from the two outputs and have. From the two outputs, and have a reasonably one-to-one mapping from the input space to the output space with some noise. So, on the in the receptors, they are noisy, and at some point, of course, you can't take it to zero, you can't be distinguishing almost indistinguishable eigens, and there is some limit which is set by all kinds of sources of norms. So, at least in theory, that works. Now, the question is: okay, now what if you have mixtures? Now, if I have a mixture of two ligands, well, the question is just more variables. So, you can, now you can have, for instance, four-state KPR would work because now you can need to infer two concentrations and two binding affinities. Or you can do all kinds of mix and match of various scenarios. You can have two-state KPR with two variables at each state. At each state. As long as you have enough variables, you can infer back what the input was. So, of course, at some point it's going to break down because as the number of variables goes up and up, it's harder and harder to come up with enough independent variables. And also, the noise starts to kick in, which is very important for KPR. Yes, Georgia. So, Athen, do you need these variables to be independent or non-interacting for yourself? Or non-interacting for your scheme to work? They don't have to be fully independent, but they need to be partial, they are not, they must be linearly independent that one of them is not a direct function of the other. So do you have any like physical molecules in mind for this standards or so? Just a very sort of metaphorical example. So this could be stat 1, for instance, right? Right? And this could be STAT3, for instance, because there is evidence in the literature that might be that STAT1 is phosphorylated one receptor is bound and STAT3 is pre-bound and falls off when the ligand is binding. So I don't want to be responsible for what I said right now because it's probably not true about step 3. But there is some evidence that the different dynamical dependence might... Different dynamical dependence might be there in cytokines. And for the KPR-like again, that would be great to hear from the experts. So, if you have some sort of TCA and TCR complementation process, it's conceivable, but I don't know the details enough, it's conceivable that different stages in this process generate different signals. For instance, any one cheat one could play the role. For instance, yeah. So, there are people here who are much more experts on exactly what's happening in the world. Much more experts on exactly what's happening in some of these pathways. So, and it becomes more and more difficult because, especially for KPR-like schemes, the noise starts to become very important because the one, and it's been known since Timothy McKeithan from 30 years ago, one defining feature of KPR is that the response goes down as the number of steps goes up, because you have less and less and less and less product, which means the noise naturally becomes more and more. The noise naturally becomes more and more important. So, eventually, if you keep adding more steps in order to discriminate between more variables, at some point you will run into noise and it will kill it. And actually, if you do the calculation, it turns out that it's really not beneficial at all to increase the number of proofreading steps because the noise just kicks in and takes over everything. So, then this leaves us sort of still with the problem that we not. Still, with the problem that not always it's possible to find enough variables to have one-to-one mapping from input to output. And this is sort of one of the central problems, the bottleneck problem, that you have when you have multiple eigens, in this case, in this extreme case acting through the same receptor, but the number of outputs is not sufficient to determine them all unambiguously. And then, of course, can all go back into a large number. All go back into a large number of outputs. But the bottleneck is still there: that this combination of these multiple inputs still needs to map on a very small number of cell responses. And somehow, again, I don't want to make categorical statements, but typically it's not going to be lossless. Some information is going to be lost. So the question is how far we can go in mapping the combinations of input into the combinations of output for prior. Of output for practical purposes. And this very similar problem, slightly different, but very similar problem is when each ligand has their own receptor, which is common in cytokine signaling, but on the level of stats and the level of downstream receptor, everything is entirely cross-wired. It's different, but very similar conceptually problems. How am I doing on time? Okay, great. So this is. And so, this is the work which was done by Julie, Julie Midroni, exploring some of the theoretical questions, so how this mapping can work. And now I'm taking one, and for simplicity here, I'm not going to be focusing on the estimation of the affinity, but go back to the problem where we know what the ligands are in the mixture, and we only want to know what are their concentrations. So we know these are IL-2, IL-3, well, IL-2, IL3. IL-2, IL-12, IL-7, and IL-4, and we want to know in which combination are they present, which might signify what kind of infection is going on in the organism, or if it's cancer, or it's the virus, or it's the bacterium, or that kind of stuff. And the simplest case, like before, it works if you have only two inputs and you have two sufficiently independent outputs. And here it's again the kinetic prophyridic scheme where the first output. Friedig scheme, where the first output comes from the first state and the second output comes from the second state, you can have independent, unambiguous mapping from the input state, which is color-coded here, the concentration of DNA, a color-coded. You can map them onto the state of two outputs, which are called S1 and S3. And of course, at very high concentration, there is loss because everything becomes saturated. Loss because everything becomes saturated, it's impossible to infer anything. But here it's a reasonably good inference. The question is: what happens if you have more ligands than outputs? Because then you're in a situation when you need to map three-dimensional space of inputs onto a two-dimensional space of output. And again, generally, it's not possible to do it. It's possible, but what is possible? It turns out to be possible. But what is possible? It turns out to be possible to have some distinct combinations of cytokines, cytokine concentration, to map them into distinct combination of outputs. And in this case, it was done just by solving the whole system of ODEs corresponding to the signaling system and optimizing it using a genetic algorithm to minimize the overlap of the outputs between three different ligands. Between three different ligands, A, B, and C, as you can see, it can be achieved reasonably well. And so, in order to understand a little better what is going on, we notice that what it does, it's in a way both topologically and conceptually similar to what classifier neural networks do. So, it takes an input of multiple variables on the input and it classifies them into a smaller number of bins. So, it's a disc. Smaller number of bins. So it'd say this AB and C combination is bin 1, and this combination of AB and C is bin 2, and this combination is bin 3, and so on and so forth. And topologically, that's what those neural networks do. They have input nodes which go through some sort of interlayer of nodes, which corresponds to some processing on the receptor level, and finally, or on the stat level, and then they end up with these outputs, which corresponds to the level. With these outputs, which correspond to the functional outputs. And this is just the whole scheme of the actual neural network that was done. And the neural network does exactly the same thing as the genetic algorithm on the original full signaling network do, and it can recover these non-overlapping sets. So this is nice, but with one caveat, which I don't know what to do about, is that out of Do about is that out of necessity there are holes in the input space. So there is lots of inputs which are not mapped on anything or they're mapped on some junk. And I'm not sure this problem is solvable. And that goes back to the question, what are the combinations that the cell is actually seeing in any reasonable situation? And it's quite conceivable that there are lots of combinations of cytokines it's never expected to see except on some extremely pathological conditions. Extremely pathological conditions, and therefore it's not wired to discriminate between those. And when it encounters those, potentially it goes haywire. So, now about the experimental verification. So, if anybody could do it, that would be great. And how am I doing on time? One minute. One minute. Okay. So, just really, really one minute. So, but, and that sort of goes in a completely And that sort of goes in a completely separate project. Cells naturally interact both in time and in space. And also in immunology, maybe the spatial component is not that important, but maybe it is. The spatial arrangement of various different cell types in the lymph node, in the thymus, is very important. And then the question is: what happens if you couple multiple cells with different complicated cell cellular phenotypes? Complicated cell cellular phenotypes through signaling, what do they do collectively? What kind of tissue phenotypes do they acquire, and how do they arrange in them in space? That connects to a little bit to Armita's work, where each cell can be thought in this old, very old idea of adding to an epigenetic landscape. It can be mapped onto as a sort of as a very crude model to have a system with multiple phenotypic states onto a spin glass, and these spin glasses can be mapped, can be put on a lattice in order to. Can be put on a lattice in order to see what kind of tissues they form. And it turns out that they can form all kinds of very weird tissues in a lattice, but if you cluster them by types, if you do some sort of machine learning to try to cluster what kind of types of tissue to recovers, meaning is it stripes or is it holes or is it squares or is it dots? It turns out that even for very complex interaction networks, the final number, at least in this very artificial model, the least in this very artificial model, the final number of tissue phenotypes is relatively small and is relatively structured. So just as a summary, so the crosstalk is really ubiquitous problem in signaling both in immunology and in tons of other systems. And well like I showed Ribs receptor demerization provides some limited solution in some cases and maybe Solution in some cases, and maybe just maybe that's it's a reason, evolutionary reason, why the diameric receptors are so ubiquitous in signaling pathways, because it's a pedestrian way to avoid complex conformational changes in response to every different ligand. You just need to have slightly different affinities to different to both subunits in order to have differential responses. The pleiotropy, the ability to have different outputs from the same input, may resolve it, may resolve the crosstalk problem, and it's really a part. It seems like it might be the crosstalk and the pleiotropy could be a part of the decoding mechanism in these cross-wire pathways. And compressive mapping, I don't think we still have a good grasp of what is going on there exactly. Going on there exactly, and we need experimental tests. And finally, coupling cells with complex phenotypes through signaling, which can affect those phenotypes, can result in rather intricate spatial cellular phenotypes. But on the other hand, their number and complexity can be well controlled. Complexity can be well controlled even within very complex interaction networks.
