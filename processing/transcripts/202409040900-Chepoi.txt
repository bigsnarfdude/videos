Uh I'm sorry I'm carrying my mask, you don't seem very well. Uh so the title is uh final complex and it's a giant work and it's uh And in the talk, I try to outline the solution to conjecture by Hester Gray. Uh so the Scott is a prof uh Alex Scott is a professor at uh Oxford and uh Alex Pickerson the postdocs at Oxford. And the conjecture you have the title of the paper, the Kaziro components of non-relation. Fine. They solved the conjecture for dimension two. So what's the statement of the conjecture? Does it mean to be bound to be with it? Sorry? So what does it mean to be bound to be used? I will explain it in. They solve the conjecture in dimension 2 and in dimension 3 by embedded in F3. So what uh what is boundary rigidity? Actually this originates from uh Riemannian geometry, but there is a bold conjecture by Michel. I will speak about it. But I will formulate now uh this what but in uh the B bound In the B boundary region. So suppose that you have a cell or say a finite cube complex, and I will call the cells, the cubes faces and the facet. So if I say is a face of X and the C prime is the subface, Subface. C prime is a subface. Then C prime is called a facet. It is maximum by inclusion. Profit phase of C facet maximum. Now the boundary of boundary could be called the combinatorial boundary boundary of a p-complex is a downward closure, downward closure. Of all non-maximal faces that are facet of a unique face, larger phase, that are facets of a unique Unique place this example if I take this face, this edge, it is a facet of a unique face as well. Face square. Therefore, this is in the boundary. And then I take downward portion, I take smaller subfaces. Therefore, in this case, boundary would be this one. If I had here a pendant edge, what will be the boundary? At low point? An extra point, yeah. All the red part plus an extra point. So is this the same as the union of the elementarily collapsible bases, free faces? Yeah, we can say. Okay, and now um this is the ball. This is the boundary, and the one skeleton, you know what is the one skeleton of X, and we will consider the metric, and they consider the metric in the one skeleton. And now we say that a class boundary region a class of complexity. A class of complexes C is boundary region if for any two complexes X, X prime in C such that there is a isometry from the boundary of X to boundary of X prime. This isometry, isometry. And when I speak about isometry, this is About isometry. This is a kind of I compute the distances in the graph on the just distance preserving map. And it can be raised to extend it to an isometry extended to isometry. The max x prime. If say the boundaries isomorphic and isometric, if you compute the distance in the complexes, then the complexes are isometric. So, here in this case, what will be the What what will will be the input information would be the distances in the one skeleton between all the red vertices here? Yeah, this will be the input and we forget the the all other vertices and the boundary rigidity will mean that we can reconstruct in a unique way the the context and the the historic The history shadow I'm just reading. That simple simple bounded compact manifolds volume. A boundary region. So, here the strong condition is simple. I will not tell because myself understand very well, but this implied like cut zero, is a most elliptic monstrometer, cut zero. And uh it was solved in dimension two. Could be dimension two. This dimension two festival and minimum and in high dimension there are only two cases which are solved by Burago or Ivanov and by the son and the qualters. So it's wide to be open. And then more recently More recently, Itai Dan Benyamini asked in the combinatorial context, namely he conjectured that we know systolic or six large plane triangulations are called the red range. So objection, objection. So objection. Uh historic plane action up boundary. And uh has a grave solved it answer but And in the same papers, you also solve the planar quadrangulations, which I mean, which are cut zero in the plane. And then come in the paper by this four outers, which with a 34th they saw. With the tool de force, they solve the two-dimensional case and the three-dimensional embedded case. They usually use non-positive curvature. So and now we'll give a solution without, but using graphs. Okay, what is the artist? Now, what I will use in the talk is the bijection between Kaziro Kip complexes and medium groups. So, everybody knows what Kaziro keep complexes are. And uh in fact, uh the one skeleton of each Kadzero complex is a median graph, and if you take a median graph and you replace all graphic Q by solid Q, you get the Kadziero section. I will not define medium graphs, simply the part between nodes, but simply I can give my characterization. When I prove this bijection, median graphs, I median graphs are the graphs. In which it's quite complex. It's simply connected. And we have this case of Roma ping condition. Pink condition just in dimension two. Whenever you put three squares in this position, you complete them in a usual definition, but this is equivalent, no? And uh usually when people uh do research on uh When people do research on cat-zero peak complexes, they use hyperplanes. And we don't use hyperplanes at all. We will use three elementary properties of medium gaps, the adeuptive complexes, which are listed here. Everybody knows the hike starts at 11:55 at the long time. So the the problem is which uh use Which uh we use. Um the first is called the quadrangle condition, which is a usual, in fact you're saying that whenever you have such edges and you have a market, so you have x d X indeed and Y so that this distance is k this distance is k and this distance is k plus 1 one step further then you have a common neighbor of u and d say it white frame a distance k minus one so whenever you So, whenever you have the CP edges downward going, you complete them in a squatter. It's probably coming from lattice theory. And in fact, more general thing holds. This is something which we will not use what it is. Which generalize this from two neighbors to arbitrary neighbors. So if you will have not two but three, you will span a three kilo. If you will have four, you will have a four kilo. And if you take all neighbors which are closer to y than x, you will span a cube of perspective dimension. So I will draw in case of three. This is a if you have x and y, you take all neighbors which are closer to y than x, then you spam a cube. And the opposite to x vertex of this cube but will be the closest to y. The this cube du doesn't lie this way. Cube doesn't lie this way. It should. And the third condition actually recalls for all convex sets in a considerable cube convex, is that cubes are gated. Cubes. You know what gated set is well. Okay, so we. Okay, so it's easy to gated means means that if you take a vertex outside the set, the set is gated, there is a unique projection, but not only unique, but it's much stronger that there is a unique x prime, so that for any y in S, there is a shortest path from y to x prime value in x prime. Y to x prime via x prime, via the gate, so to speak. It was defined in operational research and also in the work of it on buildings. And we will use just the cubes idea. Okay, now I want to define the notion of corner. Corner The corner is a vertex belonging to a unique maximal human. It's clear of the coordinates. So I erase the grid. How many corners do we have? In this case, four. This is not the corner because it belongs to maximum. But um one can ask what each uh Whether each median graph has corners, and in fact, yes, it has. And even it has something more interesting, which will call corner filling. Corner feeling. So this is a cornering. D1, D2, DM. Could be also communicated. Could be also for infinite draft fine such that Vi is a coordinate of the graph Gi which is induced by the first ion vertices. So Uh the last vertical should be a corner of the graph, but uh when I remove it, I can create other columns. By just if I remove this, I create this corner and this corner. Then I can either remove this corner or this corner. Just for fun, there is an example of a Of a 12-dimensional cube, that you remove, remove, remove corners, and you get something without any corner. You get stuck. Therefore, we should be a little bit careful. We should do it in a systematic way, and therefore we will use a mod on the pillar. This is a coordinate link such that d uh we have a vertex z there exists a vertex base point z such that d z one d z d two plus d z d n halts. So this is a corner filling such that the vertices are ordered by this time. The vertices are ordered by distances. And in fact, the proposition holds that for any set and any which is the reverse of what I am saying for we can such. Okay. This is uh Therefore, imagine that you just pick a point, your preferred point, the cat zero key complex, and you order quite this pass from this point away and take the reverse ordering, and this is a coordinate. Okay, now um Um I'll show how we use uh monoton coordinate pilling for reconstruction. Uh first of all, um if we have a few uh lemma which is uh simple but uh okay, uh sorry, I got ticks. So let's say V1, V2, DM be monotone of filling and then we denote by Gi the graph by first the boundary of G i the boundary of this graph. For this graph and the the complex x i the q complex to G I etc now the lemma is saying that if if All vertices of the cube. All vertices of the unique cube containing the i of Gi. Containing Gi except except Except the opposite belong to the boundary. What is saying this lemma? So imagine that we. So imagine that you just take a corner of a EGM graph. This is a pure graph X. And we know by what we said before, that there is this cube here, C. And I will denote by B bar the opposite in this cube. And you can imagine that this is a cornerstone. The graph looks like this. Graph look like this, yeah? And then you we can have tendency to think that the boundary of V is in the boundary, the corner is in the boundary. But all the rest of the cube is not in the boundary. But no, this is not true. In fact, everybody from this cube is in the boundary except the opposite vertics. Why? Why? Because if Because if I take so any vertex, any vertex which is not is different from the bar, it belongs to a facet of this cube. But now, if this vertex is not in the boundary, it should this facet should belong to the second queue. Yeah? But then we'll get that the But then we will get that the vertex V will belong to two cubes, which is impossible. So in fact, the boundary is much larger than I think. And the second is a result I will not prove but is essential. Is essential, demo 3. Showing how the boundary evolves when we remove the coordinate. So, of course, it's natural that it will not evolve too much. And this is true that for any i, the boundary of gi minus 1 is included in the boundary of gi. The boundary of GI union UI I will use UI now. UI okay UI where UI sorry I mean that's here this is a unique cube this is CI the cube and this is uh B I uh UI the uh the opposite of the i in the cube. So the boundary uh the new boundary may The new boundary may extra contain only the what is opposite to the i. And the boundary of gi, in fact, is contained in S Gi, which I forget to define, which we call the extended bound extended bound. What is the extended boundary? It's very simple. Extended boundary is constructed by us. At the beginning, extended boundary. Sn, the last, is just the boundary of the graph. Is uh just the boundary of the graph. Yeah, the last graph. And uh s n s i minus one is equal s i minus p i union union p i. I I have to explain uh what uh there is a real boundary. There is a real boundary, which we remove and evolve. And there is an extended boundary, a set of vertices which contain the boundary, see? The real boundary. And this will be the set of vertices for which we will know the distances. We will have the information about the distances. See? This is a Are you removing VI and then adding UI? Yeah, I remove the procedure is like that. When you do the coronet filling, we take connected TPI, we remove it and we remove it from the extended boundary, but in the extended boundary we The extended boundary, we add the opposite in the shoot of this vertex. But this vertex UI, what is important? I wrote here that the inclusion is not the equality. The vertex UI sometimes could be the boundary, new boundary, and in some places it is not. But you know, but we will know the distance from UI to the U.S.. The distance from UI to everybody. This is the end of bow and all the reconstruction. So reconstruction. So we start, the input information is what? Is the boundary of the complex. So we have input is a bound of G which we have. of uh G, which we will call uh Gm plus G. And the distance matrix uh the distances uh between the purpose and load development and the distance matrix. Central. And now step this is the step I. What we are doing at step I. This is a little bit algorithmic. So the reconstructor, the person who built, we call it reconstructor, the reconstructor Uh select uh vertex of Vi of Si farthest from ah, I forgot. I'm sorry, I had the picture at the beginning, sorry, I forgot one in the in the One in the input. And we have z, a base point which belongs to the boundary. So we fix some base point, arbitrary point, but on the boundary, z. And all the time we will take fathers from z, the vertexes. Okay, the reconstructor selects the vertex VI or SI fathers from Z. And what he will do? Here will do and set Si minus one equal P equal to S i minus I and this is first and second. What he has to do is remove the He removed the eye at this he add UI and he want to he have to compute the distance from UI to all the vertices from S, from Si. This is how to do this. And here we use the fact that the cubes are gated. Yeah? What we know that all vertices in the cube, in this cube, except U1, they are present. Therefore, for any vertex T, we know the distances to all the vertices of the cube except Y. Yep? And do we know that, in fact. And do you know that, in fact, either the gate of T on the cube is a UI or the gate of T on the cube is something different. Do you agree that if the gate of T on the cube is UI, then the neighbors of UI will have the same distance to T. Because this is Because this is uh one step further. Yeah. Therefore, in this case we will know that uh we don't know the gate this is because uh but almost now because UI is missing but if there are several vertices which all the vertices here have the same distance to t then ui is the gate of t and the distance from ui to t is a distance from any neighbor of t. From any neighbor of UI to t minus 1, and we know. Now, another case is even more simple. If the minimum of the cube minus this vertex is realized just once, then we will take this as a gate, and we will take the distance to this gate plus the distance in the cube from this vertex to equal it. In this case, we have. In this case, we update the discourse. And what happened is, in this case, we removed the i, added ui. We don't know whether ui is in the real boundary of gi minus 1, but we know the distance from ui to all potential vertices in the boundary. And therefore we have more information, care more information all the time. This is the idea of the The idea. So here I show what compute the distance matrix. Can you give us an easy example where UI isn't in the boundary? Just have a vertex and an edge for it. Hang an edge off, hang a spur off of that UI. You are. I think the example I had was a grid with one pendant. You see the... Yeah, no, I don't. Just trial on the grid. So if VI is this, this is UI. But what happened? That we will remove the eye, we will add UI, and we will know the distance from UI to all the boundaries. So this is the main idea. In fact, we to prove correctness, we need to a graph GI. The graph gi and gi minus one, we don't know them. You see? We just imagine you have the big grid. How the reconstruction is done. The reconstruction is done from the boundary. We start to know more and more and more. And the part which we don't know is the inner part. And this is GI. We don't know, but what we show that what we do with what the What we do with what the information we have is not wrong. It's a good information to deal with Gi. And at the end, we show that this is isomorphic to the input graph of Gi. Okay, I'm done. Questions for picture? Uh does this work for a wider family of graphs? family of graphs. I mean if you're just using particular properties. No, in this way uh gatedness is uh strong, uh you don't have a gatedness. It was one open question is what this kind of approach is dismantling was historic complexity. And in fact we now to prove for two-dimensional system. So the result of Castle Grave was So the result of Hesseltray was for one hour. We can do for two dimensional. But it's not uh so simple. Here we have this proposition which is saying that uh any word within such depth it's a monotone coordinate field. And uh uh and uh we don't have this in uh systolic case. Um So, if you start with your set that's supposed to be a boundary, but it happens that the distances can't be the boundary of a meteor craft. And you run this procedure, what happens? Yeah, this is a good question. Because in some cases, this could be difficult. This could be difficult for the stuff. If you look at the one-dimensional case, this is a phylogenetic tree reconstruction. And if your input data does not fit the tree metric, well, we probably will give an answer. No. But I should be careful. I think you'd give an answer, no? Yes. So you'll maybe the So you you maybe the gadgeting one will also be collected. There are no more questions. That's like Mr. Records. And we will resume in seven minutes. I think so.
