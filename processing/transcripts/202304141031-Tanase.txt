All right, welcome back. It's a pleasure to introduce Ranu Catadaza, who is going to coming from the Romanian Academy of Academy. Exactly, okay. It's going to give a talk about the critical optimized amount of candidates. Thank you for the intro. Thank you for the introduction. I would like to take a moment and thank the organizers for putting together such a lovely conference where the subject of HenomNaps is prevalent. And my talk is going to be in the Henom family. The advantage of speaking in the last day is that most of the background of the Henon family has already been set, so I don't need much introduction. I will just remind you, or I don't know what. Or I don't know, point out that I'm working for quadratic Henon maps, complex quadratic Henon maps. And for me, a Henon map is going to be written in this particular parametrization. The dynamical objects are well known, and in this talk, I will focus mostly on the escaping sets on the sets u plus and u minus, which are the complements of K plus and K minus. So the dynamics in U plus and U minus is that everything escapes to infinity in other either forward or backward derivations. Forward or backwards. Now, of course, everybody working in Henon maps knows that there are some fundamental differences between 1D and 2D, which could be partially attributed to the lack of a proper analog for critical points in the two-dimensional setting. In 1D dynamics, at least in polynomial dynamics, we can link many important dynamical and topological properties of the map. Properties of the map to the presence of critical points, such as, for instance, the connectivity of the Juria set or the hyperbolicity of the polynomial on its Juria set. These are notions that can be linked to the critical points. And of course, the bound on the critical points also helps in understanding and classifying the types of dynamics that one can have. In 2D, the problem, well, not the problem, but the But one particular issue is that the Henon map is a biologomorphism 1C2, which on one side helps, and on the other side, there are no critical points in the usual sense. So we cannot make such a clean analogy or dichotomy or something right in the one-dimensional setup. These differences, they reflect in the different methods. Reflecting the different methods we need to see and understand the Hennon maps. But also, it's well known to the experts that there are not just different methods that one should take into account, there are true, genuine, different phenomenons that happen in the two-dimensional world. For example, the New Haus phenomenon that there exists a non-maps with infinitely many things, or various coexistence phenomenons which provide some sort of intermediate examples between. Some sort of intermediate examples between small perturbations when the Jacobian is small and the new house phenomena, so coexistence phenomenons, where you have clear tracking periodic orbits and some other phenomenon happening. Now, these things which make the distinction between 1D dynamics and 2D dynamics again can be partially attributed to the lack of critical points. So what we'd like to understand What we'd like to understand over here is some notions of critical points that would make us able to understand some parts of dynamics. Since I'm focusing first on the escaping locus, let me tell you over here the C T plus and T minus. You probably already know them. But one way to visualize them is that there is a Howard filtration picture of C two. Hover filtration picture of C2, in which the dynamical plane is divided into three regions, V, V plus, and V minus. Everything that escapes to infinity goes through V plus. Everything that escapes to infinity at the backward time goes through V minus, which makes it possible to present U plus and U minus in this nice way, as sequences of backward iterates of U plus and sequences of forward iterates of U minus in the second case. U minus in the second case. Now, U plus and U minus, they're sort of nice objects because they have a well-understood structure for all kinds of N1 maps. We don't need to put a restriction on the Jacobian or on the particular dynamics. The analytic structure of U plus is given as a quotient of the outside of the protein in this plus C, so that's a complex. plus C, so that's a complex manipulator that we look at, quotiented by a group of automorphisms of C minus C bar plus C, which is isomorphic to 0 over 1 over 2 over C. This discrete group of automorphisms has probably discontinuously resulted points. The quotient over here is a manifold. So U plus has a nice manifold structure. And from here, from the manifold structure description, you can already Description, you can already kind of see that your class is foliated by these complex planes, which are somehow immersed in a complicated way in situ. But you can already kind of visualize the foliation by complex plates. There is some rigidity over here in this description in the sense that if you take two henon maps, two quadratic henon maps, which have pyromorphic. Which have bioromorphic escaping sets and which preserve this kind of structure, then the two Hennon maps are necessarily identical. So there is some sort of rigidity which is embedded over here. Okay. Now, since my aim is to focus towards the critical locus, I will introduce the critical loci as tangences between various volations and the volume. And the Fourier that I have in mind over here are the Fourier set U and the escaping set U minus. For the escaping set U plus, one way to visualize the Fourier is by the HOV theorem, but we can also visualize it intrinsically by just looking at the Bercher coordinate. There is an analog of the Bercher coordinate for the Hannon map. This is unfortunately not well defined on the escaping set U plus. On the escaping set U plus, but it is well defined on D. And there is this function which semi-conjugates the Hennon map, to z goes to z squared, and which behaves like projection on the force coordinate as you let xy go to infinity and decrease. This one defines a dynamical foriation by just taking its level sets. This dynamical variation at first is only defined in P plus. Defined in V. There are topological obstructions for extending P plus as a holomorphic function on U, but it doesn't prevent the holomorphic variation from extending. Because for the holomorphic volation to extend, all we need to do is to take this kind of formula and then we don't have V plus well defined on H inverse of V plus, but we have V plus squared well defined on H inverse of V plus. well defined on H inverse of V plus, which means that these two level sets of V plus on V plus fit inside a bigger level set of V plus square in H inverse of V plus. And so on and so of course we can just extend. And what you are looking at over here is a schematic picture of a fiber of the variation of V plus inside U plus. And this is of course a pure group. And this is of course a biolomorphic to C. Okay. Now we can do the very same thing for U minus using the other virtual coordinate, the one that conjugates H inverse to Z squared Obian. And these ones, these variations of the escaping set T plus and T minus, they're not everywhere. They're not everywhere transverse to each other. There are critical points that they create. There are tangencies between these two formations. And the critical local C is exactly the set of these tangencies. Now, C can also be defined as the zero set of a holomorphic function over here, W. And as the zero set of a holomorphic function, you can see it. Can see it as an analytic set. Now it's an actual theorem of Bertie that this set C is always non-empty. So no matter what kind of phenomena we take, these variations will always have some tendencies. Now, this is the object that I would like to focus also my time studying, but also in connection to the other types of. But also in connection to the other types of critical loci that are worth of. At the moment, let's just think of C as a non-empty clause analytic sub-variety of the intersection of the forward escaping and the backward escaping set, of course invariant under the MN. In general, there are also other notions of critical loci, for instance, the stable. Loci. For instance, the stable and the unstable critical loci. Unstable critical loci would be the set of tangencies between the Fourierations of U plus and the lamination of J minus. And this is written in quotation marks because J plus and J minus are not always laminar. But there is a sense in which one can still define the critical loci, stable and unstable critical loci, even when we lose this laminarity, because new homonyms. Lose this laminarity because almost every point has a stable and unstable manifold. So we can still talk about the tangencies between, let's say, a stable manifold and the voluation of the escaping setups. So we have these notions of unstable and unstable critical, right? And in general, it's not exactly known how they fit together with the tangencies with the critical opposite. With the critical locus, see that I have defined on the previous slide. In particular, it is not true that the stable critical locus is the boundary of the critical locus intersected with J plus intersected with U minus, and that the unstable critical locus would be the boundary of the critical locus in J minus enter U plus. So the relation between this critical loci is poorly understood in general. Poorly understood in general. Now, the advantage of working with one critical loci versus the other is that the critical locus C is always there, it's always non-empty. Whereas the stable critical locus and the unstable critical locus, one of them may be empty or not, depending on whether we put restrictions on the Jacobian or not. So the critical locusiness is in some sense a little bit more general. What kind of What kind of general things are we looking at from the dynamical perspective when talking about this critical opus? We would like to understand general properties of the critical opus. Since it's an analytic set, it may or may not have singularities. If there are singularities, we would like to understand what kind of singularities it will have. If it's always most, we'd like to know that as well. Know that as well. We would like to understand topological models of the critical locus. We would like to understand the relation between the critical loci, see the stable critical locus, unstable critical locus. We would also like to maybe connect the critical locus to dynamical properties of the map, such as the connectivity of the Julia set, like in the one-dimensional dynamics, and also understand the connections between, let's say, the bifurcation. Between, let's say, the bifurcations of the Julia set and the bifurcations in the critical locus. For instance, we would like to understand the dependency of the critical locus on parameters as we converge to a semi-parabolic parameter within the parabolic implosion region. This is something a little bit more technical, but maybe I'll get to it in due course. These questions, as formulated, we cannot answer them in the general We cannot answer them in the generality stated in here because we don't understand, unfortunately, as much about the critical locus. But I can show you some instances in which certain answers can be provided. First of all, I will just start with a relation between critical points and the connectivity of the Julia set, which is not between the critical. Which is not between the critical locus that I have presented, but it's between the stable and the unstable critical loca and the connectivity, which says that if you have a reciprocal complex anomaly, then the connectivity of the Juria set can be decided by looking at the unstable manifold of a saddle periodic point and seeing whether there are seeing whether the black over here is connected, which is a good. Disconnected, which is equivalent to the absence of this set of critical points. This critical point over here would be a tangency between the unstable manifold, which is unfolded over here, and the foliation of liquids. So this kind of thing would prevent the Julia accept from being polluted. That's one connection with the connectivity that we already know. Now, going towards the critical locus, the one that sits inside U plus and U minus, there are just a few instances in which one can understand explicitly the models for the critical ops. One of these instances is depicted over here in a CRM by Lubich and Robertson. It's in the perturbative context. It's in the perturbative context. So we consider Henon maps, which are small perturbations of a hyperbolic radiic polynomial with connected Julia set. And then there exists a unique primary component of the critical locus, which is asymptotic at infinity to the x-axis. All the other components of the critical locus are forward and backward iterates of this primary one. They're disjoint, they don't intersect. Disjoint, they don't intersect each other as components, they also term components. And within the primary component, what we can see is that it's biologomorphic to the outside of the unit disk, and it's therefore transverse to the foliations of U plus and minus. And its boundary has a connection to the Julia set. So its boundary, which no longer sits in U plus and T minus, which Within J plus and the minus, this one is for me more to usually asset J. Let me, if it's the first time when you see this theorem, you might have a hard time visualizing what goes on. So let me show you a real picture over here. This is produced with an old program, Tangencies, by John Hubbard. So you have a component of the critical lotus. Critical lotus over here, which is asymptotic to the x-axis again. But I should tell you first what is plotted over here. Blood and the end, red and the blue are the points where you take dg plus, which dg minus. This gives you the term would be positive. This is coming up. So plotted in red in all the regions where this determinant is Where this determinant is greater than zero or less than zero. At the common boundary, you see the points on the critical locus where the determinant is equal to zero, where dg plus, where dg minus is equal to zero. So when looking for the critical locus, one should look at the boundaries between blue and red. But in black is the interior of T plus. This is a simple parameter over here. It's taken, C is taken from the main value into the model product Z. You end up with the world set, and the Jacobian A is small, so you don't have much action going on in the interior of P. Just focus on the complement of the interior of P plus. You have over here a primary component going into bringing forward, you see these components. Backward, you see a component which is asymptotic to the y-axis, and these backward details are going to be somewhere on the table. So this is a real picture. So, this is a real picture, just a real picture to give you an indication. And the way in which the primary component sort of approaches J plus is that over here you see a quasi-circle, and that's the Julia set of the one-dimensional polymer, sort of. Okay, now having information about the critical locus gives us a powerful way to describe. Way to describe some topological models for the Julia set J plus because we have a universal structure for the escaping set U plus which is given as a quotient of C minus D plus C by a group H. So whenever we have a critical locus that we understand, that is nicely transfers to the relations of U plus, J plus. And that we understand, and this is a very important thing. Very important thing, then we can extend the analytic structure of this to J plus. So some application is something that I don't have perturbations of a hyperbolic polynomial response to Julia set. Then you can describe the Julia set J plus as a portion of S1 plus C by a display group of automorphism seismometric C of one half divided by C. One half divided by z, and by an equivalence relation, but the equivalence relation is explicitly dictated by the polynomial. So we can connect the topological properties of the Julia set to the properties of the critical locus. And also one other aspect to keep in mind over here is that in the Lubbies-Robertson description of the critical locus, the critical locus is disconnected, whereas the Julia set is connected. Is connected, so that's a dichotomy that we'd like to have in more instances than just singular perturbations. Okay, now what I would like to talk about is not actually the critical locus in the connectivity region, but the critical locus in the disconnectivity region. And this is what I'm talking about now. What I'm talking about in Nawani, it's part of joint work with Tanya Filsovanier and Mustradu. We are looking not exactly at the entire Horse region, but at a subset of the Horse region, which is the HOV region. So we are assuming, we are putting a certain constraint on C and A of the following sort. Absolute value of C is greater than zeta than one plus absolute value of B squared. This is the H of V region. This is the HOV region. And we know that the Helon map in this case is hyperbolic, and the Julia set is a complex function. Already over here, I'm showing you a picture with the Julia Set J plus and the Julia SJ minus in blue. So J minus is in blue, J plus is in red. The critical locus is again at the boundary between red and blue. And this is just And this is just a real picture. It doesn't necessarily provide all the needed intuition for the complex picture. This is in the maximal entropy region where the entire Julia, the entire complex Julia set is contained in the real. It looks from the picture that the critical locus would be disconnected in the real, right? Because we have something going from here and it's disconnected everywhere. So there seem to be many components of the critical locus to talk about. Locus to talk about, but we will see that in the complex they are actually all connected. So in this case, the critical locus will be connected in the complex space. Okay, so now what I would like to sell to you today is that the critical locus picture is actually something complementary to the Horseshoe picture. So you think you understand the Horseshoe picture and it's true. Understand the horseshoe picture, and it's true that we understand it. But it's also a lot of structure going on in the component of the horseshoe picture, which seems to be sort of there for all kinds of horseshoes. Okay, so our theorem over here, which is actually listed as a bunch of results, is that there exists beta meta than two, which you can actually compute, such that the following results fall throughout the H of beta. Results fall throughout the HOV beta region. The critical locus of the Hermann map is a smooth irreducible complex analytic sub-variety of U plus and U minus of pure dimension one. This is listed more as the language of algebraic geometry, but we can actually produce a specific model. So the critical opposite is homeomorphic to a Riemann sphere of infiniteness. Of infiniteness, which is a countable collection of truncated spheres, Sn indexed by the integer numbers, where every two such spheres is connected by countably many angles. These spheres are, everything is glued together by their nets. So I'll show you some pictures in this context. In any case, this is kind of the opposite of what Lubich and Robert. Opposite of what Lubich and Robertson have. In their case, the Julia acid is connected and the critical locus is disconnected. In this case, the Julia acid is disconnected and the critical locus is connected. Which kind of suggests a general question over here whether there is a general phenomenon happening for all sorts of Henon maps that the Julia SNG of the Henon map is connected if and only if the critical Disconnected if and only if the critical locus is disconnected. We don't have the means to add this kind of question in general, but we believe it could hold true for the hyperbolic ones for which we have more information. So the kind of hyperbolic maps that Dujardin talked about, that Romain Dujardin talked about the last. The last information over here on the slide is about how the critical optical C fits together with the stable and the unstable critical oli. And as it turns out, the accessible boundary of the critical optical C is the union of the stable and the unstable critical locus. So these, they don't form as much as the boundary of the critical locus. They form only a subset. And the entire boundary of the critical locus C is actually plus and C. C is actually j plus and the j minus. Going back to the force picture over here, just a second. So if I do the force picture over here, you would see these components accumulating forward on the Julia set J minus and accumulating. J minus and accumulating backward on the Julia said J plus. So it's not hard to believe that the boundary of the critical locus itself is J plus union J minus. It's the other part of the information that is very important here. That the accessible boundary of the critical locus is the stable critical locus in the NGS stable locus. Now this truncated sphere model was Now, this truncated sphere model was conjectured by John Howard. It was previously proved for by Tanya Firsova in the perturbative setting when you have small Jacobian and perturbations of hyperbolic Henomaps with this one and future sets. And we are now proving it for the HOV region. Okay, now I would like to explain the model to you and show. To you and show you where it comes from in relation to the Hussh. So, to understand how a truncated sphere looks like, on a first glance, is more reasonable to understand it started from the polynomial. Although once we start a Pauchial construction, we'll kind of lose the polynomial and understand it intrigues. So, you have the disconnected Anto-Julia set of quadratic polynomials. You have a negative potential over there, which is a circle. You keep what's in step. You keep what's inside, you eliminate from here some disks which are centered at the critical point zero and at all the pre images of the critical point zero. And you view, you also remove the counter Julia set. And a complement, whatever is blue over here and in shades of blue, you keep and you think of this one as a punctured disk that can be used to produce the northern. Can be used to produce the northern hemisphere of a sphere whose southern hemisphere is exactly the same thing. So we take this one, duplicate it, and do it around the extra potential. These are removed, the control set is also removed. So the resulting object is what we call a truncated sphere over here, where the sphere is the complement of the group. Here is the complement of the glue and the complement of the yellow seats. The yellow discs serve as gluing points for the handles. So this is how two spheres would be connected. Two consecutive spheres in the sphere model, they would be connected by one single handle going from the northern hemisphere of sphere SN to the southern hemisphere of Sphere SM. The southern hemisphere of sphere Sm plus 1. These are the big disks that would correspond to the critical points here. If you talk about how two spheres which are two levels apart connected, so that would be sphere SN connected with sphere Sn plus 2. These are connected by two handles and these handles, you see they are centered at the first number of images of the critical story. Of the critical slope with the same things over. So we are always connecting things which are compatible on the upper hemisphere with things which are compatible on the lower hemisphere. So basically, sphere SN and sphere SN plus K are connected by 2 to the K minus 1 handles constructed in this way. Okay, now on the spheres over here, it's also possible to visualize the To visualize the stable critical logi and the unstable critical loci, these are exactly the counter sets that we have over here. So, well, whatever you have on top will be the stable critical set, whatever you have on the bottom will be the unstable critical set. These are removed on our model because we only consider the critical objective plus x minus. But we see that there are accessible. They are accessible. I will explain it a little bit later in just a second. Okay, so I've explained the model, but I want to sort of explain how this picture comes naturally from the horseshoe construction. We all know the horseshoe construction. We take a MATIDIS, we fold it straight, we map it forward like that. We map it forward like that and backward like that. Now, what I want to do is, I do not want to look inside the nested sequence which goes to the Julia sets J plus and J minus. I would rather look in the complement. So, I look in the complement between consecutive levels of intersections of disks. I will look in this by this, let it by this be, and then this horizontal. And then this horizontal long tube, VH, V V sits between V and H inverse of V. So this one, under one iterate, is going to go to V plus. This one, under one iterate, is going to go into V minus. It's going to go to V. And what I track over here is not the pre-images of the body disk V intersected with V. Intersected with V and all of its nested sequence going to the Julia acids G plus and G minus, but rather I look at the forward images of the horizontal tube. These are the thin gray strips inside. I don't know if you can see the colors properly. I only see the bright light coming from the projector, so I see a lot of spots over here on the horseshoe. And I am also And I am also tracking the pre-images of the vertical tube, which are the green tubes depicted over here. This gray tube would sit between H inverse of V and H iterated 2 times 1 of V intersecting this locality. This is what I am looking at. These are the regions that I am looking at. And this is And this is a more complicated picture, which I'm gonna try to use in two ways, to explain the spheres and to explain dynamics. First of all, when we discuss about the critical locals, about tangencies within the variations of the plus and minus, we have under consideration a couple of aspects. Our Hennon map is hyperbolic on its Julia cells. It's not going to be hyperbolic on the entire complex plane, because otherwise we'd have nice. Because otherwise we'd have nicely transverse foliations everywhere. So we are looking at places where we will lose our families of infrared codes. Now, the primary components of the critical locus in some sense, and I use primary incognition marks because our critical locus is going to be connected, develop exactly in the places where we have one invariant family of pons, but not out. And these are going to be And these are gonna be the tube, the horizontal tube BH and the vertical tube B V and the horizontal tube B H. In here, close to infinity, it's easy to understand the critical logo. Why is that? Because imagine this horizontal tube far away, close to infinity, UV plus. The floriation in UV plus is vertical, almost vertical. When you When you and the Fourier of u minus close to infinity, close to the y-axis is horizontal. Take a vertical leaf over here, map it backward under the Henon map. If you map it backward, this produces a parabolic-like shape. These parabolas are going to be tangent to the horizontal floration of U plus, giving us a component of the critical vertices which comes from infinity. And it's the same over here. And it's the same over here. We have a component of the critical locus coming from infinity. For this one, the responsible part D is the variation of the minus at infinity, which is horizontal. Have it forward. It's a parabolic-like shape. And so at infinity, this is how the volume of plus looks like, of U minus looks like. When you map it forward under the Hennon map, it gives you some. Henley map, it gives you some parabolic shapes. The orientation of u plus over here is vertical, and here is the primary component asymptotic to the x-axis. Okay, now we can turn around over here with the vertical foriation of M plus and we can put it back keeping it vertical. Vertical as long as we have our invariant families of vertical curves. Our invariant families of vertical columns fail when we hit the vertical tube and consequently all the creamages of the vertical tube. So the way in which the critical options is developed is exactly inside these tubes and their preimages, intersected with the horizontal tubes and their forward images. We have these tubes. Images. We have these components. We have the primary component coming from A and we can track it. But we can track it nicely. It's going to be given by the same seminars of parabolas tangent to the vertical degrees. As long as we do not hit more pre-images of H inverse of V you know. In which the leaf of the voluntary will be more complicated. The images are okay. In any case, in these tubes, we have a nice component which is a biologomorphic to a disk punctured at these circles over here. And this is what we want to use to produce the sphere. So, how is the sphere produced? We look over here. We look over here. We think of this one as being the common hemisphere, the equator of the two hemispheres. We think of this primary component asymptotic to the x-axis as being the lower, so it's a punctured disk, the puncture is at infinity, put infinity into that. We produce a disc which has all of these holes over here. One of the holes One of the holes is going to serve us as the equator. So this big one is just the lower hemisphere of the sphere. And what we do over here by dynamics, and when I say glue, it's already there, but I interpret it by dynamics, is we take this component, vertical component, coming from infinity. We keep only the part which intersects the disk V. This is what gets knocked over here. Not over here. Okay? And this also looks like a disk with certain parts in it, and that's going to be the northern hemisphere, and that's going to be the bottom. Okay. So these are the two hemispheres joined together by the equator. This is the model between two consecutive spheres because you can do the very same thing instead of working here, you could work here and produce another sphere. So they come with a sort of canonical model between the two over here. And the Juria assets over here that you see, they come if see they come exactly from intersecting these primary components with the Julia sets J which are here somewhere in the model and the Julia set J mattus which is hidden here in some sets okay so now let me use this picture to also give you an idea of how the handles are produced we have these nice disks which serve as lower and upper hemispheres Which serve as lower and upper femisphere, and we are removing certain parts, certain parts which look like the y-disc over here. In the y-disc on the boundary, we know what the typical locus looks like to circles, to real analytical circles. There is a lot of theory going on in showing that the only type of singularity of the political locus that one could expect inside such a body disk is to this. This is two disks intersecting at one point. So, this possible scenario is not actually possible for the Henon map. Now, my bias over here, and this is something that I'm kind of hiding away in the proof, is that they're not really straight. They're dynamically defined. So, one way, and one reason why we work in this nice region is that we are able We are able to fit inside over here between V and H inverse of V or V and H or V some nice dynamically defined tubes in which the boundary of the tube is foliated by the leaves of the floration of V plus and their vertical line. This tube over here is also fouliated by the leaves of the floriation of V minus and their horizontal line. So I'm hiding, and by the way, the V is also dynamically Is also dynamically. So I'm hiding away some things. But modulo, let's just look in a by disc. This kind of by disc, or any kind of y-disc over here, is going to map in U plus after a number of iterates, in V plus after a number of iterates, and it's going to map in V minus under one single iterate, backward iterate. So phi plus to some 2 to the n plus 1 is a well-defined holomorphic map on the y dist. phi minus squared is well defined on the y list. Their level sets, they give us the volume of u plus and u minus. And we can look at the following holomorphic map. And this one is going to be well defined and holomorphic in a neighborhood. In a neighborhood of the vertical boundary of the white disk, together with a legend, the disk of the critical locus. Under the assumption that the critical locus inside would be to this intersecting transverse at one point, we would be able to extend one component of the critical locus in the side diagram. And I'm kind of using this picture over here to produce a heart of experience. Here to produce a Hartox figure in C2. The Hartox figure is given by the vertical boundary of the virus together with the disk of the vertical erus. This function over here is going to be well defined and holomorphic on my Hartox figure. On the vertical boundary is well defined because this actually encodes the vertical light foliation. And it's less than a constant less than one because at At the vertical boundary, if you take a tangent line over here over there, it's going to belong to the vertical cone. And this is basically the cone condition at the vertical bound. At the horizontal, on the horizontal disc of the vertical locus is well defined because this quantity over here is actually different from zero or the other formation, for the formation of the minus. So there are some. So there are some things over here embedded in the proof. But you know that we have a function which is well defined on a Hartos figure. It has a holomorphic extension to the inside. If it has a holomorphic extension to the inside, this is good news because then we can apply the maximum modulus principle to claim that this kind of inequality that one has on the boundary also holds true at an eterial point. Falls true at any interior point. If it falls true at any interior point, then what it means is that the formation of V plus is going to be vertical-like at any interior point. And this is not true because here, over here, the volume of U minus is horizontal-like. And we are on a disk of the critical locus, where the variation of U plus and the Foriation of U minus coins. Of V plus and the correlation of V minus coincide. So we cannot have it be horizontal like n vertical light at the same time. So we can use complex analysis over here to disprove intersections of two disks. And by analyzing Milner numbers of singularities and so on, the only thing that is left with is the fact that these two disks in the complex, these two circles in the complex, are connected by a handle. And this is the handle. And this is the handle that you see in the pictures, and which shows you that the critical locus is smooth. It's a smooth Riemann surface. Okay, so what looks like two intersecting disks, it's actually going to be a handle which collects these spheres. Now, we don't understand much about how these ones with this. About how these ones would disconnect in general. So, for the Horschu picture, this is the picture that one should have. But we do understand them at parabolic implosion, where the way in which the Lubish-Robertson model is connected to this one is like the parabolic implosion, the implosion of all handles at the circle. So we don't have a graduate way of losing the handles, like you lose them one by one while still being connected and so on. One while still being connected, and so everyone disappears at the same time. And it's a parabolic implosion of the handle similar to the parabolic implosion of the two assets at the PowerPoint work. Okay, so I didn't hear anything from the organizers. So it's good to know the organizers. That's the problem. So I am stopping here. And thank you very much.
