So, my talk is based on my joint work with Paul Jean Justine. So, to start with, let me give the motivation of the talk. Okay, some standard notation. Standard notation. So I have SO2C. So we know the SO2 irreducible representations are classified by the highest weight. So I'll denote my L to be, means L times the first fundamental to be the highest weight of irreducible. And L lies in N. And the irreducible notation is capital L lower N. notation is capital L lower L and we have the Euro picture whose dimension is L plus one and so I'll use the notation some notation for Yanging of SO2 so this is the yanging of SO2 which deforms the enveloping algebra of The unviloking algebra of SO2 times a one-variable polynomial ring if I module out h-bar. Okay. In my talk, I won't need the presentation of Yangin, so I'll only use the evaluation homorphism. So evaluation at A from Yangin of SO2 to the enveloping of SO2. So this is the algebra homomorphism. If you have elements in the L. If you have an element in the Lie algebra, send it to itself. And if you have the generator JX, send it to AX evaluator at A. Okay? And notation for the evaluation pullback, so it. So it's defined to be evaluation pullback of the irreducible. So in particular, this is the irreducible representation of the yangin. The Yangin. Okay, so this is the old theorem and the interpretation paper book. It says every finite dimensional irreducible representation of Yangin. So I'll use Yangin vessel 2. So is every irreducible representation is of the following form. Of the following form. So V is isomorphic to tensor product of those evaluation representations, AW and of course their choice of A and L's. So for example, if I take L to be 1 and L of 1, so this is the C2, standard representation of SO2, and C2A, so that's And C to A, so that's a fundamental representation of Yanging. And geometrically, so if I do the tensor product of fundamentals, tensor product C2 with different evaluation parameter. So this is realized as the boreal. Realized as the boreal morph homology of the quiver variety type A1, which is the cotangent bundle of grass manga T star girl BW. So this colour is a representation of Yangian of SO2. And if I do Yangian of G, G is a finite dimensional Lie algebra, and this is like a G-Mark variety. Jima quiver variety. Okay, so to put a few names, Varonulo around 2000, and Naka Jigma, and also Molly Kokunkov talk about Yangi action on quiver variety. Okay, so the goal of my talk is so I want to understand for the I want to understand for the non-fundamental representations. So, what's the geometric realization of those tensor products, LA1, L1, tensor LA2, L2, and so on L A W L W Okay, so in particular, what's So, in particular, what's the correct replacement of this P-star Grassmanier? And for this type of representation, so I'll refer it as high-spin representations. And in the case when all the L's are equal, so if L1 is the same as L2, is the same as Lw, so this will call it a pure scheme. And for general, if there are different. For general, if they are different, or just for general W tuples, this is called mixed spin. Okay, so now let me tell you the geometric construction. Okay, so to uh so the geometric I'll start with a quiver Q so it's the following one with one gauge vertex a self-loop marked by epsilon and W framings I got W framings And I get arrows going back and forth. So for those arrows, I'll label it by A1, A1 star and A2, A2 star, AW, AW star. Okay, and so there's a potential associated to the quiver. quiver so I will use bold W to denote the potential so this is a linear combination of cycles for the quiver so I have epsilon to the L1 yeah and for the construction I always fix this L tuple of integers L1 up to L w which lies in n to the W. Okay. To the W. Okay, so the potential is e to the epsilon to the L1 A1 star A1 plus epsilon to the L2 A2 star A2 and so on and epsilon to the Lw AW star AW. Okay, so that's a linear combination of cycles. And so why do they consider this quiver with potential? Why such quaver is potential? And so there are two sources I can mention. One is an earlier paper by Baikov Zenjin. Okay, so around 2020, where they consider the quaver with potential like this. Potential like this. So this is the potential is epsilon to the L, AA star. So this is a pure spin case. And there are some computational matrices in this case. And so the second source is The second source is the recent paper by Varnulo Vassaro. Okay, and here is for a found E algebra UQG hat, non-simply less case. And in this case, you take the equivalent potential, dual A1 reduction. Do a A1 reduction. So you get that type of queries potential. So just for illustration purposes, maybe I can give the example for B2. So if you consider UQG hat for type B2, so the catalog matrix is 2, 2 minus 2, minus 1, and the symmetrizer D1 is 2, D2 is 1. D2 is one. Okay, so the so you draw a type A2 quaver XX star and with self loops on each gauge vertex Okay and so after so here is the potential X star X x star x epsilon 1 x x star epsilon 2 squared so those power has to do with the summatrizer of D plus A1 star A1 and A2 star A2 epsilon 2. And for this type of query with potential if you do an A1 reduction at this vertex you get that type of query with potential. No? No? No, no. So the epsilon is uh that the name of this self-loop arrow? Yeah, just the name. Yeah. So the Nakajima equivalent case, because it's a sympletic, so you have to double everything. So that's, if you look at representation, you double, you got a cotangent. So this is not a sympletic example. So, this is not a sympathetic example. So, I go only get one loop. Okay. Right. So, the geometric construction, so now I fix some notation. I fix a vector space V, which is at the gauge vertex, whose dimension is V. And so I fix the vector space W1WW. Those are at the framing vertical. Those are at the framing vertex, Wi equals 1. So for each framing, I put dimension vector 1. And so I look at the representation of my waver, Q, with fixed dimension vector V and 1, like an arrow for those ones. So this guy has action of G O V, G O T W and C star. And C stack. So this G is Gv is Gl V is changing basis for this matrix. So this Tw acting on those vector space and C star corresponds to the H bar. So the C star action, so maybe I'll spell out. So the C star action is a choice such that I want the degree of epsilon to be 2 and degree of And the degree of those arrows Ai, degree of Ai star will be minus Li. So this choice, under this choice, my potential is C star invariant. Okay. Okay, so now I look at this representation of quiver. Quiver and if I look at the trace of potential, so this induce a function on the representation. Okay, so that's a function which is C star invariant. Okay, so another notation at phi of W. So this is a vanishing cycle complex. Complex associated to the function trace of potential. Okay, so this is a constructable complex. Okay, and so now I consider the critical cohomology. Consider uh H compact supported and vasoz equivariance. And with those equivariants, so just write an eq of representation of this quaver. Instead of borrow more, so I want the coefficient lies in the coefficient to be the vanishing cycle complex and dual. Okay, so I will refer this as critical cohomology. So this critical cohomology already showed up in the work of conservative. In the work of conservator Superman, when they define the three-dimensional coha, three-dimensional co-homological algebra. Okay. Okay, so now theorem A So theorem A part one is the ending of SO2 X is a critical cohomology for this representation. This representation cover. If I put some semi-stable, put the stability condition, and this will be explained later. Phi W dual, where I need to sum up of all V's. Okay, and second part: so, which representation is for the Representation is for the Yanging. So as representations of Yang SO2, so the module, this representation E1 is isomorphic to the tensor product of evaluation representation, LZ1, L1, tensor LZ2, L2, and so on. And so on L Z W L W where so when we check this isomorphism, I want the evaluation parameter to be generic if all the little else be zero? Good question. Good question. I don't have a quick answer, but maybe I can do some computation. We'll let you know. Critical, yeah. So it looks like that's just an extra loop, doesn't do anything. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, but I know if the L equals one, you get the fundamental representation. So it must be something smaller. All right. Okay, so we have those evaluations. Okay, so where those evaluation parameters come from? Come from this framing torus action. So cohomology of a point equivalent with respect to Tw. So you see all those Z's. Okay, so that's a theorem. Okay, so maybe I'll say some words for the serum. So this critical cohomology looks scary, and how do you compute? Okay, so this guy, representation of Q, this dimensional vector. There's dimension vector E1, stability BW dual. So, how do you compute? So, there's a dimension reduction along one of the arrows. I choose A i's so I should mention, so this dimension reduction at different settings. At different settings, it carries different names. Maybe in the case, people call it Kazoo Duality, and there are some other names in disguise. And the version I use is I learned from the paper of Davidson, where the dimension reduction for the critical cohomology. Okay, so by the dimension reduction, and what this guy become becomes the What this guy becomes become the complex particle homology of this. Okay, so now I'm just gonna write it down. So along this AI and the left variety, you don't see AI anymore. So I see epsilon, I see A1 star, and AW star. So epsilon is equal to 1. So epsilon is a linear map from V to V and those A I star are linear maps from W to V, arrows going up such that so after dimension reduction, so we need to compute the derivative with respect to those Ai. So I got the relations epsilon to the L i times Ai star equal to zero. Equal to zero. And so the stability condition, I use the cyclic stability, means I look at the image of all those linear map A's, image A1 star, image A2 star, and so on, image A W star. So I get W vectors in V, and I use this self-loop, C epsilon, together with those maps. So they generate the whole V. Generate the whole V. So that's a stability condition. And all of this need to quotient out by GLV. Okay. So this guy, so I'll just denote it by curly M V W maybe dimension vector one w. Okay, so after dimension reduction, the coefficient. dimension reduction the coefficient with provers shift changes to the ordinary cohomology the constant coefficient C so it's this ordinary cohomology and what did it look like so let me run And what did it look like? So let me write down the sister fixed point of this M Okay, so it turns out the six-star fixed point is this, so fix. So that's my notation, L1, Lw. So this is a W tuple of integers, V1, V2, Vw right. W lies in n to the w, where each number vi is between 0 to li. And I want the sum of vi equal to v. So that's a set of system fixed points. So maybe just give you a simple example for illustration. If I take W to V3, and if I take V1, V2, V3, V1, V2, V3 to be one torse fixed point. So I'll write it as 2, 0, 3. So you can draw a little picture of the system fixed point. So I got three vectors on the framing. And this 2 tells you I can go up, I can go two steps high, and zero means I cannot go, and three means I can go three steps. And so this L is trying to bound you. How high can you go? Right, so in this case, the V is 2 plus 0 plus 3, which is 5. Okay, so that's one picture of a sister fixed point. And another example, so if we just take w to be one, and we see only one fixed point, which means so I have only one vector framing, so I can go V, so I can have those V dots if V is less or equal to L. Okay, and so this lemma is really linear algebra, so I'll write it down. So this M V of 1 means I only have one framing, W equal to 1. So this guy is either a point or empty. So it is equal. So it is equal to a point if your V is between 0 and L, it equal to empty otherwise. Okay. All right. And now in the main theorem, if you pick your W to V1, so it says I look at the ordinary cohomology of Mv1, where V goes from zero to W. So To W. So effectively, only V from 0 to L survives, and H star of a point. So this has L plus one dimensional, so that's the same as L of L. And some standard check to check the action is compatible with the Yanging of SO2 on both sides. Of SO2 on both sides. Okay. Okay, so now I can tell you about the armatrices. About our matrices. Okay, so I denote TW to be the Lie algebra of the torus with rank W and so the real vector space TW real and so we remove those those hyperplanes given by Zi minus Zj equal to zero, where I naught equal to j. So this guy can be decomposed in terms of connected components. So each component is a wild chamber, C of sigma, and the label is sigmaizing the symmetric group with W letters. W letters. So this is a wild chamber. Okay, so for example, for W equal to 3, so this is the Euro picture. Okay, so the expectation for R matrices is, so I have a chamber labeled by sigma, I have a chamber labeled. chambable labeled by sigma prime so expect so the R matrix sigma prime sigma okay so this should be write down and explain so W sigma prime lambda restrict the mu inverse times W of sigma 12 to sigma lambda restricting on mu. So this is two matrices, and the I matrix can be decomposed into an inverse of a lower triangular matrix times upper triangular matrix. And it lies in here. So in my module, if I localize enough, so the basis is given by sister fixed point. So, this is endomorphism of some base field K, and dimension is the number of torus fixed points. Okay, so that's the expectation for our matrix where oh oh. Oh, oh so I didn't tell you what is this K. You just have to localize. If it has more poles, you localize and define the K. Just look at the dictionary. What this I just haven't told you what is R matrix. Yeah, it has. Yeah, it has more poles. It doesn't affect this. No, no. Where the so this matrix the arteries are oh so the so the entry lambda mu uh are fixed points. So this lies in the fixed point. This less in the fixed point squared. Okay. So now the rest I have to, so I just have to tell you the construction of those matrices. Okay, so what is the entry? W upper sigma lamb w. Okay, so uh so let me tell you the uh Lattice model for this. Model for this. So for the lattice model, we look at V by W rectangular grade. So for example, if my V is 4, W equal to 6, so I have 4 rows: 1, 2, 3, 4, and One, two, three, four, and six columns. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay, so I have this four by six rectangular grid, and I fix a torus fixed point, lambda. So let's say, so the notation, before I denote by V1, V2, Vw, I'll choose 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1. 0, 1 and you put your fixed point on top. 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1. And so for such grade, I look at all the continuous paths. Or this is the state. And so, what's the row of the path? So I'm going to label the grid where Grid where a horizontal label, so either zero or one. If you have an occupation one, it has a path. You connect the path, we have zero, you don't write anything. And vertical label for the column J, they label it using the number 0, 1 up to L J. 0, 1 up to L J. This is for column J. Okay, so now let me draw a path for you. So for this grid, so I mark the horizontal rows using Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, and label it by 1111 and vertical Z1, Z2. Z1, Z2, Z3, Z4, Z5, Z6. And I mark it using all zeros. So which means my path will go from top to left. So let me give you an example of a path. So start from this one, so I could do this. Or start from this two, I could go this way. This way, or I could go because two, so I can go another way down all the way to Y4. And so there's a one here, so I could go down by two, go left by two, and go down and go left. And here, so the multiplicity is two, so the label is two. Here, multiplicity is two, so I already have a label two. So that's why. Already have a label too. So that's one example of the past. And so for each pass, so let's say I denote the path by C and the set of all paths by capital C there is a fixed point. There is a fixed point V1 up to VW. For each parse, I can associate the Boltzmann weight. Okay, so it looks the following form. So the weight is F associated to a path and it's given by product of F from 1 to V. I from 1 to V, J from 1 to W. Now, J is just a corresponding cross in the grid. And for each corner, cross, so I associate a weight. Weight depend on the ij vertex of my path. Of my path and depend on the variable yi minus dj. Okay, so there are explicit formula of which way to take, so I'll skip it. I'll show it in examples. Okay, define. So for such bottom weights, so they define the w tilde associated to the fixed point number to be the Number to be the following: so sum of all parts C in here and the Boltzmann weight F C. So it's like from sum over pass and product over vertices. Okay, so this is the element in CH together with a variable wise and together with a variable And together with the variable these. Okay. And so this is for identity. And how do you get for W sigma? So W tilde sigma lower lambda H bar Y and Z so this remember the sigma So, this remember the sigma lies in SW, the symmetric truth group of W. So, those permute the W variable Z. So, I just have to do a permutation. So, this is defined to be W tilde identity sigma inverse of lambda. And I keep wise by promoting these. Okay. All right. Right, so I defined this W function, W tilde function. And so the restriction there is the following. So W tilde lambda restrict mu. Mu is a fixed point. So this is means a substitution of substitution the variables y. Y Y one up to Y V according to the weight of my V restricting on mu. So there's a rule to replace Y using these. So after I do the substitution, so this lies in CH CH and Z one up to Z W Okay could not see it. Can we take some time? Okay, let me check some time. Okay, so let me give you an example. So if I take V and W to be 2, and the fixed point V1, V2 is 1, 1, and so in. And so in this case, I only have two paths, so two states of the lattice model. And so two two, so I look at two by two, two by two grid. And the labels are so fixed one one, so I put one one here, zero, zero at the bottom, zero, zero, so I forgot the labels. So I forgot the label. So the far right is also zeros. And the left are one ones. And the same thing here: 1100, 1100. And so the two paths from top to left, you either do this or you do this. Oh, no. Okay, so that's all the possible two paths. And so what's the Boltzmann weight in this example? So if I look at this vertex, so it gives me a weight y1 minus z2 shifted by h bar, so L2 minus 2h bar. And if you look at this. And if you look at this vertex, it gives me weight y2 minus z1 plus l1 h bar. And those two weights give me the constant. So this weight give me 2 times L1 h bar. So this vertex give me 2 times L2H bar. Okay, and so for this path, And uh so for this path so I do the same thing this vertex give me the uh weight y1 minus z1 shifted by h bar and so the 22. So this guy gives me weight y2 minus z2 shift by h bar and those type of corners give me constants. Constants. So 2 times L2H bar for this one. This one is 2 times L1 H bar. Okay. And W tilde edge over there is summation of those two. Okay, so as you can see, I added a tilde on the W and when I read the matrix, I didn't add the tilde. So, or you can ask what's the geometric construction for those functions W. So, it's the following geometric constructions and And so this one carries many names: off-shell, betty vectors, or weight functions, as mentioned in Hitoshi's talk, or not abelian stable envelope. Okay, and I in particular learned from the paper by Yermini Tarasov-Vachenko, so the case for T-star flag, the random weight function and also you, that's right, in the elliptic case. I also have a minus gamma that. I asked the other whether you did it together or not. Oh. Oh, okay. We need to talk. All right. So, um Okay, so as before, I will set sigma to be identity and fix fixed point, lambda v1 equal to v1, v2, vw. So this is the fixed point. Okay. Okay, and so the thing is I use the framed shuffle multiplication and the frame shuffle also mentioned in Wayley's talk for a different purpose. I haven't defined uw. After I define uw, so the theorem will be w tilde equal to w up to some constant. Yeah. All right, so I'm this slow. So I just have to explain you what's a framed shuffle uh thing. So I have this notation shuffle with uh dimension vector V L one. V L one. So that's just G L V T W cross C star equivariant homology of a point. Okay, I explicitly, this is C H bar and the GL V will produce me variable Y1, Y2, YV, and symmetric so I can do a permutation of Ys and also. wise and also the PW will produce me variable z1 up to zw okay so that's what this ring look like and so the frame shuffle multiplication basically so I take this simple root EI so that's 000 at I spot I have one and 000 so once I fix So once I fix the fixed point, V1 up to Vw, so I can do the multiplication shuffle V1 E1 shuffle V2E2 Shuffle V W E W. So this means the framing wow wow wow once I break it into the Into the simple weight. And so there's V1, V2 depend on my fixed point. And there's an explicit shuffle multiplication from this guy goes to shuffle V, W, which depends on my fixed point. Yeah, so it's very explicit. Now I'll give you an example for this. And so for now, let me give you the definition. So this W I haven't defined, so now I define it. So identity lower lambda, which depends on H, Y, and Z. So this defined to be, so I just use this multiplication and sending my ones over. So that's an element in here, in CH and Y cancel these. Okay, so I think in the paper about the public, I think that's Okay, so I think in the paper by RTV, they call it a weight function. So I'll just call this weight functions. Right, so this multiplication can also be made geometric. Also, be made geometric, so you write some correspondence using pullback, push forward. You can get the multiplication. But so, maybe just for illustration, I'll give you a simple example. The same setup, if v equal to w equals 2, and if the fixed point v1, v2 equals 1, 1, and so the shuffle multiple. And so the shuffle multiplication frame in the case, so I have shuffle 110 shuffle 101 goes to shuffle two one one and as ring, so the first ring is CH with variable Y1Z1 and so this guy is CH with variable. CH with variable Y2Z2 and this is a ring CH with variable Y1 Y2 up to permutation and it has Z1Z2s. Okay, so what is 1 times 1 goes? So 1 times 1 goes to the following. So I have y2 minus Y1 minus 2H. minus 2h divided by y1 minus y2 times z2 minus y1 plus l2h times y2 minus z1 plus l1h so some explanation so this guy comes from my From my arrow epsilon, and this term comes from my arrow A and this arrow comes from so this term comes from my arrow A star. So product of three things and the denominator comes from the graph man you push forward. So the product three is not symmetric on the y1 y2 so you do a symmetrization. So plus you switch y1 with y2. Y1 raise y two. Okay. Right, so so this formula is the same as W one one ID. Okay, so now you basically know the theorem. So the theorem V is so those two different ways defining the weight functions. One is using the lattice model and the other using Lattice model and the other using the framed shuffle formula. So those two are the same. So theorem B W tilde is the same as the W and up to a constant C. And this constant is explicit and only depends on H bar and L's. And in this small example, And in this small example, we tried. So here's the explicit formula for W tilde. So this guy plus that guy, there's no denominator, sum of two integral things. And this is W identity. So it's this one plus the other. There's a denominator y1 minus y2. And in the example, the constant is this guy. Okay, so. Okay, so in this V equal to W equals 2, V1, V2 equal to 1, 1. So the constant C equal to 4 times L1 L2H squared. Okay, so that's the two theorems. Okay, all good. So maybe I'll mention two things. I can give you more examples. So in the paper, we also write a closed formula for the matrices. And also, if you want to test the examples, Few other test examples. So, Paul wrote a lot of some of them are called codes, so it's pretty easy to test. Okay, so maybe I can write some examples for amatices so you can see. And maybe Hiraku wanted to see the poll. Okay, so everything is computable, so I'll just illustrate by example. So this, so first is a T-star P1 example. So this is standard. So just write it down. So if I take W to B2, B to B1, and so I have two fixed points. Points so it's either this one or it's this one. So it's my picture. Okay, so in this case, the so this is really standard Z two minus y plus L two H and And uh W two one. So you just have to uh change okay to one maybe I'll use too much to write. So let me write the let me directly so there are too many formulas. I mean write down the matrix for you. So I use the W identity lambda restrict amu. So that's a matrix. That's a matrix. So in this case, I have minus z plus L1 plus L2H 0 to L2H minus Z plus L1 minus L2H. So that's an identity case. You have a sigma, so you just so we have z equal to z1 minus 2. Z1 minus Z2. So if you have a sigma, then you switch Z to be minus Z and switch L1 to be L2, L2 to be L1. And in this case, the R matrix R of Z will be 1 over Z minus L1 plus L2H bar and minus Z plus L1 plus L. plus L one plus L two H minus two L one H and minus two L two H and minus Z minus L one minus L two H. So it's something like this. Right. Minus yeah, so so it has a pole at Z1 minus Z2 minus a shift of H bar. So if you said L1 equal to L2 equal to 1, that's the Euro formula for T start E1 case. Maybe I'll write a non-trivial example and I stop. So the second example, W. Second example, W equals 2, B equals 2. So now we have a three fixed point. So this one or this one or this one so now it's a square by square matrix. So So I'll write down the R matrix for you. So R of Z equals 1 over Z minus L1 plus L2H and Z minus L1 plus L2 minus 2H. So it's a 3 by 3 matrix. Maybe I'll write a few entries. I'll write a few entries for you. So the 1, 1 entry is something like Z minus L1 minus L2H times Z minus L1 minus L2 minus 2H. Okay, and here's a degree one polynomial, V minus L1 minus L2H. minus L2H times minus 2 2L1 minus 2H and here's a constant term 2L1 2L1 minus 2H and so here's the degree 2 so this way and so on so the explicit formula for R matrices okay Yeah, I'll stop here. Thanks.
