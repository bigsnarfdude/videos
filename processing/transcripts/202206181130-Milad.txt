From Dallas University, he's going to talk to us about the affine group of the plane and the new continuous way of transform. Please, Roger. Hello, everyone. Today, I will talk about the affine group of the plane and the continuous transform. It is joint work with Kate Taylor. First, we will talk about the special overview of the square integrable representations of locally compact groups and the result. And the result of the transformation that might be useful in signal and imager processing. If you have a G is a locally compact group with left-hand measure, we call it mu sub-G. Then by, if we have by as an irreducible representation of a G on a Hilbert space H, we say that by a square integrable representation, if we have the non-zero vectors xc. zero factors x c and eta for example such these factors satisfying these this inequality or this integral must be with respect to the left hard measure on a g finite then we define the complex valued function v sub eta xc by this inner product we talk also about the de flomore operator if you have y as a square integrable representation of a g Of a G, then there exists a dense subspace D sub Y of H and a positive self-adjoint operator C sub i that associated to the square integrable representation y. And also we have this equality satisfied. Now we call it one. And now if you take eta one equal eta two equal eta and if you have this equality C sub by eta the norm of C sub by eta equal to equal eta eta the norm of C sub by eta equals one, then number one it will be reduced to this equation. We call it number two now. This is from here then we can see that we can get back X C weekly in this Hilbert space. Now V eta is an isometry and we call it the continuous Hoover transform that associated to Y and as I mentioned X C it is our this formula. C, it is our this formula, it is the reconstruction formula for C. Now, we also give an example of the affine group, which is real, which is well-known example. The affine group, it's given by the semi-directed group of R with R star. It is the set of all buoyants, the first entry X from R and A also from R, but A not zero. With the group of product, it's given by this as if you have. This is if you have xA and yb, then the first entry it would be x plus ay, and the second entry would be a times b. Now, g1 has square integrable representation. We call it rho. It's given by this formula. This is row for any square integrable function on R. And the classic continuous Hooglet transform in one dimension arises from the fact that rho is a square integrable representation. Presentation. So now we also have some examples of H, closed subgroup of G into R. We form this group G by taking the semi-director product of R2 with H. Again, X is from R square and A, it's a matrix. As you can note here, there is an underline under X, which is indicated that we look at X as a column factor. The natural representation of a g acts on n square R2 is given by this formula. And this is true for any square integrable function on R2, the Silvert space. Also, now we will define the frequency domain R2 hat, which is we look at omega as a row factor, omega 1 and omega 2 from R. Then we define the unitary map Fourier transform between these Hilbert spaces by. mean these Hilbert spaces by this formula then this is true for any integrable n-square integrable function by conjugating rho then we we get rho hat by conjugating rho by using the Fourier transform then we we get rho hat it is a square integrable representation and unitarily equivalent to rho of this group now uh we Now we will define also the orbit of omega. It is the set of all pointers. It is the action of this matrix on omega and from H. We define also the stabilizer group. It's a closet subgroup of H. It is the set of all matrices A that satisfying this equality. It is a well-known theorem also, this is by Bernier and Taylor and By Bernier and Taylor and Foor. If you have H as a closet subgroup of a G L in R, the natural representation of this group will be square integrable if and only if there exists an open dense and the stabilizer group is compact. We have here of n equal to we have we give some examples here. If you have h as a closed subgroup of h e l to r and we have as R and we have as the orbit it's open and dense, and we have the stabilizer group is compact. Then we define these examples: the rotation group, the dilation group, the rotation groups. It is the set of all matrices in these forms. These two examples lead to common software for image processing. This example, the Charlotte group, which is if you take alpha equal to a half, it's a set of all matrices in this form. In this form, this leads us to the continuous Scherlet transform, which is especially useful for detecting edge singularities in images. So, the question is, are there any other groups that we might get a continuous rubber transform from this group? So, the answer is yes. It is known for some people that this group must have a square integral representation, and this must lead us to a continuous. This must lead us to a continuous worldly transform. My main work is to work out details of harmonic analysis of square integrable representation of G2 of all affine transformation of R squared. So how we do that? First, we reparametrized the 2 by 2 invertible matrices. Then we express the left variant integration on G2 in a new parameterization. Our calculations, the result were. Our calculations: the result of our calculation is we get an irreducible square representation of G2, we call it sigma-1. We get an analog of bitter vial results. We get a proof and conditions for finding a wavelet in L square R3 that associated to this representation of a G2. We get also an a novel wavelet transform. So, how we did that? G L to R is. Did that G L to R, it's unimodular group. And since it's unimodular group, the left hard measure or the left hard integral is given by this formula. The HAR measure for this group is given by this for any square for any continuous function with combat support and this group. And you can find this formula in any book, for example, in Hughes and Ross, and you can check that. That so now we decide to rewrite it in a compact way to just to serve to make the calculation clear and clean. Now, since G2 is a semi-direct product group of R2 times the GL2R, then the left-hair measure on the G2 is given by the Lebesgue measure on R2 times the left-hand measure on the GL2R divided by the absolute value of this matrix, the determinant of this matrix. This matrix. Now we, yeah, the next step we did, we identified two useful group closed subgroups of G into R. We call one of them K0 and the other one H sub 10. K0, it is a closed subgroup of G into R. It is the set of all matrices in this form. And since we have a homomorphism and topological group isomorphism of Of the group of non-zero complex numbers with K0, then we will use this to identify the hard measure on K0. Similarly, for the H sub 1, 0, H sub 1, 0 is just the affine group. It's a closed group into R. It is the set of all matrices in this form. Also, since we have a topological group isomorphism of each one with the affine group, then we will use that to define the Harr measure. To define the hard measure on this group H sub 1 0. We need to factorize G L to R. We were not able to find a useful factorization in any paper or a book. Then we came up with the idea of factorizing G L to R as K0 times H sub 1 0. This factorization is what makes the complicated calculation easier to do. So one of the propositions that we are able to prove that if you have any matrix A, That if you have any matrix A from G to R, then you can uniquely decompose it as an element from K0 times an element from H sub 1 0. As you can see, these M sub A, the entry of M sub A and the entry of C sub A, it depends on the entry of the matrix A itself. Now, this parameterization resulting from factor A A A A A A A A A A Resulting from factorizing the GL2R, and we will use that to factorize the bigger group G2. Before that, we notice that these groups, their intersection will be the identity, and their product will give us back G into R. Now, as we mentioned that we look at the group G2, then we will use this factorization, the closest. The closet subgroup is K0 and H sub 10 to define new groups K and H. And we call H K. It is the set of all matrices. The first entry is 0. The second entry is just an element from K0. Similarly, for the semi-director-productive group of R2 with the stabilizer group or the affine group, it is the set of all pointers. The first entry again from R square and the second. Again from R square and the second entry from the affine group. We will use that to define the left hard measure on G2 by define the hard measure on K and the Hard measure on H. We just got all of this information that we have here. This is the hard measure on H and now this is the hard measure. This is a G2. This is an G2, this is an element from K. And this is when you do, and this is the element from H, when you do the product, that's what gives us a G2 back. And now it's time to define the HAR measure on a G2. As you can see, it is Lebesgue measure on R2, the HAR measure on K0, or K in this case, and the HAR measure on H sub 10. Now we will. Now we will talk about the reducible representation of group the group G2. We will introduce the irreducible representation by super one of the stabilizer group. It's all known, as I mentioned. This is given by this formula for any square integrable function on R on R star. Also, it's well known here on that the left regular representation. That the left regular representation of this group, the affine group, is equivalent to the direct sum of infinitely many cavities of pi super 1. So we will use that, as I mentioned, pi super 1, by taking the tensor product with chi sub 1, 0 to induce it up, and we get the representation of a G2 that defined on this inverse space, N square K, N square R star. L square k L square R star and this is so if you take any function square integrable function defined on k and take its value in this in this space then we get the formula of the representation that we are looking for it is as you can see this representation will move this f which is from this Hilbert space by this formula by taking by evaluating the function at The function at the m sub a inverse L. And keep in mind here, A, it is a matrix from G L to R. Now L. What we need to do is we're looking at the, we will use the decomposition theorem and then we will we need to find the part of K and the other part from H. We put all of these details here. Now we just express this the tensor product. The tensor product, these terms. As you can see, it is a little bit complicated. So, we are trying to understand more about this representation. So, then we decide to introduce the cross-section gamma from the orbit to the group K0. Does the cross-section allow us to move the representation that we get to this from the Hilbert space L square k L square. the Hilbert space L square K N square R star to this space and as you know that this space N square R two hat plus R hat it's really L square R3 so we need before that we need to introduce new functions if you have started with any matrix A from this group and you pick omega from the orbit again you can find out what's by using the decomposition theorem to find what is the part of A and To find what is the part of A inverse gamma omega in K and the other part in H in the group H. Since H is the closed subgroup, then for sure the inverse will also exist in the stabilizer group. So it must be in this form. As you can see here, we call it U sub omega A and V sub omega A. Since this our calculation, we get that the right-hand side, it depends on. The right-hand side depends on the entries of the matrix A and omega 1 and omega 2. It's rational continuous functions. We will use them in the representation itself. Now, as I mentioned, the purpose of define the cross-section is to move our calculation from this space to this space by defining the unitary map. This map, we call it U. map we call it u it is a unitary which is mean we need to prove that it is one-to-one onto and preserve the inner product between these two hilbert spaces our calculation gives us or by conjugating sigma by using this unitary map we get sigma one and the formula of sigma one as you can see it's much simpler than the previous one it is as you can see for any xc in this x squared r2 hat cross r hat sigma one hat sigma one will move this xc and at any buoyant from a g2 and evaluate it at omega and omega three by this terms here the first entry it is just the action of the matrix a on omega and the second entry it is the dilation uh now it is the main theorem that we get we prove that sigma was We prove that sigma one is an irreducible representation of g2. If you pick any of psi, any function that from this space l squared r to hat cross r hat that satisfying the integral with respect the weighted measure equal one. Then if we defined also the complex valued function v sub of psi at xc by this, the inner product, then we find out that v observ is an isomorphic. V obsi it will be is an isometry of L square R2 hat cross R hat into L square G2. Also that V sub of psi, it will intertwine the left regular representation of a G2 with sigma 1. And this shows that the sigma 1 is equivalent to a sub-representation of the left regular representation. The other bar, that which is analog to Peter-Weil theorem, we get that the left regular representation That the left regular representation of this group is equivalent to a direct sum of infinitely many cabbies of sigma one. We call sigma one that satisfy this condition as a sigma one wivelet. Now, if you when we take the effect of this or when we move this sigma by the by sigma one, we get this formula here. And also we are we prove also that this function of psi. So, that this function opsi sub xa, it is it will be a square integrable function on this space. Now, if we go back to v sub op psi by this by this formula, we call it if we compare if we if we compare xc from x squared r to hat square hat with the sigma 1 wavelet, we get the sigma 1 wavelet transform that associated to sigma 1 wavelet. The other result The other result, the flow mower operator C sigma 1, that associated to sigma 1, it will be given by this formula for any square integrable function on this space. The reconstruction formula can be stated for the sigma 1 wovelet transform. If you have psi any square integrable function as a sigma 1 wavelet, then for any x c in L square r2 hat cross r hat, if you across our hat if you compare the sigma wivelet transform the sigma the sigma one the sigma one wivelet transform to uh to the continuous wivelet transform with respect to the hard measure on g2 then we can get xc weakly in this space thank you for listening any questions Any questions, remarks, let's talk questions no one has anything to ask. This time speak it again. Next talk will be in pilots 10. It's a matter of fact in 10 minutes. Perfect in ten minutes.
