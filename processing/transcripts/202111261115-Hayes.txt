Determines congruence, VHE, and L cross L. This is actually a separating invariant for the joint action. And so this will be the joint invariant that separates out orbits. And so it's kind of another thing that's sort of interesting about this one is since the inverses are the Hermitian conjugates in this case, then the trace function of x1 inverse x2 is related to this Frobenius inner product on the matrices SU2. Product on the matrices SU2. So one can think about the joint invariant here as somehow representing an angle between two matrices in SU2. So the second example is if we take SL2, the situation is a little bit more complicated here due to the fact that SL2. Here, due to the fact that SL2 has a lot more different homogenous spaces associated with it, since it has a lot more non-isomorphic sub-algebras. And so again, you start by looking at the trace function, but it turns out that this isn't enough to separate the orbits when the trace function is small and less than two in magnitude. When it's greater than two, then the matrices in SL2 are conjugate to a diagonal matrix. And you can apply the same sort of logic as you did with SU2, but on the values where the trace is less than two, there's actually for a given trace value two distinct conjugacy classes that have that same trace. And so the idea is that you want to start by taking some sort of Taking some sort of canonical form to these matrices, these non-diagonal matrices. And the choice that we used is taking a basis E1 and the matrix that you chose multiplying E1. So just to clarify this. So you pick some matrix A and SL2. And then if you use the basis U1 and AE1. The basis U1 and AE1, then you can always take it to this form minus one alpha. But if you're only allowed to conjugate in SL2, then whether or not this is an oriented basis determines whether or not you can take A to this representative. And so, in the case that this isn't oriented, you actually have to swap the order, and the representative looks different. Different alpha like this. And so the trace function here isn't enough to separate out the orbits because of these two non-conjugate representatives. And so you introduce another invariant, which is sort of the orientation of this, which we just represent as taking the determinant sine. And this will tell you whether or not you're going to fall into. Tell you whether or not you're going to fall into one conjugacy class or the other. So, well, the trace function isn't enough to separate out the orbits in this case. Introducing the second invariant is again, part of this, the issue here is that the SL2 homogenous spaces can look rather different depending on the value of this trace. And so, one of the ways that we're going to be able to And so, one of the ways that you can geometrically realize the homogenous spaces is by looking at this big adjoint representation. So, again, if we take sort of the add representation of SL2 on its Lie algebra SL2, you can identify the different homogenous spaces either with one-sheeted hyperbolas cones or two-sheeted hyperbolas cones or one-sheeted hyperbolas. Hyperbolous cones or one-sheeted hyperbolas. And so, depending on the value of the trace, you sort of get stuck in one of these cases or another. And the presence of these disconnected or the presence of orbits that are not connected sort of corresponds to the fact that the trace values or sorry, the orbits are all connected, but the presence of these different kinds of orbits is somehow. Of orbits is somehow indicating that the trace is not enough to separate out the conjugacy classes. Okay. So yeah, so that's these examples. And then so part of this business of looking at joint invariance. Homogeneous spaces often admit foliations into submanifolds of the space G mod H. So the action G on G mod H, you can often look for these G invariant foliations of the manifold G mod H, which we want to exclude this case since it's the hope is that somehow you Since it's the hope is that somehow you could quotient out by the foliation and then look for invariants on the smaller space instead. And so somehow the situation where there aren't any of these invariant foliations is the one that we want to look at as it's the most basic setting in order to study these joint invariants. And so the definition that's sort of appropriate for looking at these more basic spaces is that of Looking at these more basic spaces, is that of a primitive homogenous space? And so these are ones where the subgroup H satisfies a certain maximality condition that ensures these invariant foliations don't happen. So the definition we're going to take for this is a homogenous space G mod H is said to be primitive if the algebras G and the subalgebra H satisfy that one, H is a proper subalgebra. One, H is a proper sub-algebra and H contains no proper ideals of G, which is just to ensure that the homogenous space is actually effective. And then the third condition is the one that's most important, that H is a maximal subalgebra of G. And so there's some little technical details here of the relationship between primitive subalgebras in the sense of maximal subalgebra and primitive subgroups, which is addressed in this. Groups, which is addressed in the Skolovetsky paper, primitive actions, maximal subgroups, lead groups. But for the case where G is not simple, it turns out that this maximal condition is all you need. And that's the situation that I want to talk about anyway. So we're just going to take this as the definition. And then so these primitive, so these Lie algebra sub-algebra pairs that are primitive have been classified. Are primitive have been classified originally by Morisov, and then Golopitsky did figured out sort of the relationship between these like sub-algebras and subgroups. And in the case where G is non-simple, the classification works out that G and H form a permittive pair or G mod H is a permittive homogenous space. You'll fall into one of these two categories: either G has some abelian ideal where G splits into the subalgebra H plus K in the direct product, and then there's this faithful irreducible representation of the subalgebra H on K. Or there'll be a simple subalgebra L in G where G splits is the direct product of L of itself, and the isotropy subalgebra H is. Algebra H is the diagonal subalgebra where the elements are equal. And so we've been calling this the symmetric case because in the situation where G is compact, the homogenous space G cross G mod the diagonal subgroup will form one of these Riemannian symmetric spaces. So So, right. And so, the reason for introducing this primitive thing is to try to justify that this original example with L is actually a primitive homogenous space. So the sort of corollary to this classification and the lemma above about L being realized as a homogenous space of G in the case where L is actually a simple Lie group. L is actually a simple Lie group, then from the lemma, we know it's first a homogeneous space of G, where it's G mod H, where with H being a diagonal subgroup. And that if you look at the Lie algebras for G and H, they exactly correspond to this second case in the classification that Golovitsky had. So G's Lie algebra is this direct product of a simple Lie algebra with itself, and H's Lie algebra is the. itself, and H is the algebra is the diagonal subalgebra. So this lines up with part two of the classification. And you know that actually g mod H is primitive and since it's been equivariantly identified with this group L and the G action on L as in the first example, then the space L is primitive as well. And so just a little remark here, the choices of SU2 and SL1. The choices of SU2 and SL2. These are sort of the smallest examples of non-simple or smallest examples of simple Lee altimpie groups. And so they're sort of the smallest dimensional cases of this part two of primitive actions showing up. So yeah, this is kind of the bulk of the talk material. Part of what we want to do in the future is looking at more general applications of what's going on here. So what happened in this example is you have this group G acting on two copies of the space L, and you somehow identified the orbits here with L acting on one copy of L. And what we've done in the past is Is verified that there's actually a more general form of this reduction where you have the g action on g mod h to the k. You can identify the orbits of this thing with the isotropy action on one fewer copy. So k minus one. And so this example with L is an application of this reduction to two copies of the space. And in the And in the future, we want to look at sort of higher numbers of copies for primitive actions and other places where we can use this reduction to actually solve the problem. So yeah, I think that's it for the talk. If there are any questions. Thank you very much for support. Questions? Questions? Could you hear them? Yeah, yeah. It was some strange sound, which like somebody knocking on something, but we could hear something. Yeah, this room is kind of noisy. So apologies for that. Yeah. Questions? Let's see if somebody raises his hand. So I've forgotten my counterexample for this read Sunday. Does that fit at all into your framework? Or that's not a homogeneous based framework. I have to go back to the paper to figure out what I did. Yeah, I have it right here. Hold on. Um it had something to do with uh it's like a rotation group, yeah, it's rotations where you keep speeding up the rotations, that's right. And right. Yeah, so it's R2 without the origin and polar coordinates, and then the action is like you translate your angle variable by some rational multiple. Yeah, it's the old question: does it become free after some. Free after some, even infinitesimally free, I believe. Well, maybe it's just free after some number of copies, right? So, this one, as I remember, it's not ever free on a dense subset. Right. Yeah. And that's kind of the situation we're working with, right? Like the diagonal action is never going to be free on the diagonal subset. So, you're always looking for some sort of open dense subset where. sort of open dense subset where it's free but that example is exactly what you said peter it's not dense on any open subset yeah not free on any not free on any open subset yeah so yeah i mean i was disappointed because this in the jet space context when you prolong the jet space eventually it becomes free on right yeah yeah we're you thought of jellyfur so maybe well that's what i'm So maybe, well, that's what I'm kind of asking. This is this counterexample must be outside the context of homogeneous. Yeah, it's actually homogeneous, expanded representation, and maybe even some induced representation show that it should. May I ask a question? You wrote something about the sort of SU2, which I didn't understand. You considered SU2 by conjugation, by diagonal, right? Yeah. And then you suddenly wrote that. And then you suddenly wrote that this quotient is S3 by S1, you suddenly wrote that it's S2, which would be, of course, same for a standard co-fibration for the left or right action. But you can see the conjugation, right? Yeah, it goes through action. So it's, yeah, it's the orbit under conjugation of a point in SU2. So do you state? So, do you state this actually quotient by conjugation is actually to the measure of sphere? No, so the quotient by conjugation is like a line segment. And the orbits of each point are the S2, little copies of S2. And so if you if you look at a SU2 or SL2? And yes, I'll say SU2 was much easier. Yeah, it's it's SU2. I also might have just tuned out and missed it, but could you tell us or remind us what was motivation for considering primitive actions? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. So the idea is that primitive actions are somehow more basic or fundamental than general homogenous spaces, in the sense that there isn't any of this underlying, like any sort of underlying foliation by integral sub-manifolds that's preserved by invariant foliation of integral sub-manifolds by integral sub-manifolds. Yeah, yeah, so right. So in the group case, the idea is like. In the group case, the idea is like if you have your sub-algebra or subgroup H contained in some larger subgroup, which we'll just call K, then you get, so there's this G projection down to G mod H, but there's also a projection down to G mod K. And so you might think about the action of G on G mod H as somehow preserving the fibers of whatever map is induced. Map is induced through there. And so the idea is that somehow there's some sort of extension problem going on where if you figure out what's going on with primitive actions, then you should hopefully be able to reconstruct what's going on with the impermitive case. So, hey, Irina. Yeah. Yeah. So, you know, if you have a group acting on a set X and X and oh, right, yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah, so the primitive situation is if you have a group acting on any set X, you can ask about whether or not there are equivalence relations on X preserved by the action G. We just want to avoid this case. Yeah, so if you have an important invariant equivalence relation, you can put, you can, you know, define an induced action on the equivalence classes, right? Right. So, so that would. So, that would be sort of an imprimitive case. And primitive case would be when there's no invariant equivalence relation. And so, you know, that'd almost be called simple, right? A simple action in the sense that there's no reduction down to any smaller space, right? And so, you know, in that whole theory of, and I mean, that's why it's permeating throughout these equations of Lie type, for example. This was something that. Type, for example. This was something that Pavel and a lot of people spent a lot of time on trying to figure out the primitive actions in order to write down these superposition principles for the primitive spaces from which they can figure out the big superposition principle. But the primitive case is a little bit like what you might call, maybe call it simple in the sense that it's the most basic building blocks. And it may, I was just thinking, it may be that if it's not private. That you, if it's not primitive, you might be able to find counterexamples of a similar type on the different leaves of the foliation. I don't know. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah. But, you know, in terms of joint invariance, Irina, Ilya and I have been trying, but we're not there yet. Is you know, you got to develop a theory for primitive, and then how do you do a, you know, sort of a reconstruction to the non-primitive case, which is exactly what they do in the Li-type. The Li-type. You decompose it into, you know, the primitive case and then build up from that. Right. So they can, and that's the truth with the differential equations, like they separate into primitive and imprimitive cases. Because usually, once you can do the primitive case, there's sort of a natural way to extend it to a non-primitive case. Maybe the compact groups, right? But in general, maybe even. Yeah. I think in the corner. Well, in terms of the lead type stuff, it's not so bad. And the equations of lead type, but I don't really know about the joint invariant case. We haven't gotten very far on trying to do it, extend it from a primitive to an imprimitive case, eh? You know, certainly every joint invariant. You know, certainly every joint invariant on a that's if you have an imprimitive case, you can reduce to the primitive and then use joint invariants on the primitive space to build ones on the imprimitive space, but it's not going to be all of them, eh? But how much are you missing? Or can you build them in any simpler way, eh? Isn't there an issue of whether or not it's effective on the quotient as well? So you might lose some stuff with just see what I'm saying, Boris? See what I'm saying, Boris? Fine. Are me? It's okay, fine. Yeah, and you know, yeah. Anyway, the, you know, the inverse image in that little diagram that's sitting up there where you have that P from G over H to G over K. So the inverse image is a, you know, K over H homogeneous space. So, you know, attempting to sort of attempting to sort of break it apart into uh and that's kind of what's done in the uh equations of le type is you solve it on g over h excuse me g over k and then k over h and then put them together yeah sort of inductive construction yeah kind of yeah you know it's like trying to build the thing on the fiber and then on the quotient and then putting it together for the total space Together for the total space. That's kind of what they were doing in the Lie-type equations. So, any more questions, comments? We should have some final comments. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we should definitely thank Francis, the models, because he did all the work. Yeah, thanks, Francis. Francis is stamping that. We have to do it in that extension. Thank you, Francis. Good to sort of see everybody, eh? And also, I would like, we all would like to thank all the speakers and the remote speakers who were great and staying with us, especially given that they. With us, especially given that there is a holiday in the US, and of course, every in-person speaker, few in-person speakers, which made this conference, which we think is a great success. Thank you very much for your see you guys out there somewhere, eh? Next time we will all be in person. Let's hope, eh? Yeah.
