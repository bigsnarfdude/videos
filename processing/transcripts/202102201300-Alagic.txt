From two perspectives, mathematics and the arts from two perspectives. One is my class that I teach, and so that's why this number 519. And the other perspective is Journal of Mathematics and the Arts, where I'm editor-in-chief. And then I'll talk more about mathematics, education, research, mathematics and art projects. And art projects that my students are doing. So, no need for you to read all this, but it was nice for me to revisit a review that I wrote in 2007 after we had a workshop here. And I see some of the people from that workshop in Banff. I say here, I'm in New York City, but I'm really referring to Banff and our first workshop that was focused on That was focused on mostly on mathematics and the arts in education. And it was a wonderful time to work in the center. And I always like and remembering the at a time director Jim Oliver would say, you are here, everything is provided, there are no excuses to delay the work that you must do. So that work was inspirational in multiple ways for things that I have been. For things that I have been involved later on. And this is this slide: is to remember Reza Serhangi, who founded the British organization. I'm especially proud because he got his PhD in mathematics at the university where I am, British State University. And this is a part of the construction that we made the We made the Bridges Conference in 2009, if I remember correctly, I'm pretty sure I do. And here is a picture of that structure behind a group of people that were there at the time. And I'm sure, okay, so it's 2009, Bridges Conference in 2009. And here is Reza in this. Kneeling at far left front row. I also put here the picture of the Journal of Mathematics and the Arts because some of the ideas about the journal blossomed in bump during these meetings. And the picture that this issue has is actually a special issue that was devoted to mathematics education. So, this is a little bit abstract statement that I like to connect when I'm thinking about mathematics and the arts, especially now as the journal editor, sometimes struggling to decide what really is capturing the essence and connections of that liminal space between mathematics. Space between mathematics and the arts. So, this is a quote from Baba from the location of culture, where that flow that we have in liminal space is captured in somewhat complex statement. This is about motivation to start my students thinking about About mathematics and arts, I try to bring in some interesting pictures, images, perspectives, and try to work on different things for that inspirational part. And you're probably all familiar with this caption that's actually done using so-called rotoscope to trace the lines and curves of the dancer's body as she moves. As she moves, I did not record who exactly did this, but it's available on this website that I have here. And then the other end, by the way, feel free to stop me and ask a question anytime. I'm not so good at looking to the chat at the same time, so feel free to interrupt me. So this is another end or spectrum. Is another end or spectrum of our thinking what is really you know art mathematically expressed or how we think about mathematics and the arts. So this is the result of an algorithm and this portrait has been sold for lots of money in 2008. So is artificial intelligence set to be Artificial intelligence set to become art's next medium is a question to ponder. So two vantage points that I want to talk about or illustrate here. One is mathematics investigations, classroom, learning to learn math through the exploration of art, and sometimes it's really craft in culturally responsive. In culturally responsive context. So, I teach future elementary teachers, and we try to, you know, do like a multidisciplinary work and contextualize things. So the assignment that they have is actually to work on math art project, but also think what to connect it to culture, whether it's their own culture or some other culture. Culture or some other culture, and to think about diverse experiences and different perspectives. And then, in terms of other vantage point for mathematics and the arts, I always ask different questions, but one that's probably inspired by the slide that I just showed you a moment ago, and also by a number of submissions that actually. Submissions that actually have digitally produced artifacts is what makes a digitally produced artifact a piece of art. And obviously, lots of different opinions and we could spend lots of time thinking about it and talking about it. And it's an ongoing, interesting topic. And it would be really interesting to have a special issue focused on that if any of you is thinking about something. Doing thinking about something like that. So here is the like a first, like a bunch of illustrations about students' works. So I'll have a few next slide with students' works and their reflections because when they are working on these projects, they are required to kind of write an essay explaining what they are doing, how they got the How they got the product, whatever it is, typically digital work, but not always. What mathematics is behind it, and how they might use it in their own classroom, and also what are some cultural elements. Maple patterns is a picture actually from the journal, and these other pictures are from my students' work. My students' works. So here is an example where I used a little bit more details to show you how one of the students is thinking. She made this digitally because at the time, you know, every semester I have a little bit different requirements. So that semester when she was in the class, a requirement was to do a digital work. Digital work, and she produced this mandala. Her main concept was symmetry, and she was teaching shapes. And this paragraph is something that she wrote about in her essay. So she expresses that she's artistically inclined, and she would probably draw this, but since the requirement was to do it digitally. Was to do it digitally. That's what she did. And her presentation actually had the whole process recorded, which I am not including here. Interesting component for me. So this was her other piece of work with similar thinking, talking about symmetry. But the thing that I wanted to share with you that's always interesting for me is. For me is how sometimes students do not recognize that their culture. The way she says, I don't particularly have a culture being white. I'm from different parts of the United States and so on. She explains some things and she includes her interest. And this is in response to an objective that to foster in students a knowledge of and appreciation for. Of an appreciation for the diversity of human and natural world. So, almost every semester, I have at least one or two students that I think are still not thinking in terms of their own culture, but I think it helps them to kind of compare and contrast and start thinking more about it, even though this is like a mathematics class with mathematics and arts project. An arts project. Oh, Mara, can I just ask you a little bit more about that? Yes. It's Susan Jarofsky here, and I just wondered about the student thinking they have no culture. I mean, that's a very, seems really strange to me. And I, is that something that you encounter quite a lot? And how do you deal with that? Not too much, but I also, it's very interesting. It's very interesting. It's either they think they don't have culture or they identify culture and religion. This is a good starting point to deal with that because the assignment is to typically do something from a different culture. So that idea of comparing what's the same, it's what's different in their own culture helps to start a conversation. So we typically have a few reflections that are related to. Reflections that are related to the topic. It's like Americans thinking they have new accents. Of course, you have an accent. Everybody has an accent. Thank you. I like that one. Yes, I can identify with it quite a bit. But that's a good example, Henry. So these are typical things that they write. They very often engage in, you know, working in mandalas. So that's why. Working in mandalas, so that's why I picked these few quotes: how they think about mandalas and how they use them in their own classes. So, I now have a few different examples. This is a and I have a student's name, and I'll just go through these slides. Feel free to stop me and ask questions. This was she named it impossible, Rebecca Ducton. Impossible Rebecca Duckton, but she also provided the process how this is done. Lots of them use, we use Geogebra for some other projects or geometry assignments. So lots of them try to use Geogebra to produce something. So it's often stars and quirk designs and things like that. The student also This student also used Geogebra, but did a good job about removing graphs. Some points are still there, but an interesting way of thinking about the assignment. I liked this one also because it had a motivation. Oh, sorry, it had a motivation in some woven baskets. Some woven basket that she actually had at home, and she tried to make some abstract representation of that using Geogebra. So she wrote, the source of inspiration for this design was the intricate use of symmetry in the South African zoo moving baskets. So these are just different examples. Examples, and we try to carry through very carefully what are objects, properties, concepts, processes, how they can use it, what students can produce. And this one in the top left corner is something that the student made out of paper. And then to satisfy digital requirement, her idea was taking a photo that's a digital part, which was nice thinking. Which was nice thinking. Going back to what is culture, growing up in a Catholic church, I remember gazing at the different windows during the services and admiring the artwork. I choose to do this art piece because it reflects my religion. Another, yeah, some. Yeah, some quite often actually they design things that are games based on some motivation from art from different places. So, this student was kind of thinking about different knots using this picture. She designed a game, what you can do with these numbers moving in different directions and things like that. Say that this was an interesting one. The class that I teach, I'm actually very lucky, it's in education, but it's a class between what they take in mathematics classroom and their methods classes. So over time, I have selected only three topics to focus on. One is volume, which basically the requirement is that they The requirement is that they develop and understand formulas, starting kind of scaffolding thinking from elementary grades up. And then the other topic is exponents and exponential growth. And the third one is something from geometry and this math art project that I'm talking about. So when we worked on exponential growth, this student, Denise Grabendraj, she made this Like she made this digital work here, which I find quite interesting. Hands were to represent her classroom and children, and then she tried to represent exponential growth in different ways. She did say that her boyfriend at the time was studying math and helped her to think through this process. Here is another one that we Here is another one that we play with, handshake problems. I'm sure you're all familiar with it. And it's a nice way to think about connecting mathematics and arts. By the way, what I didn't mention here, but I think I mentioned it in my abstract. This is just like a slice of longitudinal study that I'm doing with these students, where I'm really focusing. Students, where I'm really focusing on epistemological beliefs and views of mathematics. So the study is quantitative and then qualitative pieces through which I'm trying to kind of test my findings. And there are a group of us actually working on this, is looking into specific things, samples from mathematics and arts projects to see whether that. To see whether that class or the whole program intervention is successful. So, we should have some paper published on that. If anyone is interested, I'll be happy to email about it. Okay, a few things that I really like from the special issue, Journal of Mathematics and the Arts, special issue on education. And this is also to remind us. And this is also to remind us of bridges that hopefully will happen again this coming summer. This is also School of Science in Finland where they made some 3D representations. The next, this one is from the special issue of where artists devoted to artists. Devoted to artists. So, artists wrote their statements and provided some images. So, this is Laura the Decker Quantum Catwalk that was published in a special issue of journal. Another one from the same issue, which I find interesting, a computational method to generate. Computational method to generate self-animating images. The smooth vector field with opposite directional flow is automatically generated given an input image. So this is a little bit about me, what I do, and two projects that I'm involved right now with STEM education are convergent science initiative projects. Projects both of them have to do a lot with big data and machine learning. But my role is mainly focused on STEM education. And for one of the projects, I'm working on animations in STEM education with faculty from the fine arts. So this is pretty much what I wanted to share with you, and I saved some time to For questions or conversation. Thank you so much. That was wonderful. My pleasure. Thank you. So we have about five minutes left and I'd be happy to field questions. Yeah, please, please thanks our speaker again. And if there are no questions, of course, I can always mention something in the And I can mention that Henry is going to work on a special issue about illustrating mathematics. Henry, if you want to say a sentence about it? In any case, this is also my call for paper as if you have some work that can be a nice manuscript for the Be a nice manuscript for the Journal of Mathematics and the Arts, please consider doing that. I'm also typically interested in having some special issues. We had recently in 2018 special issue in math education. So we might be having the next one in 2022. And before that, we'll have one on illustrating math that I'm excited about that Henry is. About it. Henry is co-guest editor. Hi, Henry. You're muted. Am I supposed to say something about the... Yes, please. A few sentences about how you got motivated or what are your expectations. And I will make sure to share the call for papers before this conference. Right, right. We don't quite have the official call for papers out, but so this is a meeting. So, this is me and Edmund Harris, and the title of the special issue is something like illustrating mathematics or something like that. The focus is on mathematical art, let's say, or the art of illustration. So, when the point of the piece is to explain and illustrate some mathematical objects. And so there was a recent ISOM semester on this, and there's sort of various other aspects of this. There's a question of is illustration art? And we're sort of going at it from the angle that there's an art to how you choose to illustrate a mathematical idea. The choice of medium, how do you make those choices in a good way, this kind of thing. Of thing, so that the deadline I think is going to be something like June this year. So it's June 1st, so it's coming up. But so if you if you have some idea that's sort of along those within within those parameters, then get thinking. One question I had is: when you're doing Is when you're doing this student work with pre-service teachers and having them both write and create art and do mathematics, that's a lot going on. Do you ever get pushback from these pre-service teachers saying, no, I don't do art, I can't do art? Oh, and you're muted. It's a long-term project. They know. Term project. They know about it at the beginning of the semester. And typically, if I get some pushback, I usually try to provide some examples or samples to encourage them to think that they don't necessarily have to be artists in order to find things, explore things, and share. So typically, no, I have no issues about that. But that's a good. That, but that's a good question. Uh, it took me a while to figure out: yeah, I better start this at the beginning of the semester because, yes, it's quite demanding. Yeah, you can't launch this on people, but it's nice. It's nice that there's now this kind of longitudinal collection of images that you can show them and say, look, this has been done before. Thank you for that. Exactly. And of course, I always share Bridges Conference artwork or some other things like that, provide them with some readings. Provide them with some readings. There are some good articles about this, or you know, give illustrations from the journal where other teachers and students are doing similar things. Marin and I both do projects like this. We're very much on the same wavelength. I'm working with pre-service secondary teachers. And I used to have it towards the end of the semester. Now I make it their very first project, and they have to be in touch with. Be in touch with a Bridges artist, replicate a work from last year's Bridges Gallery, then make their own work that somehow spins off from that and make an interactive activity. And once, I mean, and they work in groups, so there's a little bit of pressure off and we define the arts as broadly as possible. So might be a comic strip, might be a poem, might be how-to video, or there's all kinds of different ways to do it. Yeah, any piece of art, yes. Yeah, I love that. Yeah, I love that. And it's never for the whole semester, it's so good. Sure, I didn't ask them to connect with someone from bridges, but I might. That's a really good idea. Yes. Yeah. Struggle with that. Exactly. Well, thank you all for listening to me, chatting with me. Check the journal, write for journal if you want to review also. It's a place to start. So, it's a place to start to be a reviewer for mathematics and arts and get connected in that way.
