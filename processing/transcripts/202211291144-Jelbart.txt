Okay. Okay, so we're going to be very interested in the slow classics through a theory of art instability. So I'm going to start with a one minute brief out of the curiosity stability parameter dependent failures. Okay? So we can consider a very general form for P, for some function u, like the form terminal slide, and some real parameter p, is a very redundant looking equation for this real parameter, and it's therefore direct comparison with this logo problem on the next slide. Next slide. So viewing biifications are biodifications of spatially homogeneous steady states that are linearly stable with respect to their core perturbations, but linearly unstable in a V spatially increased. And if in addition to this you have some kind of nonlinear saturation, then this bounds the linear growth, the solutions, and this generic mechanism for the ones that are frequently. But this is all very well known. This is all very classical stuff, at least locally. It's very well understood. What we're interested in is a so-called slow passive problem, which is a kind of a dynamic generalization. So those of you who like to take on time, we saw a little bit already. That's what we saw yesterday. This is most simply formulated just by allowing the parameter to evolve slowly in time according to a very simple. according to a very similar peak. Epsilon, but epsilon is asymposis for positive. And what's been observed in this dynamic setting of the slow passage through Turing Python instabilities, at least particular classes of Turing Python stabilities, is this so-called delay instability loss phenomenon, which I'm sketching all the five. So the phenomena is the solutions, they seem to drift right from a neighbourhood of the static instability, become denoting Instability, I'll be denoting by the star, the parameter value for a length patient. And they seem to continue in a neighbourhood that the need of repellent stay problem for quite some time before they notice the patient's pattern. That means they're fairly informally in that way. So this has been identified in a particular infection-reaction diffusion problem that was studied by Brendan and Jeffy. Later on, the same problem arose in The same problem arose in a paper by a little while there in Dave L. S. Jackson's worker, but the more important contribution to this final work was that they showed under an additional condition, namely that the existence of a spectral gap at the Turing singularity, that there's a center manifold reduction load in the air is these star. And after center manifold reduction, you get the two-dimensional pass mode of the system. If the original Turing buffer cable has an O2 symmetry, this induces a Symmetry, this induces a reflectional symmetry for the people by the case of the stream banards. So, the nards are identified as a local mechanism for the delay, and this kind of describes in a very nice way for this class with infinite-dimensional problems what's happening in the neighborhood of this stuff. But the the full delay phenomena is is full. Um sorry. But there are, of course, other delay mechanisms. Um, that's what we're talking about. That's what it was about the relate of fabrication. This dates back at least to the work of Su in the 1990s to study relate of fabrication from remote problems for the past few years. Epidoman, the Michael Carbo Poplarage, a whole study for the late stability also state-reactive systems. But there's some pieces and and very interesting literature in this area, but even the dimensional systems look by comparison to the varsity of the final system. That are the faster because the final system is relatively fast. Alright, so we're specifically interested though in the slow passage for experience stability and we want to understand it in detail, so we pick a specific model problem with this dynamic Smithalger equation. It is so called because by setting epsilon to zero, then you get this simple scalar EDD in black, which is a well-known scalar Smithalger equation. If you need no linearity in the real for epsilon, this is a well-known model problem. This is a positive model problem, the bad formation literature. We add these two things in blue. Yeah. Also, we introduced a uh parameter group. Yeah, we can use it as well. Okay, so also we introduce this sort of a random approach because we've we studied the sort of passive problem and then we also introduced this uh meta spot here. And then we also introduce this method called U, here's the stationary log periodic source. So the main thing for understanding the torque is just that it's there to break this reflectional symmetry in U, which is expected to be important for the delay. So let me make a couple of remarks about the static problem for epsilon equals zero. The terrible solution undergoes a very hard instability when V is zero. Our second point is an important one, which is that we studied the problem on an unbounded spatial domain which is a natural setting for a long time. In the spatial domain, there's a method setting for a lot of atmosphere problems. And what this means is that the linearized problem has no spectral capacity. So, in particular, there's no classical set of problem for a couple of minutes approach. The usual approach problems for random-dependent systems is to use modulation theory in place of something like a manifold theory. And this works in the so-called weakly non-linear array. So, just beyond the location of the white location, the patterns are forming. So, if But that's the point. The first step is to make this well-known data truth in sets, where these functions that I'm denoting by capital A are complex valued population functions that vary in rescale space and path. And they can be shown by a formal derivation for a value that will just go and other questions. So I won't go into too many details because this is all very well known and well understood. Moreover, we're going to see the details in the dynamic problem. We're going to see the details of the dynamic problem, but I want you to do an overview of the structure of an algorithm's classical modulation period. This is how we structure the algorithm for an algorithm. So the first step I've already explained. You introduce an amplitude and status, and then you formally derive a G L equation or modulation equation or anything. Then you study solutions to this problem because it's considered to be easier than studying solutions to the original problem. And then you want to try and infer something about solutions. And these results have existed for the scale-student on Merg problem since the early 1990s when it was probably death problems. So with all of this together, in a certain sense you get this roughly approximately two-time diagram that is a powerful algorithm for studying this problem. Study with problem. So, this is more or less the structure of the argument that we want to reproduce now for the slow passing problem. So, we start instead with the dynamics of the Collinver problem, and then the first step is to identify a suitable end size for the patient. Okay, so the entire project is more or less motivated by the following up observations. Thinking about multi-scale rescaling can be made that magnetic after reformulating the university. after reformulating this geometric file method. So this is a statement which is well grounded in the success of geometric file methods for studying dynamic modifications and slow passive problems in finite dimensional systems. It's more or less the motivation now we want to lift this approach to the PD instead of the problem. So the first step is to extend the phase space, include epsilon as an additional variable. The reason we The reason we do this is because we can then simply define the following Bohr transformation which involves epsilon in an important way. So here I'm simply stating the form of the transformation, because this is applied directly on the extended space. And if u does a modulation, ends that's because we replace u with this function that's known in plus IPL. And I'll say a little more about the form of the the transformation and where it comes from. The information where it comes from on the volume slide, but for now I want to point out, as we saw already in Priestin's talk and Thomas's talk, that there's an alternative of brakes to blow up an infinite dimensional system. So here I just want to point out the main distinction, which is that for our problem for our current problem, we're not relying on a preliminary reduction to a final method of the system. This is important for us because we work on it. It's important for us because we work on an update to space and there's no direct spatial discretization in the same sense. There's also no same amount of corporate updates because we work directly to the final bio transformation as in its own. So here's the form of the transformation, again, slightly different notation than the part of Peruvius. The first thing to notice is that this function side the L is the same form as the classical DLN set except that we replaced four parameters That we replaced a small parameter with some time-dependent function. Because we did that, we have to replace the single rescalings of time and space by something a little more complicated, namely these local decingularizations, or the classical derivative relations. This is also standard in bio problems in finer domains, so they're dealing with the designularized space as well. You can actually, in a very direct way, see the sound. Direct way see the sense in which this can be viewed as a dynamic generalization of the classical PLA sets. So there's an invariant restriction of the block transformation, it's this set f naught r is equal to zero. And if you impose that, you can show that this time-dependent function r reduces to a constant, which you may as well call delta. And if you do so, then you get back the classic DLN size. The DLN size is contained within this transformation. So this So, this all explains a little about where it comes from, or the motivation. The last point is just if we could comment on the geometry of the blown up space, but I think that this is just easy to show. So, on the left, you have the original phase space, which is not quite fully specified. You have your real variable B on the horizontal axis, and you have some finite space X on the vertical axis, and on the right, you have the bone upspace, where the vertical axis is being replaced by this lower school. I'm also showing the local coordinates because we work on a non-trigger manifold, so we need to work on local coordinates on objectations. These are just defined projectively. So we're going to be working this chart which we call K1. This is the standard rotation in the area. It's defined as by setting the device equal to minus 1, and it covers the region changes red. From there, we move into From there we move into this every retailer chart, day two, and from there we go to type day three, just to find projects. Okay, and then this is just how the notations down the bottom in that picture of the page. Alright, and this is just the global geometry and the local coordinates, but what's more interesting facts are the normal modulation equations that come out. So if you apply this blob up transformation and then you apply the same formal derivation that you see The same formal derivation that you see in classical modulation theory, so you match formally the frequencies and about R. Then, at the first order solvability condition, what you get is a GL equation of the following form. It's a real cubic GL equation, which is natural, which we started from the Bomber problem. And you get a time-dependent media coalition. And this is posed locally on the bonus space. Right, of course, you can also Right, of course, you can also formulate this in local order charts, and these are the equations that we get at the formal leading order. We have these additional time-intended variables epsilon online, which would epsilon three of these or govern by their own ODEs. They can be solved more explicitly, substituted here for the reflections. Um one important thing to notice already from a dynamical point of view is that we included this additional source term at the outset. Additional source term at the outset because we wanted to break this reflectional symmetry that we expect to be important for the delay. But at the formal leading order, you don't see the effect of the source at all, and in fact, this leading order G-Legener has the same reflectional symmetry, so you might expect a slight delay. It turns out that this is important, and we'll see this in the results uh in the next few slides. If you want to capture the effect of the source, then what you need to do is you need to go to higher order corrections. And this can be done in a systematic way. This can be done in a systematic way. You just need to take a more complicated ants for u. That's this function side n. It's a complicated looking function. I don't want to talk too much about where it came from. You can read it off the well-known form in population theory, except you need to replace deltas with RFTs and use L cup displacement. The main point is that at the lead order you get the same DL cup equations, and at the first order correction, you see the influence of the source. The influence of the source. There are some other terms I don't want to describe in detail, but you get a list of equations up to some finite number, depending on the order in which you try and take the approximation. And a set of algebraic equations, and so forth on pretty equal modes, but this is all not all important for understanding what's happening. The most important thing, as I said, is just that at the leading mode of a rectangular false concept. Alright, so this ends the Ends the the first step? Yeah, and I know that it's basically kind of started. Yeah, and I've only got a first step in it. But that's also fun because this is the most important step for the test that has the first time. But um yeah, so the key here is um the key observation which we hope is transferable to other problems here, right, is that you start with what's hopefully already established classical theory and then you replace an end. And then you replace any insights with a blow-off transformation. But the next step is to derive the solutions of the modulation approximations. We formerly derived these modulation equations in the binomial space and now we want to study their dynamical signals. We get two different sets of solutions depending on whether or not we break the symmetry. So depending upon whether or not mu is zero. In the general case, if mu is non-zero, In the general case, if mu is non-zero, then we can describe solutions after this time, which we denote by capital P, which corresponds to an x exactly which is after H2. That is partial. We would love to go all the way. We just can't control certain terms in the estimates. But what another distance is corresponds to a distance which is order epsilon V one R past the location of sort of static biocation point, and this is precisely the weak end of the figure HD which you can study. The weakened order actually static view. So it's good enough to compare the predictors for static views. Um, in the second case, in the symmetric case, if view was zero, then we can describe the whole pattern. And the principle says by saying that we can describe it up to this one pattern. Alright, so we get one result in each case. Here's the first case. Now we have a fixed choice of phase space. We work in uniformly local solar spaces, which is Solar spaces, which is the standard choice for these types of problems. These conditions basically say that you need to assume sufficient regularity for neutral conditions. And if you have that, then for epsilon sufficiently small, then we know that these are acid bodies. They occur at root epsilon, and they're covered by this modulation function A1 and 2, represented in chart K2, which, surprisingly, is not the leading order term, the leading order formal or the Now we have something drawing the norm, which they show into this system. Okay, so let me just show you this diagrammatically in the bite-up space. So here is a sketch. The main leader force is we want to see what happens to the formal leading orders. So this reflectional symmetry that we noted already does leave you with a leg. And this shows up if you look at the normal. Shows up. If you look at the norms of the modulation functions, you can show that even if the x-axis are x-rays accepted, they're pretty small. So the step goes back to the higher orders. What's interesting from a dynamical point of view is that it means that the leading order dynamics are not only smaller in diversity epsilon, but they're governed by this leading order correction term A12, which can be approximately solved because it's close to a linear info V delta. Information with the L-type equation. For our linear choice of sources approximately constant, it means that all solutions at this point in time are approximated by rolls, but the size of the action. Is this strongly dependent on the choice of the source? Did it just seeks the source? Of course, there are partial results. And if you continue to evolve time then eventually this delay mechanism in the form will be available. Mechanism in the formal leading order will will give out and then this term will give back in, and then it's expected to be important, but by then maybe your approximation is so long about it and so anyway. I don't know. Right. In the second case, okay, so if mu was zero and then we're in the symmetric setting, in this case we could do a lot better in the sense that we can describe the full passage, and then what this result says is that there's a delayed stability loss. So the first So the first condition, on the initial condition, the feature says that you have to have sufficient contraction, enough time which is okay one on the approach to a bulb. So if you have that, then the second equation says that the norm status can have to be small up until the distance past the static rotation point, which is given by this modulus of the initial condition minus C capital K. But it's capital K down to the size of the initial conditions. In other words, there's a delay which is a problem. There's a delay which is approximately symmetric in the initial condition in this bit. We only prove the existence of the delay. We don't characterise the jump, which means that we provide a lower bound for the delay time and not an upper bound. Now, if you study the dynamics of the linear problem, which is expected from predicted drive for delay, then you can prove for certain solutions that there is a jump. There is a jump um at this symmetric region. The symmetric values are V. There's other approaches, there's a previous work by never going down to a couple of multiples, then more scalar problems you can use up for as well as solutions to characterize them. It's probably possible for this problem too, but that's for future work. I mean, for anyone who has the time. Alright, so just in order to save time, Just in order to save time, because I need to come to the main results, I'm going to give just a pictorial overview of the proof. And so I can skip all of the details and just invite anyone to ask questions later on. Nevel 1 amounts to a description of a transition map up to an extension in tar K2, as is shown in the diagram. And so the proof conceptually is the same as you would see in standard law of life arguments. First, we describe a component map which describes the dynamics in charge one. describes the the dynamics in calculate one. And then we compose this with the second map which describes dynamics in calculate one. Okay, but then the two things we need to cover a full passage which means that this is three different problems that we need to understand and connect. But yeah, I skip all of the details in this team. But people are okay. So we managed to say something about the dynamics of these GL approximations. Of these GL approximations, and now we want to infer something about the dynamics of the Greek homework problem, but to do that, we need an approximation theorem which validates the formal derivation of these GL equations. So here's the result that we get. It says for theta A is sufficiently large, this means for sufficiently regular initial conditions to the dual equations. And if the etal is sufficiently small, we have the following, the dynamics of the Colbert solutions with bounded initial conditions. In the first case, if new is non-zero. In the first case, if new is non-zero, then we know that the error is bounded up until this time permit. And we know that at this time period is bounded by 1 to the n minus 2.4, which is the same for it in the setting trigger. So here, n, it counts the number of firewall corrections. Uh in the symmetric case, then we can do better. We can describe well, we can show that the error is exponentially small up until the distance which is order one past the Order one past the standard qualification point, but it's likely that often will be one of these annually. Boom. Which just comes from the fact that we can't control some things. It's not what we would like. But it's nonetheless, it still brings you to an order one distance past the right location. Well, it doesn't get you as far as the dynamic results that we have for the GL approximation. Alright, you also had this significant improvement on the diameter of the space of initial emissions compared with predictions from static periods. With predictions from static theory, and this is just because in the dynamic setting, then you start in a linearly asymptotically stable region. So it doesn't really matter if the solutions start far apart because every concept has tracked into some quantum state state. But this looks like a major improvement, but it's not so surprising that. Okay, so the proof is more or less along the same lines as the proof of the approximation theorem, the classical modulation theorem, except that we have. The first is that we replace a small parameter with defined random variable places with R of P. The second is that we work on a manifold. Otherwise, uh you just apply the same steps. The first step is you define this weighted error function capital R in this way, and then you differentiate it in time and then reformulate it with the very end of the constant formula and Formula, and you get this integral equation for the error which you just want to bound. You just want to bound them so that it's as small as possible or as long as possible. I don't want to go into the details here because there's not enough time, but this just boils down to controlling each term in the right-hand side. So you need to control the norm for the evolution family. This is an evolution family and not a semi-group. This group like delta by this R of P. You need to control the residual and You need to control the residual in the nonlinear terms with the notify F, and then you need to do this in chart K1, propagate that error into chart K2, and then it begins to K3 possible. I just want to point out where the two bases are distinguished. So if you break the symmetry, then you have algebraic control over the residual, which basically follows from the formal construction of the case sets. So this this is okay, but then This is okay, but then what this means is that when you get into chart K3 and you're in a linearly isymbotically unstable regime, then the evolution family is growing exponentially and it's acting on something that you want to have algebraic control over. So this is why we can't push the results through the forecast. Um in the second case, you get exponential control over the residual because you get this additional factorization with the modulation contents which we've shown side-slide. Functions which we've shown satisfy a delay property. In other words, all of the norms are supposed to enter these forms. So you can control the residual for long enough, traveling okay free for a longer time. For an order one amount of time. Okay, so this leads to the two different assertions in the result. And then finally, we come to the main result on this reform problem. So let Q V is a solution to dynamics of the Colmberg equation. We're bound in the initial conditions, then we have the following. Initial conditions, then we have the following with epsilon. We have linear asymptotics that are basically in agreement with the predictions from the GL and stats. In our case, they're approximated by rolls of size 3x1. And there's a delayed civilian loss phenomenon up until this distance pass the uh the location of the standing by the case, which is given by the modulus of the method V minus by two. Would be minus root two. And this minus root two comes from this slightly sublime down that we had in these error estimates, but nonetheless, it's sufficient to prove the late stability loss for an order one. Now, of course, then we also have this improvement in the size of the space of initial condition, so it requires for a large class of solutions, bounded just solutions in uniform remote solid workspaces without uh boundary. Um Uh the output. Um what I found in the different things and these follow-directly from our results and computer approximations of the equals. Okay, and then with that we have a more or less commutative diagram. And this is more or less the end of the talk. The outlook and the hope of the future is that this approach that we took in the first step is transferable to the study of dynamic quantifications in T V more generally. Um so we hope uh that it's useful for us. Is for us in understanding new problems and for others as well. On that last point in the previous slide, there's some questions. You relied on the fact that the complex internet for Lambda equation is the reduction uh of the altitude for the number. How how general is this actually, right? I mean this is sort of a big step. I mean it's a very nice way you can actually add along those previous results and you speculate on this bit more. So to an object of you, I mean the experts in classical modulation theory don't know how to do it, then I don't know how to do it. Then I don't won't have the dynamic X but if I mean if the if the modulation instance is known then there are many interesting Ps are out there where that is following the one that's totally the the GL equation is a universal um it's a universal modulation equation which folds down a lot like case of what you mean that's what we mean by a lot because it comes through a lot of people can hear it And if it's locally quadratic at this brain, then this is all you. This is all you need to assume in order to derive a modulation answer, which has the same form, which is why it's known as sort of universal or something like inverse almost like a normal form. Or the dynamics close to the pattern space, but yeah, so it is a large class of problems. I mean, for us, I mean, my natural next step is to look at that. One that next step is to look at abstract problems and see what additional problems arise, but yeah. So okay, so for accessible with longer population, you have also results that um that you can essentially okay, so you get an approximation result first on large time scales, but you can extend this to like infinite time scales essentially by or infinite time by saying And maybe here, okay, so the problem is of course that you that you kind of this this this v is decreasing, right? So now it's I I don't I don't that my v linearly decrease with sign, but I just that it can be, you know, like a step kind of function or a smooth step function, so that I move it from unstable to stable. We can be able to exploit such results and get this also from the plus. It's a good question, right? And it really puts a cap on what we're allowed to on what we're aiming to derive, like the fact that we can't extend the result of the charges. More or less related to the fact that we can't control the solutions along in our time scales. Yeah. In some cases, so I mean I mean if you have that it's If you have that anyone that has a better knowledge of this behavior, the global attractor project that is in the local exploiting in the probably anyways, you you cannot expect that to have such a result because you can keep increasing the instability of sketching something. Yeah, I I also have a good idea of including like an infinite sound on a because ideally what you hope for is if you get a minimum for all when you get algebraic and for all the modulation period and then send a matter of whole which I just don't know what happens with that. Okay, let's thank Sam again for a really excellent conversation.
