for inviting me here. Among many things, this is really nice place and also it's great to get away from the heat wave to be here in a cool place. So this is a project I've been working on in the last few years. It's a tomography problem, and also it's a universe problem, and it involves the non-linearity. So I think it fits the topic of the workshop very well. So that's why I decided to talk about this. All right. Alright, so the yeah, so I will start the very straightforwardly. So I will my setup is the X-ray tomorrow. Very basic X-ray tomorrow. We have seen this X-ray transform in two talks this morning, but mine is the very basic Random transform. So let's see how it fancy one. So I can even show you the definition here. So I consider the actual transform, the random transform on R2. And here you can imagine that, you know, And here we can imagine that we have f is a tenuous coefficient that we want to recover. And so now the parameterization of the actually of the Rambling transform, I use the Venbean type of parameterization. So here, imagine your stuff is here. And so now you integrate the function f along these lines. So I want to say that I want to mention, I think most of you are familiar with this, but I want to mention the parameterization here because I'm going to use it later. So here you choose a angle 5. So here you choose a angle phi, which determines the direction, and then you prescribe the distance of the line to the region, this S. Therefore, with S and Phi, you can prescribe all these lines, and they're unique with a function on these lines. So it's very standard random transform. Of course, for this random transform, we basically know a great deal about it. We know that there is an inversion function, this filter back projection. Projection. So if you know the random transform, you apply this function, the R star is an adjoint and IA versus the raised potential, then you will get F back. So there's no surprise here. It works very well. And in practice, if you can model the actual tomometry by using Randall transform, then you can recover your ammonia. So there's no strength points here. Okay, so now what's the interesting, you know, why we consider this kind of thing? So now there are Thanks. So now there are new things in this actual tomography. So noteboard is this so-called metal artifacts. So of course in the ideal world you can model the actual tomography by using the random transform, but we're not in the ideal world. So now the thing is that a lot of times the inversion function works if your actual data is actually in the range of the running transforms. Range of the Randall transforms. But in your additions, it's not always true. So now, if it's not in the, if your data is not in the range of the Randall transform here, then you will have a mismatch term and then you will get the artifacts. So now a typical phenomena in the actual tomography is this metal artifacts for dense objects such as metal and teeth. So here I show you two examples, but this is very common. If you Google metal artifacts after you see keys, then you will see a lot of clinical images. See a lot of clinical images involving this kind of phenomena. So, but I think these ones are simulations. So, first, let's start with the right column. So, for the second column here, it's a dental image for patients with metal implants. So, here you can see that these are your teeth, and these three bright spots represent metal implants. And now, when you do this X-ray filter back projection, you Of filter back projection, you will see this reconstruction with this dark stripes surrounding these metals. And this is the so-called metal artifacts or straightening artifacts. So this is very common for dental imaging. And so this picture is not so great, but even for the teeth, the teeth are made of bones, which are also very, you know, relatively dense. Now, even for the bones, you can see there are artifacts. Can see there are artifacts around them, but they're not that significant as opposed to the metals. So, this phenomenon will be related to dense objects. So, now that's one example. And for the first column, this is maybe not very clear what is this image. So, this is the image of the hip. And for a patient with metal implants, you know, for the joints, so now usually, you know, for the So now, usually, you know, for this big joint here, you have a, you know, you replace it with the ball and the socket, and then so you can turn. And this two bright spot represents those metals and this are made of titanium. And when you do the CT reconstruction using filter by projection, you will see these artifacts around surrounding metal region. So that's the phenomenon that we want to study because usually these artifacts are very common for Are very common for people with metal impulse, and they will cause because they will cover the regions of interest, so cause problems for diagnosis. So, the outstanding problem for this manual artifacts is to find a way to reduce, remove, or at least reduce this effect. Okay, so now before we go to the mathematics of this problem, I want to show you a few more experiments to get a better understanding. To get a better understanding of this phenomenon. So, first of all, this phenomenon is nonlinear. So, now these are the simulations that I did using MATLAB. And so, basically, you know, I have this phantom image here, and I put two metal regions, sort of around disks. Now, you will see these artifacts around this disc. However, if you remove one of them with the same algorithm, same mechanism, then you will. Mechanism, then you will, you know, the RFS will just disappear. So, therefore, this indicates that this phenomenon must be anomaly, otherwise, you would have some sort of a superposition principle. So, another feature for this problem is that it highly depends on the geometry of the metal region. So, you see for this picture here, we have one metal region, which is a disk, and there's no artifacts in the reconstruction. However, if you replace that disk with this piecewise loose region, so another So now this is a quarter of a disk, it's a pi-shaped region. You still get, even though you have one object, you still have the artifacts around the lines and also the corners. And also, if you replace the object with the non-stricted convex region like this, and here you have a point where the convexity changes, then you will see artifacts also along this direction. So therefore, this phenomenon. So therefore this phenomenon, these are the two main features for this problem that is non-linear and also depends on how it depends on the temperature. And these are where, you know, why this kind of answers you why is this not in the range? Because you put a little s onto on top? Why is this not? So you were arguing that if you are outside of the range, you are in travel and so in this range. I will explain why this is not in the range, but it's not I have an add noise. But uh it's not a I haven't add noise yet. If you add the noise, then you will have other uh uh uh artifacts. Yeah, but physics. Yeah, it's a good couple. Yeah, I'll show you in a minute. Yeah, but that's good. Any other questions? Okay, all right, so okay, so now uh let's see uh what is the mathematics behind this thing, right? So all right, so now basically um there are many so there are many uh So, there are many physics that can lead to these kind of artifacts, and the most significant one will be the so-called beam hardened effects. And this is particularly for this dense object that I mentioned. It's because for dense objects, so the problem is this, when you do this X-ray imaging, you send the X-ray, and the ideal world you will think, well, this X-rays are with the photons with the same energy, say E0. And that would be the monothic X-ray beam. However, in the real world, it's very hard to make this kind of beam with the same energy. So in reality, your photons will be in an energy bundle from E0 minus epsilon to E0 plus epsilon. So this is a polychromatic X-ray beam. Now, for the dense object, then the attenuation coefficient will highly depend on the energy. So therefore, when the beam So, therefore, when the beam passes the object, and because the attenuation coefficient depends on the energy, and then you cannot take into account the dependency in the modeling. And therefore, usually you will consider your actual attenuation coefficient to be some F E 0 plus an additional term which approximates the dependency on this for the metal region. So, if you have a metal region D here, you have a kind of this function. You have a kind of this function. Basically, you can use this alpha to approximate the derivative of the attenuation coefficient on this region. Therefore, your actual attenuation coefficient will be something that does not depend on the energy and plus an additional term. So, that's why you get this mismatch term in the X-ray model. So, now with this model, and now if you use the Beer-Lamber model to derive the X-ray data, then you will get this random time. Then you will get this random transform of FE plus the mismatch term. So that's how we get this additional term. Now, in general, this term will be a nonlinear function of the random transform of the metal region, because you have this additional term here. This is where you have the artifacts. Otherwise, you don't have it. So in general, you can say that, well, this match term is a non-linear function of. A nonlinear function of arc ID, and this nonlinear function depends on a lot of factors. It depends on the energy of the actual beam, depends on this Fe, even this Fe0 here. So therefore, it's not very easy to get this F directly. So now, under further assumptions, you can derive a simpler model for this function, this non-normal function f. This is derived in a paper by Sell and authors. And for example, And co-authors. And for example, you can drop that under a lot of assumptions, especially the energy distribution. So then you can get this central model, which is just prime trans by this alpha. But this only works under a lot of, you know, under this assumption. So therefore, this will be the basic physical model for this metal-artman phenomena. But similar things would happen with scattering. If you have a quantum scattering, you would have a similar phenomenon. And so now if you apply the filter back projection, then that PMA term will be like that. That PM interim with different artifacts. It's impossible. So now for the inverse problem that we study, actually we want to find a way to reduce or remove these artifacts. And then it turns out there are many attempts to, especially in American analysts, they do a lot of these methods to remove these artifacts. But one thing that we realized, and also it's very clear, that this identification of the non-name function. That this identification of a non-name function is the key for removal, for removing this artifact. So, in principle, you have two unknowns because this metal region is also unknown. Therefore, to remove this term, you need to know the metal region plus the nonlinear function. But in reality, also from the pictures I've shown before, you can see that metal regions are pretty clear with the artifacts. So, therefore, you can use image processing method to first define the metal region, and you assume that you can assume. Better region, and you can assume that this is null, and therefore, the only challenge here is to find this nonlinear function f in order to remove these artifacts. So, therefore, we can consider the following problem that we want to recover this non-interfunction and then remove the artifact. Actually, this has been done in a previous work by PARC in 2016. That's two-step first. You do this, reconstruct the CHID from image processing method, and then you use they actually use this model here. Actually, use this model here and then choose the correct optimal alpha to reduce the artifacts. So that's the action right here. Alright, so then the main result that I'm going to show you today is a theoretical result for recovering this nonlinear term from the artifacts. So in some sense, this artifacts are generated from the nonlinear function. And once it appears, we want to say that it reveals. You want to say that it reveals nonlinear functions so we can't remove it. Now, this actually is based on philosophy that nonlinearity can actually help you solve this problem, leader's problem, and demonstrated by this work by Kirk Vlas and Woohon in 2013. I believe that in this workshop you will see some, several talks on this line. And so, now what's the challenge for our problem? So, usually, when you consider this nominal. Usually when you consider this non-work problem, for example, you consider a semi-linear wave equation, and here we have this coefficient A here times B square. The way to recover this nonlinear function is by using a family of sources. Here, you can change the source, you might have U to find A. And for this kind of universal problem, you will need to vary the source. Usually, you choose this F to be a family depending on several parameters, epsilon 1, epsilon 2. Parameters, epsilon 1, epsilon 2, and then you vary epsilon 1, epsilon 2, do an expansion of u, and then in some of the terms, especially this term here, you will find this information of the A. So now this approach requires a lot of data, because you have to vary this epsilon 1, epsilon 2. Now for our problem, we only have one shot, because when you do this actual CP, you want to take one image and then use that to get the nonlinear function. So this is the difficulty that we have very limited data. Because if you change Limited data. Because if you change anything, you change the energy or anything, then the non-linear function will depend on the energy. So, therefore, this method won't work in that case. So, this is the main challenge is that we need one set of data to recover the non-functions. Alright, so now I'm going to show you how we'll do this. So, first, I will, I think I don't have a lot of hypertension, so I will consider a very simple setup with two. A very simple setup with two metal objects. You have considered multiple, but two is enough. So consider two, a strict convex region as the metal region. I will take a very simple non-linear function A times this archi d squared, very simple case. And then this is the artifacts that we're supposed to have here. So now how do we analyze this artifacts? So now the approach that we take is micro-local. So now perhaps the first series of work on this Perhaps the first serious work on this metal artifact was this one by Park Torn Sell in 2017. And they give a micro, you know, the wavefront analysis of the artifacts. So basically what they show is the following. So first you find, you use this phi and S in the first slide of my talk to parameterize these lines. And then you say that, well, because you see the artifacts in the reconstruction, because that's where your reconstruction has a singularity. Your reconstruction has a singularity. So, therefore, you think, well, if you have a line, then this line is a, you characterize this line by using the wavefront set. So, if the reconstruction FCT is singular on this line, so we have a wavefront set of non-zero, then this line will be a streaking artifact. Now, what they did in this paper was to get the characterization of these artifacts. So, basically, this line is a streaking artifact in the sense of wavefront sets if In the sense of wavefront sets, if you look at the Randall transform of the chi T. So here is the original image. Now you look at the Randall transform. So this is the sinogram. And you particularly look at those points where your function could be singular in two directions. So now in this picture here, this Randall transform of chi D, you can see that at these four corner points, your function is singular in two directions. It could be singular in two directions. And this is a comparison of. Two direction. And this is a comparison from wavefronts at level. It's that this four point will give you the lines that will show as the artifacts. Actually, you have four, because this line corresponds to lines that are tangent to both objects. So you get four lines. And for the other points, if this does not satisfy, then they're not the artifact. So now this is the macro local approach for describing the artifact. Of course, you know, we can do better because, see, this. Better because you see, this is this arc ID here. This is a characteristic function of a metal region. So it's a very special type of function, especially if your region is strictly complex. So therefore, by using more precise notion of distributions, we can give a positive analysis of the artifacts. So first of all, we can use the notion of a normal distribution. That means the function is only singular along, you know, across a certain semantic. In this case, it's A certain sum atom in this case is this line, this curves, and the random transformation singular across the curves. Now, by using the normal distributions, we can pretty much, you know, for this nonlinearity here, do a very simple expansion because we have two objects. And then this term, we can show that it doesn't produce new singularities. So this term is good. But this term has a, you know, this is the product of R chi D1 and R chi D2. Both of them are distributions. Both of them are distribution. One is a singular cross point curve. The other one is both of them are singular across curves. But they will be crossing this curves that has an intersection point. And that's where you have new singularities. So that's why we would have the artifacts. So basically, for this term, you need to understand the product of these two clonal distributions, but this can be fit into the frequency. But this can be fed into the framework of a pair of monologue distributions appearing in work of Malwood's one and the given moment. And basically, you have a new singularity produced at the intersection point, but the point is that using these distributions, we have a more precise description of the singularities. And therefore, in the work with Placios and Woman, I proved that the actual artifacts in this setup will belong to away from the intercept because the artifact will be. Because the artifact will be tangent to the mental region, and away from that intersection point, the artifact will show, will be a normal distribution of a certain order to this line. So, this is a more precise description of the artifact compared to the wavefront analysis. So, actually, by using this more precise distribution spaces, we can analyze, we can also address other geometries. So, in this work, we can also already address the We can also already address the piecewise micro polygon shaped metal region. And yeah, it's like a semi-disc region like that. And we can deal with polynomial type of nonlinearity. And then in the work, joint work with Joey Zhou here, we can also address the non-convex objects when you have a inflection point. So, okay, it'll be So okay, I'll be very brief because I want to focus on the English problem. So basically in this case, so let me show you the picture. In this case, you have a typical picture is this, where you have a metal region where you have this inflection point where the complexity changes. And in this case, we have a result that the artifacts will be coming from the inflection points and also possible points when you Points and also possible points when you have to, you know, if the line is tangent to two inflection points. Exactly, you know, so the artifact will be either tangent to the inflection point here or this one here, which is tangent to this two convex point. So now for this purpose, we actually had to use a distribution space which was designed to study the interaction of waves in the Of waves in the work of Maros Vargo and Worski back in the 1990s. So, you know, so that's the gist is that by using more precise distribution space and especially with the space that we can use to analyze the non-linearity, we can push this pretty far. All right, so now finally, let's see, how do we, I mean, how do we recover the non-interity? So all this analysis. So, all this analysis tells you the nature of the artifacts. But the problem with this is the previous analysis is that it only tells you where the artifact could appear. But it doesn't tell you when this will appear. So, therefore, to recover the nonlinear function, you will need to know a more precise, basically you need to find a lower bound of the way from set. That means, you know, if you have this situation, then the artifact definitely would show up, and then that will tell you the information of the non-near. And then that will tell you the information of the non-linearity function. So it's very simple. If you replace your learning function, you know, previously we considered Pogida non-linearity, if you consider it as a polynomial nonlinearity, if you apply the previous analysis to try to recover all this Aj's coefficients, it's not going to work because you consider F and R pi D, and all this term you raise to power J, they belong to a certain kilometer. j, they belong to a certain Colombian distribution space, but these powers in general they all belong to the same Colombian distribution, they all belong to the same Colombian distribution space. So you cannot tell them apart. So therefore there's a possibility that this, you know, the artifact generated from all these power terms could cancel each other or they could represent the same string. So therefore you cannot use this to recover this a j, this coefficients. So that's the main problem here. So that's the main problem here. And therefore, we need an even more precise analysis of the Raman transform of Chi D to extract information of this AJ. So that's what we need to do. And that's my last part of the talk. So in the literature, there are actually a class of connotal distributions based studied by Pirio. And in that case, if you raise this F, if F is a Piriot distribution, you raise it to 10 power, then the regular would. Power, then the regularity would improve. And therefore, you can tell from the strengths of the artifacts, you can tell apart from these nonlinear effects. However, you can show that this arc ID will not belong to this space. So therefore we need to figure this out if we can get something more from here. Another key observation in this is that if B is a strictly convex, If D is strictly convex, then actually you can gain a little bit of a K in this archive D. Because maybe you can see from the previous picture here, so this black region will denote value zero. So you can see that we have the two regions, this is RID, so these are zero. So they will basically vanish on one side of the curve, around the transform. And interestingly, And interestingly, you can, if the region is strictly complex, you can show that there is a vanishing order of. So, first of all, you have to find a, we can show that there is a, you can basically straighten up the curve and then choose a defining function, which choose the correct coordinates. This y2 will be the coordinate that is orthogonal to the curve. And then you will get a vanishing order to one-half. So, and also we find out that this h is a non-vanishing. That this H is not managing. It's very important for recovered non-linearity. But then the rest will be more rapid. So they will manage even faster than this power. And this is the key. So two things. So first vanishing order here is important. In Curial's distribution, this would be an integer order. Now this is a fraction order. And also this H has to be non-zero, because otherwise if this term disappears, then you have to look for the next term. Now this only happens if your domain is strictly convex. This is very interesting. Domains triggered comax. This is very interesting. So, yeah, so you see here, you consider integrating your function. Suppose your function is supported within the curve. Now you integrate your function along this line and you move it up. And if your region is strictly convex, then the random transform will go from zero to non-zero. And with a banished order like one-half, has to be one-half. But if your region is non-strequency convex, and now, so here if you integrate along. So, here, if you integrate along the line below this axis, you get zero. Immediately, when you reach this line, your integration will be non-zero. So, therefore, there is a heavy side type of singularity if your region is non-strictly covered. So, therefore, this won't work for non-strict complex region. It only works for a string college region. And once you have this, I think this Joey mentioned that this kind of behavior also is related to the analysis of fossil NARA and NAR and MEROS, and also in the previous work by NAR, Nicole, and Peternan classes, the range of Reynolds transfer. So, but anyway, so once you have this in vanishing order, now you consider the power of the Arc ID, then they're vanishing even faster. Therefore, you can tell them apart, and then you can even analyze the the product of all this uh uh arc ID one, I D two to get the the vanishing order. But the the key is that uh the speeding order terms they're always non-vanishing. Feeling more terms, they're always non-vectional, so therefore, we can use that to recover the non-founderity from this f r chi b. So, I think you know, this is my final results. Basically, if you have an attenuation coefficient, f which h plus r chi b, and you do this, you can, and you assume that the h is smooth, then this f can be uniquely determined from the from fcd. So that's the result. But this can be generalized. This h is. This H may not be smooth. As well as the similarity does not meet the similarity of the artifacts, then you are fine. And also, this F, there's some ways that you can generalize these. And currently we are working on a numerical development based on this analysis. And we try to use polynomiality and then first recover the meta region and then use this result to remotely cut back. Yeah, so this work is based on, you know, this is supported by NSF, and then there are some references here. Yeah, thank you very much. Are there any questions for Euro? Could you go back on the slide? I just want to look at that slide. Okay. If not, let's thank Iran. And just a reminder that now we have a break until 2 p.m., which we would love it if you
