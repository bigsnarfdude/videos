I thought first started looking at these things that there wouldn't be, well, A, I thought there wouldn't be many examples. And then B, I thought maybe, okay, maybe there's some examples, but maybe you can't do much with it. But it's been surprising to me at least how much you can do in an arbitrary tangent category. So we'll talk about differential objects or kind of the analog of vector spaces. I'll talk about affine connections as well, what those are. We'll see sort of why I'm picking those two things as well. And then I'll briefly mention some of the many other things you can do in a tangent category. You can talk about vector fields, vector bundles. You can talk about vector fields, vector bundles, differential forms. Really, part of our goal has been to try and eventually translate anything you can find in a differential geometry book into tangent categories. You open a tangent differential geometry book to a random page, and hopefully you can find some analog of it in tangent categories. And the idea is that you can take those ideas and transport them to any other differential, to any other tangent category, not just the category of smooth manifolds. And that's the overall plan. There's still lots of things left to do in this overall sort of program. Okay, so. Okay, so JS talked about Cartesian differential categories and Robin is talking about those as well, but they're not really sufficient for differential geometry. So the category of smooth manifolds, the typical place where differential geometry occurs, is not a Cartesian differential category. And one of the big problems here is how the form the derivative takes. So remember from a Cartesian differential category has this operation with every map from F A to B, giving you a derivative map, which goes from A cross A to B. But really, that's kind of. But really, that's kind of mixing up two things in a sense. This d is a directional derivative. As we were talking about earlier, the leftmost coordinate, the leftmost A is taking in the point, and the rightmost coordinate is kind of taking in a vector. You're sort of applying the derivative of F at A in the direction of the first A in the direction of the second A. So really the first A here is a point, and one of the A's is the point, and the other one's a vector. And that's kind of hidden in a Cartesian differential cutter. It's kind of baked in that the same type of thing. Of baked in that the same type of thing. So, in a sense, in a Cartesian differential category, all your objects are vector spaces, not in the sense of having some kind of scalar action, but in the sense of they are spaces of vectors. But even if you move a little bit away from vector spaces, you move to smooth functions to find on some open subset u of a, and possibly going to some open set subset v of b, now its derivative is going to take in well the points it can take in any u, but the vectors it can take in is any element of a. Take in is any element of A. So if you imagine some open subset in R2, an open ball, there's all possible tangent vectors you can take, but not possibly all possible points. And the result will be something in B, not necessarily something in V. So as soon as you move a little bit away from vector spaces or that kind of thing, Cartesian differential categories aren't the right thing. And as soon as you move even more generally to smooth manifolds, where smooth manifolds being sort of locally look like open subsets of Rn, but in general, sort of piecing together open. But in general, sort of piecing together open bits of Rn. You can build something called the tangent bundle. So it consists of all tangent vectors at all possible points of M. Here we have this picture here with the sphere and this TPS2 is all the tangent vectors at the point P. So you imagine sort of putting down a plane on the sphere and looking at all the possible tangent vectors out of that point P. Now you do this for all the possible points P and glue all those things together, and you get what you consider the tangent bundle. We consider the tangent bundle. It can be sort of hard to visualize quite quickly. You know, already sort of doubles in dimension. So as soon as it gets to the tangent bundle of anything more than like, if you have like R2, it's something in a subset of R2, its tangent bundle is already something in R4. So it gets really hard to visualize what it looks like. But you can build this thing. But in general, it's not true that the tangent bundle of M will be isomorphic to M cross M. That's maybe just for vector spaces or even Tm isomorphic to M cross A. Tm isomorphic to m cross A for some vector space A, like F with open subsets. Sort of well-known thing with even the sphere, if M is a sphere, the Harry Ball theorem, consequence of that, tells you that the tangent bundle of the sphere is not just locally, it looks like an open subset cross a vector space, but globally it can't be, it's not isomorphic smoothly to m cross some vector space. So a tangent bundle is its own thing, and it's not just m cross m and it's not just some m cross m. m cross m and it's not just some m cross a so it's some other object in this category of smooth manifolds and what we kind of do this is sort of a central structure in differential geometry so we want to see what kind of categorical structure does this tangent bundle possess what kind of uh sort of what are the structures sort of the axioms that you can talk about the central properties of this tangent bundle and that's we're going to axiomatize okay um so first of all this assignment is is functorial so if you have an So, if you have an object M and take it to Tm, that's sort of an assignment of objects in this category. But if I have a smooth map from M to N, there is an associated map from Tm to Tn. Locally, it consists of essentially both the function and its derivative. So it takes a point x and a vector v. So I'm sort of writing the coordinates of Tm locally, like a point in a vector like this, and it's going to apply f in the first coordinate, and it's going to take the directional derivative x in the direction v in the second coordinate. Direction v in the second coordinate. So it has this kind of action. This is how it looks like sort of as action on arrows, and it's involving again both the function and its derivative. And this df is, let's say, the directional derivative, this sort of operation axiomatizing Cartesian differential categories. So you can sort of guess, and I'll see this later, that any Cartesian differential category will be a tangent category with this kind of operation of doing both the function and its derivative. And one thing that's already nice about this point of view, just changing the point of view a little bit. Nice about this point of view, just changing the point of view a little bit about what's going on with the derivative, seeing it as sort of a component of this larger thing, is that if you want to show this a functor, you have to show it preserves composition, of course. If I do TF, TG, and TF, TF, TG, the same thing as TFG, and you look what it means to be functorial, it's precisely the chain rule. So the functoriality of this operation is exactly, nothing more than exactly the chain rule. So that's nice because rather than some sort of ad hoc axiom. Because rather than some sort of ad hoc axiom, which the chain rule can look a little bit like, if you see what it looks like in Cartesian differential categories or differential categories, it's just sort of an axiom that represents what the chain rule is. But thinking about it as a component of a functor, now it's just representing functoriality of this operation. So that's a bit nicer. And we'll see this with the other axioms of Cartesian differential category. They get replaced by either some functoriality or some kind of naturality condition. Okay. So that's one component of what the tangent bundle have. What other structure does this endo functor have? So every element of the tangent bundle of M is essentially over some point in M. Where we're talking about elements of a tangent bundle as a point and a tangent vector at that point. So we've got some operation which goes from tangent bundle m down to the base space m. P, or p for projection. So it's kind of taking the point in the vector and So it's kind of taking the point in the vector and pulling off the point. We can't necessarily pull off the tangent vector, but we can pull off the point on which it sits. So that's one thing, and you can check that's a natural operation. Really, its naturality just comes from the fact that there's an F in this first component there. There's a zero operation. So at each tangent space over each point, there's a special zero vector. And so we can think of this as a natural transformation from the identity to t, so have components m to tm. m to tm and the naturality of that operation comes because if you take the derivative and you insert a zero into its vector part you get back zero so if you check what naturality means that's uh what it's talking about you can add two tangent vectors at the same point so this has a little bit more categorical structure to it so first of all for any m you can take the pullback of the projection along itself and we call this t sub 2m and this is you think about what this pullback is this is going to be what's a pair of tangent vectors over the same point. Of tangent vectors over the same point. So it has to be have to agree that there are two projections. So T2m is going to space of, well, an element of T2M will be two tangent vectors over the same point. And if I have two tangent vectors at the same point, the idea is I can add them. So there's going to be a natural transformation from T2m to Tm. And the fact that this is natural comes from the fact that the derivative is additive in that second variable to work out whether this function is natural. It's sort of using the fact that the derivative is additive in that second component. Is additive in that second component. Okay, so that's already some structure we're finding for the tangent bundle. It's an endo functor, it has these natural transformations p0 and plus. The plus is, assuming this pullback exists, and this plus is going from this pullback here. Okay, so that's sort of the simple part of the structure. Now, the sort of, but this doesn't really capture exactly yet what's going on with the tangent bundle. There's something, there's a number of sort Bundle. There's something, there's a number of sort of a couple important components missing. And one of the components we want to recognize, we want to sort of set up in some way is the fact that each tangent space is itself a vector space. And we're going to do this in a different way, rather than asking for some kind of vector space structure in the standard way, i.e. some kind of object of scalars, and that these tangent spaces are of an action by the scalar. We've already asked for sort of addition and zero, but right. zero but rather than having some if we we don't want to sort of uh force in some kind of special uh line object necessarily some kind of object of real numbers sort of will limit how many examples we have but instead if think about vector spaces vector spaces have this very special property that we talked about before their tangent bundle is isomorphic to themselves cross themselves so if a is a vector space t a is isomorphic to a cross a so each of these tangent spaces should have this property as well the tangent bundle of a tangent space Bundle of a tangent space, all the tangent vectors at a fixed point should be isomorphic to that space cross itself, Tpm cross TPM. So, how can we sort of set this up categorically? Because that's, we don't want to talk about elements too much. We want to avoid that general in category theory. The elements necessarily determine all the object. So, you can sort of think about this in a different way. Anytime you've got a vector space, there's a nice operation you can sort of do to take a point and make a vector out of it. This is sort of at the heart of what's going on. So, I've got this picture here with a point. So I've got this picture here with a point AB, and you can make a tangent vector to that point. The tangent vector sort of sitting at zero. You just draw that vector from the origin to that point AB. So this is something that, you know, students, I think, rightly confused about when you talk about, when you start doing vectors and linear algebra and stuff, the sort of difference between points and vectors. And it's sort of a subtle point. And there's really an operation that's going on that takes a point and makes a vector out of it. So you can do that in any vector space. And so I give you a map from V. And so I give you a map from V to the tangent bundle of V. And so for thinking every object, every element of Tm is itself sort of an element of some vector space, then thinking of Tm is like this V, there should be an operation from Tm to T of T of M. Just replacing the Tm with the V there. So it should become some kind of operation from Tm to T squared M. Indeed, there is. There is a natural transformation from Tm to T squared M. I don't think I gave it the name here. It's called the vertical lift. Lift. It's an interesting structure because, and sort of, and again, it's given locally by this formula. So, an element of the tangent bundle will be a point and a vector. The element of the tangent of the tangent bundle, sort of work out what that looks like. It ends up being sort of a point and a tangent vector and another tangent vector and kind of a double tangent vector. And this kind of lift operation takes a first-order tangent vector and gives you a second-order tangent functor, just vector, just locally by this formula here. And you can check that. Here. And you can check that sort of naturality of this operation goes back to because the derivative is linear in its second variable. It turns out to be natural because of that. So this is a natural transformation that exists from the tangent bundle to the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle. I find it interesting because it's not something you'll see in very many differential geometry books. I think JS maybe mentioned, or maybe it's, I remember who mentioned earlier, the book about Kriegel and Mikor. About Kriegel and Mikor, natural operations in differential geometry, talks about talks a lot about sort of takes a categorical perspective on things, talks about various functors and natural transformations in differential geometry. And they talk about this thing here, but in most differential geometry books, you won't see this thing. You'll see sort of the hints of the projection and the zero and the plus, but sort of thing at this L, you won't see very much. But sort of essential operation if I were going to set things up here. I think it's sort of, it really is. And it really is a central thing behind a lot of in a certain way we can think about how to do differential geometry. Even more generally, in any vector space v, rather than just take a point and make a tangent vector at zero, if I'm given two points, v and w, I can sort of take w into a tangent vector by sort of translating it to a tangent vector at zero, then kind of shifting it over to be a tangent vector as v. And it turns out you can build that map for the tangent bundle itself by doing kind of a projection followed by a zero and then this list. Followed by zero and then this lift, and then adding the components together. Locally, this looks like if I've got a point and two tangent vectors, I get this element of the second tangent bundle, which is x v1, putting a zero there. Excuse me? Yep. What is t lowercase two? Yeah, so I defined that here. It's the space of how two tangent vectors at the same point. I see. Okay, thank you. Yeah, no problem. Yeah. Yeah, sort of an important distinguishment between T sub 2 and T upper two. T sub 2 and T upper 2, T upper 2, T tangent vector to the same point, T squared, the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle. Typically, this kind of, you know, this has three coordinates and this has four coordinates locally. Okay. So we've got this other operation going from t2m to t squared m. And if you look at both of these locally, both of them are kind of putting a zero in that third slot there. And these are called vertical vectors. You do see some mention of these, especially when people talk about vector bundles in differential geometry. About vector bundles in differential geometry. They'll talk about the vertical vectors or the vertical bundle of a vector bundle. These are things for which, so, which is this component? If this component actually is the derivative of the projection map for the tangent bundle. So, the derivative of the tangent, the t of the projection for the tangent bundle goes from t squared m to tm, and it's the one that pulls off the first component and the third component. So, when we build these sort of double second-order tangent vectors out of first-order things, Tangent vectors out of first order things, we're getting some, we're getting vertical things. Vertical vectors, you can sort of think of saying like the plane in a tangent space. Again, it's sort of hard to visualize, but if you think of the tangent bundle of the sphere, we've got all these different things and sort of imagine that. There's also different possible tangent directions you can take from that. So you try to think of the, I mean, the tangent bundle is sort of hard enough to conceive. And then the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle is even worse. It's already, even if you start with R, that's four-dimensional by itself. But if you think about tangent vectors to this. If you think about tangent vectors to this tangent bundle, you can imagine ones which sort of stay completely in each of the planes of the tangent spaces, sort of visualizing that. Those are the ones, those are what the vertical vectors are sort of geometrically. And the point is that all vertical vectors of t squared m arise this way. So any tangent vector, which has any element to the second tangent bundle, which has the third coordinate zero, actually comes from this operation of t2m to t squared m. So categorical language, that tells us this diagram is a pullback. This map from T2M to T2. As a pullback, this map from t2m to t squared m, sort of lifting up a thing. If I project down all the way down to the manifold, zero. So I'm looking at the t squared m's, which have the derivative of the projection being zero. That's exactly the first order space. So this is a sort of key axiom, I think. It's sort of the key axiom of what we'll call tangent categories in a second, and sort of a key property of the tangent bundle of smooth manifolds, because it tells you the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle is sort of hard to work with. But if you know you've got an element of the tangent bundle, the tangent bundle, Got an element of the tangent bundle, the tangent bundle for which t of pm is zero. You can actually deal with it as a first-order thing. So that's a pullback that exists here. One last sort of component to the tangent bundle. Talked about this in Cartesian differential categories, the symmetry of mixed partial derivatives. It doesn't matter where you do d squared f dx dy or d squared f dy dx. That was represented like Robin on writing composition in diagrammatic order. So first this, then this. This than this. You flip the sort of two interior coordinates if you do d squared f, and you work out what that means. It means there's actually a natural transformation from t squared m to t squared m. Locally, it sort of flips the two interior coordinates. And the fact the naturality of this is really this equation here, actually the symmetry of mixed partial derivatives. So there's a natural transformation from t squared to itself, and its naturality is somehow reflecting the symmetry of mixed partial derivatives. Okay, and so that's sort of all the components we need to talk about what a tangent category is. So tangent category. I'd like to ask this community to something with covert. I mean, need we assume it kind of we need some coverture is zero to have this symmetry. Symmetry. No, this is true for any smooth manifolds. You don't need any kind of geometric structure on the manifold or any kind of curvature at all. This exists for any smooth manifold M, this structure here. It is, though it is, I mean, it's a great question. It is related to sort of curvature and it's related to a number of sort of ways we can define things in tangent categories, as we'll see in a minute. But it's, we don't need any structure on the smooth manifold, any kind of geometric structure or connections or anything to define. Or connections or anything to define that. So, tangent category is going to be have all these components we talked about. So, it has some category, base example being smooth manifolds, an endo functor, some functor from the category to itself, which is in our standard case, the tangent bundle, natural transformation, kind of that projection one. We ask that we asked earlier, we asked the pullback of two copies of PM, but nice to have available to us n copies of PM. So, I'll ask that exist and be preserved by the TM by. Preserved by the Tm, by the T functors. A nice way to sort of quickly talk about the plus and the zero is to ask if this map have the structure of a commutative monoid in the slice category. That's just a fancy way of saying we sort of got an addition operation and a zero operation satisfying sort of associativity, unitality, stuff like that. Oh, I should mention again, yes, but you know, this idea, Robert and I kind of rediscovered it when we were trying to bring together Cartesian differential categories and synthetic differential geometry. Categories and synthetic differential geometry. We're trying to understand, sort of, is our common structure between them. And we came up with a lot of the axioms here. I'll mention actually the pullback, the universality of vertical lift, we sort of weren't sure if it needed to be an axiom or not. We sort of initially thought that it was sort of a nice thing one could have. But after we, then we sort of submitted a paper on this, and Anders Koch very nicely told us, oh, Rosicki did this 30 years before you. And he'd written a paper about this, but didn't sort of pursue it. Written a paper about this, but didn't sort of pursue it any further. Um, but it turned out he basically got the exact same axioms as us. Um, so there's this natural transformation from t of t squared to t squared, and it satisfies some axioms. There's this vertical lift thing, this sort of lift from the first tangent bundle to the second tangent bundle. There's some other coherence axioms relating the L and C, things like that. We look at the papers to find all the details. And you've got this pullback diagram, which says the universality of the vertical lift, an element of t squared. Of the vertical lift. An element of t squared m, which has the derivative of a projection being zero, is uniquely given by this sort of first order to second order operation, this new I've written here. And so I've sort of covered all the different bits earlier in smooth manifolds, and now we're just axiomatizing this to be, say, category is a tangent category if it has all that structure. All right, so it looks like fairly specific structure. This is what worried me for a while. We'll see Richard Garner's talk later on, a very different way to talk about the axioms for a tangent category in a way that makes them seem a bit less ad hoc. But that's a whole other story, which I'll leave to Richard's talk. But of course, you know, one concern is are the examples of the things beyond smooth manifolds, and can you do anything with these structures? So smooth manifolds, their tangent bundle, that's sort of the motivating example, a standard example. The motivating example, a standard example. Mentioned earlier, comedian manifolds. I think, I guess, Rick mentioned this. There are a certain type of infinite-dimensional manifold. And something that's interesting here, there was sort of two tangent bundles for comediant manifolds. There's a kinematic and an operational one. And they're kind of the two ways you can define the tangent bundle in ordinary differential geometry. They're different when you work in this infinite dimensional setting. One defines a tangent bundle by kind of equivalence classes of curves. By kind of equivalence classes of curves, another one defines it by derivations, and those actually give you different objects in the infinite-dimensional setting. But only one of them is tangent structure, only the kinematic one turns out to be tangent structure. And it's kind of nice if you look through the book on this stuff, talking about how to work with comediant manifolds. Ultimately, they mostly work with the kinematic tangent bundle. I think part of the reason really behind the scenes for that is because it's tangent structure, whereas the other one isn't. As I mentioned, for synthetic differential geometry. Mentioned before synthetic differential geometry, it's really nice. So, it's a sort of a setting where you start with the topos, so you are in a really nice category, and you assume some kind of infinitesimal object, and you take maps out of that infinitesimal object, the exponential object there. And so the tangent bundle there kind of ends up being representable. So, that's a really nice setting for differential geometry. There's examples in algebraic geometry, so commutative rigs, so rings without negatives, or and its opposite category. Or and its opposite category, as well as affine, as well as schemes, things like that. This is risky tangent bundle, tangent structure. Category C and Finity rings, which is constructed as part of work with synthetic differential geometry, is also kind of nice on its own as an example. This is a really cool example. It was floating around for a while, and Ben McAdam sort of really nailed it down recently. The category of all small categories itself with finite limits is a tangent category, totally surprisingly. I mean, and it's what's the I mean, and it's what's the what's the tangent bundle of a category? It's the Beck modules in that category, so the abelian group objects in X. So this gives a way of from a category building a tangent category to it. And if you look on the NLAB, it's actually what they call the tangent category. So the tangent categories are examples of tangent categories. So tangent categories in one sense are examples of sort of tangent categories in another sense. So this is a really cool construction that turns out to satisfy all the actual. Construction that turns out to satisfy all the axioms. We'll see on Wednesday sort of generalizations of this notion to infinity one categories and how this sort of lights to Goodwilly calculus. That's really cool. Oh, another side to this story. Sort of as one of JS's many arrows between the many different structures, any Cartesian differential category is a tangent category. And I sort of basically kind of mentioned what the structure looks like. So there you just define the looks like. So there you just define the tangent bundle of m to be m cross m. I define tf to be sort of f in the first component, tf in the second component, and you define all the transformations in the natural way. The projection of x and v is just x. The lift of x and v is x00v. The flip is flip the two coordinates. So the axioms for a Cartesian differential category, which you saw earlier, translate into the naturality of each of these operations. And this already includes some other. And this already includes some other examples like the abelian functor calculus. This is a great breakthrough by Bjort, as JS mentioned earlier, that the abelian functor calculus can be seen as an example of a Cartesian differential category, and so it can also be seen as an example of a tangent category. So, if you start with, I guess, another sort of maybe a couple two arrows on JS's slide, if you take the co-Kleisie category of a differential category, that'll give you a tangent. Category that'll give you a tangent category, but also there's other results, sort of the other legs in JS's slide. I should have actually kept that picture here. The Koh Allenberg more of a differential category is a tangent category. So it gives, that was sort of unexpected. They gave more examples. JS mentioned that I was said that I was going to miss example, so I put it in. There's sort of this idea of a manifold completion of restriction categories joins. It's a whole other story which I won't get into, but if you've seen some of that story before, this is one of the reasons. Um, this is one of the reasons we're developing this as well. Those are tangent categories. So, one other interesting example turns out you can build tangent categories from an existing tangent category. So, if you take, I'm going to talk about what vector fields, connections, and some of these things are just in a minute, but if you take all the objects in X equipped as a vector field, that again forms a tangent category. So, sort of objects equipped to some kind of geometric structure in a tangent category give you a new example of a tangent category. So, if you equip, talk about the collection of objects equipped to some connection that forms a tangent category. To some connection that forms a tangent category, or the collection of objects equipped to the flatter torsion-free connection forms the tangent category. So, you can apply this in category of smooth manifolds, and are you getting interesting new tangent categories they didn't have before? Okay, so I want to just talk about a couple things you can define in arbitrary tangent categories. So we had a bunch of examples of tangent categories. What can you do with them? So, first of all, differential objects. And those will be sort of a trivialization of TM, some kind of simple. sort of a trivialization of Tm, some kind of simplification of the tangent bundle of m, whereas by contrast, the connection will be a trivialization of t squared m, a simplification of the tangent bundle of the tangent bundle. So we define a differential object in a tangent category to be sort of very special objects in general. Maybe some commutative monoid, and it has some other map from the tangent bundle of E back down to E. So we always have one map which kind of pulls off the point. It's very special if we can pull off the vector as well and give us something back in the base space. If we have that, Base space. If we have that such that this forms a product diagram, so that TE is isomorphic to E cross E, a few coherences we want to ask for as well, then that's what we'll call a differential object. So these are kind of special things. These are like, you know, essence of the vector spaces, though without any kind of guaranteed scalar action. That's why we call them differential objects rather than vector space objects or something. So the smooth manifolds, it's the Rns. The convenient manifolds, it's the convenient vector spaces. In models of SDG, these are the Euclidean, what are called Eclide. These are the Euclidean, what were called Euclidean R modules. And in this kind of wacky tangent structure on the categories, Beck showed, though he didn't phrase it in this language, that the left additive categories were the differential objects in that tangent structure. So it's kind of nice too. So I'll mention here a theorem that kind of alluded to before. If we can form this pullback, so if you have some point of your base space and you pull back the And you pull back the tangent bundle along that point, you're getting all the tangent vectors at the same point. So this is the tangent space. If this pullback exists, I think I actually need to include an assumption that T preserves this pullback as well, then you can show that this tangent space is a differential object. So that thing I mentioned earlier about the tangent bundle of TAM being TAM cross TAM, that follows from the universality of the vertical lift. So each of these tangent spaces, if they exist, will indeed have this nice property. They exist will indeed have this nice property. And that's one reason why this axiom is important. It sort of gives you right away a nice collection of differential objects in your tangent category. And sort of conversely, you can go from a tangent category back to a Cartesian differential category if you just look at the collection of differential objects. So if I have a differential object, now I can define a derivative operation by just doing the tangent bundle of f and then projecting off one of the components. SJS did earlier in writing. SJS did earlier in writing sort of the projections pi zero and pi one computer science notation so I pull off the second component of tf that's going to give me the derivative again the naturality axioms will give the cdc axioms so these are really kind of the nicest objects in a tangent category and you can define them and work with them and anytime you have a tangent category it's nice to kind of look and see what are the differential objects things which have simple tangent bundle So, what about connections? So, the reason I want to talk about connections is differential objects being a simplification of the tangent bundle. Connection, one way to see connection is a simplification of the second tangent bundle. So, I mean, connections are important too, because just talking about smooth manifolds and the tangent bundle, that's not really differential geometry in the sense of geometry. Two smooth manifolds can be isomorphic in many different ways. You can sort of squish and bend. Squitch and squish and bend and twist things in all different ways, and all going to be isomorphic to each other. It's only when you put some kind of extra structure on the manifold that you actually get geometry, actually get talk about geodesics and things and talk about other important curvature and things of the manifold. So it's extra structure on top of a smooth manifold. And so we want to see how we can talk about these things in any tangent category. Jeff, you have some questions in the chat. Oh, sure, yeah. Questions in the chat. Oh, sure, yeah. So, what are the differential objects in categories of algebraic varieties, schemes? So, in schemes, the affine schemes are the differential objects. Yeah, that's one example. What was the first one? Yeah, that's, I mean, that's sort of yeah, that's sort of the main one, I guess. Schemes, in schemes, the affine schemes are the differential objects. Of the differential objects. So connections are sort of like a very important concept in differential geometry, but they're sort of hard because they're presented in many different ways. But the way we can think about them here is, let's say, a second, a trivialization of the second tangent bundle. So one way to think about this is, you know, the second derivative of a function tells you about a function curves. It tells you it's kind of concave up or concave down. So the second derivative is giving kind of curvature information about functions. So it's not surprising, maybe, that the second derivative. So it's not surprising maybe that the second tangent bundle is, if you have sort of structure on it, it's going to tell you how a space is curved. So let's think about the second tangent bundle. As we sort of mentioned before, it always has two projections down to the first order tangent bundle. The projection for Tm and T of the projection on M. Those are two different things. One is a projection for Tm itself, one is T of the projection for M. And local coordinates, the first one is kind of pulling off the point in the vector. One is kind of pulling off the point in the vector, the t of the pm is pulling off the point in the second vector. But there's kind of no nice way to access that last coordinate. There is, as I mentioned before, the universality of one of these two components is zero. Sorry, the second component, second vector is zero, but not in general. But that's exactly what how we can phrase a connection. So Robert and I had a definition of connection, and Rory session right kind of took that and made a somewhat a nicer version of it. So an affine connection. Nicer version of it. So, an affine connection on object m in a tangent category consists of a map from t squared m to tm, some way of kind of pulling off, in essence, that last component such that this is a limit diagram and some other coherences. So it's kind of telling you that this k is a way of decomposing the second order tangent bundle into three pieces. We always have kind of two pieces with these two projections. The k is giving us another piece to it so that every element of t squared m is exactly three elements of tm. And what's nice here is, you know, if you have a deconstruction. And what's nice here is, you know, if you have a decomposition of tm, like we saw with differential objects, then naturally we're going to get a decomposition of t squared m. And the canonical kind of decomposition there is kind of thinking of taking an x, v1, v2, and w and pulling off x and w. And that's the kind of natural flat connection on the vector spaces. Think about vector spaces. There's many different ways you can kind of curve them, but the one which keeps things flat, sort of the natural way to think about it, is the K, which kind of corresponds to just taking Which kind of corresponds to just taking x and w without doing anything else. So, this sort of way of talking about connections is pretty unusual. You won't find this in our different geometry books. We kind of had to hunt around well to find anybody that talked about this. There was a paper by Patterson in the 70s, I think in the Canadian Journal of Mathematics or something like that, which talked about this definition. But it is equivalent to other definitions of connection. If you've seen maybe the covariant derivative definition of a connection, you can. Covariant derivative definition of a connection, you can build that covariant derivative by using this k. So, covariant derivative takes in two vector fields, so maps from m to tm. And the way we can build this operation, and it's supposed to be giving you another vector field, and the way you can build this with this k is do u, the derivative of v, and that gives you to t squared m, and then bring the k, take you down to tm. So you take that composite, that give you a covariant derivative. Erismond connections kind of have a lifting instead. They kind of take two first-order things and give you a nice way to lift up to t squared differently. Way to lift up to t squared differently in a different way than the vertical one. The vertical one kind of gives you a very flat thing, sort of giving you a big non-vertical. And you can build this from the universality property asked for here. And there's a whole bunch of last story more I could tell you. I should have mentioned actually, Rory's going to be talking about connections next time. So I'm just giving you a little teaser on these. You can talk about curvature, torsion, if your tangent category can solve differential equations, which is something you can define. Then you can talk about geodesics for these things as well. So those things you can do with this. As well, so there's all things you can do with this definition of connection. Let me just check my time: 640. Okay. One more little thing. This is actually an easy thing you can define in a tangent category. You can talk about what vector fields are. So a vector field on an M is just a map from M to T M, which is a section of the projection. So it's giving you at each point some choice of tangent vector. And so that's going to find an Atangent category. That's easy. A tangent category that's easy. You can add vector fields by using the plus operation. But more interestingly, for example, you can talk about when two vector fields commute. And this is, you can do that using this canonical flip thing, this CM. I take V1 followed by T of V2 and then flip it. You want to see whether that's the same thing as V2 followed by T of 1. That's one place where you can use, an important place to use the canonical flip to talk about commutation of vector fields. I should have mentioned there's a question about curvature. There's a question about curvature. So, both the definitions of curvature, both the abstract definitions of curvature and torsion for connections in a tangent category are defined using the C. So, the C is used importantly to define curvature and torsion for connections. If you have negatives, so this one thing, a little bit change we made from Rzitsky's earlier definition. We didn't demand that you can take the negative of some tangent vector, but if you do have that ability, you could subtract. Do you have that ability? You could subtract these two things off, and turns out you get a vertical element of the second tangent bundle. So, by the universality of the lift, you can bring it down to the first-order tangent bundle, and this is exactly the Lee bracket. So, if you do that operation of taking this, subtracting off this, gives you a vertical thing, uses the universality, gives you a first-order tangent vector. That's one way you can define the lead bracket, and that's the way we define the lead bracket and tangent category of negative. So that definition itself goes back to Rositski. That definition itself goes back to Rosicki had that in his first paper. So, lots of other things you can do, just sort of scratching the surface here. Talk about the analog of vector bundles. Ben's got a great talk about that next, which we call differential bundles. They kind of also have a similar kind of universality of vertical lift axiom. You can talk about connections on vector bundles. Here, I was talking about connection, affine connections, sort of connections on the tangent bundle. But actually, when we define these things, we define vector bundles and define. These things we define vector bundles and define connections on such bundles, so even more general. You can define what it means to a tangent category to solve differential equations. And what's really cool about this, and this is a great idea of Robins, is you sort of set it up in a way that looks like a natural numbers object. Have you seen that before in category three? You can talk axiomatically about what it means for an object in a category to be an object of natural numbers. And there's a similar kind of definition. You can talk about a curve object, which is some kind of object which allows you to. Which is some kind of object which allows you to turn vector fields into curves. So vector fields into flows. So turning a vector field into an actual movement on the space. It's really cool. And I'll have a reference to this in my many references at the end. You can talk about differential forms, maps from T sub M M to E, so linearity and anti-symmetry and things, and sector forms, map from T upperscript N M to E, which are interesting things. They sort of naturally, Rory and I were looking at talking about how to deal with differential forms. How to deal with differential forms and tangent categories. It turned out to more naturally work with these things. These haven't seen much use in differential geometry, but I think they're pretty cool. And they definitely come out more naturally in tangent categories, maps from T upper NM. You talk about Lee groups, groupoids, algebraids. Ben, I think we'll talk about more about that tomorrow. That whole cool theory there. So just sort of wrap up, I've, I mean, again, I've been really surprised how much How much sort of life has gotten out of tangent gategars? How many examples there are, how much you can do in an arbitrary change. It really surprised me. I thought it looked like a very specific structure that would only have a few examples and maybe you couldn't do much with it. But it turns out to be quite a few examples and lots of things you can do in them. And there's lots more yet to be done. A lot of the structures we've defined in an arbitrary tangent category, we haven't sort of looked at what they are in various examples. I mean, the algebraic geometry area, applications to algebraic geometry, and seeing what the circuit. Algebraic geometry and seeing what the structures are look like there is a whole open area. We know like very little about what a lot of the structure, general tangent structure looks like. As I mentioned earlier, there's a totally different perspective on the axioms, which makes them look a little bit less ad hoc via V algebras. So Richard's going to talk about that later today, and that's building on really great work of Poon Leung and his PhD thesis. So, oh, just got a couple minutes here. So I'm just going to quickly put together a whole bunch of references that use tangent. A whole bunch of references that use tangent categories. So there's lots of references out there, but you know, if you search for references out on the internet, some references will often just be, you know, this paper does this theory. So I put together a sort of papers here, which are really using and building on the theory of tangent categories. I may have missed some too. So again, the original thing is back to Razitsky. Robin and I kind of rediscovered this and connected it up to differential structure, as I mentioned earlier. Then there's been various papers proving things you can do in tangent categories. Proving things you can do in tangent categories, the Jacobi identity for the Lee bracket turned out to be surprisingly hard. Poon Leung had his thesis talking about how to talk about tangent structures using V algebras. Various other papers, connections, differential bundles. Rory had a great paper on connections as well. Roy had a paper on differential forms. Richard Garner is a talk about how to really nice embedding theorem for tangent categories to show they always sit inside a representable one. That's cool too. Some applications, sort of. Some applications, sort of making life, sort of talking about differential lambda calculus and how and closed tangent categories and how that theory is applicable. There was tangent categories used to sort of understand the Fodder-Bruno construction a bit more. I think Robin sort of mentioned this paper in passing, but I'll actually give the paper itself. That was a nice paper of JS. Ben and Matthew have done this whole cool theory of involution algebraids. You've got other geometric structures you can define, other examples. You can define, other examples, this really cool new thread of using talking about tangent infinity categories and how that relates to Goodwillie calculus. More work on differential bundles. I think it's pretty cool. This stuff on differential equations is a tangent category. I'm really happy. I think that's really cool theory. And even more work on these structures for dual tangent structures from infinity topuses, which I think Michael will talk about on Wednesday. So, all this in the last few years, a lot of development. The last few years, a lot of development and examples, and further theory of tangent categories, which again is pretty cool because I didn't think they would go very far at first, but they're really cool how much they've sort of developed over the last couple of years. Thank you all for your attention. Yeah, if there are any questions. Well, we'll thank Jeff. And actually, Jeff, you and uh actually jeff you you if you go to the chat you have a bunch of doubters doubters excellent and uh so they were just wondering about uh the differential objects okay so there's this question about is the kinematic definition the derivation definition of the equivalence class of curves definition it's the equivalence class of curves definition is the kinematic one the operational one is the uh uh the different uh derivations one The different derivations one. Yeah, oh, Ben asked if Ben answered that. Keep looking down in the chat. Oh, yeah, I think I was. Yeah, I think it's actually the affine end space. Yeah, sorry, not just not in general, the affine schemes, the affine end space. Sorry about that. Yeah. And some other people have their hands up. I can see. I don't know where the hands are, but if you jump in, someone, you can ask your question. Okay, may I? Yes, go for it. Is that Peter? Hi, Peter. Hi, Jeff. It's, well, it's a small thing, but I was wondering in the strategy. I was wondering in the strange example of cat and abelian group objects what else you can say about sort of what the theory looks like there or what it tells us. That's sort of ongoing work right now. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know much more other than the differential objects. And so there's yeah, both Ben and PhD student Marcel. And PhD student Marcelo at Dow are looking at this right now. I see. Yeah, and it's sort of related to the infinity categories example, too. So I think those developing those two sort of in parallel would be good. I have one other sort of question, maybe not just for you, but for anyone in the differential categories school. Has anyone looked at trying to fit? At trying to fit differential recursion into this framework? You want an answer to that? The answer is, of course, yes. I mean, Jonathan Gallagher and I... Well, you worked with Turing categories. So, I mean, we had the same sort of thing, but with differential structure. Is that what you mean? Differential recursion? Yes. I thought it didn't. I thought it didn't. You thought it didn't. Okay, maybe we should talk about it then. Okay. Thomas, Tom Goodwilly, you want to ask your question? Oh, hi. So I just wondered if you could say any more about this mysterious remark that being able to solve differential equations is a lot. Differential equations is a lot like having a natural number object. First of all, what does a category theorist mean by a natural numbers object? And then also, do you mean ordinary differential equations? And then what are you talking about? Great question. So the second one that was. Yeah, ordinary differential equations that I mean. That's actually partial differential equations. That's actually partial differential equations and understanding them in the context of tangent categories is to me sort of a big, important open problem. Don't know much about partial differential equations and how to handle them. And that's sort of related to jets and stuff as well. So that's yeah, that's a whole thing. Now, ordinary differential equations. Natural number object, yeah, I guess that would take a little bit to talk about. It's sort of an initial thing. So it has. It's an initial thing. So it has an object, say A in a category, and say the category is products, and so has a terminal object. So it'll specified point, so a map from 1 to A, which you call, say, 0, and a map from A to A, which you call successor. Suck, I guess some things call it. And that's like the operation which takes a natural number A and goes A to A plus one. A and goes a to a plus one. And sort of induction kind of tells you that there's a universal property there, that that kind of thing, that point and that map from A to itself has initial property, it's sort of initial among those kinds of objects. So you can look up like on, there's various places, NLAB has like the full definition of natural number object. And so there's kind of a similar thing with the real numbers. thing with the real numbers in differential geometry and vector fields. So the real numbers have a special point, the point one, and they have a special vector field, the vector field which takes a point P and just gives you the constant one everywhere in each vector slot. And that kind of turns out to be asking for that to kind of be initial in the category amongst Be initial in the category among such things is kind of saying that every vector field has a solution. So that's sort of a quick version of it. If you look up the I just wanted to get the flavor of the analogy here. I mean, I think it's fair to say that in functor calculus, the category of based finite topological Finite topological spaces, I mean, finite complexes, it plays some role like that. Yeah, yeah, I've been talking about that with Michael before. But I don't know. Yeah, so this paper here. Yeah, this paper here talks about, like, has all the details of the definition. And there's more work to be done here as well. But yeah, I'm hoping that that kind of thing is like what's happened. A similar kind of thing is happening in Infinity 10 categories or something like it. Yeah. So, Jeff, Jeff Boyce, I want to ask you a question. I was just wondering if you could say something about how those pullback type gadgets, when you ask for connections or differential objects, how that records trivializability? Well, I guess trivializability to me meant like trivializability. Like trivializability, I was literally thinking of that meaning that T E is isomorphic to E cross E. I think people, I'm using the sense of people talk about trivialization of a vector bundle. So a trivial vector bundle is of the form like, I guess it's not quite E cross E, it's like A cross B for some vector space B. So it's using it in that sense of a trivial vector bundle. So the tangent bundle is a trivial vector bundle is what's going on there. And I guess I was kind of using it by analogy here, just the fact. Here, just the fact that a connection gives you this kind of decomposition, either by definition, we're saying it's giving us this kind of decomposition, this trivialization of the tangent bundle to split it into these simple parts. Okay. Do you know if this would have, just off the top of your head, if this might have connections to, say, like giving some sort of coverage in a topology for your M and then pulling back along the coverages to trivial. Back along the coverages to trivial to give local trivializability conditions? I don't think so, but I'm certainly no expert in differential geometry. So that sounds like a different kind of thing. Okay. Thank you. Yeah, it looks like in the chat somebody's written, Alexander's written sort of the definition of natural number object, yeah. Um, any other questions? Any other answers? Well, then we should thank Jeff again for the lovely talk. Ben, you should try out your sides, see whether you can actually get sideways. Yeah, if someone could make, I've got Ben's iPad on here. If someone could
