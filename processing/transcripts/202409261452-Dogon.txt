So as the title suggests, I really want to connect the two part two quarters of the partners. So this maybe goes back a bit to the survey that Cyril gave, which was very nice. But I want to remind a bit what we mean by character rigidity. So in general, if you have a countable group, I think it's relatively well accepted to say that it is character rigid. If every character we use it, it's a bit confusing, but I mean like an extrema. It's a bit confusing, but I mean, like an extremal character is either induced from the center, so it vanishes outside of the center, or it is finite-dimensional. And the center you can divide out by, it's not so interesting, you should think of like the regular. And just to keep in mind, this really is kind of a super-rigidity property. As soon as the center is trivial, this is the same as asking a Barcouli's type super rigidity of gamma inside its L gamma. It's L gamma. L gamma encodes only two one factorial representations of gamma, as is written here. Now, I mean, there's a history of Becker proving results, but currently the breakthrough result was when Peterson proved, and also later on, we proved by Putin and Cyril Cyril Remy Puton, Cyril Foule, of course, that as soon as you take a lap As soon as you take a lat prototypical example of a property P group, so gamma is the higher ranked lattice in a semi-simple E group with property T, it's highlighted here, they're all character region. And this has been extended to like non-algebraic groups over characteristic zero local fields. But of course, the natural question to ask is like, do we need to assume property P? Property B. And this was the question that was posed both by Cyrill and Jesse. And just the main example to keep in mind is, of course, irreducible lattices in product of rank one groups, so say hyperbolic spaces. Like here, this would be an irreducible lattice in a product of hyperbolic spaces. And it's open whether they're character rigid. Although we know a lot of other rigidity properties, such as super rigidity and such. So this is really a pressing question. And such. This is really a pressing question. And I should mention that we have specific examples where we do know it's true. So, for example, SO2 over a ring with infinite units. It was proved by Jesse Peterson and Andreas Thom that they are character rigid, but like a specific method that shouldn't work in general. And so now that we're motivated, I want to connect it to a stability problem. And in fact, show that it is equivalent to. And in fact, show that it is equivalent to something. So, now going back to Avia's talk and maybe Caleb's talk, I really want to justify that studying stability can maybe help with understanding characters of groups. And now I want to talk about like non-amenable groups of groups. So I want to talk about an amenable version of stability. This is a preliminary name. So if you have a symptomically multiplicative MAP and 2-norm, I will say it's convergent. I will say it's convergent. If when you look at the traces of these maps, they converge to some trace of the group. As soon as they converge, they converge to some trace of the group. And I'll say it's amenable if the trace is amenable. It generates a hyperfinite phenomenon. And the group is said to be amenably Hilbert-read stable if when you only consider the stability challenges which are amenable, you can correct them. Just as the definition of Just as the definition of stability, just focus on ones which are amino. So, in particular, I don't want to correct hyperlinear approximations, right? Because those would be non-amitable. And the theorem that, ah, this is joint work with Etama, but it's still going on with one of the sorry, is that for these groups, character rigidity is equivalent to this stability problem. Right? So, I mean, there are two directions here, but the kind of But the kind of this direction going from character rigidity to amigable human-treat stability is not too hard to see using Hadwin and Schumann's machinery, but kind of in the non-amivable relative setting. And the opposite direction, I think, is more, oh, sorry for the typo, is more interesting and it relies on the heavy result of the work of Pader Boutenet, Buddhier, and Peterson called terminability, coupled together with the finite. Together with the finite-dimensional spectral gap property of these groups. I think I'll finish early. Thank you for your attention.
