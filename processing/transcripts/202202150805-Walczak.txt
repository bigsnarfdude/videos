The late Neil Friedman from the Weizmann, unfortunately. So it's really a joint collaborative work that is all new. So it deals with the problem of self-non-self discrimination and basically figuring out how T cells are able to do that. So the picture we have in mind is sort of the shape-space picture where we want all T cells, the whole repertoire. Cells, the whole repertoire to cover all of space, but of course, there's forbidden regions which are related to self-proteins. So, you want to recognize all foreign proteins, all foreign peptides, but you want to avoid the regions in this abstract phenomenology so you don't hit them. So, the question we want to ask is, and a lot of people have been trying to ask, can we find It can we find T cell sequence features that are correct that basically are related to discriminating between foreign and self-peptides. Can we find some signatures in the sequence? Okay, so just as a reminder of what the textbook picture is. So you go from a generated repertoire generated through VDJ recombination, which happens in the fymus, and after the cells are generated, And after the cells are generated, they go through rounds of positive and negative selection. Also, in the fimus, where the positive selection basically get rids of the rest won't fold probably, have some biophysical defects, won't express, or just don't bind anything. And negative selection gets rid of the T cell receptors that are self-tolerant, which means they recognize your own proteins. Recognize your own proteins. And so you remove these T cells. However, even at the sort of conceptual level, there's a few problems with this. So for mice, thymic selection lasts, well, basically for everybody, there's a limited time to it. For mice, it's a four to five days. For humans, it's about 10 days at most. But generally, there's a short time to it. During this time, each T cell encounters around 500. Encounters around 500 antigen-presenting cells that present to them many peptides, and each T cell is estimated to see a few thousand cell peptides. And given that there's around 10 to the fifth, 10 to the 6th cell peptides, that means that each T cell sees about 1 to 5% of the self-peptide ensemble of the self-peptidum. Okay, so basically, A, there's not Basically, A, there's not enough time to be shown everything, and B, because of that, each T cell sees only a tiny fraction of the things that it's not supposed to bind to. So how is it supposed to learn not to bind to it? And on top of that, we actually know that it's not a perfect process because we know T cell is certain T cells, the process is sleeky, certain T cells make it fast, for example, T Rex. So, how systematic is TCI elimination, and can we find signals of it again in the repertoire sequence? So, as I said, we're not the first ones to think of it, but what we have that people before didn't have is we have negative examples. So, usually, when you ask this question, you basically look at the actual naive T cell repertoire. You look at the repertoire, you find either in the fibers that they give. You find either in the fibers at a given time, but you never see those cells that are discarded, right? If you think, you know, I mean, we all think about phymic selection as a T cell gets asked a question if it answers correctly, it passes if it does, and it doesn't pass. We think of it as binary process, but we never see the no's. We never see the negative examples. So, in this amazing experiment, Nier and Eric Rifkin, who did Eric Rifkin, who did the measurements and Eric Greenstein, actually did build a mouse that has the negative examples. So what they did is they collected data from female six-week-old mice, both from the thyrous and the spleen, and they collected different cell types. So these mice have two markers. They have an activation marker, which is called NU70. NU77 and they have a cell dev marker which is called annexin 5. So basically the cells that have negative both anerf77 and nexin-5, those are the ones that are before any kind of positive or negative selection because they've neither been activated, tested for anything, nor have they died. And once the nurse They died, and once the NERSC 77 is activated, that means they've passed through this what we'll call DP, so double positive, uh, double double positive positive ones, so DP pars. So these are the double, DP stands for double positive, SP stands for single positive. That means they've lost, that refers to the CD4, CD8 marker as usually. So, anyway, once they activated the NUR77, they've passed. 77, they've passed the first part of positive selection. However, the ones that are still 77, no 77 negative, but an X and V positive, that means they die by neglect. And I put these ones in the wrong place because they should be no 77 positive. And sorry, the SP1 should be here. Should be here, should be here, should be up here and not down here because, of course, they've been activated and they haven't died by neglect. But on top of that, they've oh no, sorry, these are okay. I just labeled, I labeled this wrong. So, what we do have here, so we have the cells, let's be clear. The cells, let's be clear. In the spleen, we have these ones that are your typical CD4, CD8 cells. So these are these which should be here. So I mislabeled them. But we also have these CD4 NEG S and CD8 NEG8, which are the ones that went into negative selection. So thereafter, they passed the positive stage, but then they got this cell marker death signal. So the annex in V positive. X and V positive, and that means they're actually going to die. Sorry for this diagram, I screwed this up a little bit. This is all correct. Anyway, with these two markers, the idea is we can distinguish cells before they start positive selection, the ones that underwent positive selection and the ones that failed positive selection, that's the die by neglect. And then the ones that went into negative selection and actually became mature CD4 and CD8 cells. And CD8 cells, and the ones that failed in the negative selection part and became CD4 but died, got a death signal and CD8 that died. All right, bottom line is we have both the positive and the negative examples, and then we can build a model of selection at each stage to figure out what are the selection features that act. Selection features that act at each of these stages. So we take our usual generation model, PGEN, and then we compare the repertoire at each stage and define enrichment factors, which basically control for different features such as V-gene usage, amino acid, sequence, and J-gene and length, and so on. And here we use the single-end Sonia model, the linear model. We don't have enough data for neural net, but as you Data for a neural net, but as you'll see, it works okay. So, even before, I mean, building a complicated model, we can analyze some properties of the system. So, I mean, probably this, well, maybe it will come as a surprise. The gene usage, and I'm showing here only the alpha V genes, but it's the same thing for J G, alpha J, beta V, and J, more or less. Basically, the gene usage follows. Basically, the gene usage follows the generation probability. So, generation probability for each gene is in blue, and here all the other cell types with the CD4 in pink and CD8 in orange. And maybe the most interesting thing here is, remember, we're always sort of asking what's the difference between the cells that said yes and the cells that said no at each stage. And interestingly, we see basically no difference in the CD4 or Or CD8 in the ones in the kepped ones that become mature, and the discarded ones, so the negative ones. Basically, no clear signal. There's a selection for length, so the length distribution becomes less wide, but the selection is mainly from generation to whatever happens next. So, including the DP-positive ones and the DP pre-ones, there's a little bit of Peri ones. There's a little bit of further sharpening when you get to the CD4 and CD8, but it's really minor. And Pgen doesn't change basically from the beginning, which is what we've seen before. However, if you take all the alpha V genes together and you do a PCA analysis of it, they actually cluster. And the other genes cluster a little bit less clearly, not as nicely as this. But here you see a clear clustering and a following of the Clustering and a following of the maturation stages that the pre-anything and the die by neglect are very close to p gen. Then you go into the positive ones that are in between the CD, both types of CD8 and CD4, and then you see a separation in CD4 and CD8. So you're basically able to recover the maturation diagram. Okay, but we, so far it's sort of negative news. So far, it's sort of negative news, no big difference anywhere. So, we thought, well, maybe we should go and look for some non-linear features. Maybe there's something strongly non-linear, something more global that is telling us about avoiding these self-proteins, basically these forbidden regions, right? Because we're basically saying we want to exclude some sequences. So maybe it's some global feature in these sequences. It's some global feature in these sequences we're looking at. Can I ask one question? Yeah, on the previous slide on your PCA plot, um, I missed, I still don't understand. So I thought each, so you're measuring TCA receptors, right? So you probably have lots of cells, but you have very few points. So I'm probably at the wrong point in my head. Each point is a mouse. Each point is a mouse. Oh, not each point is. Okay, got it. But I thought you would. Okay, got it, but I thought you would okay, fine, okay, right. So there's three colours, three points per color, and sorry, I should have said that. And you know, oh, I see. Okay, but so, but each mouse would have all kinds of cells, right? Positive and negative. No, so then the color tells you the positive and negative ones. The color tells you the cell type. Basically, the idea is for each mouse, you put in the cells and you cluster. Put in the cells and you cluster the cells. I mean, maybe for all mice, you put in all the cells and then you cluster all of these cells. I mean, you do PCA, so basically, you cluster them, right? And then you see that they sort of they get the in the first two dimensions, they they're more, they're closer together by cell types. And the cell types that are sort of closer together in the maturation diagram cluster more than the other. Cluster more than the other ones. That's the idea. Okay, so can we find some more global features? And so for that, we looked at n-grams or k-mes or, you know, basically we looked at sequences of n, which here I'm showing you n for free, but we also looked at, well, one, two, three, and four, and we collected the statistics of these n-grams. So we basically Of these n-grams. So we basically asked: how often does each one appear in the whole sub-repertoire we're looking at? So we look at the specific sub-repertoire, say the die-by-neglect or the pre or CD4, and we calculate the statistics of that. And then we're interested in looking at the diversity of. At the diversity of these engrams, that the diversity or the entropy that corresponds to these engrams in a given repertoire. And then, why are we doing that? Well, our intuition is if that there is suddenly at a given maturation stage, there's a part of the repertoire that becomes forbidden, then the diversity should decrease. And if it's only visible in some more global feature like an n-gram, well, then we may pick up on it here and not in the previous analysis. In the previous analysis, so we're basically hoping for some decrease in diversity with maturation stage. And just technically, since it's very hard to estimate entropy when you're not sampling fully, we use the Nemenmann shephibialic estimate. Okay, so that's the idea. And these are the results. So this is the entropy per n-gram as a function of the different matrix. As a function of the different maturation stages. And so the first thing you see here again, there's circles and triangles. So the circles correspond to actual data and the entropy estimation using this Neman-Sheffi-Bialik thing. And the triangles correspond to a model. So previously, I told you we learned the P-post model, we learned the enrichment factors. So we can also use that. Factors, so we can also use that to generate repertoires and we can see whether they agree with what we estimate from the data, and they do. And this basically tells us that this linear model, which is what goes into our estimation, into our enrichment estimation, into P post, captures everything there is to capture in the data. The triangle and the circle always agree, so there seem to be no complex selection motifs that were missing with the model. With the model. The other thing to notice is that basically, what's the maximum entropy we can hope here? Well, the entropy should be less for the N1 NMOS, so the frequencies basically, than the logarithm of 20, which is around 4.3 bits. And we see a significantly slower entropy. And so that means the selection on the MNO. And so that means the selection on amino acid frequencies. The lines here is also the entropy of the pigen model. And you can see that the entropy of the pgen, so the generation model basically controls the entropy of these systems with some exceptions. We also see that the entropy, so the diversity goes down with NMOS. So there's also strong correlations between amino acids, so they're not independent. But But except for, so we generally see that the PGEN model is pretty predictive at the early stages of what we see in the data. However, once we get to the CD4 and CD8 stage, there's a further decrease in diversity and it's small but significant from the generation model. So there's selection happening at this level of Of negative selection. And so that is clear. However, selection acts both on the ones that actually become CD4 cells and migrate into the spleen, as well as the ones that are negatively selected at this stage. So the selection is more global and it doesn't, again, the decrease in diversity doesn't discriminate between the yes and the no sense. The no sets. We can also cluster, we can also basically see how different the models are at the n-gram level and the level of the full model with enrichment between the different stages. And we see that again, they cluster by maturation stages with the dipineglect and the pre being more similar to pgen than the CD4 and CD8, and the double positives lying between the CD4 and the CD8. And the CD8, and exactly the same is true if we take into account the V and the J genes on top of the CDF. So we're again recovering the maturation pathway. So, okay, so the question we're sort of, I'm trying to sort of put in your mind from the beginning is this yes-no binary question. And we're sort of hoping that at some point we'll see an answer that this is significant statistical difference. Significant statistical difference between the cells that pass a given stage and that don't pass different stage. So we have the idea that the subset somewhere should be mutually exclusive to get rid of the self, the T cells that recognize self. So let me first give you a toy example of something that is definitely mutually exclusive. Imagine I generate artificially from pigen, I generate T cells, and then I sort them into two categories: long T cells and Categories: long T cells and short T cells. So I put a threshold somewhere at say seven of amino acids in CDF3, and I just separate them into long and short. So clearly, if you're long, you're not short. That's simple. And then I build energy models in these enrichment models on the subset separately for long and short. And I look at the energies and they are anti-correlated. Good. Anti-correlate. Good. So that makes sense. However, if I try to discriminate them, if I build a linear regression model, I mean, I can discriminate them, but it kind of sucks. Okay, it's not a great discrimination because a lot of the energy is still clustered here. Nevertheless, if I look at the energies, they anti-correlate. So now I'm going to do the same on all pairs of my maturation stages, and I'm hoping to see this. Okay, I'm hoping to see an anti- Okay, I'm hoping to see an anti-correlation. So I'm gonna do this on the energy with respect to the DPP because they've all gone through DPP. And just to tell you how I define energies, if I have a self-tolerant PEP TCR, then in the promoted model, that energy should be small, it shouldn't be there. In the rejected model, it should be large. It should be there. Okay, but this picture in mind, I want anti-correlation. Want anti-correlation. I do all pairs of stages. This is what I get. Okay. I get very good correlation sometimes. I never get anti-correlation. I never get real separation between the two things. What I'm saying here is that there's some global selection driving everything. There are some differences in the energies, but they're definitely not anti-correlated. I see zero correlation with die-by-neglect. Correlation with die-by-neglect, which means that die-by- and neglect are just randomly chosen from every other maturation substage. But all the other sub-maturation stages that make it past this DP pre and don't die by neglect are correlated. So they've been selected for something similar. And what's worse, the CD4 NEC-S, so the ones that die at the point of being made CD4. The point of being made CD4, and the ones that actually become CD4 that make it the spleen have a huge correlation factor, as do the CD8. Okay, so the ones that really should be saying yes, no, say the same thing. So that's a bummer, right? Okay. So then, last chance: what does What is linear regression? If I take a T cell from each of these repertoires, can I figure out which repertoire it belongs to due to just by doing linear regression on these models? The answer again is no. These are the ROC values of the AUC curves, CAC and AUC curve, comparing again the really yes-no answer we're hoping for. So CD4 spin and CD. Also, CD4 spin and CD4 neck S, an AUC of 0.58 or 9. We're really not getting anywhere. So basically, I take a T cell out of any of these repertoires. I mean, I take a T cell out of the C D4 that is functional and the C D4 that should have died because it recognizes self, and I can't figure out which repertoire I'm taking it from. So, last hope: quorum sensing. Quorum sensing. Maybe if we take a few cells, then somehow I'll be able to figure out what report they come from. And this idea was proposed by Butler, Marankada, Thomas Butler, Marin Kada, and Arup Chakraporti a few years back theoretically, where they basically say that if P is the probability that a random T cell recognizes a random peptide, then the probability of there being no cell cell recognition Self-reactive TCR selected. So basically, getting rid of all this T of the T self-reactive one goes as one minus P to the number of TCRs to the size of the repertoire times the number of self-peptides presented. And they make the point that this very quickly goes to zero. So basically, it's very hard to get a T cell that is not self-reactive. And the reason for this is that The reason for this is that for each T cell, basically the probability, the mean of the number of T cells responding to foreign and self-pept is very similar. The means of these two distributions are very similar and it's very small numbers. If we take one T cell, it's not going to make a difference. However, if we take T T cells, small T T cells, and ask and say, okay, will only make a difference between Okay, will only make a difference between the distributions of the number of T cells needed to activated T cells to self and foreign. Although this difference that the probability that you react to yourself is a little tiny bit smaller than the probability that you react to a foreign one when you ask TT cells the question, did you react to self or did you react to a foreign one? To for one, these distributions due to the law of large numbers get thinner and they become more easily separable. And then you can calculate that there's an you ask basically for these histograms to be as separable as possible to have the biggest separation between them. And you can find an optimal t-star. And with these kinds of numbers, that optimal t-star is around 40. And then Neil's group came along and they saw some. And they saw some very, very similar effect experimentally, albeit in a slightly different system. So they looked at CD4 memory differentiation, and they noticed that one T cell is not able to decide whether it should differentiate into a memory cell or not. But if you have many T cells being asked the same question, then they suddenly undergo this rapid transition and they make this decision. And this threshold they saw is around 30. They saw is around 30. So it's a slightly different decision process, but it's still T cells having to make a decision. So going back to our problem, if we now ask, well, if I take T T cells and ask them what repertoire do you come from, do these T cells know? Can they figure out whether they come from the one that is supposed to be non-self-reactive or from the one that is self-reactive? And the answer is yes. So even with fertile So even with 30, we get a good AUC curve, and with 100, we get basically perfect discriminability. So it seems to us that there's nothing per se in one T cell receptor that forbids it to recognize self. However, if activation relies on a quorum sensing role, a few T cell receptors already have combined statistical features that are able Features that are able to perform this discrimination task. So that's it. I showed you that we can actually get the no repertoires, the ones that failed at different stages. There is no deterministic rule for TCR rejection, but there's this collective effect that allows for a self-tolerant T-cell population to discriminate between self and non-self. That's it. Yep, go ahead. Very interesting talk outside of this is Ellen Hothenberg over here. I am curious whether you built into this model at all and thought about TFEX. Because when I was working in technology, I think it's way everything was about positive versus negative selection and the finance. Negative selection in the thinus, and that's sort of reflected in your model. But with the ability to modulate self-tolerance in the periphery with the T risk, is it really important to even have these kinds of TCR repertoire purges? Yeah, so we, I mean, we do have a small T-rog population in this experiment, but it was too small to analyze this way. We did look at the T-Rex question, or we are looking at the T-Rex question with army to. A question with Amita, so maybe she can also tell you a little bit more about that offline, but in humans in a slightly different setting. One way to think about T-Rex could be that due to other sort of signaling components, they just have a lower threshold. You know, so basically, what we've seen with Armita is that there's nothing special about T-Rex. Again, I didn't mean special. I'm saying. I didn't mean special. I'm saying, do you really need stringent positive versus negative selection anymore if you have good T-rex? In other words, could that be a reason why you're seeing such a weak selection signal in the intraclining populations? So I don't think we, yeah, I mean, okay, I don't think we have. So you're basically thinking that it's T-Rex that mixing up our signal. That we have T-Rex in the CD4. T rates in the CD4 positive that that's what's taking over. I don't think so because when we looked at the separation between T-Rex and regular cells, we don't see a difference in the repertoire statistics. This was for humans, but I don't see why it would be different for mice. So, and I do think. So, and I do think we have to look back. I mean, in this data, there is no separation into T-rex. That is true. But yeah, my short answer is when we did look at separated functional data, there is no difference in the TCR statistics between T-Rex and conventional cells. I'll ask Arida more offline. Thank you very much. That so, maybe I can rephrase that because I don't know the answer. If I understand your question, Ellen, I don't know the answer to it. So, I think that maybe the
