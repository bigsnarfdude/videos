Our next speaker is Mathieu Di Turo, who is a postdoc at the University of Alberta. I guess since fall 2020, I think, right? We started there. So a bit more than a year. He's working with Manish, is that correct? And before that, he was also one of the speakers, I guess HÃ©zar introduced himself, said he got his PhD at the Sorbonne. I think you also got your PhD at the Sorbonne. Snowball and he's interested in topology and outright geometry. He will talk to us about quilt electrics on molecular curves. Please. So, Renate, before we start, I just want to make sure we see actually the slides because we were on the Zoom. Yeah, take a sending it. Take us doing some magic. Just move it forward to something. Like sometimes the camera is doing a stress slides for a moment. Is it worth that the video is blocking too much of the slides for that? It seems to present It seems to present it well. It's just. It's not in the Zoom, as far as I can tell. Like the Zoom sees, like, I don't know, something? It's a burst meeting room that we're seeing at first video. Okay, so he gives you much important thing. How before it works? So just give it a moment. We had a bit of trouble like that in the first talk as well. Of trouble like that in the first talk as well. So we're Jake is working on a please bear with us. Is he still recording? Yeah, maybe they can edit that out. It's really part of this conference, though. You wouldn't want this all to be like refined and professional and stuff. Does everybody see the room now? Does everybody see the room now? We see the meeting room here, the TCBR meeting room. Okay, yes, I think that's good. Great, please go ahead. Okay, well, thank you for the introduction and also thank you for giving me the chance to speak here. For giving me the chance to speak here. I think we just lost the slides again. Jake, my friend. We don't see it in the site. So thank you for the video chance to speak at the other level at your day. So today I was going to talk about modern numbers. So we have a bit of multiple theory, modern trips, and we also have some experience here that we have quite a bit. Some things you're making with quinites. Sorry, so I suppose it would be a nice quick review of quinceler. So we won't go into the general reality at theory to take what wrong. So instead we're going to focus on some restricted case. So let's consider the compact vectors of X and the horizontal vector model on X. And now we put smooth matrix on X. And now we put smooth matrix on both X and E. So the first thing we can do is define something called the determinant line bundle, lambda of E. So for that, we take the alternate product of the determinants of the Daudou Common G spaces. So on the right-hand side, you can see H0 and H1. Those are Daubro-Chomology spaces that are finite-dimensional. And they are determinants. That means And their determinants, that means the top exterior power. So we get complex lines. The denser product is also a complex line. So we get this complex line lambda E, and I call it Deterrent line model because there is actually a version of that for families of compact unit surfaces. But the definition is more complicated, so we won't be seeing that today. Okay, so now we put a smooth matrix on both X and E, and that's On both x and e, and that means we can put a metric on lambda E by considering the Hmetric on H0 and on H1. So that's by doing integration of differential forms. So we can see that electrometric through Odge theory, and that means that this electrometric only depends on kernel locations. So it only depends on this. So, it only depends on the eigenvalue zero of some operators, of some locations. And that means that it's actually not a good metric. Because if we consider a version of that in family, then those terminals of locations can jump in dimensions when you change the base point. And so that altometric will not be a smooth metric with respect to the base point. So the altimetric is not a good metric. The eto metric is not a good metric. So, in order to get something that actually works, we need to not just consider the zero eigenvalue, we need to consider all of the eigenvalues. So, that's why we need to correct the L2 metric by some factor that takes into account all of those other eigenvalues. So, the quiddent metric, one lambda E, is defined as this correction of the algebraic by the inverse square root. metric by the inverse square root of the determinant of the Dolphol location. Now here this notion of determinant for an operator here that's done using zeta articularization. So the spectral zeta function. Okay so here we get this thing that we call quident metric and this quidden metric unlike the L2 metric satisfies important properties. The first Properties. The first of those I already mentioned, it is smooth in family. So if we consider the relative version of the determinant line model, the Courier metric varies smoothly with respect to the base point. The second property is that the Coulant metric has a spectral nature. It's defined using the actric, which depends on the eigenvalue zero of the rotations, and this correction factor, which depends This correction factor, which depends on all of the other eigenvalues. So the nature of the Quinn metric is spectral. And the most important property of that quinant metric is that it fits into a Riemann-Hohr-type theorem. So we'll talk about that theorem more later. But it's a very important property of this Coulomb metric. Okay, so that was for the quick review. So, that was for the quick review of quident metrics. And now, the situation that I would like to present to you is that of modular curves. But now, if we take a compactified modular curve, so here gamma is a function group of the first kind, let's say without torsion, we take a holomorphic vector bundle which comes from a unitary representation of gamma. We cannot define a quidden metric as we just saw because. As we just saw, because the metric, the point-free metric on X and the metric on the vector bundle have singularities at the cusps. So we cannot define the determinant of the Double Rotation in that case. So that's why there is actually something to do for modular curves and those vector pounds. Okay, so just because there is still something to do in this context doesn't mean that nothing has ever been done. Nothing has ever been done. There has been an attempt at defining a pivot metric on modular curves in the past. So for that, we need to talk about a very important function related to modular curves and also an important object in analytic number theory, and that is the Serber zeta function. So again, let's consider a compactified major curve and a vector bundle coming from And a vector bundle coming from a representation. The cerbic z function is defined as this double product. So on the right-hand side of this equality, you have the first product, which runs over the conjugacy classes of primitive hyperbolic elements of the function code. The second product takes into account the powers of those hyperbolic elements. Okay, so that's. Okay, so that here looks like quite a complicated function, but we have some information on it. We know that it exists on the half-plane real part of s larger than 1, and we know that it can be continued. We also know where the 0s and boss are located and what their multiplicities are. So using that function, That function, using that function, Factorian and Zograf in 2007 defined what they call a queen metric on the modular curve, but in a very restricted case. They didn't deal with any holomorphic vector bundle coming from a representation, but dealt with the endomorphism bundle associated to a stable bundle. So it's a very, very restricted case, but there But there they were able to define what they call the regularized determinant. So because the determinant doesn't exist, they had to define it in a way. So they defined it by this derivative at one of the server-zether function. And now by analogy with the case that we saw in the first part, they define the equivalent metric by correcting this algebra metric using what they call Using what they call the regularized determinant. So that's what they call the Couried metric in their case. But now, if we really have to call it the Cuident metric, we should check those properties that were satisfied by the Cuident metric in the compact case. So, those three properties that I mentioned earlier, well, the first one, they actually do get. One, they actually do get smoothness and family. That's something that they prove in their article. Their queen metric is smooth in family in a certain sense. Now the spectral interpretation, that's not as clear as in the compact case. Because, okay, we have the Serbo-zeta function, and using the Serbo-Trace formula, that has a spectral flavor. But it's not enough to just say this derivative at one is That one is the regularized determinant to say that it is actually the determinant of an operator. So there is some spectral flavor for that Coulomb metric, but it's not as clear as in the compact case. And now the third and most important point, most important of those properties, they do not get a Riemann Rault-type theorem for that quinine metric. They get a curvature formula, but not a Riemann Rault-type theorem. R-type theorem. And that's what I want to present in this talk. I want to present ideas on how to get equivalent metric on modular curves, which fits into that kind of Riemann-Roch theorem. So let's see what that kind of theorem is. That would be the Riemann-Roch isometry of W. So, in order to talk about So in order to talk about that isometry, we need to go into a slightly more general setting. So here we need to consider the family of compact ring surfaces of GSG and a holomorphic vector model on X. So as I said earlier, in that case we have a version of the determinant line model which gives a line model on the base. We have a relative version of that. And we also have a bunch of We also have a bunch of other line bundles on the base which are called intersection bundles. The first part of the theorem proved by the linear is that we have a relation between those two types of line bundles on the base. On the left we have the spectral stuff, we have the determinant line bundle. On the right we have those line bundles which come from intersection theory. Intersection theory. So let me just say a few words on those bundles on the right. The first two are what are called Dering pairings. So the Dering Pairing of two line bundles is a way to see the product of the two first trend classes as a line bundle on the base. So informally, if you take two line bundles on F. Two line bundles on X, the product of the first chunk classes should be in the second child group. You push forward to the base, it should be the first child group of the base, so it should correspond to a line bond. The delayed pairing gives you a way to construct such a line bond. And the last factor on the right is an IC2 bundle, and that's basically the same as the recurrence, but for the second term class instead of pro. Chunk class instead of product of first chunk classes. Okay, so we have this isomorphism which looks a bit scary because we have a power 12, we have Brent, Jake, we lost the slides. Change them. We're back. Go ahead, okay. Right, so we have this isomorphism of the. We have this isomorphism of line bundles, which looks scary because there are all of these factors. We have powers 12, R, 6, but it still gives you a way to relate line bundles which come from a different background. So that's what's interesting about that result. But now if we put smooth metrics on X and E, then it turns out that we have metrics on all We have metrics on all of these factors. On the left-hand side, we have the equivalent metric, and on the right-hand side, we have other metrics. So now, what's natural to wonder is, does this isomorphism preserve the matrix? Does it become an isometry? And it turns out that, yes, it does become an isometry up to a certain factor, which is completely explicit. Is completely explicit and it depends only on the genus and on the rank of the vector bundle, the genus of the Riemann surfaces. Right. So those metrics that we define on all of the factors, they're defined above each point of the base. So in order to go from the isomorphism, which is really something that Which is really something that you need to take into account the whole base for that. But in order to go to the isometry, we can just assume that the base is a point, because we just need to check compatibility with the metrics for each metric. So for each point of the base. So now let's see why there is a problem with modular curves. Because if you think about a modular curve, it's a compact remote surface. Term, it's a compactified surface. Those vector bundles that we consider, they are holomorphic vector bundles on the compactified module term. So the first part of the Wins result, the isomorphism, still holds, because we still need all the hypotheses. The problem is in the isometry part. We cannot define the metric in that case, so we obviously don't get the isometry. So I've been mentioning that the isometry part. That the isometric part of the result doesn't hold because we have singularities. So now I want to say a few words about what that means. What the word singularity means here. So once again, we take a compactified vector curve and a holomorphic vector bundle on that curve. So if you take any cusp of that major curve, you can describe an open neighborhood of that cusp. An open neighborhood of that cusp as a punctured disk. The center of that disk corresponds to the cusp. You can take a coordinate on that disk, and now you can see what the Frankie metric and the metric on E look like above that disk, so around that cursor. And that's what they look like. So for the Poi-Kim metric, you can see that it becomes this modulus of dz squared. It becomes this modulus of dz square to the square of the modulus of z log of modulus of z. What it means that this metric is singular is that if you let z go to zero for that coefficient, one over z log z to the squared, that coefficient goes to infinity. So you cannot extend a PoincarÃ© metric in a smooth way over the cusp because you have something that goes over at infinity. So you cannot extend it. So you cannot extend it. So that's what it means for the Poinchari metric to be singular at the center of that disk. There is a problem for that metric. That metric on the vector bundle E is slightly more complicated, but it can be fully described by talking about the norms of some holomorphic frame near the cusp. And the norm of one of the vectors in Of one of the vectors in such a frame will be given by the modulus of Z. Can we get the slides back, please? Oh. We lost the slides again. There we are, thank you. Okay. So the metric on E is characterized by this norm, and as you can see on the right-hand side of this equality, we have the modulus of Z to the power 2 alpha J, where alpha J is some real number. alpha j is some real number. Now here, unless alpha j is zero, you can see that this norm goes to zero or to infinity as z goes to the cusp, the center of the disk. So there is also a problem for that metric in general because we cannot extend a metric by zero. That's not a metric. Or we cannot extend it by infinity. That's also not a metric. So in general the metric on E In general, the metric on E also has a singularity at the caps, but the Pokemon metric always does. So there is this problem, but we still notice something nice about those metrics. What's nice is that those metrics only depend on the modulus of Z, on the radius on that disk. So what we can do is, instead of considering those singular metrics, which is a bit annoying, we can consider We can consider, we can replace those metrics. So instead of considering those singular metrics near the cusps, we can replace them by constant metrics. We can truncate those singular metrics. So what it means is that away from the cusp, so here that's a representation of a material curve on the left and on the left. Of a mature curve. On the left and on the right, we have two cusps. Away from the cusps, we don't do anything to the matrix because they don't have any problem there. But on those disks here, near the cusps, we replace the singular metrics by constant metrics. So what we get by doing that, well, that's not a smooth metric. That's a continuous metric. Okay? But for the purpose of this talk, But for the purpose of this talk, let's just pretend that it is smooth. So, if we pretend that the truncated metrics are smooth, then there's no obstacle in defining a quinet metric associated to those truncated metrics. So, as we saw in the first part, we correct the anti-metric by the inverse square root of some determinant. Of some determinant. Okay, so that quident metric can now be used with the mean's isometry because, well, we pretended that the matrix was both. So here we have again this scary isometry. On the left, the determinant client model, on the right, those intersection models. So now let's So now let's uh keep in mind what we've done here. Around each cusp we took a small neighborhood of radius epsilon and we replaced on that neighborhood the singular metric by a constant metric. So if we want to recover information from the singular metric, there's just one thing to do. We let epsilon go to zero. We let those open neighborhoods shrink onto the cusps. Onto the cusps. Now there's a problem with that. Because we had singularities to begin with, if we let epsilon go to zero, we're going to have two divergent factors on each side. So instead of just doing that, we note that because of this isometry, even though the two sides diverge, they diverge in pretty much the same way because they are isometric. So what we have to do is understand the diverse diverse. So what we have to do is understand both sides of the isometry independently as epsilon. So the first step in doing that, we need to take care of the right-hand side. And for the right-hand side, we need to modify a little bit those intersectional groups. We need to do a regularization of each factor. So let's see what it looks like on the first of them. On the first of them. So if you think about omega x, that's the holomorphic cotangent bundle. So the sections are holomorphic differential forms. So very regular objects, very singular metric. So what we can do is we can take some of the regularity away from the objects, from the sections, and put it on the metric. What I mean by that is instead of considering omega x, Instead of considering omega x, we want to consider omega x of d, where d is the divisor given by the sum of classes. So instead of holomorphic differential forms, we consider non-morphic differential forms and we allow simple poles at the caspus. And that means that the metric we get on omega x of d, well, it's still a bit singular, but not as much. And when we do this modification on the Modification on the first factor of the isometry, we get something that converges as epsilon goes to zero. And of course, because we've replaced omega x by omega x of d, we would have some other terms, but that serves to extract the divergent part and set it aside. Okay, so let me just change time. Okay. Okay. Okay, great. So how do you get rid of D then? How do I get rid of D. Get rid of D? Or do you keep D as part of the answer? Because somehow you've been... Yeah, yes. I do keep D as the. So what happens is that the Derring pairing is bimultiplicative. So when you tensor by Ox of D, or when you replace omega X by this on the right-hand side, using This is on the right hand side, using bimultiplicativity, you're going to obtain some other factors, but they are much simpler than the first in the pairing. So, in the end, the result will still have D in it. And actually, in order to regularize the other factors, we need to introduce other divisors. And so that's why the isometry in the end becomes quite complicated. Okay, so the other part is the left-hand side of the isometry. We need to understand what happens to this. We need to understand what happens to the determinant of the rotation as epsilon goes to zero. And so to do that, we need to use something that also sounds scary. That's analytic surgery. Okay. We'll see the dealing with number theory at some point, I hope. So we need analytic surgery, and that's the principle behind that. And that's uh the principle behind that is to say we have a determinant of repression on a big uh Riemann surface, but we can split that Riemann surface into smaller parts. On those smaller parts, we're going to have determinants of some locations as well. How can we relate the determinant on the whole curve to those smaller determinants? Now that's That's quite a complicated part of getting this result. And in particular, because the smaller parts of the modular curve have boundaries, we need to choose boundary conditions. And that's actually a very subtle problem here. There's only one set of boundary conditions that work, and they're called the Arvarez-Wentworth boundary conditions. As Wentworth boundary conditions. So we can't do anything simple here, you have to do something complicated. So those boundary conditions, if you think about the vector bundle E, the boundaries in question, those are going to be those circles that make the transitions between the different zones. If you think about the vector bundle E around those circles, it can be trivialized. So the sections of E around those circles, Sections of E around those circles, they can be identified to collections of functions, coordinates in a frame. So those boundary conditions mean that we want, also, sorry, in particular those functions, they're complex values, so they have a real part and an imaginary part. So we're going to ask that the real part vanishes at the boundary, and the normal derivative of the imaginary part also vanishes. So it's a mix of Dirichled and Neul. At annoying. And we need more stuff to complete the study. We need a cyber trace formula. And we also need to do some local computations of determinants around the tests. So that's actually where most of the work in terms of quantity is located because those computations are several hundred pages. And we use some techniques of analytic number theory. In particular, we use Number theory, in particular, we'll use the Ramanujan summation. Keep talking. It'll go on for another couple of minutes. So once we've done both of those things, we... Oh? Okay? Yeah, goodbye. No, you're not back. Sorry. Yeah, yes, goodbye. Thank you very much. So once we've understood both sides of the isometry, as epsilon goes to zero, As epsilon goes to zero, we're going to find the same, basically the same power of epsilon, the same divergence, and we're going to find different coefficients. So if we just keep those coefficients, we get our equivalent metric. And this quiet metric can be defined as a correction of the automatic by the inverse square root of some factor. That factor is given by some explicit constant and a derivative of the several zeta function at one. Of the separate zeta function at 1. So if you remember what I said about Tactaine and ZOGRAF, it's still compatible because in their case the integer d was equal to 1. So it's still kind of compatible with their work. It's just that here we have an additional constant. That constant makes the query metric fit into an isometry. Okay, so now this Now, this quidden metric, unlike the metric defined by Tactile and Zograph, satisfies all three properties: smoothness in family, spectral interpretation, and Riemann-Rau theorem. So now, if I have a couple more minutes, that maybe? Go ahead. So now, let me just mention a few possible applications of that kind of result. In particular, with analytic. In particular, with analytic number theory. So if we move to a setting of parallel geometry and an arithmetic Fiemenhauer theorem, then that kind of result allows us to express that first non-zero derivative at one separate set of function in terms of elements defining the group and the representation. So it gives an explicit formula for this derivative of the separate set of function. In particular, In particular, it can also give a way of expressing the Pine-Peterson norm of modular funds with Nebentipus in terms of some special value at one of some several zeta function. So those are things that are linked to number theory, to analyze number theory. And there's also another application of that kind of method, which I think in some situations could give. I think in some situations could give other interesting results in number theory. I think I'll stop here. Thank you for your attention.
