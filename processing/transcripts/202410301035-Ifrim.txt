Solutions for 2D gravity waves. Thank you so much. I understood Master class, but it's not a master class. Okay, thank you. I would like to very kindly thank the organizers for the invitation. The ones that are present here, thank you for them. The ones that are not present, but they're online. Thank you so much. It's always a great pleasure. I cannot tell you how much I appreciate it. So, today is really going to be a class. So, absolutely. Absolutely something very different than what you have seen in the sense that it's still gravity waterways, so you're going to fall asleep a little bit. But nevertheless, what I'm going to talk about, I'm going to concentrate on low regularity. And so what you have to understand, and I'm going to say this in the beginning because probably I'm not going to get time to say it in the end, take it at the level of understand the tools and believe me that they will be applicable to other models. So it's more than solving low-regularity waterways. It's a whole Low-radio ID waterways. It's a whole setting that you'll find very useful. So, this is joint work with Daniel Tatar and Alberta. And some of the results are going to be earlier results are actually with John Hunter as well, in collaboration with him. So, let me tell you a little bit, and let me start naturally, because it's a class, I don't want to lose anyone in the process. I'm keeping you already this picture. So, this is a 2D gravity water waves. The picture has a bottom. The picture has a bottom, but it's because what I'm going to say is really going to apply, but I'm going to keep it clear and I'm going to only refer to gravity waterways so you don't get confused on what exactly I'm assuming. The water flows inside a fluid domain, which I called it omega of t. Now I have the interface in between water and air, and I'm going to call it gamma of t, so to say it's straight the notations. And for fun, I added some pictures that I stole from Daniel, and those are gravity waves. And those are gravity water waves, and you can see them on the ocean. If you see the wavelength, you know, there are, if it's very long wavelength, then there are gravity water waves. But if you zoom a little bit in and you're going to see those choppy small waves, small length, they're going to be capillary waves, and you see them together, capillary and gravity water waves. And those are the things that we are really going to concentrate in studying. The existence, the local Welposnas theory, and the global Welposnas theory as well. And so now that you have the picture. And so now that you have the picture, let me tell you that to set up the water wave equations, as you probably know, you start from Euler equations. The unknown that you're going to have, so there are a couple of unknowns. You have the fluid velocity, which is denoted by V, you have the pressure, you have the incompressibility conditions that you all are aware of. And then I put here the equations Navier-Stokes versus Euler, so you can see the full Newton slow in its beauty. And so I just colored. And so I just color-coded things, gravity is with blue, and everything that is related to viscosity, which in our case is going to be in a viscous fluid, so the viscosity is zero, is going to be in red. And that relates to Navier Stokes, if you want to consider that model. So now that you have Euler, you wonder exactly how would you set up the wave equations. So you start with Euler, but this is going to happen in a domain that has infinite depth, but then you have the interface. So then you naturally need to impose those boundary conditions, which Those boundary conditions, which it goes by the name as material derivative. And what this says is that the material derivative remains tangent at your surface at any given time. In other words, if you start with the particle that's on the surface, that interface, it's going to remain on the interface, so it's not going to go up. And that's by known by kinematic boundary condition. And another natural condition that you don't impose it's actually happening, that's why it's a free boundary problem, is the dynamic boundary condition where the pressure, you have an equivalence of... Where the pressure, you have an equivalence of forcing, forces acting on the interface. And then here, the pressure is going to be directly proportional with the surface tension coefficient. And here, this age is the mean curvature on the boundary. And so, those are your boundary conditions. And so, now you all are aware of this whole methodology in which, because you assume you have vorticity, so your fluid is irrotational, because of the equation that the vorticity solves. Of the equation that the vorticity solves, you know that if you start with zero, you're going to have no vorticity happening, and not if you don't have an obstacle. So, in this case, vorticity is going to remain zero because of the transport equation that vorticity is satisfying. And so, the idea is to introduce, which goes back to the very 60s, I guess. So, you can introduce a velocity potential, which is a stealer function, and then you know what I'm aiming to. So, once you have Where I'm aiming to. So, once you have this, you're going to know that your velocity potential is going to be a harmonic function in the domain of the fluid. So, basically, you can move your problem on the boundary and you're going to get your information literally by just reading what happens on the boundary. And like I said, here is uniquely determined by its values on the free boundary. And this is a key idea that goes back to Zaharov, which basically helps you to trade dimensionality. So, so you started with a two-dimensional problem, and if you mention A two-dimensional problem, and if you manage to move it on the boundary, then you win in the sense that you're actually going to win in terms of dimensions. You lower the dimension by one. And so now, let me talk about choice of coordinates. And let me emphasize something. There is more traditional choices of coordinates. And there is this one that I'm going to explain a little bit. So now choices are a very acquired taste, in the sense that it depends on the analysis you do. That depends on the analysis you do. And it's not just something that you just work, it's something that you actually have to work to determine what is the best for you. Because otherwise, you can run into the problem that using the wrong coordinates, you're not going to see the forest because of the trees. And so, for us, Eulerian coordinates were not a thing. So, Eulerian coordinates, it's something that you basically particles are moving in a fixed frame, and so you have a flat geometry. But then you'll see in a bit that once you introduce Eulerian coordinates, you're going to have to. Saulian coordinates, you're going to have to deal with the Richleton-Newman map. And if you go further, and if you know the story that you need to look at the linearized equation, then you need to carry about the linearization of a Dirichlet-Newman map. And that's in itself a whole career that you can spend on that. So, leaving that aside, you can actually choose Lagrangian coordinates, which, because you use it, actually is going to set you in a high regularity setting. So, the idea is not, if you're going to work in a low regularity setting, not to use it. So, for instance, Not to use it. So phrase moved along the particle trajectory and you have a curved geometry. And that's not, I'm not going to assist in describing the Lagrangian coordinates because we are not going to make use of them. So we basically came up with this holomorphic coordinates and I'm going to explain the difference in a bit, the difference in between what you heard in the previous lecture and what I'm going to call holomorphic coordinates. So the idea is exactly the same, to flatten the surface, the interface, but the coordinates are going to be differently chosen. And so basically you Be differently chosen. And so basically, you should see those solomorphic coordinates as the best of those two worlds. And so I'm going to have a conformally flat geometry and I'm going to explain you what it means. Fast curling, you know what we're going to do. Once we have the velocity potential, we take the V, write it in terms of the gradient of the velocity potential, plug it in in the momentum equation, integrate, get Bernoulli. And then we arrive on a new equation that is on the free boundary. And like I said here. Boundary, and like I said here, the variables now are going to be the elevation, eta, and then you're going to have the psi, which is the velocity potential restricted on the boundary. And this is basically the Zaharo's formulation, and I put it here in all its glory to tell you two things. You don't have to remember it, maybe you know it by heart. Second, it's a full non-linear equation. It's self-contained, and the variables are, like I said, at times psi, and those are the ones we're just following them on the boundary. On the boundary. It's a non-local equation because you have a Grishleton-Neumann map. So, to my mind, and to our minds, it was really something that we wanted to stay away from. And so, and there are some things, and I can tell you a longer story. So, now we go to this idea. I'm going to explain it, and then I'm going to give into details who did what. So, holomorphic conformal coordinates is exactly this idea that you've seen in here, which started with You've seen in here, which started with the whole fluid domain and moved the problem on the boundary, which is done in the Eulerian setting. But imagine you do that now in the conformal setting. So I have this conformal transformation Z that maps my free domain, and most importantly, it takes this wavy interface and it flats it, it sends it on this flat real line, which is the parameterization of the real line is parameterized by alpha, and so that's my transformation. Now, I'm Now, I'm going to say this formulation I'm presenting to here for infinite depth, it works for finite depth, it works for periodic waves. So you have more things to worry about, but nonetheless it works. So once you have introduced this conformal transformation, you have to, I'm going to denote this holomorphic coordinate. So this is E that takes the lower half plane. That's the lower half plane you just see in there. And that's how the holomorphic coordinates are defined. That's my Are defined, that's my map. And then I have the boundary conditions at infinity, which are common sense. Like I said, I want to flatten it. So this is literally what I'm doing. At infinity, it's going to zero, it's flat. And so then if you're working in a periodic setting, the only thing you need to impose is this alpha minus alpha is periodic. And now, clearly, I'm gonna look at how that eta that you've seen, what would be my eta in this case, but in the flat case, the eta was the elevation in the Eulerian formulation. In the Eulerian formulation. So that will be z. So that's my free boundary parametrization. Like I said, parametrizes, it's parametrized by alpha, which alpha is the real line. So it's the upper part of the lower half plane. And now I'm introducing this new variable. I'm not happy to work with this free boundary variable. I'm going to introduce nothing removed an alpha state in things, so nothing really happens. Things, so nothing really happens. So, now for me, this is the variable to work with, and there is an advantage in doing so, and people in applied math will agree with me in a second. So, and then I have the velocity, holomorphic velocity potential, which I wrote it in here, and this is the substitute of what you've seen previously in Zaharo, the psi. And so, those are new, my two new variables for me, which are describing the interface and the velocity potential on the boundary, and I can write down now a system. And so, let me give credit. And so, let me give credit. So, this appeared. We're not the first by any means to look at conformal. This goes back to people that worked on waterways, on numerical schemes, and so on. But we're the first to write a system the way you see it in this very slide. And so to understand a little bit of Senikov was close, but though he used real variables, of his variables were real, he was still doing this kind of transformation, but he chose a different way of defining his variables and then how. Variable variables and then Zaharuven Mu at the same time they worked. And what I can say is that you've seen already whose formulation is a combination of holomorphic coordinates, but then you also have the Lagrangian formulation built in. So this will be a little bit more hard to follow. This it was for me hard to follow. Maybe you understand it better. And then we came along and we said it has to only be the way you see it. And so what you see in here is a portion that's clearly related to water waves. It's me discussing how I decide on the coordinates. How I decide on the coordinates. So far, it looks like it has nothing to do with the fact that I'm proving low regularity, but it does. So now I have a clear way of defining the space where my evolution happens. And the clear way is going to be, I'm going to come in a bit to explain to you, but first is going to be something that I call functions that are holomorphic, but it's abuse of notation. Actually, I'm referring to functions that have the spectrum on the negative. Negative side of the real line. So those are my functions. Are functions that have bounded, so they are defined on the surface or on the interface, on the line parametrized by Z alpha. And then I can extend them in a bounded way, and they're going to be holomorphic in the lower half plane. And if you look at their spectrum, it's going to be from minus infinity to zero. So they only see negative frequencies. So that's where my evolution happens. Evolution happens. And so, to give you a hint, this is how the system looks like. It's exactly like you're looking at Zaharo's formulation on the Laraway equations that you've seen it in Eulerian, but it's now in holomorphic coordinates. So now you have W, which describes the elevation, and you have Q that describes the velocity potential. And now you see you have some F in here that I gave the expression, which is basically looks like the transport portion, but you know. Transport portion, but you know, a transport portion of your equation needs to be something real. And so, this f, if you look at it, is not something real. And let me explain something here. Those things that you see in here are basically, like I said, holomorphic functions. And I like this because I have a nice structure. I'm looking at Sobolev spaces of such functions. So, the Sobolev space will have a structure. If I take two functions that are holomorphic by my definition, I multiply them, they're going to. I multiply them, they're going to remain holomorphic. Okay, so that's something that you really want. I take a derivative of a holomorphic function, remains holomorphic. It doesn't change, it doesn't send me in a different world that I need to worry where it is. So that's an advantage, a huge advantage, if you ask me. And now, and if you ask anyone that's doing low regularity theory, and if you do numerics, it's actually helping you. And so, what else I wanted to say? Here, you see the projection. Here you see the projection. And what is this projection? You know from Zaharo's formulation that once you move in the Eulerian on the boundary, you get the non-local aspect that it's hidden in the Dirichlet-Newman map. And so you'll be like, okay, you did a transformation. How did you lose the non-locality in the process I didn't? It's still in here and it's hidden in this F that you see in here, which is a projection. And if I write the expression of the projection, the projection is identity minus I. Entity minus I Hilbert transform over 2. So the non-locality is hidden in this projection. So I'm getting exactly the same thing that Zaharov got in the sense that I'm getting a fully non-linear problem. I'm reducing the dimensionality, but I'm getting the Hilbert transform, which I'm happier to work with because it's easier than the Drich Letween Manap. And now I have some constants that I want to explain a little bit. This is the Jacobian, which is what you get when you change the coordinates in the holomorphic. When you change the coordinates in the holomorphic coordinates, remember, holomorphic, it's our definition of holomorphic. I only see negative frequencies. So when I project, the projection of holomorphic functions gives me holomorphic functions. So if I don't have a bar, and if I have a bar, it gives me zero. Okay? And so now I'm only writing here a conserved energy that one can derive easily looking at this. Literally, this system is not going to help you. This system is not going to help you. Like I said, you know, this looks like a transport term, but it is a complex-valued thing. So, I probably the real part of it is actually what's going to play the role of the transport. So, I need to do some massaging, like Eric was saying, to decide what is my system. And then I introduce prematurely this R, which is going to be the right variable to work with. And I'm going to explain in a bit why. So, as it is, I only recall that I have a system, it is non-local, it's fully non-linear, and I also have Non-linear, and I also have a conserved quantity that measures W in L2 and Q in H homogeneous one-half. So I have half of the derivative that I know that I can bound, that I don't know less and I don't know more. And so how exactly am I going to make use of this information? And so let me point out something. This is something I realized about my system, but I wanted to realize a little bit more. What do I want to realize? What kind of system is this? First of all, I'll realize it's hyperbolic in a bit, but something that I'm by default trained is to look into this first. Trained is to look at the dispersive because I can bring something from home that is dispersive where I know to look for something interesting. So, what you do, you go back to this system and you be like doing expansion, see what's the part. If I'm doing the expansion here and I'm expanding this Taylor-wise, Taylor expansion, I'm going to have Q alpha minus Q bar to which I apply P, but PQ is this other one, so this is Q alpha. So, if I'm looking at this, the only linear term on this side. At this, the only linear term on this side is q alpha. And if I'm doing the exactly same thing here, this will be the linear term. So if I'm going to write it down, this is basically going to give you the linearization around the zero solution. And that's all you need to know, because once you have this, you can write it as a second-order differential equation and write down the dispersion relation, which also you can call it a characteristic set. And I wrote it here for you, so it's a parabola on the side. So it's a parabola on the side. And this is gold when you do anything, because this is going to tell you a lot of things. Among other things, it can tell you what are the speeds of your groove velocity, of your certain types of frequencies. So for example, if you look at high frequencies, the groove velocity is going to be perpendicular to the tangent to the point you chosen. So if you look at it, the slope of it is going to be almost straight. So your high waves, or I could have very well Waves, or I could have very well written down the velocity formula. And so you see that very large waves move with slowly with group velocity that small, and very small waves are going to move very fast. So from this point of view, I'm looking at two separate things that are happening. When I'm looking at the local problem, if I'm looking at large amplitude waves, like large frequency waves, and I'm looking at the global problem when I'm talking about small. I'm looking when I'm talking about small waves, small frequency waves. So, this being said, I would want to understand this whole world possess theory, and so I know that this is going to be a dispersive equation. Now, I go back, and I told you, a big portion is about deciding on what kind of variables I should work with. And so, while you do the analysis, the first thing you see, because it's a fully non-linear problem, in any PDE class, you'll In any PVE class, anyone will tell you, take a derivative. I don't care with respect to which variable, space or time. Take it, because that would land you on a quasi-linear model. And so then it's a little bit more easier to deal with. I'm not saying busy easier. It has his perks. So when you take the derivatives, you're going to get a self-contained system in the W alpha and then in Q alpha. But if you're paying But if you're paying attention, your problem is hyperbolic. And so you know it's a hyperbolic evolution. The first thing you need to do is to diagonalize it. Otherwise, it's a mess. We all tried it. I tried it as a graduate student. I told the energy estimates and I was very demonstrated. So until I realized that I had to diagonalize. So you diagonalize it and then you get this magical. It's an algebraic computation that you're going to do. But what you get is what Didier will be happy to hear, something that's physically relevant. Physically relevant. So, what's exactly? I'm getting the slope. So, basically, this is the slope of the boundary. And I'm getting this R. This is nothing more, if you do the computation, than the velocity vector field in conformal notation. So it's literally that. So it makes sense to really look for the right coordinate. It's not just a thing. It's actually important to have the physical relevant variables to work with because those are going to lead you to. To work with because those are going to lead you to the results you want. So, once you've done this, you actually diagonalize the whole system magically, it's going to look like this. I forgot projections just because I did not want to make those things look even worse. So, this is really an evolution on what I call holomorphic space of functions. So they only have negative frequencies. And the way we did this, we do this in dispersive PDs. And in PDs in general, on the left-hand side, we put what we mean the principle. Hand side, we put what we mean the principal part, and on the right-hand side, we want to put things that we literally treat perturbatively in a way or another. And I have to be specific when the time comes. So, here is the main part. This is the material derivative, and this B is part of that F that I told you about, what is the real component of F. So, it's really a transport, and my unknowns are W, bold, and R, and they're physical, and I have the coupling that happens, and the coupling is not through this. My coefficient is this, my unknown. My coefficient is this, my unknown is this. So, this is another thing. You can ask me right from the back: how would you know to do this right away, to know which one is the coefficient, which one is the unknown? That's a story that's related to the linearized equation. So that's how I know how to decide which is the unknown, which is the coefficient. And here again, the W bold is going to be my unknown. This thing is going to be my coefficient. So, this is not magical, it happens through some work to decide what's the It happens through some work to decide what's the principal part. And so now that I have this, I should mention that there is another quantity that I knew a priori that I need to put it in here, which is this A, which is nothing more than the normal derivative of the pressure. Together with the 1, it's what we call the Taylor sign coefficient. And because we chose the right coordinates, the proof to show, which is a reproof what CJ did, that 1 plus A is positive is literally half of a line. Half of a line. So that's, and it's done at scaling. So that's why you want to be working with the right coordinates because they are really talking to you. And so you have this, I mentioned this is Taylor coefficient, and it's going to appear in your energy. So you have to have the energy coercive. So you need this quantity to be well posed. Okay, so good variables. And here, so this idea of diagonalizing those back to Alinak. Alinak was a genius. I like the guy. And I think he has the best. And I think he has the best ideas that I, and as a graduate student, he was my idol. Okay, so Aninak actually introduced this notion, and then we've seen it in many instances appearing before we even started doing waterways. For example, in 2011, I was working on waterways, but not that deeply. And so, Alazar, Birken, and Zuli, they have this good choice of coordinates. But the difference between having it explicitly, algebraically in front of your eyes, here Directly in front of your eyes, here you have it in a paradifferential setting. So if you are not someone trained in paradifferential analysis, you will give up to look for them. You will be like, okay, what's this? I don't know, where is it? So it's good that it exists, and we took a hint. It's beautiful, but it's a trade-off. Like I said, it's a trade-off. What do you want to do? What are the coordinates? So, halazam ducia as you have a beautiful result. I'm going to go and explain it in a bit. And now, like I said, I'm after what. Like I said, I'm after well-posedness for non-linear equations. And I'm going to tell you a story, and I'm literally after low regularity, but I'm going to tell you a story that you will think it's out of this planet, but it's not. It's actually the problem tells you what to do. And this is something you can take from here and do it in other... You'll have your own difficulties to deal with, but it's something that don't just shut off completely because it's already water, it is not. So here I wrote my equation. Here I wrote my equation because I don't want to scare you with water waves in the most easiest possible way. Ut equals F of U. F is going to be a non-linear differential operator. Otherwise, I have an OD. Okay, so most. I might have an OD. So this is a diagration that I'm working with. And usually, if you want to work with any non-linear PD, the first thing you do, because you don't want to redo and redo and redo estimates over and over again, you want to have something that's modular. Have something that's modular. So, you want to do the energy estimates for the linearized equation, and I wrote here the linearization. V is going to stand for the linearized variable, and then I'm going to have a differential of F. That's what DF stands for, and this is going to be applied to my non-linear variable V. And then, if you know Bonnie's decomposition, and believe me, it's not hard, it's something that talks to you, you'll know that you can associate to this equation something. To this equation, something that's called the para-differential equation. So, basically, what I'm doing intuitively, you'll see it in a second. What I'm doing, I'm taking the para-differential, the main part of this differential operator, non-linear differential operator, and I'm looking to see which is the leading part of it. And that is going to be para-differentially going to act on my linearized variable. So I'm actually looking what are the real, what is the principal part of my equation. The principal part of my equation, and I'm subtracting that. And on the right-hand side here, I'm actually putting n nonlinear is kind of linearization, and then I'm taking para-differentially think at it. I'm looking at high frequencies, low frequencies, and then comparable frequencies, which are going to be easy to deal with, the comparable differences. You can integrate by parts as you wish. So, once I do this, I realize that this helps me because if I do the analysis for the linearized equation, I can go back and do it for the original equation. For the original equation, I can find a subset of the original equation. For that, I can apply energy estimates that I already have, and then I have some terms left which I can deal with. So it's less work. And then I'm doing the exact same thing for a para differential equation. For original equation, I'm associating the para differential equation. You'll be like, oh my god, you have a zoo of equations. What are you doing with them? You'll see them naturally popping in the discussion in a bit. So, why do I need this? Usually, how do you get this? I need this? Usually, how do you get this? Is Hadamarwell closeness? And the reason I put those equations is because those equations are going to show up in all of those things you need to prove to have Hadamard-Will closeness. So you need an existence of regular, an existence scheme of regular solutions. This is hard to obtain. More so, because the problem that we are working on is a problem that is in W, alpha, and R. And that's okay because the state of solutions is going to be a linear. The state of solutions is going to be a linear, it's going to be a Sobole space. But if you were to return to the original variables, there is a non-linear way of going back to the original variables. So then your space of state becomes a non-linear one, like what Daniel was saying. So literally, that complicates the kind of scheme you're going to be able to produce. So when you want to produce this scheme, you want to prove uniqueness. To prove uniqueness, the big hero is the linearized equation. You plug in your solution, you subtract, so it's the linearized equation. You subtract, so it's the linearized equation. It turns out that you cannot get the energy estimate you would wish to. You'll get them, but I'll show you in a bit. You'll get them, but you will have to go through the linearized para-differential equation. So the para differential equation associated to the linearization. It's a must-do. Otherwise, it doesn't work. So that's why this equation plays an important role. Then you have to show that rough solutions has unique limit of smooth solutions. You need some of the type of convergence. You need some type of convergence. And that type of convergence, you can do it in any weaker topology. That's fine. And we call that weak lipsticks. As long as you show you have convergence, it's fine. And so then again, those estimates are relying on the linearization and importantly are relying on the paradifferential linearized equation. And then also the step that is most important is the continuous dependence on the initial data, which is missing in most of the words, but it's essential. Literally is essential. Literally is essential. And it's essential because it has many things to do with the Hamiltonian flow. So you really need to prove this in order to really have what we call Hadamaluel Pauseness. And so here I'm saying we use Lipschitz bounds for the linearized equation and weaker topology and frequency envelopes. Frequency envelopes is not a method, it's a tool. It was introduced by Theri Tao. You have to think of it as a bookkeeping tool. It's essential to wrap up your energy estimates in a very clean way. Estimates in a very clean way, so you don't get lost. And so once you master that, you will see that your life simplifies, but you still have to do the energy estimates. Okay, going further, let me tell you how I go now from a well-posedness result to a low regularity well-poseness. And so this is something that happened for the wave equation. So it's a whole theory that was developed by Tataru and at the same time by Bauri and Shimani in 1890. Same time by Baudi and Shimon in the 8990s for non-linear wave equations. So, let me tell you the story behind this. So, again, I'm going to keep it at the level of look at the model. Imagine that you have an energy estimate, and you have an energy estimate that looks like this, and you have those control parameters. So, this will be the way your energy you want to hit the ground model, you want to look at the gronel estimate. So, you're going to be, okay, I'm pulling out my point-wise bouncy here. Hopefully, you're not going to push the bullet points. Here. Hopefully, you're not going to boost all that noise because we're all going to get lost. So, you're going to have some uniform control norms in here. And then, if you want to use Gronual, this is your energy that you decided happening in some soboleph space that you chose it. And then, if I want to do Gronual, what do I need? I need this guy to be bounded. And because I want this guy to be bounded, I'm going to need to rely on sub-bolled embedding. I want to have this sub-bolled embedding, so I want to find the right S as Find the right S as big as you want, if you want, and then the B sigma. But then you'll realize: oh, when I do symbolic embedding, I also lose a little bit because I'm doing the subolic embedding. So now, this would be enough to give you the energy estimate. And then you can go on and on and prove your existence theory, Hadamar, and compute your scheme and so on. And this is something we put together in some expository notes. We put together in some expository notes which are called well-posed net subprimer, and you can find it online on archive. Anyways, this is happening and it has nothing to do with low regularity. But then you wonder, where is this low regularity hitting? And it's close home. How? If I'm to do the gronual here, I'm going to get an exponential, if I'm solving it, integral from 0 to t of this quantity. So if I want that to be fine, I'm basically asking, literally, that I want this term in here. That I want this term in here to be bounded in L1 in time, L infinity in space. And I don't have that, agree? Previously, what I was doing by just asking Sobolev embedding, I was having that that term needs to be, so I was getting L infinity in time, L infinity in space, and I know that all I need is to be L1 in time and L infinity in space. This difference irregularity is a difference that's going to propagate in the world-poseness results. Going to propagate in the world-poseness results. So, this is a huge gap of things. So, then I start thinking: okay, but my problem is literally dispersive, which means different frequencies travel with different group velocities. So, if I have a way of averaging things out and get an average decay, then I can use that in my advantage and maybe get something in between an LP in time and an L infinity in space. But that already existed, like Daniel and That already existed, like Daniel and Shimon and Baori saw it. That's exactly Strikards estimates. So if I quit on having the bad idea of using Sobolev, but instead I use three cards, I win. I win big time in terms of regularity. So this is a story that is said nicely. The whole work that they developed was to literally derive Strickard's estimates because you know how to derive them for constant coefficients equations, but those are no constant coefficients for But those are no constant coefficients where you have everything in here. Everything is non-linear, everything is non-constant, everything is flying around. So they have a way of doing that. And I'm not going to insist. So you need to derive your own street art, probably for your own models. We did it for a lot of ways. So then this will lead you at the low regularity. And let me give you a story. An outline of the well-posedness results at low regularity there are no. So literally, what you So, literally, what are you going to be after? And to make Didier happy, I don't know why Didier I'm choosing you. So, I'm going to tell you that the critical Sobolev exponent is s equals one half. So, quasi-linear problems are notorious, known, that you're never going to reach the scaling. So, every improvement is going to be a game, and every improvement, in fact, brings a new method into play, a new things that you take it away and move it somewhere else, and it's Take it away and move it somewhere else, and it's independently of interest. So, how far are we, and what is the history of what people have done in terms of local well post-ask? So, we start with CJ with S equals 4, and she's using energy estimates. We go to Thomas and Björk and Claude Zwilly, and they use energy estimates, done well. They get to one plus epsilon, so they have this epsilon. That epsilon is from the embedding, from the Sovolet embedding. The embedding, from the sovolid embedding. That's why they are closing that epsilon. And then you get to, we revisit this just to understand, and then it turns out that we managed to basically remove this epsilon and get it only using energy estimates. And now, Tomas realized, and with the group with Claude and Nicola, they realized, oh, we need to bring in the street cards. And if you bring in the street cards, we can lower the regular. And so they were the first one to lower it to one minus one over twenty four. Minus 1 over 24. Albertai, who was a student of Daniel, realized that if you do three parts better with a loss, with a loss means that in the inequality that I just showed you before, I can allow for some plus something derivatives extra, not too much though, some partial derivatives. Then if you do this literally with three arts with no loss, you lower it. It's a huge step from 1 over 24 to 1 over 8. And what I'm going to tell you today, we do energy estimates, but we're not, we literally. Estimates, but we're not. We literally changed the way you do energy estimates. Are the energy estimates, but more carefully done? So, we do energy estimates that are called balanced energy estimates, and you're actually going to remove and you're going to get one fourth away from, so one minus one fourth far away from the scaling. And literally, what we are working now is to bring strict art signal loss and lower it, and this would be the lower one. Why would you care about this? You want to know when exactly things are falling apart, meaning that you want to know. Falling apart, meaning that you want to know the whole range of Sobolev indices for which you have local room possesses. That in itself, for a mathematician, is gold. Secondly, you have a whole theory that you are doing long positions for problems that you can see in the real world. Why would I expect to have more derivatives on the surface, the slope, and on and on and on? So I'm getting close to home in the sense that I want to do it in the more relevant physical one, but I would have to stop. There is not known. There is not known clearly, we're not going to reach the scaling to one half. This is a quasi-normal problem. There is no problem in the math community that was anyone reached that. So we are going as much as we can. And in the process, we might see why we stop, what happens, what are the failures of the things we are doing. And maybe we can break down. I don't know. You will see something in doing this. And other contributions are Nubuena also has something in between. Also, it has something in between Albert and us here. And the Poifere looked also and worked in. And they have results. This is for gravity water waves only. I'm not saying anything about capillary. I'm not saying anything because I wanted to keep it clean and just talk about this. There are results that are for other models and I'm not gonna insist. So I just wanted to tell you that this whole thing leaves you, this whole theory that I just presented, that whole Zoov equation is gonna leave you here. Equation is going to lead you here to low regularity. And let me tell you a story, which is going to be probably something that interests you. So, the idea of lowering the regularity comes from using normal forms, but normal forms were technically used previously for enhancing, getting enhanced lifespan of solutions, if you are aware of. And suddenly, the use that we have in here is to lower the regularity of the local world process. And to explain to you in a nutshell, imagine that you have quadratic non-linearities. That you have quadratic nonlinearities, then you are going to be quadratic. So it's linear in these control norms. And this is of size epsilon, it leads you to epsilon to minus one time of existence. If you go and you have only cubic nonlinearity, it leads you to epsilon to minus two because you are quadratic in the control norms, which is of size epsilon. And now the trick is to go from quadratic to cubic. And for semi-linear problems, this is what Chatag show is that you can really apply this transform. Is that you can really apply this transformation directly to your equation, and what you get, you get an equation for which you get good energy estimates. The transformation is bounded, so you can go back and forth. So, you do get this enhancement. For quasi-linear non-linear problem, it fails in multiple ways. First of all, it might be that this guy is not bounded, mostly is not bounded, and even if you are stubborn and applied, the equations that you are going to obtain, there is no way you can take back that result if it works and apply it to the original one. And apply it to the original one, so you get nothing. So, literally, applying it directly to the equation is not the way to go. And this was a big deal: how you actually resolve this. And there are many approaches that are in no way in the order they appeared. So, it's just though, I think Thomas and Jean-Marc, they were the first one that kind of come up with this, but I'm going to tell you why I put them here. So, first, we observed that we can apply this modified energy metal. This modified energy metal, which is basically the first time we applied it from Berger-Silbert equation. So, if you want to look at it, it's very thin and easy. But for water wave models, and by the way, this is not in no way related to the fact that the problem is dispersive. So, you can apply it for non-dispersive models as well. So, what you do, you take your energy, linear energy, and then you are going to plug in the normal form variable, and then you are going to obtain, you're going to just, if you're plugging normal form variable, what I need, you're going to. Normal, for example, what I need. You're going to plug in, you're going to compute the linear energy of the V. It's going to be linear energy of the whole thing. You're going to only retain the linear and the quadratic and the cubic part, and then get rid of the rest. And that's exactly what I'm seeing here. So you add some corrections. And this is actually the energy that you're going to build, and it's going to give you the nice enhanced lifespan. So it's going to give you that epsilon to minus 2. That's the metal. And it's literally working properly because you are not. Working properly because you are not changing the equation, you are just changing the energy. And now, is this my thesis? This is a normal flow method, which I failed to know how exactly to apply it for waterways because when I was working with this, I was working at the level of the formulation, in Eulerian formulation, and I could not see from how exactly I can implement this flow method. Now I know. And basically, you're moving your equation in a new flow, and in this flow, you don't see the quadratic terms, and you get the right energy aspect. Quadratic terms, and you get the right energy estimates, and you have a way of constructing such a form. And then it's this work of para-diagonalization of Thomas and Thomas and Jean-Mar, which basically you do a normal form, but you do it at the para-differential level, and you do a symmetrization of your energy again at the para-differential level, and that symmetrization cancels some of the terms, and you literally get an energy estimate that has good energy bounds, but it's at the level of the para-differential equation. But the idea was that, okay, so why? Okay, so once you have those normal forms, let me show you something. This is the kind of energy estimate that one gets, and I'm lying a little bit because Thomas, Nicolai, and Claude did not use all, you know, holomorphic coordinates, but I'm just saying this is the kind of energy estimate that they got. So you see it's linear in the control norm. This is 1 plus 2 plus das epsilon, 1 over 2. And then you have the energy in here. What you see in here is basically an energy estimate that's quadratic in those control nodes. In those control norms. So, those control norms or uniform bounds, ours, we replace that n-infinity bound with BMO because you have solo embedding with BMO and you don't lose that epsilon that you will originally lose. So, basically, I'm calling this a sigma, where sigma tells me when sigma is zero, I'm at the scaling. And when, so those are scale-invariant, and scale-invariant, where I'm pointwise measuring my solutions uniformly in a scale-invariant norm. And then I get this estimating. And then I get this estimate in here, and I get one half as well. Those two are going to dictate my Sobolev embedding, if you think about it. Those two are going to tell me the Sobolev embedding. And so I'm going to have, if I'm smart enough, and that's what we did in our work, if we are smart enough to divide this derivative in two and balance it and get this, then summarize embedding will be much better. I'm gaining one-fourth, agree? So I'm doing embedding for one-fourth of a derivative rather than... Rather than one half. So that's the gain you've seen. The gain in the epsilon was using BMO, doing better energy estimate. That's the gain in the thing that I just, in the thing that I listed here, the epsilon was using BMO, energy estimates much better, but to get here is literally just balancing the energy estimates. And how do you get those balanced energy estimates that I was telling you about? This goes to the linear. This goes to the linearized equation. So, all your analysis literally is at the level of the linearized equation. So, like I said, those are original variables. I linearized. I got my linearized variables that are denoted with small letters W and Q. Then I do exactly what I know. I diagonalize, use the Alien Arscoe variables, W, small, and R, and this is how my system is going to look right. And I'm not happy in the sense. And I'm not happy in the sense that I know I want to get that estimate which is quadratic. So, see, I have two control nodes. It's quadratic in the energy estimate. We call it a cubic energy estimate. So, I want to get this. And how am I getting it? Because if you believe me, in here, I have quadratic terms. So, from that point of view, getting an estimate that I'm claiming I'm going to have, which is of this sort, is kind of impossible because I have quadratic terms. So, how exactly am I going to do that? So, it turns out that we can. It turns out that we can get this, but for particular s equals 1/4, we get this energy estimate for the linearized equation at exactly this regularity. You'll be tempted to say, okay, why you don't get it at s equals 0? Because that's where we usually do the energy estimate. It doesn't work. We are surprised as you are. So it's just s 1 fourth. So this is the regularity. 1 fourth cross age homogeneous 3 fourths. That's going to work. And that's because we get this double. Work, and that's because we get this balanced energy estimate. So it clearly you'll be like, Okay, but you just told me that you have quadratic terms. How on earth you got rid of them and got quadratic? You know, you had to get rid of them and do something to get rid of the quadratic terms and get cubic and higher order terms. How did you do it? And so it turns out that you will not see it by looking at this linearized equation. So what you do, you do the para-differential linearized equation. That's the trick. You write it, you divide and conquer. You see what your principal part. You see what's your principal part? Don't get scared, this is wild. Wild quantization is just because it's good with commuting and integrating by parts more or less. So I have to look at this equation, this is the main one, and I'm going to get energy estimates for it, and I'm going to get them for any kind of regularity I want. But then I realize there is a way to connect this para differential, this linear para differential equation to the original one. And by hand, you can find the normal form transformation. You can find a normal form transformation that gets you from the linearized equation to the linearized para differential equation. I put in the tilde, and this is going to give you their equivalent, basically, those two formulations. You're going to have equivalent norms and you're going to have the right energy estimates that you can get exactly to one-fourth when you're doing this transformation. Because you want this transformation to be bounded. It's only going to be bounded here. So, literally, you took your hint from the para differential linearized equation and Linearized equation and straightforward form the transformation that will be bounded and you will land you exactly on the linearized equation only when you have that regularity. That explains S1/40. So that's exactly why you needed the linearized power differential equation. And now I'm telling you a story, which tells you a little bit. So you start with the original equation, which was in W and Q. We differentiated to make it quasi-linear. Here the equations are literally, there is a correspondence, they're equivalent equations. Correspondence, their equivalent equations via that non-linear transformation, which is the Alinak transformation. But you are doing two things: you are differentiating and you are doing this Ali-Nak norm variables. Those are two non-commutative things that are going to hit you right when you need the most. Exactly here, when I apply, I look at the linearization in both settings. I always have a correspondence. Don't blame me. This is hat is not actually a transform. It's just a notation of the linearized variables in this. Connotation of the linearized variables in the system. And then, once you're going to write down the para-differential linearized equation associated to the linear equations, this correspondence here is not going to be that trivial. This is where the whole the work is going in. Literally, they're going to be equivalent, but with a lot of work. And this is what we claimed, that assume that I have this A14 norm that stays bounded in L2. Basically, what I'm saying, the para-differential linear equation is equivalent with this. Kibalen with this, and so is true for the linearized equation. And so, doing my analysis on this, I can literally build up to the original system and get my solutions. So, here, what is to do? I need to go back and apply what I've learned from the linearized equation via the linear para differential equation to my original problem. I was just bragging about how the work goes into the linear one, and then I wave hands when I get to the original problem. And that's exactly what I do. That's exactly what I do. When I write the power differential equation associated to the original equation, basically it's going to look just like this. And I'm going to see in a second, getting my hint from the linearized equation and the way it connects with the parameters, getting my hint that I have a normal Foreign transformation that lands me exactly on where it should land. So I can get an equivalence norm, so those are equivalent, and I can get that my para differential equation indeed has those perturbative terms. Indeed, it has those perturbative terms, and I just can't straight apply my energy estimates that I previously had. So that's how easy it goes. And now you'll be like, okay, you just said that if you remove it, they're equivalent. How on earth do you do it? And the way to do it, I put it here schematically, you are going to basically, this is your original equation, this is the para-differential version of it. You know you have quadratic terms in here. And so you look at the quadratic terms and you say, I have low, high. Never mind if it's low high. It's exactly what I have in this. It's exactly what I have in this. This is low, this is high, so it must be part of the para differential equation. So I don't worry about this. If I look at high, high, that means I can integrate by parts as I want, or I can do a normal form to turn into a cubic if it doesn't work, and I win. So then I'm left with only cubic terms, and then I start wondering, because I work at the power differential level, I have a knowledge of how the frequencies are distributed, what are the kinds of terms I'm going to have. And if I have low, low, high, again, it's Low, low, high, again, it's in the para differential setting. This is like a coefficient. This is the main part. This is exactly what I have in here. If I have low, high, high, I'm thinking at low as being literally fixed, like being a coefficient, then I'm doing a normal form for the high, high, and I'm getting quartitons, yeah? And then I have more room to spread and spread derivative, then use my control norms and not ask for more. And then if I have high, high, high, perturbative as it comes. And I can deal with it in a second. And I can deal with it in a second. Now, imagine that I can do this kind of balanced normal form analysis that leads me to this. I literally showed you how it works on the original problem, but I wouldn't know if it wasn't to take my hint from the linearized equation, where things are literally more complicated because you lose symmetry. When you linearize, you basically set up who is your variable and who are the coefficients. And so, this is a little bit more harder to do, but you can still manage it with a normal form. If you do it for form. If you do it for power differential equation, you cannot just apply a normal form. And I'm seeing here that you apply an exponential power conjugation. If you remember Kohlhof transformation, if you are going to expand that Kohlhof transformation, it's a non-linear transformation that appears in events. If you just keep the linear and the quadratic part, it works as a normal form. It removes. The problem is that it's unbounded. So if I keep adding terms and to form an exponential, that exponential, it will end up bounded so I. Exponentially to lambda bounded sub y win. It's going to produce terms that are going to be bounded. So that's exactly what this says. Literally, it's a normal form that's completed to an exponential, and the advantage is that it's mounted. And that will be the step that you will technically do for the linearized equation. And I want to say that this was the local role poseness. And then again, you'll be like, okay, so what happens? How do you get to global? I'm not going to have time to tell you how you get to global. I'm just going to flash. I'm going to see a little bit. Just gonna flash. I'm gonna see a little bit. I'm gonna flash the result. It's not at the level of the local velposeness. And the reason it's not is because we are using a vector field, so it's vocalized data. Okay, so we are using a vector field. But this is the best we could do in terms of derivatives. And so you can see in here it's 7 over 4. And then what we are saying is that we improved on the existence results, including our. Results, including our own. And so we believe it's optimal, though we don't have a result. I don't think we can do better. It's just a comparison with the one DQBNLS. We claim that this is the best it can be done in terms of regularity if you are assuming localized data. Okay, so what goes into this proof? Literally, you rely heavily on the balanced energy estimate, on the good energy estimate that you obtained in the local role-bosness theory. In the local world possess theory. So, this plays a crucial role. Otherwise, you're not going to be able to lower it. So, we are using balanced energy estimates. And you see, I'm going back to the original variable for the global worldhows. I'm not in W more than Q and R. And so this is a little bit, that's one reason things are getting more complicated. And I'm using one vector field, which is the scaling. We used the balanced energy estimate, which is a plus, allows us. Energy estimate, which is a plus, allows us to do order regularity. We rely on the para-differential reduction via normal form analysis, which literally goes back to the idea of Thomas and Jean-Mar. And then, usually, how do you prove those global world closeness? If you are in any way familiar with, let's say, wave equations or water waves, you need to use vector fields, like I said, and we use scaling. But if we're actually using a little bit more than scaling, we use a non-linear field. A non-linear Sobolev inequality, meaning that our vector field is not going to be linear, it has some corrections added to it. And the last piece of information that helps you close energy estimates, you will see you'll have a growth in a region. And you'll be tempted to say, oh, I cannot close my energy estimate. It's exactly in that region where you become very careful. And you use this testing by wave packets method that we introduced. You are basically going to derive special, you're going to bring this. Derived special, you're going to bring this whole method into play just for a small region where your energy estimates are falling apart. And it turns out that if you do it carefully, you can literally see that you can close the energy estimate. And this leads you to seeing the modified energy, the modified scattering. The modified scattering appears right into your face, literally. Because you are going to end up devising an ODE in this region and solving for that ODE. And when you solve, For that ODE. And when you solve that ODE, that's going to give you how the solution, the asymptotic profile of your solution. And you are going to look at the phase, you're going to see it's different than the phase that you would have expected. It's modified scattering, not linear scattering. And so we explained this in a note that we posted in 2014 and literally easy to follow if you are interested. And believe me, it applies in many instances. I've seen it lately in a model that I was working on, not waterways. Working on, not waterways related. So, in summary, low regularity well poseness is basically requires you to really understand the nonlinear interaction and understand structure that your equation has. And this is going to be based on two main tools. I'm oversimplifying. First is finding the right coordinates to work. We didn't know when you found them, but it works smoothly. It's like a marriage, you know when it works. You don't know when it fails. So it's exactly like that. So it's exactly like that. And so you have energy estimates with sharp control norms. And so, no, I'm literally being honest. So that's exactly how it is. And then, so the worst that happens is when you estimate the cubic terms and are the ones where you have resonant interactions. And I kind of went fast. You have resonances, but they happen only at zero. So waterways from this point of view are nice, because those resonances are not going to really play a role. Not going to really play a role. You have what I call a node, what we call a node structure. When you put in the normal form, the zeros on the top are going to cancel with the resonance, and so you actually have those corrections that you're adding are bounded. So it's a null structure. And then another piece of information that you need is the dispersive estimates that you need to very, very carefully devise if you don't have. And once you have them, and they're hard to capture actually, once you have them together, they're going to make. them together they're going to make your well poseness as sharp as it gets and it produces more information that you basically for any equation in general you find that it's interesting to really go for the local world you know low regularity world bossness or low regularity global world closeness because it brings more to the game than just a number and so work in progress capillary waterways my student Liza actually is graduating used this whole machinery and looked at capillary This whole machinery and looked at capillary water waves and tried to prove a low regularity result, and this machinery works smoothly. And now, what we are doing with Daniel and Albert, we are looking at long-time low-regularity solutions in deep waterways. And to tell you a little bit more and become more exciting, we are expecting to assume no localization of the initial data and still do it at low regularity. And so this will be all. I thank you very much. This will be all and thank you very much. I think I was ahead.
