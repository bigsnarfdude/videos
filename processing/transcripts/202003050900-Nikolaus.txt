Yeah, thank you very much. And I will today talk about stuff that's partly joined with Emmanuel Ledonto, Achin Grause, and Irakli Pachkoria. And I will actually mostly talk about some very easy but fun algebra. So let me start with something very elementary. Let R be a commutative ring and A and N cross. And A and M cross animators. Is already animated from you to the frame? I don't know, probably you can just fiber everything over Gleason spaces. Anyhow, so what we want to look at is the characteristic polynomial. Everyone knows that. And I actually look at the variant, the inverse characteristic polynomial, where I sort of the strict polynomial. Like where, you know, where I put like identity minus t A instead of A minus T times identity, it just flips the coefficients. So it has leading coefficient one. Polynomial with first coefficient one, absolute coefficient one. And the characteristic polynomial, as we all know, has some very nice properties. Properties. Properties. What are these properties? The first property is a trace property. It has a property that the characteristic polynomial of AB is the same as the characteristic polynomial of BA. What is called the trace property. And that implies in particular, of course, that it's independent of the choice of basis. So in fact, you can really define the characteristic polynomial for endomorphisms of protractors modules. Protectus modules. It's the exact same formula, just not just for matrices. That's property one. Second property is if you have upper triangular matrices, A1 star A20, then the characteristic polynomial of A is just a product A1, A2. The third property is maybe a little less well known. A little less well known. So, just to and it tells us tells us what the logarithmic derivative of the characteristic polynomial is. So, logarithmic derivative is just x prime over x. Okay, what is that? Who knows what that is? Exactly. Trace A plus trace A squared T plus trace A3. T plus trace A3 T squared and so on. And the fourth property is obvious, it's natural. Okay, and actually in fact these four properties determine the characteristic polynomial uniquely. What does natural mean here? Natural in the ring, like if you just base change the matrix from R to S, then well. Yes. Okay, so these are properties. Okay, so these are properties of the characteristic polynomial. And the main theorem I will start talking about, or the first theorem I will start talking about that we prove is that, I mean, there's a generalization for R non-commutative commutative, and by non-commutative, I shall mean not necessarily commutative in that talk. And F an anomorphism of a Of a projective module, P finitely generated projective projective R module, there exists a generalization of this characteristic polynomial, chi F, which lives in the bit vectors of R satisfying one through four. Particular generalizes the number of the commutative one. The commutative one. But of course, I mean, this theorem is not really meaningful at this point unless I tell you what these bit vectors are. So, part of that theorem is the definition of these bit vectors. And these are bit vectors of non-commutative rings. And so, let me tell you what those are. And that's something I've defined with Achim a while ago, and Lars has done in the p-typical case. So, R again is. So R again is going to be a non-commutative ring. I want to define, and these are what is called the big width vectors. And it's in this case an abelian group, abelian group only. And what is it? Wr. We define that as follows. What you do is you take the power series. What you do is you take the power series over R, with leading coefficient one. I mean recall the characteristic polynomial was a polynomial with leading coefficient one. Here I look at power series. And well, I mean that makes sense over non-commutative rings. And that ends up being in a group under multiplication. It's a non-commutative group though. What we do is we aboveionize it. Just make it Boolean and we quotient by a single relation. And the relation is the following. single relation and the relation is the following you just have the polynomials of the form RST and you want that to be identified with 1 plus srt okay and there's a slight subtlety that the subliminization in this quotient is in the completed sense are there some missing parentheses in your nominal under here yeah I mean I want to identify this term that's a polynomial of This term, it's a polynomial of degree one, this term. And I guess somehow this is the coefficient RS and SR for all elements R and S in my ring R. And I want to take the completed quotient. Quotient slash variization. By that I mean you just take the relations that define a subgroup and you close this subgroup under the T-addict topology. In other words, you adopt the. Topology. In other words, you allow infinite sort of combinations of these relations. It's just in order to make it a topological ring. Okay, that's the definition of non-commutative big wid vectors. And of course, there's a bunch of remarks in order. I mean, the first remark is if R happens to be commutative. What are these bit vectors? Well, then these are just Well, the power series are already above, and this relation also automatically holds. So it's just going to be power series with leading coefficient 1. And that actually is the underlying abelian group of abelian group of Wittwackers, big Wittwackers, of ordinary big Wittwackers. That's a description that Witt himself found in his later years. Initially he defined it using the Initially he defined it using those components, but then later he observed that the big width vectors can just be defined as an abelian group, as the abelian group of power series with leading coefficient 1. And the p-typical ones are quotients of that. In fact, everything I'm going to say also works p-typically. These are just going to be quotients, but I don't want to mention those p-typical sources. Okay, so that's the commutative case. And you might know that in the commutative case, of course, bit vectors of commutative ring are not just an immune. Of commutative ring are not just an abelian group, but these are itself a ring. Where does this ring structure come from? Well, in general, we have an external style product. We have a product WR tender WR. These are being groups now, and there's an external product going to WR tender R or more generally R and S to R tender S. And in the commutative case, can just observe. Case. You can just observe that the multiplication of the ring R tendo R to R is a ring map. That's how you get the actual multiplication. And well, one can write down formulas for this multiplication. I'm happy to if you want me to. You can just write down that structure. That's why somehow in the non-commutative case, width vectors are only in a Belian group and not a ring. But there is somehow this trace of the ring structure left. Okay, that's the second remark I wanted to make. And the third remark I want to make is that my theorem still doesn't make fully sense because I said it satisfies properties 1 through 4. Let's stare at the properties again. So there's no reason that R is equal to R there is. Yes, so in general, actually, it's the lag symmetric monolithic functor from rings to the side. What I wanted to say is property one and two are now clear what they mean. Property three is maybe a little bit unclear. What shall you mean by the logarithmic derivative? And what happens here is the map, we can look at the logarithmic derivative, which goes from power series to power series. I mean I guess power series is leading coefficient one where it sends f to and I guess I want to Where I send f to, and I guess I want to insert a minus f prime over f. And let's say, I mean, in the commutative case, I have to make a choice, I just mean multiply from the right, say, with f. And the statement is that this factors to a map from the group of width vectors, which is a quotient of this group, to, and then it will land actually in a quotient of power series. The quotient of power series, which is r, r, brackets t, will a map, and that's a homomorphism. And here by this, I just mean you take the Boolean group generated by commutators and quotient by that. This is not a ring anymore, but anyhow, you just mean, I mean, this is an infinite product of this ring, okay? And so there's this ghost component. There's this ghost component. And if you think about hard about what traces over non-commutative rings are, you'll find that the traces, so-called Hattori-Stalings trace, also lies exactly in this group. So then, using this logarithmic derivative and this Hattori-Staling's trace, this kind of third property makes sense. Okay, good. That is this. And maybe I give you an example because it's fun, like how these norms are... Because it's fun, like how these non-commutative characteristic polynomials look like. And this is just like the easiest case if you just take a two by two matrix, ABCD. I'm just going to give you the result. I'm happy to explain how to compute it. But here's how the characteristic polynomial looks like of that matrix. So it looks like this. So it looks like this. So it's an equivalence class in the spit vector. So it's going to be represented by a power series. It's in fact actually going to be an actual power series, not a polynomial. How is it going to look like? It's going to be 1 minus A plus B T. So the trace is the usual term. Then you have A D minus B C D. It's the usual determinant term, you would think, show us up. But then you have further terms. Minus, the next term is C A minus A C. CA minus AC B T to the 3 minus, well, and then further terms. CA squared minus ACA B t to the 4 and so on. So that's how it starts looking. Again, I'm happy to explain how you compute that. And you see, in the commutative case, it literally reduces to what we're used to because all the later To what we're used to, because all the later terms cancel out. And this is, of course, not quite well defined. It's an element in this quotient. So, in fact, I mean, this follows by using some row and column operations. If you do different ones, you get slightly different forms of these terms. Thomas, is that why I don't have very many D's? Is that why there's not very many D's? Yeah, exactly. So, basically, basically, what you do is you form this identity minus TA and then you do row and column operations to bring it. Do row and column operations to bring it into a diagonal, and here I guess I've made the choice to somehow kill that row by this guy. So, if I made it the other way around, you would have more Ds showing up. Okay, so that is fun. That is the non-commutative characteristic polynomial. And let me explain how to prove that theorem, or how to define the non-commutative characteristic polynomial. And the way we do that is actually we prove another theorem, theorem B. Prove another theorem, theorem B. I mean, we, of course, by the way, in the end, I'll connect that to topology. All of that is, of course, like inspired by topology. And so we took a clue from topology how to do that. So what we actually prove is the following. So we have this functor bit vectors, and the theorem is that the functor W blank is Morita invariant. Morita invariant. And more precisely, And more precisely, I don't know how this is called, Morida functorial. More precisely, for every additive functor from the category of finitely generated projectives R modules to the category of finitely generated projectives S modules, there is an induced induced induced map with vectors R to with vectors S and I mean it's functorial in that. Particular of Morita equivalent rings where it have isomorphic leading groups of big bit vectors and this is actually not an easy theorem. If you think about it just I invite everyone just to think about Everyone, just to think about G Ln R n cross n matrices over R and write down this definition of the width vectors and think about why it's isomorphic to W of R. This is not easy. And in fact, I should have maybe mentioned that earlier, that Lars has actually defined the P-typical version of these width vectors using ghost components. And I think he proves Morida invariance by the comparison to topology. And we felt that there must be an actual algebraic... Felt that there must be an actual algebraic proof that this ring, I mean, this construction is Morida-invariant. And I will explain the proof. Unless there are questions about the theorem. Did you get the sinus quite in the fixing? So here? So for T to the fourth you don't want a plus I don't know, like Akin, do you have an idea? I don't know. I mean I'm happy just one people characterize the characteristic point of view. I think the answer is yes, but I'm not thinking because we do it with coefficients in a second and then it does, but without, I think it's also true, right? I mean you have to observe that somehow this logarithmic derivative is like inject. I mean in fact, you know, like this logarithmic derivative is like the Gauss component, man. And what is true, like And what is true, like in the commutative case, if your ring is torsion free, then it's injective. So that nails it down in the torsion-free case, and I guess then you can just adhere to the universal case. Like, which is torsion-free, yeah. So the answer is yes. Sorry, I should have said yes right away. Right. So with the question, does the d-log formula determine the characteristic problem? Yes, or the question also? And I guess the answer is actually, in fact, the d-log formula. Actually, in fact, the D-log formula together with the naturality already uniquely determines it. Because as I say, you just have any endomorphism over any ring, then you just form a universal ring where you adjoin to the integer C's coefficients. That's going to be like torsion-free, and it maps to your ring. In that case, somehow the ghost component may be subjective. Yes? Yeah, I was just thinking, I mean, also this upper, I mean, I guess like also this upper triangle. I mean I guess like also this upper triangular form together with what it does on linear factors uniquely determines it in the commutative case because well you can always go to an algebraically closed field and bring it in upper triangular form but that is somehow not true in a commutative form. Fortunately I wrote down the ghost component thing. Alright okay so let me just first tell you how how the theorem B implies theorem A or at least give you a construction. I mean this is not really a proof but at least the main construction in theorem A The main construction in theorem A. So theorem A was just a construction of the width vectors. How does this work now? But if I have an endomorphism of a finitely generated projective module, what I can just do is I can look at the width vectors of this ring and Rp. We're allowed to plug in non-commutative rings now. And identity minus Ft is just a power series over this ring. So it is just an element in these width vectors. And by rediverge, I just have a map. And by breezy inverse, I just have a map into WR. And I will just define the characteristic polynomial as this image under this map. I mean, this is, by the way, if you know how the density trace is sometimes constructed, exactly how you would want to do it. And so in a sense, you can think of this map as a determinant. And then you just have to read off what this map does on both components and so on and so forth. And this map, actually, in fact, is not always an isof. This map actually, in fact, is not always an ISO, of course, if only if P is supported everywhere on R. But there's always a functor in this direction. Okay. Does this give me a way to think, like, is this their way to interpret the Cayley-Hamilton theorem or something? And just letting me know. I don't think so. I mean, I don't know. I got asked this question a lot. In fact, Lars emailed me this question. I don't think it's so easy to. I don't think it's so easy to. The problem is that this is the upside-down characteristic. Well, I mean, there is a... You can just apply it to f to the minus one at least if f is invertible. I mean, that is true in the computer case, but somehow you could you could think that this formula generalizes at least for automorphisms f, but I don't I mean I don't think like evaluating I I haven't found a way of making sense of evaluating endomorphisms. Of evaluating and homorphisms on these width vectors because everything is non-commutative. And also, to be honest, like everything we do here is basically just stuff we know that should work from topology and do it algebraically. And I don't know what the kind of topology result would be that corresponds to Kaylee-Hanigan. So yeah, I mean, short answer, I don't know. And I have thought about it for quite a while and couldn't come up with anything intelligible. So if you see this is an analog. See this is um an analog of the determinant and I'm thinking of the form formula like characteristic of the determinant I D minus F T. Can you see from that why that formula is like a power series in the non-commutative case that is finite in the commutative case? I mean I guess you can just flash it out in this example by th by means of that trick. Example by means of that trick. Like, I guess I'm saying you can see for like generally instead of the determinant being polynomial, managers being like a power certain thing. I guess, yes, I guess, I mean, in a sense, yes, but I would do it by means of running examples, I guess. I mean, in fact, actually, I should say maybe one can define the determinant also. You can define the determinant over non-computed strings, but only for endomorphism. Endomorphisms which are close to the identity. So, this kind of formula that the characteristic polynomial is a determinant can be made a little bit more precise. That turns out to be useful. But yeah, so I guess the answer is somehow yes. I mean, there is, I mean, maybe in the end afterwards I can explain to you, there is also a version, I mean, it actually lies in a certain ability group mapping to bit vectors, which we call rational bit vectors. And I mean, it has a little bit more finiteness than being a power series, but it's not a polynomial. But it's not a polynomial. Something more complicated than that. Certain localization of a polynomial. Okay, so anyhow, how do we prove this Morida invariance now? And as I said, it's not actually easy to write down formulas what this map is like a priori supposed to do. We tried for quite a while to just construct this map, and it's actually not easy to guess how it's supposed to work somehow. Can in the end prove what it does on ghost components and by some natural Components and by some naturality define it like that. But the way we somehow ended up doing it is as follows. So we actually generalized with vectors first. So if R is a ring, non-commutative ring as before, and M is an R bimodule, I'm going to define for you a being group of big bit vectors. With coefficients in M in M as follows. And what I'm going to do is I'm just. So it's supposed to work like that. If M is R, then it should reduce to the definition we had before. And recall the definition we had before, but just like power series and then a bunch of relations. And what what I can do is, of course, if I replace R by M, I can just take the symmetric algebra. So I'm just gonna take the symmetric algebra. I'm just going to take the symmetric algebra on M tensor 2 over R and so on and so forth. So that is somehow the symmetric algebra on M, but in the first components I only allow 1. It's like the generalization of power series with leading coefficient 1. And then you do the same as before. I just above that. And take a quotient by the relation, I guess 1 plus mr is equivalent to 1 plus rm. Plus Rm. That is supposed to be interpreted as an element here, MR. You can just multiply from the right and from the left. It's a bimodule, so this makes sense as the relation. Okay, these are the big width vectors with coefficients. And as before, they reduce to the ones to the commutative, I mean to the one if m is equal r, and so they also reduce to the commutative one, and so on, and so forth. And in fact, what you can prove is, for those of you who Can prove is for those of you who've bought a little bit of widvectors, we know widvectors have all these algebraic properties, like for Shibung, Frobenius, Ghost maps, Teichmüller, and so on and so forth. And it turns out actually you can write down all of that in this setup. It's just going to be a little bit funny, like for example, the question Frobenius will be a map from WRM to WR and then the P for a tender product is M over R and so on and so forth. So all these structures generalize. So all these structures generalize, but there's one new property and that is kind of maybe the most important property. That's maybe my theorem V star V star that we prove. And that says the following. It says that W R M has a trace property. Trace property. I.e. if M is an R S bimodule And n is an SR bimodule. Then you can form two things. You can form WR with coefficients in M tent over Sn. It's now an R by module. And the statement is this is naturally isomorphic to width vectors of S with values in N tendor Rm. Right, that is now an S. Right, that is now an S by module. And that is the trace property. And this actually is kind of not super hard to write down that map. Because somehow you know what it's supposed to do on these terms, in these powers here. It's just going to be the thing which basically flips the components, and then you can just prove that it's well defined. In fact, again, you need to use some ghost component magic for that. So that is theorem B. So that is theorem B. And how does this imply? How do you use that to deduce Merida invariance? I mean, that is now pretty easy. Proof of theorem B. Theorem B was the Merida invariance. It's just if R and S are Merida equivalent, in other words, M and R, you can choose Merida bimodules, M and N. What is that? Then you have W of R. That is just W of R. That is just W of R with coefficients in R. But now, because these were Morida-by-modules, R is just isomorphic to M tensor Sn. That's just what it means to have Morida-by-modules. R is this. And then this is just isomorphic to Ws. This value is an N tensor Rm. And that is actually Ws. That's actually a G. Well, that's actually a general fact, which will also come in handy in topology in a second. That if you have a functor which somehow satisfies this trace property, then it automatically is Morida-invariant. It's actually, in fact, the standard proof of, I guess I learned that from a paper of Andrew, that's a standard proof somehow that THH is Merida-invariant. What did you call it? And you call it the Walthausen someone, someone argument. Yes, or yeah. Right, okay. Anyhow. Anyhow. So why do you call it trace property? Yes, because, I mean, you know, you can think of these as functors, right? And here you have two different orders in which you compose functors, Fg and G F. And recall at the beginning we had this trace property for endomorphisms. I mean, yes. So is the tool harder for the additive version rather than the more the uh Oh no, the proof is basically the same. Just didn't monitor. Give names to everything. Then you have a functor that has an adjoint which is homing and then no no it's functor reality yeah that's I mean the question is whether the functor reality also immediately follows from the grace property easily and the answer is yes. No. I don't know how to define these with vectors for an additive category, in fact. I mean, somehow... And I do, I mean, of course, I do somehow using topology, and maybe you could extract like very complicated formulas from that. And maybe somehow then you would take something much. Then you would take something much more complicated than power series. You would maybe take some more formal characteristic polynomials of endomorphisms or something like that. And that would be your generators. And then you have a whole lot of relations. Somehow, you could probably write down something, but it would be massively complicated. Way more complicated than this PD quote. Do you know what I mean? Power series are generated multiplicatively from terms of the form 1 minus alpha t to the t. Of the form 1 minus alpha t to the n. These are basically Fashibung of Teichmüller's. And it just wouldn't be true. I mean, this wouldn't make sense. Teichmüller wouldn't make sense. So, what you would have to do is you allow arbitrary endomorphisms of arbitrary objects of your category and somehow invent like formal symbols called chi f and then you'd have to figure out what the relations are and that's gonna be horrible. But yeah, that's probably somehow something one could do. One could do. Okay, good. So that is the trace property, and that's the end of algebra. Are there any questions? Did you say how to prove here in B prime? No, but I just say, I mean, I tried to say, somewhat indicated in words, that what you have is somehow, here you basically have this big symmetric algebra. Here you have another big symmetric algebra. Here you have another big symmetric algebra, and some of the terms are tender powers of that. And what happens is the map is on these tender powers basically just given by the obvious thing you would do. Flipping somehow. And then, yeah, it's just a somewhat annoying exercise proving that all of that is well defined in descends to a map. Yes, and of course you can do that with a bunch of bimodules. So, really, actually, you want to allow a list of bimodules for certain reasons and so on, of course. Yes, that is rational bit vectors. Let me, I mean, maybe ask that again in the end, then I can tell you what it is, because I did want to go to definitely come to topology. Okay, so I mean I'm let I I'm saying uh one thing about that in a second, but sort of we first say relation to topology. We first say relation to the quality. It's really like our source of inspiration. And of course, we knew somehow all of this had to be possible in a sense, because we knew like sort of the atomic trace exists and so on and so forth. And somehow then it was basically a nice challenge to figure out how to do that purely algebraically. And I'm actually very pleased with this formula. I generally think actually the formula of describing width vectors in terms of power series is much nicer than the approach using those components. It's just a formula. You write it down. It's just a formula. You write it down, you write everything. Like, I think also Witt thought that actually in his later years about this was a big improvement that he found this formula. How did he define the Teisman formula? Did he make the same choice of Teisman that represents the shoot? I'm not sure I did. I mean, to be honest, I did not. I mean, he certainly did not make the to the minus one choice, the one you like. I mean, you know, there's four choices. I mean, you know, there's four choices what the title can be. It can be 1 plus alpha t, 1 minus alpha t, it can be 1 plus alpha t to the minus 1, and 1 minus alpha t to the minus 1. And somehow, I think this is the one last prefers. And I somehow agree on an abstract perspective that this is for some things the best choice, but I somehow can't bring myself to find a geometric theories as easy as a sort of linear factor. I don't know. Anyhow. I don't know. Anyhow, then this is going to be a power series, and I like sort of linear factors more. But anyhow. Okay, so relation to topology. Sorry, Louis. Yeah. Okay, so what happens in topology? I mean, first of all, maybe if I have a ring, I can define this cyclic K-theory of R. And what is that? That's just, I mean, you take. And what is that? That's just, I mean you take somehow endomorphisms, a category of endomorphisms of projective R modules, but that's just a functor category. You just have the objects are given by a projective module together with an endomorphism. It's a category in an obvious way, and then you can take K theory of that category, exact K-theory, and equivalent by K0 of R. That is what is called simply K-theory, and how does K0 of R map to that? You just take an arbitrary projective module and you send it. Arbitrary projective module, and you send it to the projective module with a zero endomorphic. Okay, and so there's cyclic K theory. Would it make a difference in the send it to make a difference? Yes, it would make a difference. And I do want to send it to zero. You're right, there's a second map. So there's a remaining map from K0 R into this, where you send it to the identity. But I mean, this makes it like an ideal, if you send it to zero, and then like everything is nicely multiplicative, and so on and so forth. Is nicely multiplicative and so on and so forth. And so I guess somehow what I said before implies that the characteristic polynomial factors to a map from the cyclic K-theory to width vectors of R. That follows from this fact that on upper triangular matrices kind of would be the product. That's kind of on short exact sequences that gives you the sum of the outer two terms. And in fact, you can sort of define cyclic k-theory with coefficients in a bi-time. In a bimodule, what is that? There you just allow endomorphisms from P to P table Rm. More twisted endomorphisms. Twisted by the endomorphism, and that will actually in fact by a variant of the story I told you with coefficients will map to bit vectors R, with coefficients in M. And actually in the commutative case, it's a theorem of Eymquist that this is actually an injection and the the image is exactly the rational bit vectors. Exactly, the rational bit vectors. Turns out that this is actually false in the non-commutative case. This map is not injective in general, but still you can use work of Ranitsky and Jayham to actually give a definition of that, like an algebraic description of that, is what we call rational bit vectors. And yeah, I'll give you the definition in the end if I have time. But somehow anyhow, I'm I'm saying there is a non-commutative version of Eimquid theorem. It's basically due to Ranitsky and Shaham. I basically know in the language I I'm using today. In the language I'm using today. By that, do you mean the image? No, I'm saying that actual group can be described purely algebraically. And there's a map. And this map is not necessarily injective always. Kind of this crazy fact that you have a, it's totally weird, you have a sub-monoid of a group, a non-commutative group, and then, I mean, it factors over the group completion of that sub-monoid, but that. Group completion of that sub-monoid, but that map is not necessarily injective if your group was not abelian. It's really weird. That's kind of the thing that happens here. Anyhow, so it's not injective in general. Okay, so what is the relation to topology? That's maybe theorem C in my talk. And I mean, this is really like sort of the relation between width vectors and THH and TR goes back to work of Hetzelhaut Madsen. Then there's kind of an installment in the Then there's kind of an installment in the sort of p-typical non-commutative case by Lars. And then here's the final version: is what we prove. And that says the following, that this group of non-commutative width vectors R with coefficients in M is actually isomorphic to pi naught of T R R with coefficients in M. And this T R with coefficients in M This was defined by Lindsraus and McCarthy. Strauss, McCarthy. And I will spend the rest of the talk giving you a definition which is more along the lines of the definition of T R and cyclotomic spectra that I like to use. But they define it using point-set model. But they define it using point-set models for functors with mesh product. Okay, anyhow, that's the theorem. And that is how it compares to topology. And let me just give you one corollary. I mean, the first thing I should have maybe mentioned is somehow this is like the big width vector version. But it turns out you can get the p-typical ones and the truncated ones by allowing so-called truncation sets. S. And somehow this is true if you put truncation sets on both sides as well. I just decided to only talk. I just decided to only talk about the big mid-vector story, but everything here actually works with truncation sets in P-typical, and so on, and so forth. And let me give you one corollary, which I think actually was the main motivation for Immanuel and Eurakli to study that in the first place. And that's the following thing. So, if X is any connective spectrum, What you can do is you can look at the Hill-Hopkins-Revener norm from E to Cpn. And then I look at the CPN fixed points of that and pi naught of that. So pi naught CPN. But I can look at this kind of pi naught of the CPN fixed points. And it turns out this is now as a corollary isomorphic to the width vectors of the integers with coefficients in pi naught. With coefficients in pi not x. And here I should put p, n. That's somehow the truncated p-typical version of our construction. That's a quotient of our construction. And that's because this Hill-Hopkins-Ravenel norm is actually just TR of the sphere with coefficients in, I guess, x. And here I should say p, n. It's a p, n truncated word. So this kind of norm is just a special case. This kind of norm is just a special case of this TR with coefficients, at least for the groups. Yeah, I guess somehow, no, the norm. Yeah, I guess somehow you're right, yeah. I guess some. Absolutely. So maybe CPN. CPN fixed points. Yes. Thank you. Okay, so that is, I think, was the initial motivation of Iraqli and Emmanuel, why they invented this kind of funny groups only for. It is kind of funny, groups only for the integers, and then we observed that it can be done for all rings. And it's actually small. We came from this TR direction, and they came from this norm direction. Okay, anyhow, so now let me spend the rest of the time talking about TRR, M. And right, so that is a little funny. What are the subscripts on the W and the TR? And the TR would be yeah, that's kind of p, n. It's like the truncation set. If you know what truncation sets are, it's 1p through p to the n. Ah, very good. So it's just a truncated p-typical bit vectors. Okay, cool. And yeah, you can somehow do everything, all of that, just like with a truncation set as additional annoyance around. And then, yeah. Okay, so cool. So what is What is T R R, M? And so we know that if we have a ring and a bimodule or a ring spectrum and a bimodule, we can just form th with coefficients. Right? It's just R, tensor. I mean, the usual formula, just you put coefficients. Or you insert in the cyclic bar construction an M in every term. And so. And so, but now it's a little funny that you pretend to be able to form TR because, well, this is not a cyclotomic spectrum or anything, this TRRM. It doesn't even have an S1 action. So why would something like TRRM exist? Like Tc minus doesn't make sense, Tp doesn't make sense, neither of the terms we usually study make sense. But somehow, if you, upon a little bit more careful analysis, you see what is remaining of the supremic structure. And, I mean, And I mean, that is the following thing: facts. One TRRM, THHRM has the trace property property. So in other words, THHRM tender SN is isomorphic to THHS comma. S, n tensor Rm, as before. And in fact, actually, I spent quite some time sort of making a coherent version of that trace property. So there is a coherent version of how these isomorphisms fit together and all of that. And so it's a coherent trace functor, in fact. I sort of set up a formulism doing that. And sort of one nice corollary of that is the following. It is that th r, what you can do is you can take the p-fo tender. What you can do is you can take the p-fold tender power of m over r and that has a Cn action. Cn action. And I mean at first glance this looks trivial, right? Cc? Tensor N, right, absolutely. Thanks. N. And at first glance this looks trivial because you think well I can just act obviously by sort of rotation on this kind of n falt tender product. This kind of en-fold tender product. But then, if you think about it, this is not a map of R bimodules, right? So, how the hell do you get that action? And that is where the trace property comes in handy. What you do is you somehow act on this bimodule, and then you use the trace property to somehow rotate back. And somehow that is the loop you get in the end. And that is why you somehow need to set up this kind of coherent formalism to make that sort of rigorous to get an actual CN action. So, you said you can use the trace property to prove that you get a functor on. That you get a functor on the Merida category. Is there any such, can you go back? Like, is having a coherent trace functor thing the same as having a small? So, in fact, you can write down functors which are Morida-invariant but don't satisfy the trace property. Like versions of K-theory, for example. So, trace property is actually more than being Morida-invariant, but it nicely implies Maria inverse. And so, okay, one concept. And so, okay, one constant, and this is actually a shadow of the S1 action. So, if I input M being R, then of course this gives me Cn action, sort of being the restriction of the S1 action to Cn sitting in as roots of unity in S1. And okay, so that's one fact. What is fact two? Fact two is that there's also like a remainder of the superatomic structure. What is that? Well, I guess now it's kind of more or less clear what you want to think. As clear, what you want to think, there is a map like this where you somehow go to R and then you do the P for a tender product, R and then take CP. That is kind of the psychotomic structure. Okay, and the claim is that you can use these two structures to define this relative TR and let me do that in a And let me do that in a way which is somehow close to the way I like to do things. The following definition. A circlatomic spectrum with coefficients with coefficients. Is a sequence consists of The sequence consists of first you have a bunch of spectra xn which are spectra with a Cn action for every n larger than zero and that is just naive naive like just a functor from B Cn to spectra. Secondly now I have these kind of trace maps, the trichotomic maps, so I go from Xn to X Pn. X Pn take C P and that's a C N equivariant map. And I have such for every n and every P prime. Right and here, like as usual, this a priori has a C P N action, and then the tape C P has a residual C N action. And it's equivariant for this residual action. Okay, so that is. Okay, so that is what a symbol atomic spectrum with coefficients is. And I mean, what are examples? And by the way, as usual, there's actually no interprime relations whatsoever. interprime relations whatsoever. It's literally everything, I mean the data is literally everything I've written down here. Just these two pieces of data. And here are examples. The first example is th r comma m upper bullet. So that is a cyclotomic spectrum with coefficients whose n term is just th r comma m tensor n r. And this, by what I've said before, has a Cn action. And by what I've also said before, at least the first piece of structure, I've given you this, and then I guess you input M being already a bunch of tensor powers. Observe that it's still equivalent. Okay, that is an example. The second example is actually, in fact, the sub-example is just a sphere curve. It's just, I mean, n-degree n just going to be the sphere. I mean n degree n just gonna be the sphere, this trivial action, trivial action, and the Frobenius is just a trivial map. So going from S to S takes the P, a trif map. So this is in fact actually equivalent to THH S with coefficients in S, of course. Just in the special case of the first example. And more generally, if X And more generally, if x is any cyclotomic spectrum, so that's a spectrum with S1 action and a Frobenius, then you can just get a cyclotomic spectrum, spectrum with coefficients out of it. Well, I guess it's just constant. So x lower n is just x for every x. And then you remember more and more of your S1 action. On the n sky, you remember you have. On the n sky, remember you have a Cn action, and for Benius is just going to be always the same for Benius. And I guess then two is also a special case of three. Just the trif sphere in cyclotomic spectra. Okay, good. So that is cyclotomic spectra with coefficients. And now what is TR with coefficients? Definition. Well, X is a simple atomic spectrum with coefficients coefficients, then TRX is just going to be the mapping spectrum from the sphere into X in that category of cyclotomic spectra with coefficients. Alright, that is the definition, and of course, T R. the definition and of course T R R comma m is just actually I mean I guess T R of T H H R M bullet M tangot M bullet that's how I wrote it right tangled bullet okay that defines for you T R. For the truncated things do you just throw out like lots of the X ends? Yes exactly. Like lots of the xns. Yes, exactly. So you just think of somehow you have a truncation set, and then you just remember those xns where n is in the truncation in in the complement. In the truncation set, yes. Exactly. So in particular, I get like the truncated versions. And so, I mean, let me just tell you what somehow this basically is. Like, for example, if you flesh out what that means, something like TR, I guess, 2, P R M. So the first, I mean, like, somehow in other words. So the first, I mean like somehow in other words, somehow T R R M C P fixed points. Did I get the indexing right? What does that look like? Right, I mean the first guy somehow where you start your somehow building up your bit vectors thingy. That is somehow going to look like just what you do is just a pullback, just a pullback in the following diagram. You have th r, m here, then you have the Then you have the cyclotomic structure into the P-fold tensor product Tate CP, and then you have somehow the RM tensor P H CP. So this is why when R is S, you get the norm. Yes, exactly. That is why when. And you see somehow, I mean, in other words, I could say it's like a genuine CP spectrum. Like a genuine CP spectrum, some of the geometric fixed points, RTHH, RM, but the underlying spectrum is some RTH RM tensor P. Sorry, did you need to write what? Yes, I guess, yeah, sorry, I guess. I mean, the fixed points of what, yeah, I guess THH. But yeah. I guess they really write down something they call WRM, Littenstraus-McCarthy, it's a huge thing and Yeah, I mean that's not genuine language. Yeah, somehow I think maybe one way to think about it is somehow the genuine S1 spectrum or S1 for finite subgroups is like THHR with values like an infinite tensor power of M. Tensor power of m or something like that. And then somehow the geometric fixed points will be thr. Well, anyhow. I don't necessarily, I was always very confused by what Lynn Strauss-McCarthy do, and this is like a story which I personally find less confusing. But yeah. The whole confusion comes from trying to write it somehow in that genuine language, which always confuses me. Anyhow, so I mean, sorry, I didn't, that wasn't meant. It's just a statement about me. It's just a statement about me. Anyhow, so okay, but is it clear what I mean, Leonard, or did I somehow insult you instead of answering your question? I say, okay, yeah. Sorry for that. So do you know you don't have the possible forbidden sector on this? Yes, so you don't have any remaining structure, in fact, actually. It's just the spectrum. There's no S1 action or anything, and there's no Frobenius. So in particular, I cannot define. So in particular, I cannot define anything like Tc in this generality of its coefficients. It's literally just TR type. Is there like a forbidden attack on the category of these concepts that will begin? Yeah, I guess there's a sort of shift style action. So what you have is, I mean there is kind of, okay, maybe I should have said this, there is a sort of Frobenius which goes from TRRM into TR, and then again you have P4. And then again, you have P for a tender power HCP. So that's maybe somehow the remainder of the actual forbiddenness. So I'm going to write down in a second that this TR also has the trace property. So is the forgetful functor from cyclotomic spectra to fix atomic spectra with coefficients then induce an equivalence to the homotopy fixed points for this extra action? Extra action. Users. Sorry, I don't know if that's a question. You just wrote down an action on the category of cyclotomic spectra with coefficients. Yes. That action has homotopy fixed points. Yes. So that's a new category. Is that category equivalent to cyclotomic? I mean, maybe if you say that for every group and in a coherent way, you get somehow a cyclotomic spectra where you just have an action, I mean, somehow not an action of S1, but maybe Q mod V. action of S1, but maybe Q mod Z or something inside of S1. But I guess there's a coherence problem you have to solve how to make all that coherent. So maybe just fixed points for this action. Yeah. I mean there is possibly a theorem along these lines. Anyhow, so let me, I mean sort of, I guess now the theorem I wrote down earlier makes sense, right? Sort of the theorem was that pi naught of this TRRM is actually isomorphic. This actually isomorphic to this kind of purely algebraically defined bit vectors I wrote down. And here's the comparison theorem, something I proved a while ago and at some point upload. So here it is. First, of course, this is equivalent to Strauss-McCarthy's definition. Carcy's definition in the appropriate sense. So they define it for a functor with smash product and the statement is that under the obvious comparison maps this is equivalent to their definition. In particular, what they prove, which I think is really striking, we have that TRRM We have that TRRM is the limit, limit of the Goodwill tower will be tower of K cyclic R plus coefficient in M. So, and the limit of the goodwill tower in M. So, what you do is you somehow consider M as a variable. Is you somehow consider m as a variable, and then you can first take the excisive approximation, and that is by the theorem of Bjorn and McCarthy, actually th and Lindstross-McCarthy do more. They prove actually the n excisive approximation is basically the version of TRN down here for the truncation set 1 through n. So, in particular, this T R is just the limit of the Goodwilly tower into the n variable. Okay, that's one. Two is that T R. is that TR RM has a trace property. Trace property. And actually more, it's kind of a trace theory, it's a sort of Cartier module, it's a sort of relative relative topological Cartier module. For those of you who know what that means. So that means in particular that I have a map Means in particular that I have a map of this sort, and I have a Fashibo map from the homotopy orbits, and the composite is the norm, and so on and so forth. So it has a bunch of algebraic structures, and that is kind of the algebraic structure, which on pi naught gave us the structure on widwackers that we talked about before. This is actually the kind of logic I went through. I sort of first proved this the result, and then I sort of stared at the algebraic structure, and then we tried to mimic that like an algebra. Okay, so. Algebra. Okay, so and in fact actually I should say maybe you can I mean more generally this works for T R of a stable infinity category and then a functor where f is a functor from C to in C. That's maybe the correct generality in which you want to look at T R of R with coefficients. Maybe not just for ring spectra, I mean it's bimodulous. And the third part of the result is the following. Third part of Red is that the cyclotomic trace. I mean, this maybe probably formally also follows from this because it's a limit of the Goodwilly towers in particular. I have a map from this guy, but somehow I wouldn't say the trace, the glotomic trace refines to a map from K cyclic RM. Rm into TR. And this is basically also how the phrase is actually constructed in the book by Bjorn Dunuswood, Willie McCarthy. Right, so we find such a map and say compatible with all the structure. With all the structure. And that is somehow, of course, then the pi-naught version of that map is our characteristic polynomial. Okay, I think that is what I wanted to say. Thank you very much. Tony, you have m is equal to r, I guess you say tr, but do you have any kind of bounded below assumption for it to be equivalent to the cash flow tier? Well, I guess Well, I guess um yes, so I guess somehow for this comparison I definitely assume bounded below. Yes, so I guess you're right, we don't expect this to be somehow exactly the classical T R unless R is bounded below. Yes, maybe I should say, yeah, equivalent if R is bounded below. And in fact, actually need some, I mean I think actually there are some parts in the paper where one needs a little bit, some Needs a little bit, some assumptions on R for everything to be homotopically well behaved. Anyhow. Can you say a little bit about how you compute this pi naught? Is the thing that you said? Like, I know that if you just zoomed in and tried to compute pi naught of some norms, then like for F2, there's two Z mod twos that glue together to Z mod 4. That's not so obvious to see. Right. But do you do some universal case? And how do you do that? Universal case, and like how do you yeah, I guess somehow you you basically, I mean, the key key is to produce a map, like always, and somehow once you have a map, like everything else, like the filtration quotients, like this TR obviously has a button, has like filtrations which looks like r, m to the 10 blah blah. And so somehow, reduce the map, as you say, you adhere to the universal case. And then I guess you somehow, one way to do it is then to sort of look, I mean, observe that. Then to sort of look, I mean, observe that in this case the ghost components are basically injective. It's kind of always the story, somehow, in a sense, you know, bit vectors are most useful for characteristic peerings. At the moment, you want to prove something about the bit, it's easiest to go to characteristic zero. And that's also what you do here. So I think it's uh yeah, I I think it's kind of fun that it sort of resolves all the extension problems in these norms. Problems in these norms, which were initially not so obvious how to do, I agree. In general? Well, I mean, now you get a state of function as an element in the middle of the case. Yeah. I yeah, I don't I mean I I would personally rather look at cyclic K theory than T R R M because you want some some somewhat of an uncompleted version. And I have thought about that but I haven't like come to reasonably I mean yeah I'm meeting like once a week with Christopher and we chat about that but we haven't come to a conclusive definition at the moment. Yeah if R is smooth or very P or something like that, like can you compare with the the rounded coefficients? Ah it's a I mean I haven't tried, it's a very good suggestion. I guess yeah, I mean it sounds really good, but I haven't tried what it would be consonant structure I mean I mean I don't really actually know the round bit with coefficients so well. Coefficients, so we'll have a small what kind of extra structure does it? You would need some kind of twistable structure on the M. So that's the generality in which the ROM would with this coefficients is done? That's vague. Yeah, I don't I d I haven't really thought about that. I mean I have thought about it quite a bit about I mean in the case where M is R of course and R is not necessarily correct. Yeah. So you need you need an extra structure on M so that you can find the draw-bit something. So that you can find the drawing bit complex displacion. Is that how it works? It needs to be a crystal. It has to be. Oh, you need a connection. So you like the colour. I still want to define it. And this is kind of what I call categories. So the objects are kind of, I mean, the objects are like sort of table infinity categories arranged on circles. One equality is. And there are three types of maps. One map is you just put two circles, you have with blacks, like you have somehow the same shape, C1 through C5, C1 prime through C5, and then like an airplane. Then you have like some maps which compress the two edges together. Like a condition of functors in that case. Then you have the map concerning identity, then you have the rotation. And you have a rotation. So it's actually a sort of Cartesian vibration over the last year, they have to put pictures. If you're looking at functors, you're going to have seen this. Sure, I'm sure. That's basically what I suggest this kind of. And the point is, somehow the point is, that's the thing. It's a trace property if and only if these contraction maps are actually equivalent. So what happens is somehow you have this THH R M ten to Sn. This is then isomorphic to another term which you write THH R M S N. And this obviously in the category has an action. Obviously, in the category, it has an action by sort of C2 in this case, and then somehow it's also isomorphic. Another way of saying that all the Cartesian edges up here is something. So is there a name to improve this where you do a chat core side version first and you have like so you think about it? I mean I think that should something like that should be true in every like infinity category where you look have trace. Infinity category where you look have traces. Like when I mean, you know, like whenever you have a sort of ambient infinity two category monoidal. So that's comfortable. And then you can look at traces. Traces of objects from a geological object itself. And that's got gonna be an endomorphism of the identity. And somehow this trace again will have some property of the sort. And it's always going to extend over such a dimension. It's kind of going to be another approach that I'm going to use. Dimension has a considerable cyclic object which is constant. I guess Jacob Brooks is using the co-force of my process. Okay, so this is this is like a startup constant. I guess like in the nine they do like that the air intertrusk at two categories. Yeah, I can't really comment beyond that because it just okay anyway, that's what I'm saying. This is what differentials creates. Yeah, and it's fun you can sort of set up the theory of THH motives. Really such a cyclic diagram. Every such THH motive will just be equivalent to H models will just be equivalent to like, I guess, single, like, sort of C and F. So you can just compose all of those together, all of those together. But you can do it at every spot. Like this THH modifies, it comes with one, and some of this and the model and any of the others. Even though in the category of THH modifies everything is equivalent to a static identity category and a biomodule, it's useful to introduce this risk if you want to talk about this kind of action. If you want to talk about these kind of actions and all the kind of inverse properties and tracks. I mean, I've actually written that like three years ago. It's a 48-page document. I wanted to work through it now that we have this paper and stuff. Just like that. I just wanted to make sure I understand. So if I started with an ordinary usual cyclotomic spectrum, it might Usual cyclotomic spectrum. If I formed this cyclotomic spectra, I would get T C, but I could get T R and all the other ones by doing these. Okay, so all the different T whatever is co-representable in the other. I mean, actually, I mean, the T R is also co-representable in the psychatomic spectrum. But the T R in so not co-representable. T R is representable in cyclatomic spectrum.
