For giving me the opportunity to speak and also for organizing the conference. So, today I want to talk to you about a joint project with Seung Kim Khan, Abhishek Malik, Jung Hwan Park, and Matthew Stauffergan. And the title of the project is The 2-1 Cable of the Figure 8 Knot is Not Slice. Okay? So, here is a knot. It is the 2-1 cable of the Figure 8 knot. And what is one of the basic things you can ask? Well, of course, you can ask is this slice. This slice. So I think the first instance written of this question is due to Kellucci in 1980, and he asked, Is the two uncable to the figure eight not slice? He did not specify the category of sliceness, whether topologically or smoothly slice. Today I will talk about whether it is smoothly slice. So everything I say today will be in the smooth category. Topological category question remains open. So the answer to this question is no. Statement of theorem. Okay? Statement of theorem, exactly as it is in the title of the talk. Very good. Alright, so I want to talk to you a little bit first about why this is an interesting, perhaps difficult question, and then I want to talk to you about the method by which we establish the answer, because I think it is a sort of a new method for establishing non-sliceness, which is a little bit interesting. Okay? So, first, let me talk to you about why this particular knot amongst This particular knot amongst all of the knots in the world. You might care whether or not it is slice. I think a lot of the more modern motivation for this question comes from a theorem of Miyazaki, which was proven somewhat later than the original question of Kauchi, which is the following. So if K in S3 is any fibered negative anthrochiral lot with irreducible Alexander polynomial, then if I take a certain K. Then, if I take certain cables of K, even cables, two n, cables, then these knots are not ribbon. Actually, he showed that they're not homotopy ribbon. So, to be entirely honest, I'm not an expert in this theorem. I think there are several people in the audience who could easily tell you the ideas that went into the proof of this theorem. But for us, it will just be sort of a a a box. Okay, so if I have this k here, certain k's, and I take their two n, one tables, then magically these are not ribbon. Then magically, these are not written. And of course, the figure eight is the simplest example of such a k. So I've written some sequence of k's here, the smallest couple of k's, satisfying the hypothesis of Miyazaki's theorem on the board. And in case you have forgotten the deference symmetries of your knots, negative antichiral means the knot is isotopic to the reverse of its mirror image. So here are just some knots which are known not to be written. So of course, why is this interesting? Well, the next thing I'm going to tell you is. Well, the next thing I'm going to tell you is that somehow these cables have some approximation to being slice. And so the first thing let me say is that these knots, these Miyazaki knots, these cables of these Miyazaki knots are strongly rationally sliced. I'll clarify what I mean by this in just a moment. And I think this was proven originally by Kaouuchi in 1980, maybe specifically for the 2-1 cable of a figure 8, and then these later authors extend. And then these later authors extended it to all of the knots mentioned in the statement of Niyazaki's theorem that I have right here. Okay? So these knots are not magically not ribbon, but at least they are rationally sliced. And now there's a prefix here, strongly, rationally slice, which is going to sound slightly technical, but actually is very important. And so I'm going to tell you what this strongly means in just a moment. So of course, rationally sliced means that you bound a smooth sliced disk into some Bound smooth slice disk into some rational homology ball. So, what does strongly rationally slice mean? So, if I have a knot in S3, then the complement of the knot, of course, has H1 is Z with integer coefficients. Now, if I have a slice disk in a rational homology ball, then the complement of the disk has rational homology Q. And so, of course, the integral homology of the complement of the disk, modular torsion, is just Z. Torsion is just Z. Now, you might think that the meridian of the disk necessarily generates H1 mod torsion. It turns out that this is not true. The first time I saw this, I thought it was not believable. But you can actually do an explicit example. So for example, the figure eight famously bounds a smooth sliced disk in some rational homology ball. You can actually explicitly write down a Kirby diagram with a disk complement, and the disk merge. The disk complements, and the disk meridian actually is twice the generator of this thing. So, in general, it does not generate H1 mod torsion. If the NOT admits a rational slice disk whose meridian does generate H1 mod torsion, it is called strongly slice. Strongly rationally slice. And so another way to say this, of course, is that this map here, this inclusion map, is an isomorphism. So why, and so they proved. And so, you know, so they prove that these knots, these cables here, are strongly rational slice. Why do I make such a big deal about it? Strong rational slice-ness implies algebraic slice-ness. Okay, so in particular, all of these two n-common tables that I mentioned to you before are algebraically slice. Let me point out to you that regular rational slice-eness does not imply algebraic sliceeness. The figure eight is rationally slice. The figure eight is rationally slice, okay? But the figure eight is not algebraically slice. In fact, the figure eight does not even satisfy the Fox-MÃ¼llner condition for the Alexander polynomial. So the figure eight is not slice by any means. So in some very real sense, taking the 2,1 cable of the figure eight made it more slice. The figure eight is clearly not slice, but the 2-1 cable of the figure eight is indeed algebraically slice. So somehow it became closer to being slice. Somehow it became closer to being slice. And this phenomenon persists for all of the things in Miyazaki's theorem, because you see here I have said that k has irreducible Alexandria polynomials, so k is not going to satisfy the flux normal condition. But indeed, what they proved is that these cables are strongly rationally slice and therefore algebraically slice. Of course, so why have I told you this? Well, of course, Of course, one could theoretically say that these are therefore potential counterexamples to the slice-ribbing convention, right? And in fact, prior to our work, I believe that no known example of any of these 2n1 cables, of these knots in Miyazaki's theorem, the slice-ness has been determined one way or the other. Although, admittedly, the 21 cable of the figure eight is the most prominent example, so perhaps nobody focused on any other nod than that particular example. In that particular example. Okay, so you have these knots, which are, you know, not ribbon, but quote-unquote maybe sliced. At least they're algebraically sliced. So of course you can't use any algebraic slicing techniques to prove that they're not slice. Okay, so what about other ways of disproving that a lot is not slice? Okay, so what about quote-unquote more modern invariance, invariance coming from floor homology or Cavanov homology, et cetera? So the discussion here is actually rather similar to a discussion that we Rather similar to a discussion that we heard before in a previous talk. Well, the usual knot-floor homology invariants of such a knot are going to vanish. Because a lot of the knot-floor kit actually is a rational concordance invariant. So this Greek lettering of cow, epsilon, epsilon, et cetera, et cetera, all of these are going to fail. Now, there are, in principle, certain not-floor invariants which can Certain not floor invariants which can distinguish between sliceness and rational sliceness. One of these is involutive not floorhomology, which actually we already heard in a previous talk. And in the case of involutive not phlohemology, there's a recent paper by Hlam King, Clark, and Staffergan where they showed that you can use this involutive not floorhemology, whatever it is, to study odd cables of the figure eight. Okay, odd cable, 2n plus 1, 1 cables of the figure 8. And they used involved not flow homology to prove these knots are not slots. In fact, they proved these knots are linearly independent. However, they also showed that you cannot use involved, you know, the involved knot floor homology of the even cables is trivial in the sense that you cannot use it to obstruct them being slice. So this sort of like this fancier version of This fancier version of floor homology fails. And also, of course, you can ask about Covano homology. And it turns out that the S invariant from Covana homology for the 2,1 table of the figure eight is 0. Okay, so you cannot directly apply any of your favorite, floor-theoretic cobogative invariants to conclude that this knot is not slice. Alright, so how are we going to prove that this is not slice? Well, Not slice. Well, so here's another way to prove that a knot is not slice. So if you have any knot, then you can form the double branch cover of the knot. And the double branch cover is a Z mod 2 Z homology sphere. And if the knot is sliced, smoothly sliced, let's say in B4, then you can form the branch cover of the disk. And the branch cover of the disk is a Z Matu Z homology ball. Z Matt Tusi homology ball, whose boundary is, of course, the aforementioned Z Matthewsi homology sphere. So if I have a knot which I want to show is not sliced, then of course it would suffice to understand the double Baron's cover and show that it bounds no such Z mod to Z homology ball. And so of course if you want, you can formalize this in saying that there is a homomorphism, the double branch cover homomorphism, that goes from the smooth concordance group to the Cobordance group to the homology cabordism group of Z mod 2Z homology spheres. Okay, so I think people know what this is, but let me just write the definition here. So what is the Z mod 2Z homology cabordism group? Well, you take the set of Z mod 2Z homology spheres, oriented, smooth, and you quotient out by the relation of Z mod 2Z homology capordism. You identify two homology spheres if they are homology comport in Z mod 2Z. And this is a group, okay? This is a group, okay? And well, what is so good about doing this? Well, here, if you are not familiar with the history of the homology-cobordism group, then you sort of just have to take it on faith. But the study of the homology-cobortism group is a very, very old application of a great deal of extremely heavy machinery dating back to the inception of smooth four-manifold topology. Okay, so the homology Cabortizing group has. The homology Kabortism group has been studied all the way back from Morclian's invariant to Donaldson's theorem, Yang-Mills theory, any of your fancy named floor homologies of today, instantaneous floor homology, monopole floor homology, cyber wing floor homology, haveric floor homology, all of these things have been applied to study the homology cobordism group. In fact, it's almost a cottage industry. If you have a new floor homology, then you should ask yourself, what can you say about the homology cobordism group? So a large number of invariants have been developed. Variants have been developed to study this object. So let me just give you an example. So this is certainly, taking the double branch cover, certainly not a new idea by any means. This is a very, very decades-old idea, even outside of floor theory, you know, very, very classical idea. So, I mean, let me just give you an example of what I'm trying to say here. So you may know that there is this invariant called the D-invariant from Hagar floor homology, which is an invariant of homology Kaborism. Which is an invariant of homology cobordism. So, in fact, as soon as I hand you the D invariant, then you say, ah, well, I can take the double branch cover of a knot and then just slap on the d invariant and call it a new invariant. And in fact, this is what Menelescu-Owens did in 2005. So then you get a new knot invariant, a concordance invariant called the delta invariant, just by appending whatever homology concordance invariant you had to taking the double branch promotion. I'm just giving a, you know, this by no means is like the single or even most prominent example, but I give this an example. An example, but I give this an example of like, oh, if you know about homology comportism, then you just easily apply it to the comportance. Okay? Now, unfortunately, the double branch cover of the 21 cable of the figure eight, in fact, does bound the homology ball. In fact, it bounds in contractible manifolds. I will demonstrate this fact in just a moment. However, what that means is this strategy is going to fail, because already, when I take the double branch cover of the 2R table of the figure 8, that is 0. The figure eight, that is zero in this homology comparison group. Okay, so what can you do? Alright, so what can you do? So now we come to the point. Alright, so the idea behind the strategy that we are going to employ is that the previous question, taking the double branch cover Double branch cover was not quite the right. We should affect a slight refinement of the strategy, which is that, of course, when I had the knot and I took the double branch cover, I got this homology ball. But the homology ball came with some more data. It came with the data of the fact that I obtained it by taking the double branch cover. That is to say, the homology ball has a symmetry on it coming from the branching involution. So, well, So, well, of course, so for any knot, okay, so for any knot, when you take the double branch cover, you record the data of the branching involution. Okay, now, and of course, if the knot is sliced with slice disk D, then the double branch cover of D, which was my homology ball, also has an involution, which is given by the branching involution over the disk, obviously. And of course, the branching involution over the disk restricts to the branching involution of the nod on the boundary of the Delmars boundary. Okay, so I should have asked the previous. I should have asked the previous question in the equivariant category. Instead of just asking whether the double-branched cover bounded a homology ball, I should have asked whether it equivariantly bound a homology ball. Okay? Is this clear to everybody? Okay. I apologize for... I think I'm repeating myself, but it is Thursday afternoon. So when I listen to talks, sometimes I like phase in and out. So I think it is good to repeat things multiple times. Okay, so just for philosophy. Just sort of philosophically, asking if it equivarially bounds on college law just sounds like you're not actually doing anything different than the original problem, if you know what I mean. Because I mean, ask me if it's because you could quotient by the involution on the homology ball and go back to the involution has a large fixed point locus, so I'm not sure that you can. Oh, it's not the obvious. Oh, it's not the obvious. Well, it's the branching evolution over the disk. So this is the case for this. So it's a fair comment to say that this question does not sound any easier than the questions that I have said, but I will endeavor to explain to you why it is, in fact, an easier question. So of course, of course, let me just throw more formulas in at you. So of course, just like in the previous case, I said that you have a homomorphism from the smooth. I said that you have a homomorphism from the smooth concordance group to the homology cobordism group. Well, actually, what I just said is that that homomorphism threw away some information. That homomorphism should factor through some equivariant object. So there's some equivariant object here, which is somehow the equivariant homology cabordism group. And the double branch cover involution, if I remember the involution, factors through this intermediate object. And it is possible that Possible that I could have a knot which is zero if I go all the way and forget about the involution, but the class somehow in this equivalent homology comportes and group is non-zero. It's a more refining variance. Okay, so once again, let me just say the definition, even though I think everybody knows what the definition should be. So the homology cobordism group of involutions, well, okay, so now I just have homology spheres, but each homology sphere is equipped with a symmetry, an involution, and oops. And the relation is, of course, two such pairs are said to be the same if there is an equivariant homology comportism between them. Because antiviruses are sad. Okay. Now, let me say a few words about this also, actually. So this is actually, if one is paying very close attention, If one is paying very close attention, there are several interesting things about this definition. One of which is that you might actually ask me what is the group structure on this group. It is actually not obvious that you can form the equivariant connected sum. And indeed, if I don't put certain restrictions on this involution, it turns out that you cannot form the equivalent connected sum. So the actual definition of this group is a little bit more complicated, but it is not really important. Important. Obviously, in this context, what we care about is whether or not you bound an equivariant homology ball. So we are not going to go into the definition. Another interesting thing, so this was sort of first formally introduced by myself and some co-authors. And we actually, so you can actually alter this definition slightly by asking that when I look at the four manifold, instead of having an involution on the four manifold, I scrap the requirement that it's an involution. I scrap the requirement that it's an involution. I require it to be a diffeomorphism. So then I would be asking: I have a homology sphere, maybe a Z mod TZ homology sphere with involution, and I ask whether it bounds a homology ball with a self-diffeomorphism restricting to the given involution of the boundary. And if you know a little bit about the work of Lynn Ruberman and Sevelyev, this is actually their notion of a strong cork. So actually, we actually, this particular project where we introduced this three-dimensional object, This three-dimensional object, we were sort of interested in studying quark theory and detecting quarks. Okay, but I'm not going to say very much about it. But anyway, so there's this equivariant comportism group. The button seems to have died. Or tiny one though. Alright, alright, so fine. So the strategy is, of course, going to be understand the image of the 21 cable. Understand the image of the 2-1 cable of the figure 8 inside this equivalent Capordism group and somehow prove to you that it is non-zero in this equivalent Capordism group. Before I do this, let us just talk a little bit about the double branch cover of the two uncabled figurines. Is this a tractable object for us to understand? The answer is yes, and the reason the answer is yes is because of the following great fact. So the great fact is that the double branch cover of the 2-1 cable of the figure 8 is The 21 cable of the figure eight is homeomorphic to plus one surgery on, actually this holds for any not K, plus one surgery on K sum K reverse. I will draw this in just a moment. And moreover, the branching symmetry on this three-manifold is identifiable in the surgery diagram. Okay, so I will draw it for you. Here is the figure eight. Okay, I want to be very careful about the figure eight. Very careful about the figure eight sum of the figure eight reverse. Okay, and why I'm being careful about it will be clear in just a moment. So I draw the figure eight, okay, and then I draw a vertical axis next to the figure eight, and I take the figure eight, and I rotate it 180 degrees around the vertical axis, okay? And I do this, which of course is still the figure eight, okay? And then I sum these together in the obvious way in which the band crosses the axis. Okay, but note that when I did that, in the rotated copy of the figure eight, I would have. And the rotated copy of the figure eight, I would have to reverse orientation before I'm disconnected. Some this is why I write k, some k reverse. Okay? And so this knot is, of course, a symmetric knot. It's a strongly invertible knot. We heard a little bit about strong inversions on knots already in the previous talk. And well, it is perhaps not very hard to believe that if I have a strongly invertible knot, then if I do surgery on the knot, then the surgery 3-manifold will inherit asymmetry. Okay, so my claim to you is that with double branch cover, Is that the double branch cover of K21 is plus one surgery on this thing, and the symmetry is the symmetry of this diagram. Okay? So, you know, okay, so, you know, first up, I should attribute, you know, I mean, I don't know the original attribution of this kind of thing. I mean, of course, people study how to draw, you know, surgery descriptions of branch covers of knots, you know, much more, you know, much more general than the situation. You know, I've seen this attributed to Actal. You know, I've seen this attributed to actiludent curves, so this will be the attribution that I give here. All right, so fine. Okay, so I claim to you that there's some explicit geometric understanding of the double range problem of k, of 21k both k. However, in the particular example of the figure eight, what does this tell you? Okay, this tells you, this tells you something which should make you sad, because here, of course, the figure eight is completely symmetric. I mean, it is isotopic to its mirror, it's reverse, it's blah, blah, blah. It's reverse, it's blah blah blah. So this knot here, k sum k reverse, if k is the figure eight, is a slice knot. Okay? And whenever you have a slice knot and you do plus one surgery, or in fact any one over n surgery in the knot, then actually you can basically do the surgery along the slice disk. And you conclude that the surgery bounds a homology ball, in fact a contractible manifold. So the fact that the double branch cover is identified with plus one surgery on this slice knot tells you that if I just ask my usual question about Ask my usual question about a homology ball, this is going to tell me nothing. Okay? Now, however, I want to point out something very important here, which is that this knot is a slice knot, but the sliced disk is not an equivariant sliced disk. And the reason you might be confused is because you might think like, oh, well, this is like k sub minus k. And if I think about how you usually draw the ribbon disc for k sub. You usually draw the ribbon disk for k sub minus k, then that ribbon disc sort of obviously looks very symmetric. Okay? But the picture I have drawn for you is not k sub minus k. It is k sub k reversed. Now, of course, it's isotopic to k sub minus k, but if I perform the isotopy, then the isotopy will only happen on one half of the diagram. So it will not be an equivariant operation. Okay? So this not is, well, firstly, one can actually prove that it is not equivariantly slice. I mean, we heard about equivariant sliceness in a previous talk. There are many, many ways to prove. This is in a previous talk. There are many, many ways to prove this non is not equivalently sliced. And you could take that as sort of, I don't know, like corroborating evidence that maybe this strategy is going to work. Of course, the application only goes one way. I mean, just because you prove a secondary slice does not mean you get any three manifold statements. But you could say you could take this as a hopeful sign. All right. So I thought that perhaps, so I think. That perhaps, so I think many people are probably familiar with this kind of thing. The fact that the double brands cover is this plus one surgery, but I thought that it would be nice to attempt to convince you that it is true. So this is like a little topological interlude. So, okay, let me just give a very brief explanation of why the double-bears cover is what I've said it is. So, here in the top left-hand corner, I have drawn for you a tubular neighborhood of Tubular neighborhoods of K7K reverse. There's no surgery, this is just a tubular neighborhood of K7K reverse sitting inside of S3. And I've drawn this obvious axis of rotation of S3. So now I want you to imagine taking this tubular neighborhood in S3 and quotienting by this axis of rotation. Now when I quotient S3 by the axis of rotation, I still get S3. And what will happen to this solid torus? Well, this is a solid torus. Taurus? Well, this is a solid torus, and the axis of rotation intersects the solid torus in these two arcs. So this is like the hyper-elliptic involution of the solid torus. Or whatever I want to quotient it, I will get a solid ball. Okay, so this is what I have drawn in the bottom left-hand corner. If you think a little bit about how you should draw the S3 after quotienting, then you can come up with this picture. The ball will look like this. And I have also drawn in the bottom left-hand picture. In the bottom left-hand picture, the branch locus. And notice that the branch locus intersects the ball on these two red arcs that I have colored red in this edge. So now, what does the Montesino's trick say? The Montesinos trick tells you that if I take this solid ball and I rip it out and I reglue it in downstairs, then this will correspond upstairs in the branch cover to ripping out the solid torus and regluing it in, i.e., performing surgery. Okay? So now in the bottom right-hand Okay, so now in the bottom right-hand picture, I have taken this solid ball and I have ripped it out and I have glued it back in. And I've glued it back in in such a way such that the two red arcs, which were the intersection of the branch locus with the solid ball, now become these two very complicated red arcs. Now, the reason I can do this is because this pair of complicated red arcs is in fact just another pair of boundary parallel arcs for the solid ball. The pair of red arcs, they just follow along this sort of figure A pattern with the single exception of this. The single exception of this half crossing here. Okay, so now you look at the bottom right-hand picture. On the one hand, the bottom right-hand picture, the branch locus has mysteriously, tautologically, turned into the 2-1 cable of the figure 8. No, of course it is, because I glued in the ball exactly that way. Of course, the branch locus here closes up the direction of the arts. So that's why this is the 2-1 cable of figure eight. And so that means upstairs this should correspond to some surgery on the solitaurus upstairs, and you think very hard and you conclude that the surgery coefficient is one. And you conclude that the circular coefficient is one. Okay? So, are there any questions? Okay, so now we have the strategy, and I have convinced you that there is, this is my phone, I have convinced you that there's some topological understanding of the branch cover, including the branching evolution. And so, how are we going to do it? Okay, so now I know that everybody jumps with joy. The moment you have all been waiting for the inevitable arrival of. Waiting for the inevitable arrival of the Hagar floor homology has occurred. So, how are we going to do it? Well, we are going to use Hagar floor homology. Okay, so I realize that many people in the audience know a lot of Hagar floor homology, but I also know that it is Thursday afternoon. And so I will attempt to be as non technical as possible, okay? Which means that if you know Hagar flow homology, you may be bored. And if you don't know Hagar floor homology, then you may still be bored, but hopefully it will at least still be understandable. Hopefully, it will at least still be unresolved. So, how to use Hagar floor homology? I claim that somehow we are going to use Hagarth floor homology, which remember, I already told you that is good at studying homology cobortism. So now you might be like, well, maybe Hagar floor homology is good at studying equivariant homology cobordism, and indeed this is the case. So let me describe to you how this is. But before I describe it to you, I have to describe to you why it is that Hagar floor homology is good at studying homology cobordism. But actually, before I do that, let me Actually, before I do that, let me give the proper attribution of this idea, of this using Hagar floor homology to study this equivariant the Bordism object. So, the first instance of this idea, I think, is due to Alfieri, King, and Stipschitz. And they sort of studied Montesino's knots and torus knots. And the reason that this came up, this sort of idea came up in the study of Montesino's knots and torus knots, is that, well, if you have a Montesino- Torus knots is that, well, if you have a Montecinos knot and you take the double branch cover, then it is a Brieschorn sphere. Now, often if you take a Taurus knot and you take the double branch cover, it is also a Briesman's sphere. And in fact, you can have a Montesinos knot and you can have a Taurus knot with the same Briescorn sphere, double branch cover, but the branching action on that Briesborg sphere will not be the same. And if you can prove that the branching actions are sufficiently different, i.e. up to equivariant homology comboism, then you will distinguish in a very complicated and In a very complicated and roundabout way, the Montesinos nodded and torso-known in cross-free. Okay, and so they had this idea, specifically Montesinos knots and torus knots. Specifically, I think they proved some linear independence results for the set of Montesinos knots, modulo the set of torus knots, or something like this. And then building on their work, myself and some collaborators sort of studied this ecovariant cabordism group sort of in general, not specifically in the context. Not specifically in the context of branch covers of knots. We were sort of, as I mentioned before, interested in sort of connections to the theory of quarks and things like that. And then the important thing which I want to talk about today is that the current paper, as in the title of the talk, relies on certain computational techniques and relations to this myself and some. That myself and some co-authors developed that relate sort of equivariant knots to this equivariant homology combordism objects. Okay, and I'll try to explain what this is. And I should say that you can study these symmetries on three manifolds via many other, you don't have to use Hagar floor homology, you can use many, many other fancy floor homologies. I would be a mess if I did not sort of at least mention several names that there are people active. Several names that you know, there are people actively working on this thing, okay? All right, so here come the definitions, okay? So, so Hagar floor homology. Well, what is Hagar floor homology? So, Hagar floor homology, you give me a three-manifold, and I hand you back the quote-unquote Hagar floor complex. And every time I say three-manifold, I will mean a three-manifold equipped with a Spin C structure. So you hand me Y, S, I hand you back the Hagard floor complex of Y, S. Okay, what is this? This is just a chain complex. Is just a chain complex. It's a graded chain complex. In our context, it will always be a Z-graded chain complex. And one thing that makes it a little bit different from just a chain complex is that it is actually, the chain complex is actually over this polynomial algebra, f adjoin u. So f is z mod 2z. But the point is that this chain complex comes with an action of a variable u. We can multiply things in the chain complex by u. Okay, so that's what Hagar phloemology gives you. And of course, as you probably know, Course, as you probably know, what is so good about three-manifold phlegmology is that it satisfies this quote-unquote TQ of T structure, which is that if I have a cobordism between two three manifolds, and once again, when I say cabordism, I always mean cabordism equipped with thin C structure, et cetera, et cetera. This cobordism will give you a map between the, it will give you a chain map between the Hagar floor complexes of your 2,3-manifolds. So, floor homology turns cobordisms into maps. Very good. Turns cabordisms into maps. Very good. Okay? So I'm sure that you are aware of this. And actually, I'm sure that many people are also aware of the next point, but I wish to emphasize it. The important thing about these maps is that they see rough topological properties of your cobordism. So, for example, I told you that these chain complexes have a grading. So you could ask, well, what is the grading shift associated to a cobordism map? And that grading shift depends on the algebraic topology. Shift depends on the algebraic topology of W. It depends on, for example, the Euler characteristic, and it depends on the signature of W. And it depends actually also on the first term class of the signature. So, fine. It sees the algebraic topology of W and it also sees one more very important thing, which is it sees whether or not W is negative definite. So, if W is negative definite, then the Kabor-Dism map, it is a theorem that the Kabor-Dism map associated to W satisfies a certain algebraic property. A certain algebraic property, which I learned to call the localization property. Now, what is the localization property? I shall write the definition on the board, but actually the definition is not very important. So a map between two chain complexes, which have this u multiplication, satisfies the localization condition. Well, what I do is I take the homology of the chain complexes and I do what is called localizing at u, which means I invert the variable u, and then I require. I invert the variable u, and then I require that the induced map of the induced map on this local isomology be an isomorphism. If you are familiar with Hager's flow homology, then you know that this condition is just saying that if I have a negative definite cobordism, then the cobordism map on HF infinity is an isomorphism. If you are not familiar with Hagar fluorhomology, it doesn't matter. I don't actually care whether or not you remember this definition. Again, with the, you know, continuing on in the spirit of repeating things multiple times. Repeating things multiple times. The point is really just that, you know, the Hagar floor homology translates topology into algebra. Okay, so if I have a cobordism between two manifolds, then the Hagar floor homology gives me a chain map between two chain complexes, and it translates the basic algebraic topology of my Kabordism into some algebraic properties of the induced matter, whatever they are, this localization models. So, of course, if I have a homology Kabordism, just If I have a homology cobordism, just to be a little bit more specific, if I have a homology cobordism between two homology spheres, this has trivial algebraic topology. So you would probably think that the associated grading shift is zero, and you are correct. And of course, a homology cobordism has trivial intersection form and therefore classifies, you know, it classifies as a negative definite cobordism. So if I have a homology cobordism between two, three manifolds, then I get all of the properties that I, I get this localization property, I get a rating shift zero. This localization property, I get a grading shift zero. In fact, I can turn the covortism around and get maps from one chain complex to the other and back. Okay? So, of course, if you give me two homology spheres and you want me to prove that they are not homology coordinate, then what do I do? I just calculate the Hager-Floor homologies, or Hager-Floor complexes, and I stare at the Hager-Floor complexes, and I ask myself, algebraically, can there possibly exist such a map? Such a map. And if for some magical reason I conclude that there cannot exist such a map, then of course I wash my hands and I'm done. Now, okay, so I realize it's very vague. Why is it so vague? It is because this is, I hesitate to call it a philosophy. This is more like what you just do with fluorohomology. This is like sort of built into the foundational facts about floor homology. But the point is that I don't. You know, but the point is that I don't, you know, this is not specific to this Hayer floor homology. Okay, you can replace Hayer floor homology with any other kind of invariant. You know, this idea is pervasive. If I have any other kind of invariant that satisfies this mantra of bordisms induce maps, and certain kinds of bordisms induce certain kinds of maps, then I can replace Hagar floor homology with not floor homology or Cavanaugh homology or instantane floor homology or blah blah blah blah blah. Okay, and I could also start trying. Okay, and I could also start trying to sort of enhance my four-theoretic invariant. I could try to make it more complicated. I could try to have sort of additional bells and whistles on it. In our context, what will happen is that we basically develop some version of Hagar's floor homology, which takes into account the symmetry on the three-manifolds. But I still apply the same idea that I should disprove cobordism via disproving the existence of certain. Disproving the existence of certain maps between algebraic objects. Okay? So again, let me just, you know, I know some people have, you know, are familiar with Harry Floydology, so let me just provide a sanity check here. So actually, you know, if you just take the definition that I wrote down previously, and you just look at these maps between the Hay or floor homologies, it turns out that whether or not you have these quote-unquote local maps between two complexes actually turns out to be a very important thing. Between two complexes actually turns out to be governed by a single integer. And what I mean by this is that actually, if you give me a Hagar floor complex, I can just write down a number. And if you give me two Hagar floor complexes, if the numbers are the same, then these maps exist. And if the numbers are different, the maps don't exist. And if you are familiar, this number is exactly the famous D-invariant on Ozvath and Zabo. This is why the D-invariant is a homology comparison invariant. So in this instance, you might be like, why in the world did I tell you all? You might be like, why in the world did I tell you all this complicated, abstract philosophy when I could have just told you that there's a d invariant and it's integer value and it's a homology comparison invariant. So in this case, this philosophy does not tell you anything interesting. I mean, it tells you the information contained in a single integer. But if I replace K-R flow homology with maybe some more complicated invariants, then whether or not these maps exist when I give you these two-chain complexes turns out to be much, much more complicated. Turns out to be a much, much more complicated question. And so I say this because I should give the correct attribution that the first person to sort of use this philosophy sort of in a sort of very non-trivial manner was Matt Stoffergan in 2015, who applied this in the setting of quote-unquote Pintu Equifai at Cyberbootflow Hormology. All right. So, it's okay, fine. So, I will impose upon your patience a little bit longer. It seems that I have not said anything related to our. Related to our nice symmetries on three manifolds. But I do need to say one more thing, which is the appearance of involved Hager for homology. And partly because we will use this, and partly because what I'm about to tell you about how we study the ecovaric homology cabortism group is very much inspired by certain work by other authors. Okay? So, what is this involuntary Hagar fluorohomology object? Okay? So, in Okay, so in 2015, Hendrix and Menelasku showed that they basically showed that Hagar floor homology, you should think about it as having an inherent symmetry. They basically showed Hagard floor homology as an equivariant object. In the sense that actually every time you compute the Hagar floor complex, it turns out that the Hagar floor complex comes with an automorphism. It turns out you can always define an automorphism on the Hagard floor complex. Automorphism on the Hagar IV complex. Actually, it turns out that you can define a homotopy involution on the Hagar IV complex. Okay, so again, I realize I'm repeating myself, but it's Thursday afternoon. So you should imagine that somehow the Hagar floor complex magically has been discovered to have this additional symmetry. And of course, they proved that if I have, let us say, let's say a cobordism, let's just, for instance, we say, a homology cobordism between two homology spheres, then the associated Then the associated map in Hagar floor homology is an equivariant map. So somehow I have these two Hagar floor complexes, and all of a sudden I know that actually they're sort of symmetric objects. And whenever I have a homology cobordism between two three manifolds, the map that I get from the output of floor homology is a symmetric map with respect to this symmetry. So what that means is that why would you ask me, prove the Why would you ask me to prove these two homology spheres are not homology coordinates? I should look for the existence of an equivariant map rather than just a map between the Hager floor complexes satisfying all the properties that I wrote down before. There's some additional symmetry property of the Kabordism map, which I know the Kabordism map has to satisfy. So this might, theoretically, I could be in a situation. I could be in a situation in which a non-equivariant map exists, but an equivariant map does not. And if I somehow knew that an equivariant map does not, then I would conclude that the two, three manifolds are not homolog. So this idea was used by many authors to successfully study the homology Caportism group. I've just listed some of them here. This is not particularly relevant for this talk. However, but the point is. However, but the point is that understanding these chain complexes with these symmetries is now also sort of a fairly well-developed thing. All right, fine. So now I will attempt to get to the point. I realize I'm boring everybody. All right, fine. Okay, so now what setting are we in? So we are in the setting of these three manifolds equipped with involutions. Okay, so if you are very familiar with Okay, so if you are very familiar with the work on the previous slide, then actually now there's a very obvious thing which you should do, which is you should say, well, if I have a three-manifold and the manifold has an automorphism, then surely this tells me that the Hagard floor homology admits an additional symmetry coming from the symmetry of the three manifold. Okay? So we show this. So we show that if you have a manifold Y with an involution, then that involution induces an involution of the Hager flow chain compounds. An involution of the Hager flow chain compounds. And of course, if you have now an equivariant homology between two equivariant three manifolds, then the cobordism map induced in floor homology will, of course, be equivariant with respect to this new symmetry on the Hagar fluoro. Okay? Okay, very good. So of course, you know, then, you know, so what's happening here is we just keep imposing more and more conditions on the algebraic maps. On the algebraic maps. So, first, I said it satisfies this grading shift and localization, this localization condition, and if I do that, then I get sort of the D-invariant. And then I said, well, actually, Hendrix and Manelescu show that a Hagar floor complex is an internally symmetric object. It has this inherent symmetry. And I said, well, okay, so now when we search for maps, we should search for maps which are equivariant with respect to this internal symmetry. And now I say, well, actually, now we're in the context of three manifolds with involution, with external. Manifolds with involution, with external symmetries. So can I say, well, the external symmetry should be reflected in another symmetry of the Hager-Flo complex. Okay, and equivariant cobordisms should induce equivariant maps. So now I have to require my, in my search for these maps, I have to require them to be equivariant with respect to these signatures. Okay? All right. So, okay. Maybe I will not leave the slide, actually. But, you know, so, you know, so again, what is the strategy? Again, what is the strategy? So, the strategy is now you hand me this NOT K, in this case the 21k will figure 8. I take the double branch cover, okay, there's a three-manifold. I compute its Hayard floor homology, I compute this mysterious Hendrix-Manelescu internal symmetry, I compute this external symmetry induced by the Bradley pollution. I calculate all of these things, and then I just ask myself algebraically: is there a map from the complex of S3, which you might imagine is very trivial, into this? You might imagine is very trivial into this K dark floor complex with all of its symmetries. And that the map has to be, it has to be equivariant with respect to all of these symmetries and it has to have all of the properties that I said before. Now, there is a very, very actually large now literature on how to answer this question. It's not really obvious if I just give you two such chain complexes to tell whether or not such maps exist. But in any particular example, In any particular example, you can just check it by hand. So these chain complexes are finite-dimensional in the grading you care about, and they're over a finite field. You can literally just go down and check what are all the possible maps. Are there any that satisfy the requisite conditions? So I'm not going to talk about any fancy way of proving or disproving the existence of such maps. I mean, you can just do it. Fine. Okay, so that's actually it. That's the whole proof. The whole proof. But of course, how do you actually, what is the hard part of the proof? So the hard part is, of course, you have to calculate the symmetry actions that I said before. If you don't know Hagar floor homology, and even if you do know Hagar floor homology, then you might think, well, calculating Hagar floor homology of three manifolds is not always such a trivial task. And calculating the induced action of a symmetry is a task which is more non-trivial still. Task which is more non-trivial still. Okay, so it's actually quite difficult in general to calculate the actions of these symmetries. But what is the point? Well, the point is that I have given you, what is the topological mode of the input? Well, the point is I have given you this excellent picture of the double branch cover of the 21 cable figure 8, which is surgery on this knot. The knot is very simple. The surgery is plus one surgery. The symmetry is right there in the picture. So you might say, well, okay, fine. So surely, given this explicit description, can you calculate? Description: Can you calculate for me the Hagar floor homology of the resulting free mantle? Okay, and the answer is yes. Okay, so here is a basic floor theoretic principle, which I think many people are familiar with, which is the surgery formula. What is the surgery? What is the principle of the surgery formula? So, the principle of the surgery formula is that there is this, associated to knots, there is this mystical knot-floor homology object. And if you tell me the knot-floor homology of a knot, then I can tell you the Hagar floor homology of any surgery on the knot. Hagard floor homology of any surgery on the knot. Okay? Now, why is this better? You know, you might think, okay, but then how do you know what the not-floor homology of the knot is? Well, it so happens that the not-floor homology of the knot is very often combinatorially determined. Okay? So, what I just said. So, you have the original surgery formula, which was established by Ozvath and Zabo in their original papers. I've written the surgery formula down. If you know what it is, then you know what it is. If you don't know what it is, then it's not important. If you don't know what it is, then it's not important. It's just what I said. You can algorithmically compute the Hagar floor homology of surgery and a knot from the knot floor homology of the knot. Okay? So fine. So, you know, now, remember, the knot in question is the figure eight sum, the figure eight reverse, which hopefully we all agree is like a reasonably simple knot. Okay, so I can calculate the Higger floor homology plus one square. Okay, fine. So now what? Okay, well, uh remember I have to calculate all these other things. Okay. Well, the the idea of the syrugy formula is very ubiquitous. Formula is very ubiquitous. Every time you have something about a three-manifold, you should just ask yourself: does it have a corresponding NOT version? And if I know the corresponding NOT version, then do I know the three-manifold version of a surgery formula? And the answer is yes. So there's an invaluative Hager floor surgery formula, which says that if I know the, there's something called the invaluative knot floor homology map, and if I know this map on the knot complex, then I can calculate for you this internal symmetry of the three-manifold Hagar floor homology of any sort. Of the three-manifold Hagarford homology of any sort. Okay? And so, of course, if you know these two results, then again, the idea is very obvious, is that, well, suppose now I have a symmetric knot. So we show that if you have a symmetric knot, in particular a strongly invertible knot, then that strong inversion of the knot induces a symmetry of the knot-floor homology. And if I know the symmetry on the knot-floor, If I know the symmetry on the not floor homology, then I can calculate the symmetry action on any surgery manifold. That's not 100% true. It turns out we only have a theorem for large surgeries, but I'm going to put that aside. So this is just literally the philosophy of the survey formula in every single instance of Hagar's line work. Okay? Alright, so again, so here is, so okay, fine. So now I bumped the question all the way down to looking at this knot and do I understand And do I understand the floor homology of this knot? Okay, fine. So, alright, so do I understand the floor homology? If it's not, well, okay, so first of all, it is known that if you have a knot, or it's known that not-floor homology tensor products under connected cells. So, if I take that, if I know the not-flow homology of K1 and K2, then I know the not-flow homology of K1 and connected cell K2. Okay? And so here, this is just the figure eight and another copy of the figure eight. And the figure eight is very simple. So we know the not flow homology figure. And the figurative is very simple. So we know the not-for-order multifig, so we know the not-for-multi state. And again, there's also an invalidative not-floor connected sum formula, which says that if I know, if I have a connected sum and I know the invalidative not for maps for each of the summands, then I know the invalidative not-floor map for the connected sum. And this theorem is due to zumke. And once again, it turns out the figure eight is sufficiently simple, like the, you know, you know what the invalidative not form map is. Okay, so using these two theorems, These two theorems, I know what the knot-floor homology of this is, and I know this mysterious internal knot-floor symmetry. And the last thing to do is, of course, calculating what I told you is that there's a symmetry of this not homology, induced by the fact that this knot is strongly invertible. But it turns out that, well, what we prove is that this is not actually very hard, because if you look at this knot, if you look at this knot, well, there are two summands to this knot. The two semants, this not, an Austrian version basically interchanges the two semands. So, wouldn't it be nice if basically the induced action on the not basically interchange these two factors of the tensor properties? And that's the influence. Turns out that that's not 100% true, but morally, this is the basis for performing this calculation. So, we perform an explicit calculation where we calculate the induced action of such a symmetry on the not-floor complex. What happens is that there's this task. Is that there's this tau exchange? I'll just say a couple of tenure points. So, this tau exchange is something, it's sort of the obvious thing which interchanges two copies of the tensor product. It turns out that's not exactly what the action of tau is. There's some weird prefactor which comes in for some technical reasons that I'm not going to get into. But actually, so that's it. So, let me take a few extra minutes just to wrap up. So, that's the whole thing. That's the whole thing. I mean, you just perform this calculation, you pass to the double grins, you understand the double grins cover, you prove that it doesn't bound an equilateral homology ball, and then you're happy. Okay, all right, so fine. So what other knots does this strategy apply to? So let me let me just, so the theorem at the beginning was a special case of a more general theorem, which I suppressed because this theorem does not somehow sound nearly as good as the other theorem at the beginning of the talk. The beginning of the talk. So, okay, fine. So, can you extend this idea for establishing non-sliceness? What are some other examples? What are some other applications of this method for establishing non-sliceness? So, alright, so you can take the original statement that the two-way table of the figure eight is not slice and generalize it in a few different directions. So, here are some successful directions in which you managed to generalize it. So, first of all, you can, of course, ask for not other than the Ask for not other than the figure eight. Now, if you've sort of been following, then it sort of sounds like, well, you know, the figure eight, what I really cared about was some not floor homology of the figure eight. So indeed, if you have a knot which is in some ways sufficiently similar to the figure eight from the point of view of not floor homology, then indeed the same argument is going to apply to tell you that the two uncable of that knot is not slice. Okay? And so it turns out that the conditions under which that That the conditions under which that are true are this technical condition called floor thin with arsh invariant one. But the point is: okay, fine. So there are some other knots for which exactly the same argument holds. In particular, several of the knots in the list of Miyazaki's theorem, the first few of them, actually indeed hold. The first example in which it doesn't hold is the knot 1017, which is our invariance here. The other direction you could attempt to generalize the theorem is that, well, you say instead of taking two, one cables, I can take all sorts of other cables. Can take all sorts of other patients. And let me explain why you might do this. So actually, so I should have said this at the very beginning of the talk. Actually, you can show that all the knots in Miyazaki's theorem, all the k's in Miyazaki's theorem are rationally sliced. Again, that's not, the k's are not strongly rationally sliced. The k's are rationally sliced, and their cables are strongly rationally sliced. But in particular, the k's are rationally sliced. The k's are rationally sliced. So, for example, you can just take the peak, you can actually take any pq capable of k, right? And this will be rationally concordant to the torus-naught tpq. So, if you subtract off the torus-not tpq, I will get a rational slice knot. And in fact, if one of these two parameters is even, it turns out that this thing is strongly rationally slice and this algebraically slice. Okay, and in fact, in Miyazaki's theorem, he shows that these knots also are not homotopy-ribbed. Okay, so again, I have some collection of algebraically slice knots, but I'm not. Some collection of algebraically sliced knots, but not Ruben knots. So this is not an unreasonable family to consider. We are able to show that specifically for 2K cables, K sub 2K, connected some appropriate minus torus knot, this is not slice, not smoothly sliced. The reason that we can do this is, of course, the question of, do you understand the double-branched cover in the symmetry on it? And the answer is in the And the answer is in this case yes, because in fact the two very similar to the sort of previous thing is the 2k cable of k, the double garage cover is k survey and k sum k reverse. So you can see that some very similar calculation will apply for these kinds of mouths as well. Okay, I think I have run rather over time. So are there any questions? Yes? Someone asked, what do you keep doing to one theory? That's a great question. We cannot, I don't think we can handle it. We can't handle that. As far as I know, I think Miyazaki's theorem, in fact, still applies. So I think you actually know that it's not ribbon. I think you also know that it's algebraically sliced. Our invariant will vanish if you do the iterated to uncode. Does it does it say anything about doing shapes on? Um I have no idea. Um I'm not sure. Um anyway. Um maybe I should say not necessarily to I okay, so we actually proved that it's not forgiven in the in the concordance rule here. But again. Concordance problem there. But again, it would have diminished the initial statement of the theorem. So, other questions? Yes? Does it seem like you always need both evolutions to that's a great question, yes? So you could ask, oops, you could ask, in this strategy here, I took into account both the external and the internal symmetry on HR flow homology. You could, of course, only take into account the external information. It turns out that in this case, in this case, It turns out that in this particular instance, if you do that, then the invariant will vanish. That is to say, there is a map that is equivariant with respect to the external involution, and there is a map that is equivariant with respect to the internal involution. But there is no map which is simultaneously equivariant with respect to it. It's actually quite a strange model. Other questions? Um what do we think I'm going to kill? So we have a surprise last four minute talk. Some of us were interested in seeing the last slide of Tata Ki's talk, which was questions that didn't get discussed earlier. So if you want to stick around, we're going to have five minutes. Ask Tada NP to just show us. Ask Patty and Pete to just show us the okay with that. Yeah. Yeah. Just show us your last questions. Well we had a similar we have a similar question to your problem A for the scanning operations as well. Scanning operations as well. I would like to thank the organizers for giving me a chance to present our problems. I have some questions, problems that I would like to know. that uh I would like to know the answer and uh I I would like to know someone knows the answer or has some idea. So the first problem is that our graph class in graph class survives under the stabilization Uh it seems that ET doesn't s survive. I I I have no idea. Second problem is that our theta graph classes not put non-trivial elements in Yeah. The topological uh mapping glass group. This is true. They are corresponding degree, higher dimensions. So it seems that uh it is true, but uh I don't have a proof. You're statement that it's true in the higher dimension. Your statement that it's true in the higher positions, is that are you using Hatcher Wagner there, or is that? No, no, no. Okay. Uh-huh. Yeah, sure.
