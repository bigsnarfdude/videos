Two years ago uh it happened that I was uh reading a a paper on uh diagrammatic representation of the cactus. I knew cactus before from representation theory, but I found very interesting to study the combinatorial combinatorics of uh cactus groups, so I bothered several colleagues in Camp. Then with Juan we got a grant for a PhD on cactus groups and with Victoria Native we started to do some work together. So that's the story and last year me and Victoria organized I think the third conference in practice groups maybe they're all about, but we will see. But the gathering together maybe not all authors because I can see what's there. Or just because it was not there, but that is about the representation theory, of the rights, geometry theory, and communatories. So, for starting, I will start with a paper in Jacob with Victoria. I will show a few results of my students that go a little bit far not farther, but in a different direction than our paper. Direction than our paper with Victor and Goshenon, my PhD. And I will finish with some sense to introduce the talk of Edi about a generalization of cactus groups. About the history, I think that probably the first appearance of cactus group was in 1998 in a paper of Devados on mosaic. Power of Devadoso on mosaic operators working on mosaic operators, he found an action of a group, and he called this group Casibrade Group. And later, Erica Skaminzer found useful this group in another realm in representation theory when you work with crystals. And this group. And these groups can be extended quite easily to cocceter groups, other coccor groups, and wild groups by work of Buddhafi and Lozaf. But Eddie will say a few words about this kind of generalization. I will stop simply on that. The first warning is that in this talk In this talk, essentially, the tactus group will be combinatorial objects. With diagrams, I will not speak about application in category theory, representation theory. But since I'm there with so much people knowing branded categories, I will at least show how cartoons group appear in. Group they appear in the monoidal categories. So let me, so since they are combinatorial objects, I will give immediately what it is, the group presentation. So for the moment it is just a group with a presentation, maybe not an abstract group, where you have n times n minus one over the. n times n minus one over two generators. So we have to, in this is we have to just to think that the first has to be less, sorry, less than the other one. If you know pure brain books, you can think about the presentation of the pure braid books. So you have n times n minus 1 over two generators. Then you have that generators are evolutive. And then you have as usual with this kind of With this kind of generalization of a right-handed coxated group or coxated group, far commutation. Meaning that if I will work with intervals, so for example PQ, I will think about the interval between P and Q, the interval between M and R, and if they are disjoint, the two generators commute. So it's a typical far commutation. And then there is a And then there is a relation which is quite that it will be easier to read with diagrams. The idea is that when you have an interval which is contained in the other one, you can slide the generator in the big one, PQ, and then you see AMR, you go on the left, and you have the Left, and you have the symmetric one according to the bigger interval. This is the presentation that was used already in Devatus paper in 98, in Erika Skamitzer papers in 2002, Scott's paper on mock reflection groups in two thousand one. But I think that the first one using a diagrammatic interpretation of cactus groups was Of cactus groups was most of all in 2019. So, much data. And so, we can read, we can read with diagrams the relations. So, first, of course, what it is a generator. A generator we have to think about, for example, I cut here, okay? So, for example, what is one is that the generators S three uh four five six seven. S37. So I'm just doing a permutation. This is not a break, this is really a permutation where you just reverse the interval. And then we can read the relations. So generators are involved. So they are not singular points. This is the same point that when you start to use virtual grades, they are. To use the virtual grades, they are not similar points, they are really permutation. And we have a mutation, and then the third family of relation is depicted here. So here you can think that it's a big interval, and you can slide the the little generator. The little generator and on the other side. First thing is that when I'm working with people on topology, I will do from the top to the bottom. But when I work with people in algebra, I work from the left to the right. So maybe the picture will change because it depends with people that I'm working with, particularly with Veris about left and right. So just So, just two little examples of this group: G2 is Z2, nothing to do. G3 starts to be a little bit more intensive, university-coxated group on two generators. And then things become a little bit more complicated to understand what uh triggroup is. Uh it is possible to reduce uh generators and relation. Generators and relation. I will say a few words later, but in a paper of my student, England, which is part of INCOM, they show that it is possible just to find one generator for I mean, here, for example, I can I can I can say that uh this generator has uh five leaves. As five leaves, because there are five strands which are involved. So you have just to take one generator for n leaves, and leave n leaves. And then you can reduce the presentation with some presentation which are not so far, which are homogeneous, except the first one, which of course it is that way or generally it was involved, but it becomes kind of complex reflection group where a relation of homogeneous. So here it is just written that what are relations at the level of writing with generators. The first important point, this is important in this conference where a young Baxter is omnipresent, is that there are no young Baxter. So there is no art real. You can say in seven You can say in several ways. Topology, there is no Bride and Master Treat relation. For people from sectarian theory, no, there is no impact there. And there is no, for people in Brides, the usual Bride relation. Meaning that if you take also this kind of relation, then the quotient is the symmetric group. Because actually, this relation is true in the symmetric group, because they are really permutations. But we don't allow this kind of situation. I just wrote here a little remark that you can close cactus, then you have cactus doodles. But if you know doodles, doodles are immersed circles in S two or R two where you can have double points, but no multiple points. Multiple points, and it means that you cannot have a triple points, then you cannot use a Redemaster 3 move. But if you Google Cactus Doodle, it is better to add, for example, the autos, because if not, you will find plenty of stickers of cactus on Pinterest. So it is so there. I think that they just the one or two. I think that it's just one or two people on Cactus Ludo, but it's just for saying that, like usual, people in Northeoi take a braid or something which is a diagram and they close. And then it is possible to try to understand, for example, that watch relation between the bright part and the link part. So as I said before, it is I I said that it is Said that it is there are really permutations in the sense that I don't allow the relation ABA equals BAD, but if I add it, I have the symmetric group. So finally, I'm like for bright groups, okay, the canonical epimorphin to the bright group of the symmetric group, is that I'm taking my favorite cactus or here my favorite generators because it is a Fabric generators because it is homomorphic groups, and I take the corresponding permutation, which is just the permutation reversing the interval PQ, the point between P and Q. As in the theory of query group, we we can study the pure part, the pure part or coloured part, uh if you Part, if you prefer Arnold interpretation, is that simply we are taking all cactus which have trivial permutation constraints. And then, what it is very interesting is that finally it is a fundamental group of a configuration space. Okay, like the pure braid group, the usual pure braid group is a fundamental group of configuration space when points on R2. Here it becomes much more difficult. I will just give a picture is that you have to think about configuration spaces of projective curves, marked projective curves. And when you do a kind of picture Do a kind of picture of this kind of objects, you find a kind of opuntia cactus. So it is the cactus with a kind of a mimicky mouse with some marked points. And what it is funny is that in most of our diagramatic, you have also this kind of cactus which are of kind saguaros because Victoria did a Victoria did a botanical study how to prepare people that. So, finally, there are cactus groups because if you study the diagram, they seem cactus, and when you do configuration space, the diagrammatic seems another kind of cactus. So, but let me explain how they appear in in category theory. So I will not go very far very I will go fast on this part because I think that you and several other people explained what it is about the category. So I'm just saying strict just to avoid people saying yes, but there are no associates or no. I'm writing just a diagram. Let me just write a diagram. So you The diagram. So you have a braiding and then you have the hexagon. But in the hexagon, okay, so you have the Eurian-Baxter equation, but we can also have a shortcut, meaning that instead of writing sigma 1, sigma 2, we write immediately sigma 1, sigma 2. So we have a braiding, or I will say, sliding between you and the sensor product. Same on the bottom. Same at the bottom. And of course, when you take the tensor product of n factors, you can write this morphism and this morphism will give birth to the gradebook. Okay, so just saying that. But what it happens, how cactus appear in this theory, we have to change the category. To change the category, which is a category which is not so far, we call a co-boundary category, where we have still morphism on the tensor product of two factors. They are usually called commutators, and the first point is that commutators are involved. We don't want it in the alphabetic category because it's not Because it's not, it becomes a symmetric one. But they are involved here. We don't have an hexagon, we have a square. And simply that you see that I can apply first commutator on two factors, and then here and here I'm permuting one factor with the test support of the other two. Of the object. Once more, if we take the product of the tensor product of n factors, we can define spqc in a similar way as we did for sigma i, but we have to take that sigma is actually working on the first peak component. The first p component of the tensor product, and then I take the tensor product of all factors between p plus 1 and q. And then it is the ideal. This is not, this S sigma PQC is not yet the cactus group. So the cactus group appear recursively when we take the Recursively, when we take that sp plus one is the sigma, p plus one c, and then we have to slide if we want to do records that spq is the composition of spqc with sp plus one cubed that we defined before by recognizing. It is a sliding and what And when we take this element, we found Menrikes and Kamitzer, they showed that these operators they have these properties. That's the reason why, for example, Kamitzer says this category should be called cactus category, and now he's working on some generalization. They are called flower cactus category, and so on. And here it comes the capital group. Of course, for people in representation category theory, this is just a group acting on their favorite categories. But it is funny that they appear like that, and the pure part is a fundamental group of configuration spaces. Okay. For example, this this group is still quite mysterious. In 2004, I think that they showed that this group, the pure group, was torsionless using the fact that it was the pi one of something, okay? And they were able to And they were able to deal with the geometry. And then, for example, the paper of 2019 that I was saying before of Mostovoy was that the main aim was that in the paper of Caminister Edricas, they were asking if this group was residually important. And most of all, with the diagram, techniques shows. Techniques show that this group PGN is residually important. Reasonably important, meaning that when you take the lower center series, the intersection of the lower series is equal to one. So, pure cactus loop. The construction of most of our for studying the residual properties of the cactus group is to really. The cactus group is to relate cactus groups to costeter right-angle costs at the groups. This is the main idea of the paper. And how to do it? We have to think that every time that we have a cactus, generators by generators, we can think about how many strands are involved. So I marked which strands are involved in the singularity. So for example, So, for example, and then I can say that the element sigma S13 goes on the fact that it involves the first, the second, and the third strains. So, we are writing a set theoretic macro because it is not a morphism, dopamorphism, between Gn and the N, where Gn is a diagram, not a diagram. A diagram group, not a diagram group that you find in geometric bouquet, it's diagonal group in the definition of most of our. So we prefer to say gauss, gauss-diagram group because it is related. When you know a little about pure breakwood with a pure breakgroup, welded pure breakwood, you know that you can write the element as chord diagrams. It is exactly the same things that we are doing here. You say that you have a generator for any possible. For any possible partition of the interval n. And then you have that once more that the generators commute if the partition are disjoint or when the partition is included, nested in the other one. So for example, the generator T124 we can write like that, meaning that we have a dot point on the first vertical strand. First vertical strength, a dot point on the second, a dot point on the fourth. So let me give an example, picture will be easier to understand. So let me write from the top to the bottom. So here you see the cactus involving the third, the fourth, and the fifth strain. So I'm writing, unfortunately, it is not very clear, but there is a dot, okay? Three dots. Three dots. Then what we find is that the second strand has a singular point with the fifth. So we are writing 2, 5, and so on. So for example, the image of this element of the cactus group will be this square. It is not a good morphism. This is clear, because we can define that following. We can define that following, but of course, it doesn't respect the multiplication. But when we restrict our attention to the pure bread part, to the pure cactus part, sorry, this is a lapsus, it becomes a homomorphism. And also, we can have that we have a homomorphism, but we put things together. D is D is the part that is associating a diagram to the cactus, and S is the part that associates permutations. Really, like when you do finite up invariant theory for braid books and you want to write down braids with chord diagrams and permutation. So, consequences, it is a So, consequences, it is a PGN is residually important. Why? Because it is a subgroup of a right-angle coexistence group. So, it is residually important. It is linear. Why? Because this group is linear. So, finally, this construction gives immediately nice results. So, the idea with Victoria and Wu was to say to push forward this idea how much we can say using right angle cocceter groups. Right angle coccettal groups. And in knowing, that's the point of fact is to knowing enough where cactus go in right-handle cortex groups. So, for example, the first theorem is that this group just have just even torsion, and we can find even torsion of any power of 2. We can find quite Find quite easy how to let grow the order of elements. The Pucato has no torsion. Yes, it was already showed because it was algebraical in perturbation, but we have a very short and combinatorial proof of this fact. And then we were able also to prove that this group has no center, centerless, sorry. Centerless, sorry. And finally, that the word problem is solvable, and maybe AT will come back on this point for extensions of Cactus. So finally, I can say that this is the part of what it was possible to say using simply the fact that they are very related to the right-angle coxeter group. There is one part that there are not so much related to right-angle coxeter group. It's the last result. Coxeter group is the last result on the parabolic part. So if you know coxeter artillery theory, when you say parabolic, you already understand what I'm saying here, but I will give some definitions. We start with a group with a presentation and we find we take a subset of generators and Of generators, and we take only the relations that are involving the set of generators that we decided to take. So it is clear that we have a new group, GI, with just generators a subset of the first one, with a substance or subset of relation of the first one. We have a map. This is clear. The problem is that. Is clear. The problem is that in general, this map is not injected. And we say that the subgroup is complete if the map is injected. In the realm of toxetenardin group, these subgroups are called parabolic and they are subgroups. So this homomorphic is all the time injection. But for example, right-angle coceter. Good, this is true. Are good, this is true. So, every time that I take a subset of generators and the subset of related relation, it is still a subgroup of the group. This is not true in cactus, because, for example, let us take G4. We saw that the G2 was Z2, G3 was the universal coxeter group, and G4 is also, we have a Is so will have several generators, but I take just generator one, two, and one, four. And when I see the in the group itself, so this group, if I see the presentation, sigma one, two, sigma one, four, there are no relation. There is no relation between them. And uh but when I see uh uh on uh on the on the group uh itself, uh they Itself, they satisfy this relation. It is not a relation that is written in the presentation, but we can deduce that this relation is true. So in the Cactus group, we have this kind of Coxeter relation ABAB is equal to BABA, but it is not in the presentation. So we can get rid of this problem because Problem because we can say that we take a collection of sub-inders of between 1 and n, and we say that this collection is symmetric if every time that we have a pair of intervals, nested intervals, we have also the symmetric one according to the big interval. So, for example, if I have that MR is contained in PQ, well, I have to also take T. But I have to also take this one because it is the interval which is the inverse image of the interval mr in the sub-interval dq. And if we have that, if we are just working with symmetric collection, then these generators give a complete group, meaning that if it Group means that the effectivity is also a subgroup of the cactus group. For example, if you know planar braids, planar braids are just because yes, planar braids has their equality. Planar braids, they are just that you have the relation that far Far generators they commute, but it is a subgroup of the capacity group. It is a first level. It is the level of generators just with two leaves. These are lanar brain. Let me show just to understand a little more these groups. So, G3, we saw we We said that it is Z2 star Z2. Why? Because it is easy to find that finally the presentation was redundant and we need just these two generators which are just a relation that they are involved. That's it. For G4, we have another presentation. This is Shimon and Nan that they did for N. Did for any n, okay, but I'm just showing the first two that we did by hand in the paper with Victoria. Is that we have just three generators involved in, and then we have this one is a coxeter relation, this one is not, because there are three involved uh uh generators. But for any N, this is uh the typical relation that uh appear uh in Taco's book. Appear in Katlus group. What if this is the pure Katus group here? But in PG3, we have this group and you have such action on the symmetric group S3, which is very simple. And the presentation is this one. This is just that the cube of sigma one. The cube of sigma 1 to sigma 13. But we can rewrite this element because like this one. And because it is, I can't write, but now I explained so you can write here. Because we have a sigma one two just to be sure, okay, sigma one two sigma one three one two I want three I want two Moment 2, C moment B. But now, these generators with three leaves, we can push all this generator on the left. And they are involved, so two, they disappear, but when we move this generator, sigma one, two becomes sigma two, three. So finally, in spite of writing this one, it is with the generator of this presentation, this one is a Presentation, this one is with the presentation, the usual presentation of cartoons. Anyway, I call alpha this element, and this is the generator of the pure cartoon-built contributions, because we are writing half-twist with the three pull points, and the other half-twist with leaves regenerator on two leaves. Coolies. Let me just give, for example, a generator for PG4, where you can see that we have alpha, a translation of alpha on the other strands, another translation of alpha, and then it becomes more complicated. It is one related loop, and this is the reason why is, for example, torsionless in this case. But for n with the or equal to six, we don't know. We don't equal the six, we don't know a presentation. Of course, Reidemass share gives a presentation, but simply it's off and without any understanding of relation between pure cutters group. But now I want just to say a few words about something that is not related to, not so related to right angle cockscale group, is that now Shemin. Now Shemin and Nanda, they show that it is possible to surject the cactus group on the Hydra groups. It means that if you know a little the last result on finite quotients of Parade groups, it's conjecture that the littlest quotient of the Parade group is the symmetric group. For n greater or equal than 5, Bn, the quotient has to be at least. The quotient has to be at least n factorial. But here it is not true for cactus group. We can quotient cactus group in very small finite groups. And the second point is that the lower center theory of the group Gn doesn't stop. And if you know once more the Bright group, you know that the commutator of the Braille group is equal to the Is equal to the third commutator of the break group, meaning that the commutator is equal to the commutator of the group with the commutators. So it means that really this group that I'm speaking about are more similar to right-angle coaxial group than Bread group uh even if uh they were those uh called quasi-bread group, they are combinatory, are much more related to right angle conciliation. Related to right-handle coxilium. I will finish quite fast with the fact that these cactus groups can be extended to other possible generalization. For example, we you can write and maybe Eddie will say a few words about the fact that it is possible to associate to any coxeter group a cactus group. A cactus group using the longest element of the coccet group. But here I want just to focus on two generalizations which are also a fundamental group of orbit space like cactus groups. Because we talked before that the pure cactus group was a fundamental group, then the cactus group was Fundamental group, then the cactus group was a fundamental group of an orbit space. This is the case for affin cactus group, which were defined in 2015 by Bon Afray and last year by Elin Tamitz, Chetitsky Rydnikov, and my student Pizir, that it is a present presentation than before, but you have that we are also non standard interval are accepted we are working modulo n. We are working modulo n. Let me just give a picture. This is the kind of cactus that you have. That's sigma 1, 2, then you have sigma 3, 1 relating the strand 3, 4, and 1 back behind. And then sigma 2, 3. And all the results that I gave before, A, B, C, D, so about the there is torsion, torsion is. There is torsion. Tarsion is only of only even torsion that the problem is solvable and also the result on parabolic is still true in this group. And finally, for the last five minutes, the group that is more interesting for me and Eddie is the virtual catalogue group. Is the virtual catus group that was defined independently by us and Kamnitzer. The idea is that you have to take the free product of the capital group and the symmetric group and then to add the relation, like for if you know virtual grades. And the relation is that the conjugation of a generator by a W, you have just to change the The corresponding permutation of indices only if w acts as a translation of the interval. And if when but we for our studies we propose another definition of the Witrobe group but which is a term of generators and relations, but it is the same group. It's the same group, meaning that of course you have the first The first set of generators is the calculus, the second set of generators is a symmetric group, but you have a far commutation as usual, and then a slide. Let me just show a little bit more in terms of generators. You have cactus, you have symmetric, and then you have this kind of sliding. They will give just a diagram. You see that for. Diagram, you see that, for example, this sorry S, sorry. This is the usual factors. This is just a permutation that I want to put with a circle to be clear that they are not the same kind of generator. And the only relation that I have to explain is that this lighting relation, that you see I have my cactus, and the cactus can pass through. Cactus can pass through the band of permutation like that. If you know virtual grids, it's exactly how we define virtual grades and exactly how we define virtual mass. And even for welded bright groups, this is the relation that we have to add. We have to add also another one, but we have to add this kind of relation. So we have this group, and we have, of course. Course, we have, of course, that the natural homomorphism going from the symmetric group to this group is injective. Simply, we take a theory traction. And then, simply, I want to finish with some results. We have two projections, like forbidden by groups, we have two projections on the symmetric group. Once we take the permutation, another time we kill the cactus. We kill that the cactus part. And then we have several results: like that, this neutral group is asymmetric to our product by the symmetric group, where K, V G N, and P B G N are generators with indices where the symmetric group can act. And then, for example, we got a good presentation for P D G N, but also CANIS and co-authors. And cooters. We have also for KBGN, and then with this result, we can show that the ural cactus group can be injected inside. We have solvable problems. Eddie will say a little bit more on this point. And then once more, you remember this group that we gave before, but this big group subject canonically on this most This most of our construction. This is another reason why the cactus group embeds the virtual cactus group. And I finish now. I may talk now. I thought that I started ITRT, but I don't think that we are unhappy that I finished. I went a little bit faster. I went uh a little bit fast at the end because I thought that uh it was uh really time for me but Paolo, thank you for your tenant control. Does anybody have any questions? Paulo? I will not thank for the I will not thank for the question because it was complicated. I can say s let let me say like that. You have to take projected curves with market points and then starting from there you have to take the real compatification of the configuration space. For me it is very hard to see. For me, it is very hard to see. I prefer, for example, the definition of Devados in terms of mosaic operators. But if you want to know something more about this part, there is a very nice YouTube talk of Kanitz. I think that it is better. Because it is just, for me, what is important is that cactus group are configuration spaces of Spaces of one-dimensional objects. This is really important. Because what it is, the fact that it is common between... I told about... Just to take this part. I was speaking just about affin cactus group and virtual. Because if if you know, for example, diagram groups. For example, diagram hooks, geometrical theory. You have three kinds of possible diagrams. You have the line, and here it is the cactus. Then you have the circle, the other variety of dimension one. And then you have the asymptotic group, and in the realm of diagram groups, you have zero diagram groups. And then you have the virtual part, meaning that you can exchange points even. You can exchange points even if they are not adjacent between them. So the idea is that you have on the line and then we can take modulo M to say that even the last one is near the first one or you can say that all of them are near each other. So you have three types of techniques and these three types of techniques give birth to fundamental groups of conforgeous phases. Fundamental group of concorratorous traits, which are very complicated, that as I said before, in presentation are not known. And also, the geometric interpretation is very difficult because even for when you start, it is something co-dimension two of a space or dimension n, it becomes very difficult to understand. But still, they they they are related. They are related. But you can go to the other direction. You say that I was working with cactus group with the symmetric group. Then I replaced the symmetric group by another coxyl group. And then you go in algebra. But if you want to stay in geometry, I should say that these three are the most interesting ones. Let me say that we have another idea, is that we try to say something. That we try to say something that it is not possible to say from the geometrical point of view. For example, to find that this group is centerless, you have to use German algebraic techniques. So I'm sorry, I'm not able to. But really, when you see a picture of an element, it is something like that. I'm not joking, it's like that. Joking, it's like that, that like that. Okay, that's what I've seen the first time. Now they could find the parameters. I think that it's the best is if you intensity to geometry that it is a question when effective group is strategically important. Strategically important. So, what is the motivation for it? Is the motivation to associate some last archives to it? I come for combinatorial group theory. So, to be with this both is very important for me. For example, when you have a data group with evaluators-freely portent, which is then much better, you can. you can you have also some relations which are related to indicability of the group, reunability of the group, and you have that the group is orderable. So you have plenty of it is let me say I have time to say what it is the lower central series maybe. So sometimes it is good. So to repeat, so I start with a group G, then gamma 1, gamma 2 G is Gamma two G is this is gamma. I will say that this is gamma one gamma two g is the commutator and then gamma three g is the commutator of the commutator it is important also when you do for example representation in some In some even twisted homology. For example, when you do with braids, okay, the homology that we will take can be just abelian because when that Bn, you can show that Vn is equal to Vn Vn. Mapping's group is even at worst because the Mapping's group is isomorphic to Isomorphic to the commutators. It means that every time that we have a dent with, it can be written as a commutator, a product of commutators. So you have this one, and for GN, there is our status here, it doesn't stop. It means that, for example, you can, it is also related to the E-Lie algebra, that you can work on the group itself. For example, the Lie algebra of Malza Parbaj of Guilbeck are very intellectual. Of people great are very interesting for people in photography or photovoltaic. The other few great group itself, not at all. But theories and so on, you have a good group. But anyway, for infrared view, is it the listing property for the machine learning? But that's why I wanted his motivation specifically. My question was a bit more precise as TGM. For example, when you study the lower surface theory, sometimes they can give you some properties or some abstraction on the finite portions. For example, with several colleagues like Edi or John Kwaski and Vasika Guzaves, we found in another real surface-grade groups that some portions were not possible because of the fact that we know that when these These subgroups are characteristic. So, finally, you have some very strong obstruction when you want to study the homogenous between one group and the other. But if you know. Finally, I think that if you attach to the West Central C of Red Hook, there is a nice ornography or niceness whether the West Central C is Well, I said that he stops for all kinds of rights and topological generation of grade. Another colleague of ours and I think Mark. Exactly, I'm not to be convinced that it is, but I feel I thought. We had a comment. Yeah, sure, just talking. But this is a cooperation that sometimes uh happens. Finally it is uh it is a uh strong for the understanding of this. Have you any information about the commutator server? I did that. And the quotient is something like three a billion. I think that we have to to do something because uh the history is that we we wrote our first paper with Victoria. Wot her first paper with Victoria and Hugo with a very clear idea that we were reading together the paper of Mostovoi, and it was a common opinion that this idea of relation between right and go computer we could move forward. But then we moved in no other direction and uh with a D we decided to go study Shopa. But of course we could be interested. Whether it would be interesting to know about the interviews. I have to think about an idea that cactus groups are linear because they are isomorphic to a linear group. But can we constructively define some basic representation on one of the two representations that we just showed? And what's known about the representational theory of these? Like, can we Theory of these, like, can we but you know you know you um no you know uh you know the the image or you know really the the matrices because um because you have uh that you know you take your favorite element then you take the right angle coccid element related plus the symmetric so you can really write the matrix you have it you have it. Ma the c the question is uh um how to if the question is how to characterize the interior of the image of the right angle of the loop, it is a little bit more complicated. Because for example, we were trying to understand the pure cartoons look residually potent, but it cannot be residually torsion-freely potent because of the fact of the existence of this element of Existence of this element of order two. So, what is the biggest residue-free element? We have a candidate, okay? But we are not able to find exactly for this kind of problem that we are not, it is not so easy to understand between in the coxeter which are elements whose pre-image is in the cactus. We were able to do in our theory, it was the hardcore, I should say. The hard part, I should say, the hard part was to be sure all the time that when I come back, I come back in the cactus group. This is the, and for representation, I should say, but the problem is that once you know that the group is linear, it's much more difficult to say, okay, for people, okay, this is the rest of the world. Well, if you have like the relation with the difficult comfortable Difficult find one of a configuration space, it doesn't. Yes, you might want to know more representations to bring back results. But it is interesting if you have an interpretation in terms of motion group, mapping class group, we don't have it. So there is nothing that is moving here. Yeah, sure. So something you have to put that we don't understand very well, maybe a representation. And the other problem is that it is not possible to do cactus. Is that it is not possible to do cactus on dimension two or dimension three are really objects of dimension one? This is important also to understand. It is a meta theorem. It is really that if you understand what it is, what is going on, geometrically it is really the geometry of the line. It's a difficult thing to figure out like efficient presentation for these peer computer sets. For these pure sets? Yes. We know that they are torsionless. My student did the presentation of also with five strands with gap, but it is unreadable, completely unreadable. If you know, for example, a planaboid group, but the pure part is conjectured that it is a right arting angle group, but it is not known. And here And here I cannot say that it is not possible to find a presentation. The problem is to find at least a hierarchical presentation that you can see, because finally there are the we didn't go in this direction, but my student did, about all towers of Cactus group on one side, on one direction, the other one. They are much more hierarchical than breakers. But pure part is very hard stuff on somebody trying like programming basis or something. I have no idea. There are geometrical interpretations of these groups and they are in the paper of Annals of Mathematics of Canada, I have to check, but paper of 80 pages. How do you prove that the the world problem is solved? We just give a solution. But Eddie will answer next question. Actually, there is a the tip you take the the the usual The usual solution for the right cockset group or right art in angle groups with how do you say with these vertical lines poles? Do you have uh some uh bricks which can uh which can unite several poles. We can unite several books. You pile everything up and then you remove your contents. You may have to work on it. But now you are working the image. So you have just to take care that every time you can come back on the group. So it is not but we did something much more general. So maybe much more complicated. Much more complicated. We're waiting for many. Okay. So let us be pulled, let us take all of you.
