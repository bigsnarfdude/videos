Thanks to the project CRC for the financial support. Today I will talk about the asymptotic stability from the generalized good Business equation. Then I will try to introduce briefly the Business model, the original model, and after I will try to explain the basic properties, the setting of for problem, the existence of solitary waves. Existence of solitary waves, some previous results that are important for our result, and the main result of this work. Then, Business in the 1870s, they use a system of equation with the goal of describing two-dimensionally rotational animisking fluid in a uniform rectangular channel with flat body. Then, this word is important. Then this word is important because he was the first to give a oral explanation to the traveling waves discovered by Scott Russell two years early. Then, Bussines made an approximation of the URL problem to describe the two-way propagation of small amplitude gravity wave and the surface of the water and the cannabis, and he obtained this. He obtained this equation, which is of second order in time, fourth order in space, with this quadratic nonlinearity applied with these two derivatives. In this physical context, H is the height of fluid. Well, here is not present, you know, but is the speed of the fluid. G is the gravity constant, and capital H is the depth of the liquid without perpetration. This model could be simplified and could. This model could be simplified and considering the dimensional model, and the dimensional model has this way, has this form. The problem with this model is that it's a strongly linear real pulse. Essentially, here is high the backward and forward heat equation. However, if we consider the plus sign in the approximation, this is the changing when we do that, we obtain. We obtain a new equation that doesn't have this problem and it's called the Good Business equation. Okay, then we will consider the dimensional model of the Good Business equation and we want to work with just a first order system. Then we make the classical Shinshop variable and we obtain this system of two equations. System of two equations. This system is Hamiltonian and has four, at least four conservative quantities, but they are relevant for all works are the energy and the momentum. The energy is well defined in H1 times L2 and the momentum is well defined in L2 times L2. Okay, the solitary waves as solution Solution: He has this form in the first coordinate is Qc, and the second one is minus CQC. And the element is X minus C T minus this shift. C is the velocity of the solitary wave. And the system, it was proof, I will talk about this later, for velocity between minus 1 and 1 in that interval. And this QC is This QC is the solution of this equation in H wave. And in particular, when we consider pure power nonlinearity of this type, the standing solitary wave, the standing because the velocity is zero, is essentially this, a hyperbolic second with some power, and the second coordinate is zero. Then, some pre-result about this that are essential. Essential. Bonner and SAC in the 80s proved local wave pulse and global wave pulse for small data, but very far off the energy space. Also, they proved the existence of solitary waves for velocity in this interval, minus one and one, and the velocity belongs to this interval. And Linaris in the neck tree and in notes of the 2005 proved the global were causing the energy spay in the case of a small initial. Case of a small initial. Kichimodo in the 2013 proved in the integrable case, that's mean for the P or 2, the power nonlinearity, the sharp wall pulse. Then they prove that in the classical solving space is global well pause for this exponent, for s bigger or equal than minus 1 or 2, and in the other case is Gilpost. Pose. Then, we want to talk about the asymptotic stability from this equation, and the proof result about this is: well, in this seminar work, they also prove that the solitary waves are stable if the speed of the solitary waves obeys this condition. k minus 1 over 4 is below to c square and c square is below 2 1. But this required that p is bigger than p. That P is bigger than P is bigger than 4. But this is the, for us, is, I think, the most important work because Liu in the 90s proved that the solution with an initial data arbitrarily near the ground state, this is the velocity equals zero, could blow up in finite time. And this is the setting of our problem. We went to study that synthesis. Not for problem. We want to study the asymptotical stability of this crown state. But we know that there is this problem with the initial data ritual. Okay, so is it important to the results also for some data? I think that no, but I'm not completely sure. I know. You have a blowout, right? Yes. Have a blow up, right? Yes, but yes, it's true. But Liu imposed some condition about the energy also for the dx minus 1 of the initial data. And it's a little bit more restrictive. I'm not completely sure if are completely complementary results, but it's probably that it could be, but I'm not sure. Okay, then the further. Okay, then the first main theorem here is: well, we consider this pure power non-litinarity in the Good Business equation, the generalized Good Business equation. And for P bigger equal to 2, we consider, or there exists a positive delta such that if there are a global event odd solution of this type, event odd means that the first coordinate is 7, the second is odd. The second is Od of the generalized Good Business equation. If satisfy this smallness condition, this means that the solution is close to the ground state, at this delta distance, then for any gamma small enough and any compact interval, we have this local asymptotic stability. Then here we have the the first variable tends to q, that is. Tends to q, that is here. And we were not able to recover this term, but we have this regularization of this term. Then, to study this, the first step always is try to understand the perturbation of this ground state. Then we consider a perturbation in the first quadrant, this W, in the second zeta. W in the second theta, and if we are plus, we obtain this linearized system. This linearized system, well, is here appears in a natural way the classical Schollinger operator, and this linearized system is equivalent to this equation. Then it's natural that to understand this linearized system, we have to understand or study. We have to understand or study this general operator. And well, the Schrdinger operator has been extensively studied by Shan-Gustofson, Naginachi, and Sai and Olor. Okay, then from the linearized operator we have that is a four-order differential operator and this we could prove that there is a unique hegemony. A unique agent function associated to this negative agent value. This term is well defined and we consider normalized this term and the Hegel value, the Hegel function, decays exponentially with this one minus, that is a number slightly below two. Also, we can prove that the second agent volume of this operator Second agent volume of this operator is zero, but also there is some resonance in the classical sense. This means that we have some solution of this equation where it belongs to the L infinity but not to L2. However, the unique L2 Hagen function here is the derivative of the ground state of this solidarity. And with this in mind, we can prove that this operator is non-negative under certain operators. Non-negative under certain or to another condition. Okay, with the study of this linearized operator, we are able to define some direction of this problem. Then we define y plus y minus and zeta plus zeta minus. That essentially is the agent function associated to the negative agent volume. Associated to the negative agent volume, the spherical coordinate, and the dx minus 1 of the HM function with the square root of the negative agent volume, absolute value. And this y plus and y minus, if we define or we consider this function, the exponentially and this direction, we can see that it's a solution of the linearized problem. And this shows the presence. And this shows the presence of exponentially stable when it's minus and unstable linear manifold when we consider the minus sign in the exponential. Then we have to understand, we have to work with this direction to obtain a result. The CTO plus and sita manus will be useful to describe the manifold of initial data, where our result is successful. The second member so is a little ugly, but yeah. We consider the P bigger or equal than 2. We define a set A0, where essentially are the type of perturbation that we can consider. Then we consider epsilon in H1 times O2. Epsilon is some event of function, even in the first coordinate of the second, that is small in the That is small in this norm, but also is orthogonal to the direction zeta plus. Then there exists a constant C0 and delta naught that are positive, also a Leuterian function with takes value in A0 with real values, which is 0 and satisfy this bounded condition. Then with this, we define this. And with this, we define this manifold that is essentially a perturbation of this standing wave, the solitary wave, the standard solitary wave, perturbated with the epsilon and the flow in the direction y plus, where epsilon belongs to the induct. Then, for this m, it follows that the following holds. If the initial data belongs to the data, If the initial data belongs to this set, then the global associated solution satisfies this orbital asymptotic stability. And also if a global even odd solution of the global good Pussian equation, the generalized Good Pussian equation, satisfy this smallness condition, that means that belongs That means that belongs remain close to the standing wave, then belongs to the manifold M for every time. Okay. What is the idea of proof? We want to use, oh, essentially we want to use this direction to try to control the directions. The directions, then we have to redefine our perturbation. Then we consider the direction y plus here. We consider the flow in this direction and also u12 that satisfies some orctonal conditions, which are this for the negative agent, for the aging function associated to the negative aging bar. Then, with this portion conditions, we have This protogenary condition, we have that A1 and A2 could be written this way. And since we consider a small perturbation, it's natural to expect that U1, U2 and A1, A2 are small multiplied by some constant. We can see that the flow in this in this discomposition If this decomposition satisfies this differential equation, A just depends on T, we have A naught, but A naught is this N multiplied by this function, the L2 inner product, and N orthogonal is given by this, and N is associated to the nonlinearity. But the important thing for The important thing for that follow, I think that this is more essential, is that the perturbation u1, u2 satisfy this system. And here is very similar to the linearized equation that we obtained, but we have some orthogonality conditions for u1, u2, and also some parity conditions. And a n orthogonality is this term. Term. Okay, then we want to use essentially the idea proposed by Kowalcic Martel and Munoz. Then we want to use Burial to try to understand the dynamic, the local dynamic here. And also we follow the idea of Pogolsip, Martel Muñoza, Hambund Bog. Then, the first step is we have Yeah, we have this equation, this linear equation with the orthogonal condition, and we want to consider a localized version of these functions. Then we define w1 and w2 a localized version of this function at a sk. Then this is essentially the momentum of our problem. We consider a wave function here and we Here and we derivate this term. Then we obtain this bureau inequality, this bureau estimate, and here essentially we recover the H1 norm, the L2 norm for the second variable. However, this red term is dangerous because if we rewrite in these variables, it's not possible to find a good sign here. Then we have to use change. To use a change of parable that is motivated for a word of Martel for the generalized KDB equations. Then we consider the regularization, this regularization, and here the L operator. The L operator is the classical invert operator. Then we define this new system and this new system is given for this equation, for this system. And here we define also Define also a localized version of this problem that is CETA1 and SETA2, but we use another scale, the B scale from this. And yeah, this scale has some relation, but it's a little technical. Then we consider now the momentum of this equation from this system here. We consider a weight function. This weight function now depends on body scale A and B. We derived this. With derivatives, and we recover again the H1 norm here in the second variable and the L2 norm. However, our change of variable modify the regularity of the variables. Then, here, the second term, sorry, this, is small. If the BS scale is big enough, this term is small, then we can hide this term. And this also is small for the mining potassis. Their mining potassis. Okay, then we try to rewrite this term in terms of zeta1 and zeta and w. Then following the paper of Bowalsk Motelominos, we use a query estimate to make this. Then we can separate this term in terms of wb1, the h1. WB1, the H1 norm. We recover here zeta1. This term is big, but it's not a problem. However, this new term disappears. We have the derivative of zeta1, and if you remember, sorry, pure is not present. Then we have a new problem with this change of bargain. Then we have to consider another modify system, then we consider this. system then we consider this v1 the derivatives of this variable and we define v1 tilde v2 tilde and this satisfy this system j and h are essentially terms associated to the non-linear terms and here again we consider this momentum the partial momentum of this equation with this weight future now if we obtain here the Now if we obtain here this viral estimate, here we recover or appear this derivative of zeta1 and here we obtain the first and second derivatives of zeta2. Then we are almost ready to finish our result. However, it's more clearly we present or we rewrite a transfer bureau estimate. This means that we will use the This means that we will use the dynamic of this system and this system to relation the derivative of zeta1 with the second derivative of zeta2. Then we consider the derivation of these terms and we obtain this beautiful relation. Then, with all these momentous or modified version of momentum of this equation, This equation, we consider a linear combination of these that is quite complex. The find is tricky, but yeah, we can prove this. And essentially, here we have the good sign for this term, and now we have to control this. Yeah. If we pass from this W to U, we are almost ready, just we have to work, try to understand here the dynamic of these terms. Then for this, we recall this system, the system of the fluid direction Y plus. We consider this new variable with the goal of decouple this system, and we define now this. And we define now this function. And with this function, we are able to obtain these terms. And now we have all the good signs, all the good properties. Then we control the H1 norm in the H1 norm in the W1 variable, the LT norm for W2, and this quantity is funded for this term. And this term is. This term. And this term is integral in time. Then we are proof that this term is integral in time, in fact, this is small, and then there exists some subsequence where this term tends to zero. And using another combination of birds, we can prove that in fact these terms are is bounded, it's integral and bounded. Interpretable button, and that we can put our comment in this way. And just opt. Thank you very much. Are there some questions or comments? So so I was wondering uh about photonality condition. You added something like a dx minus one and dx minus two. Do they decay enough? Yeah, for example dx minus two yeah, that that said to belong to every so you have a dx So you have a dx of a minus two outing of pi zero? Yeah, integral. Here, yes. I mean, this function is in L2. Yes, in L2. Okay, why is that? So pi zero is vanishing in the Fourier in the Fourier space. I had another question. I I had another question. So so you you characterize the set initial data set for asymptotic stability. What happens for the other initial data? Yeah, I don't have any idea related to that, but I think you mentioned some blow-up feature, right? Yeah, I think that it's probably that it's related with this result, but I don't have a direct proof how relate these two results. How relate this to your result. But yeah, I think that it's possible that there is some complementary in this. So those blow-ups are somehow close to this data? Initially. Yeah, initially with this data there is no blow-up, then yeah, I think that is because we avoid these directions. We avoid these directions of the plus here. Pass here. Then I think that is it could be related with this, too. And also, we have some parity conditions. Then probably is avoid these bad directions. If you choose some different value for h of epsilon, then yeah, we need some security. Okay, let's start to speak again.
