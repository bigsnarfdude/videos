About what kind of physics motivation this talk is about. And this talk is really about kind of completing the square of these fractional quantum Hall effects. On the top left, we have the most basic form of it, which is the integer quantum Hall effect, which can really be understood at a non-interacting perspective, where you take a 2D electron gas, put it in a magnetic field, the spectrum splits into degenerate. Splits into degenerate bands called lambda levels, and then you imagine filling up these lambda levels. And you can show that for every lambda level you fill up, the Hall conductance jumps by a quantized value e squared over h. And even though this can be studied at a non-interacting level, we can show that interactions actually really don't really don't split this at all. And it's a very robust state. Likewise, Likewise, if it turns out that you can get analogs of lambda levels, at least topologically, in systems without a magnetic field or with really small magnetic field. And these we call churn bands. And they're bands where the topology of the band doesn't come from the added magnetic field. It's kind of intrinsically there at zero magnetic field. And typically, to get these translators, you need to work a little bit harder because they require breaking time-reversal symmetry. So, even though you don't have to add a magnetic field, you somehow have to break the degeneracy between two time-reverse sectors. And in these Moiray materials, that's usually done by strong interactions causing you to polarize into one valley or another valley. The two valleys are related by time-reversal symmetry, and so it's in principle possible to have. And so it's in principle possible to have a turn band in one valley and the opposite turn band in the other valley. And that's what can happen in twisted bilayer graphene. And this is an experiment done by Andre Young's group, where they sweep a magnetic field from a negative value to a positive value, and they see a hysteresis loop, which indicates that at zero magnetic field, you've spontaneously chosen one option. And when you go backwards, you choose the other option because you've kind of trained the state to be in that other option. So it indicates that at zero magnetic field, So it indicates that at zero magnetic field is really choosing to polarize into one churn band and have a quantized resistance. But what this talk will really be about are fractionalized states, where the electrons in the band fill up a portion of either a lambda level or a churn band. In the lambda level case, this has been studied for quite some time and is known as the fractional quantum Hall effect. And when you partially fill a lambda, When you partially fill the Lambda level, at the non-interacting level, you don't really know what to do. And so this problem is really intrinsically governed by Coulomb interactions. And amazingly, these Coulomb interactions can cause the electron to fractionalize into pieces that have a fraction of the electron charge. And associated to that, you get a fractional value for this Hawk conductance. And this is really remarkable physics, but one. This is really remarkable physics, but one practical disadvantage is that the energy scales associated with this physics come from the Coulomb interaction, which come from the density of electrons and their interparticle spacing, but that's set by the magnetic field. And in practice, it's very difficult to apply absolutely massive magnetic fields to get these states to large temperatures. And that's where fractional translators can potentially come in, because the scales are really set by the Because the scales are really set by the microscopic structure. They can, in principle, occur at zero magnetic field. I'm going to allow my definition to include them at a small magnetic field. I can talk about that more a bit later. But yeah, they have potentially elevated energy scales because the physics really comes from the lattice itself. And it turns out these are actually sharply distinct phases of matter than the fractional quantum Hall effect. The fractional quantum Hall effect. In a loose sense, I can sharpen this later, they correspond to translationally symmetry-enriched topological orders, which basically means that they feel the lattice. There's an aspect of the fractionalized particles here are kind of thinned to the lattice. There's a background charge of them. And that really makes them sharply distinct phases of matter than the fractional quantum Hall effect. But even beyond that, you can hope that you could maybe even get different topological orders or different energetics favoring different. Different energetics favoring different kinds of states associated with the fact that this is really a much more diverse setting than the fractional quantum Hall effect. And these states have been understood for, have been studied for quite some time because of all these separate motivations. And they've been really the proof of concept for them goes back to many works all the way back in 2011. So, but what I'm going to be talking about today is a much more Today is the much more practical, but also I'll argue conceptual question of what churn bands are really good for this fractional quantum Hall effect. When do we really expect electrons to fractionalize? What data of the churn band can tell us whether we expect this to happen? Because churn bands are in general much more diverse than Landau levels. They can have dispersion, they can have inhomogeneities within the Boeing zone, and it's not immediately obvious what to look for. Okay, so with that, I'm gonna briefly discuss the outline of my talk. In the beginning of my talk, I'll focus on this more abstract question of how to find a turn band as good for the fractional quantum Hall effect. And I'll argue that the kind of naive characterization you might think, maybe you, okay, you definitely want to have narrow dispersion because if you have a very wide dispersion relative to the interaction, you're just going to get a metal. Going to get a medal. But kind of taking that for granted, that's not really, it's actually pretty easy to see that that's not really good enough. There are many topological bands that have been well known for a long time that even when they're exactly flat, they don't post a fractional quantum Hall effect. And moreover, these bands, which are really just higher lambda levels, they also have uniform bary curvature. And so these two very superficial quantum These two very superficial qualities that, honestly, in a lot of talks on fractional trend insulators, people repeat, these are completely insufficient to determine whether a band hosts the fractional common Hall effect, because there are known counterexamples going back to the 80s, really, if you view lambda levels as formally similar to churn bands. And so I'm going to be talking about a criteria. And there's been a lot of work on actually trying to mimic. A lot of work on actually trying to mimic the lowest lambda level in churn bands specifically. I'll review that work, but I want to go a bit beyond mimicry and kind of talk from a bottom-up point of view about what condition we should really apply to churn bands in order to get the fractional bone-hole effect. And I'll call this condition vortexability. It's a criterion that's shared between Landau levels and certain churn bands. But the churn bands that are vortexable in The churn bands that are for textable in general do not share most of the properties of the lowest lambda level. They kind of just pick this one and don't really care about the others. But I'll argue that this one alone is sufficient to argue that you can get fractional translating states, at least if the interactions are repulsive and sufficiently short-ranged. So, to kind of emphasize this point about why this is a non-trivial question, I want to compare. Question: I want to compare the lowest lambda level to a higher lambda level. Now, I don't want to say higher lambda levels very abstractly because people will raise their hand and say the first lambda level also hosts some fractional quantum Hall states. It actually hosts very different fractional quantum Hall states than the lowest one, but let's take the 50th one. There's really no fractional quantum Hall states expected, observed, or numerically observed in the 50th lambda level, and a wide body of work. And a wide body of work shows that you expect instead charge-density waves like stripe or bubble phases, where the electrons kind of localize either along bubbles of charge or along stripes of charge. They don't fractionalize. And so, but these two systems, all their superficial quantities are identical. They both have exactly zero dispersion, they both have exactly uniform charge density, they both have exactly uniform barycurvature. Exactly uniform barycurvature. They both have continuous translation and rotation symmetry. So if you want to mimic the physics of lambda levels, you can't just stop at these properties. These properties are hard enough to mimic, but you can't just stop at these because you'll never know if you're mimicking this lowest one or the 50th one. And so the crucial ingredient is really elsewhere. And the And the real reason that these conditions aren't sufficient is that they don't really show up in the interacting Hamiltonian. Interacting Hamiltonian depends on the band projected density operators, which the data that feeds into them is the overlap between block states at k and block state at k plus q. And people subsequently studied these overlaps through and developed this field of momentum. And developed this field of momentum space quantum geometry and used that to really figure out a way to mimic the lowest lambda level specifically. Because the lowest lambda level is expected to be the one that gives the best fractional quantum hall physics, both experimentally and numerically. So I'm not going to spend a huge amount of time on this because I won't need a lot of the technical aspects, but the idea is you define a distance function in the Bohr and zone. You define a distance function in the Berlin zone that's related to the overlap of the wave function, differentiate it to get an object called the Fubini-Studi metric, and it turns out that this object can differentiate between all the different lambda levels. The lowest lambda level has the minimal value of this. This object is actually bounded below by the barycurvature, and so the lowest lambda level saturates in inequality. But all the higher lambda levels have a higher value of this. Now, I haven't said anything about why this has anything to do with the fractional. Has anything to do with the fractional quantum Hall effect, but it's at least a resolution to the fact that these systems seem to look extremely similar. This is a quantity where they're very well distinct. It's a little bit better than that, though, which is that if you fully mimic the Fubini-Studi metric and mimic the very curvature, you can actually show that you precisely recover all the block overlaps between all the different states in the lowest. All the different states in the lowest lender level. This is quite a non-trivial statement because this Fubini-Studi metric is really a k-local quantity, whereas this is overlaps between all different points in the Brolin zone. And so if you really do fully mimic this, then you can basically guarantee an FCI. So that's not a small Q statement. You're small - you're claiming. So, in this particular context, you can go from small Q to You can go from small q to any q. And it really has to do with the fact that everything's homogeneous in the Brulean zone, and you can use that to effectively generate. Vortexable. No, just for this case of mimicking the lowest Lando level. Because the metric has to do with small gate, right? Yeah. So this will not be true for vortexable bands. We will not fully. Bands. Like, we will not fully recover these overlaps. The reason you can fully recover these overlaps is that the Lowest Lambda level has a lot of additional structure, including continuous magnetic translation symmetry. And the proof really relies on that. It relies on kind of reconstructing that. Okay, so I missed what you said. What is the space at which you precisely cover? So if you have the same Fubini studiometric as the lowest lender level and exactly Mendel level and exactly flat bary curvature. Ah, okay. Yeah, so you have to do this and the bary curvature. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Then it's enough. So I won't be doing that because that's honestly really hard to do in a lattice system. If you've completely mimicked the lowest lambda level, you've completely mimicked all of these properties too. And it's pretty hard to think of a lattice system that has a uniform charge density, for example. Density, for example. So I want to kind of go beyond mimicry a bit and ask: really, what's the essential feature of the lowest lambda level that we should focus on? And I'm going to argue that that feature can be described as vortexability. And I'll describe this condition and also describe the name, why I gave it this name in this slide. So let's recall the Lofsland state of the lowest lambda level. This is really the first. Really, the first theoretical explanation of why the fractional quantum Hall effect cannot at all be expected. The way we can think of constructing it is starting with the fully filled state of the lowest lambda level, attaching this Jastro factor, Zi minus Zj to the 2s. And this, you can think of this as, at long distances, as kind of like flux attachment. It's saying that when particle I goes around particle J, you get a phase. Around particle J, you get a phase of 4πs. So there's some winding when particles go around each other. So particles see each other as magnetic fluxes. But it's a bit more than that, because when particle I approaches particle j, the amplitude of the wave function, the probability amplitude of the wave function goes to zero. So attaching this factor isn't like a unitary transformation in the same way that flux attachment is. It genuinely changes the amplitude of the wave function at different points, and it does so in a way. Function at different points, and it does so in a very favorable way because when particles come together, the wave function goes to zero, which is really good for Coulomb interactions. You don't want particles on top of each other. And there are ways to sharpen this with Haldane pseudo-potentials, but basically it's just really, really good for the Coulomb energetics. And so it'd be really nice if we could generalize this construction to Chern bands. But typically, this Jastro factor will excite you to higher bands. To higher bands. These Z operators, which is just the position operator X plus IY, they're microscopic operators. There's a priori no reason that they keep you within your band of interest. You could imagine them kicking you out to remote bands. This doesn't happen in the lowest landout level, but in a generic churn band it will. And so the solution to this is to really just define the problem away. We define Problem away. We define a churn band to be vortexable. If, when we multiply an arbitrary state in the churn band by z, we demand that we stay within the band. If we stay within the band entirely, we call that a vortexable band. And if you get kicked out, then that's a violation of this exact vortexability criterion. Now, the lowest lambda level satisfies this criterion. Satisfies this criterion. One easy way to see it is that the symmetric gauge states of the lowest lender level have like the z to the m times this Gaussian factor. This m can be identified as the angular momentum. When you multiply by z, you just increase the angular momentum by one, but you still stay within the lowest lambda level. But as we'll see, we can actually get vortexable bands that are well beyond the lowest lambda level. They can have non-uniform charge density, they can have non-uniform barycurvature. Uniform barycurvature. Yeah. So, how sure are you that, for example, in actual material you have really these Laughlin states? Because I mean, I know very little about it, but the way it was explained to me is that, you know, people thought of actually calling one fact, there was some kind of attempt to somehow give that some understanding because of the Landau levels. But is it clear that for real material actually measure a fraction of model effects is something you wouldn't need like that? I mean, I understand why there's some. I mean, I understand why there's some potential some heuristic why it should be like that, but is it really so? So, you can measure the fractional corner effect in a material, but are you asking why it's specifically this kind of fractional corner-hall effect? Are you convinced that it's always a function of bare form? It's probably not exactly this form. This is kind of an idealization, even in the lambda-level case. So, there are probably corrections to this form. This form. Now we often talk in terms of phases of matter, right? Like you could ask, even if it's not the exact same form as this, is it in the same phase? That's also a little tricky to do because you can see that it's the same Hall conductance, but that doesn't immediately tell you that it's the same phase. And you could, for each fraction, you should really tabulate all the possible candidate phases and think about ways you can differentiate them. So in general, it's a non-obvious question. Obvious question. Yeah. But honestly, like, it's pretty cool just to see a fractional Hall conductance anyway, right? Right, so yeah, so as I was saying, just to follow up on that, computationally, what are the other means to tell you're in a rational performance hold state? Is it just compute the entanglement spectra? That's the thing. spectra that's the thing yeah there there are a few different ways um entanglement spectrum in the context that so there are different kinds of entanglement spectrum there's if you do DMRG for example like put a system on a cylinder you can cut the system and then there's a lot of work that motivates that you should expect to get a chiral edge state with like a particular counting of energy levels that seems to be borne out in pretty much everything every any time that you expect to get a fractional opponent you expect To get a fractional point, you expect to get the state. And so that's one really good way of doing it. There are also ways to do it in exact diagonalization known as spectral flow, where you thread a flux through one of the handles of the torus and you see that the topologically degenerate ground states braid into each other. That's one of the ways people did it in very early on before people were doing DMRG on these. Another way is, actually, one of the first papers. Actually, one of the first papers extracted the many-body churn number by differentiating the topological degenerate ground states with respect to these fluxes that you thread. So, there are many different ways, and ideally, you should probably do more than one to be really sure, because sometimes you can be fooled by a charge density wave if you're not careful. The only thing that is computationally amendable would need to be on the other side. Yeah, I guess I think some people would argue that EMG. I mean, DMRG is pretty. You can't do extremely large circumferences in DMRG either. It's a question of numbers at that point. It's really chemical potential as a function of charge density. Sorry? I think the easiest thing to do numerically is just to do a finite size calculation and estimate the chemical potential as a function of charge. The chemical potential as a function of charge density and see that there's a jump. Because that's actually what's measured: a jump in the chemical potential. But on a finite-sized system, it's kind of hard to do that, right? It's usually pretty fair. On a like 4x5 system. Even with much fewer electrons. That shows you there's an energy gap, though, not necessarily fractional quantum Paul. But fractional quantum Paul is energy gap at a... Is energy gap at a magnetic field of that density. That's what it is. But what about a fractional turn insulator? Same thing. But there's no magnetic field, right? Yeah, but if you had one flux bottom, the density at which the gap occurs changes. Right, but then you have to argue that the system is kind of adiabatically connected to itself after you thread one flux one and through the unit itself. But you know, macroscopically, if you have a large gap. Uh-huh. If you have a large gap and you change the magnetic field by a little bit, the gap's not going to go away. Oh, I think are you talking about fighting it through the handles of the torque? We can talk after you. Okay. So, what I've given so far is a single particle criterion that generalizes a property of the lowest lambda level, but can generalize it to systems that Systems that don't satisfy many of the other more fine-tuned aspects of the Lois Lambda level. But this single particle property can then be elevated to construct many body statements. For example, many body wave functions are just really Slater determinants, superpositions of Slater determinants of single particle wave functions. And so we can really just iterate this condition for every particle. Yeah. Sorry, just there are problems with the Sorry, just aren't there problems with the position operator on like block functions and things like that? I mean, you don't have to act on block functions. You can act on coherent states that are exponentially localized. I see. So the size here aren't necessarily the block function. They don't have to be. Okay. Yeah. It's not the position of Berator, right? It's really nanoticity. It's really X plus IY. It's really X and Y separating. Naniloticity theory. Analyticity theory. So that your band is invariant by multiplication, by any type of analytic function. Yeah, that's another way. That's roughly that you're seeing here. Yeah. Yeah. There are a few ways to view the well-definedness. It's also equivalent to a momentum space condition that we can directly check. That's in practice how we look for it. But this is much more conceptually clear, so I'm presenting it first. But anyway, we can imagine iterating this condition to many particle wave functions. Now, this is a holomorphic function of n variables. You apply this condition to every one of these n variables, and you expand this holomorphic function in a power series for every variable, and you apply this iteratively to every function in the power series. So if this is true for z, you can convince yourself it's true for z squared and z cubed as well. Just because this is really just saying it's closed under multiplication by z. Closed under multiplication by z. So it'll be closed under multiplication by z squared as well. And by extension, any holomorphic function of n coordinates. And this is a holomorphic function of n coordinates. And so we can directly construct an analog to the Lawson state in any vortexable band. And furthermore, these Lawson states are the ground states. Lawfland states are the ground states if you take the limit of short-range interaction potentials. And this is basically a reinterpretation of Haldane pseudopotentials that were constructed by Haldane very early on in the days of the fractional quantum Hall effect. They were formulated in this way in terms of short-range interactions by Trubman and Kibbleson in 1985 to argue that the energetics of the fractional quantum Hall effect didn't really depend on the very high level of symmetry at the lowest lambda level. Symmetry at the lowest lambda level. And we're taking the same perspective here. The real critical essence of these energetics is that particles have a high power zero when they come together. Okay. This is probably one of the more important slides. So any other questions before I move on? I guess, you know, you. I guess, you know, you really need a condition of macroscopic homogeneity, which I think you can prove too. Oh, so you mean if I don't assume translation symmetry, for example? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think, so in the paper we didn't assume translation symmetry. Previous works on fractional translators generally do because you imagine them in crystals. But for fun we didn't. And well we kind of did. Well, we but we kind of did. We assumed that there was translation symmetry at an arbitrarily large scale. So kind of like a twist angle torus. The scale can be thermodynamically large. Because we still wanted to use some formal properties of the block states, but we didn't care how many bands there were. So there could be millions of bands and you could take a huge unit cell. And we expect that to be a pretty good approximation for any system that's roughly homogeneous. But yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can I ask a follow-up about translation symmetry? So I had thought that the verteximal condition was equivalent to the ideal band condition, but actually this goes beyond because the ideal band condition requires translation symmetry, have a well-defined K, right? It does go beyond it, yeah. I usually don't market it that way because I don't know how many people actually care, but it is true. It also goes beyond it in one other way, which is that, I mean, here. Which is that, I mean, here I've said the vortex, I've set the vortex function to be x plus iy, in which case it's equivalent to the ideal band condition. But you can have a nonlinear function of x and y here in principle. And we studied that case and provided what it really means. So the ideal band condition is always linear, but it doesn't have to be x plus iy, but you're saying it's always linear, right? Yeah, it's always rotated x plus iy. Yeah, that's true. I think Jed does this often. Yeah, yeah, that's what I was thinking of. Yeah, okay, got it. So it goes beyond that one, too. So it goes beyond that one too. Okay, but actually the only practical way to determine that band is more taxable would actually be to compute the ideal band condition if you had translation of variance. Is that right? I think there is some ways to look beyond it, but it becomes more of a optimization in search and rescue operation. And search and rescue operation rather than like you kind of have to search for the vortex function. And you can imagine searching by expanding a putative vortex function in terms of various coefficients. And we talk about how to do that in the paper, how you could eventually do that in the paper. But in practice, I think for most materials, like x plus iy is a pretty reasonable first guess. And if you're going to check one thing, just check x plus i. Yeah. So this condition. Yeah, so this condition, so I think as you said before, right, it really, as it's written there, it requires some obscure, right? So it would maybe work for the chiral limit or something like that, or that band. So it's not actually a holomorphic, so it's a little tricky to tie it to holomorphicity specifically. So the chiral model wave functions, for example, are holomorphic functions times something that's not holomorphic. That's right. But I can multiply it and it's still an eigenfunction somehow in the coherent state. Yeah. But now I wonder: so, is it really, for example, for these Lando levels, is it really physically true that only the lowest Lando level exhibits this? Because all the other Lando levels will not satisfy this condition, right? Yeah, there's some interesting structure there that I would love to talk about, but I don't think. I think it'll derail the time too much. But the higher lambda levels on their own are not vortexable. It's like the first lambda level itself is not cortexable. It's roughly because there's some Z bars floating around. Yeah. If you take Z and attach. If you attach take Z and hit it with the first lambda level, it takes you down to the lowest one a little bit. Yeah, so it's really only the lowest one. And that's really one of the virtues of this condition. It says why the lowest lambda level is special. It's also the only one that exhibits spectropony effect. The first lambda level has less good Laufland states, but more good more exotic states. So it's, I don't want to make any broad statements, but. Statements, but you don't want to go too high. It's also true that any Lambda level can be mapped to the lowest Lambda level by changing the interaction. Yeah, right. So here it's really important that this is ideal for short-range interactions. So the interactions look very weird when you do that. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good point, though. Thanks. Okay, yeah, thank you for all the questions. Okay, yeah, thank you for all the questions on the slide. I always like it when I get a lot of questions on the slide because, yeah, otherwise the rest of the talk is a little moot. Okay, so I want to briefly review the momentum space conditions that I've already alluded to. If you have a translation symmetric system and you say that your vortex function is equal to x plus iy, then we can connect to a lot of previous work. Connect to a lot of previous work on these fractional turn insulators. In particular, it's equivalent to this thing called the trace condition, which people had previously used to actually engineer equivalence to the lowest land level. They would first try to find this condition, and then they would try to flatten the barycurvature after. Turned out that that was easier than doing either one of these separately, both of these separately. But now we've Of these separately. But now, of course, we know that this condition is kind of good enough already. We don't really need to worry about the variant curvature homogeneity too much. It's also equivalent to the existence of a holomorphic gauge for the cell periodic block states. I'm not going to talk about this for much of the rest of the talk. It's an incredibly powerful condition, but it's also not a condition that's conceptually illuminating through things in this talk. But it's useful technically and maybe useful. Technically, and maybe useful to know it exists. So, as I said before, people originally were interested in finding bands that mimicked the lowest lambda level as good as possible using tight binding models. And the previous approach to doing this was you write down some, use this holomorphic gauge condition to write down some wave functions, a holomorphic function of kx plus i, ky, and then just define the Hamiltonian to annihilate it. The Hamiltonian to annihilate it by just as a definition. And it turns out this is actually a local Hamiltonian in the sense that it has exponentially decaying hoppings. It's just all these hoppings are very fine-tuned. And then you would play with parameters in this function to try to flatten the very curvature, although now we know that's not necessary. Fortunately, we don't have to do this anymore, because there's a wide variety of MORA systems that seem to just give us this vortex ability very naturally. Naturally. Now, it happens exactly in the chiral limit of testobiographene at the magic angle. It also happens in some generalizations of this, where you add more layers, and you can even get higher churn number of more textable bands. So these are really topologically distinct from a single lowest lambda level. There's also some work on strained graphene, where you can't actually get exactly to a vertexable limit, but you can actually. To a vertexable limit, but you can actually get exponentially close. This is an idea that Islam had, and I think it's maybe one of them, it's a very practical approach to getting fractional translators without having to twist anything. It turns out twisted TMDs, even though their model looks like a p squared over 2m particle, they somehow come very close to this vertexability just quantitatively. Texability just quantitatively, we can check it. And I apologize, I have the wrong reference here. This should involve trifup. Yeah, sorry. There's a helically twisted graphene. I think I have the right reference later. I'll point you out to the right reference later. Where you take three layers of graphene and you twist them in the same direction. And this has local, more aperiodic domains over hundreds of nanometers that have both vortexable turnbands in the chiral limit as well as higher trend. In the chiral limit, as well as higher term member reflexible bands. So, there are all these examples, and I'm going to talk about the analytic emergence in chiral testabilographene, but it's a very broadly similar story in all of these except for, I guess except for MOTE2. So, let me talk about the emergence interested by their graphene. I'm going to go a little bit faster because the audience is. Bit faster because the audience is very familiar with dysabatography, and Simon already reviewed the flat band condition. I'll just maybe point out a few statements about the approach to the chiral limit, which is that there really is a relative, there are AA tunnelings here that kick you out of the chiral limit. These are suppressed by two factors, one of which is lattice relaxation that shrinks these AA sites relative to these AB sites and BA sites. So this tunneling occurs. So, this tunneling occurs at these AA and DB sites. And so, the lattice relaxation dynamics of the system push you towards the chiral limit. And actually, Oscar and Jen Kang did a renormalization, amazing renormalization group calculation that showed that this kappa flows to zero in their renormalization group. And these factors reduce kappa from its putative value of one to something else. Of one to something else, and that something else is hard to determine with any kind of precision, but it gives some motivation to set it to zero as a first pass. So with this first pass of setting it to zero, we turn off these diagonal hopping terms just like Simon did, and we have this chiral Hamiltonian with a D in the lower left. Now, I'm not going to talk too much about the origin of the magic angles and the origin of the flat band. Angles and the origin of the flat bands in the interest of time, but I will talk about why the exact flatness is directly tied to vortexability in this model. And that's because the flat bands are obtained by as zero modes of this D. So D psi is equal to zero. But D only has anti-holomorphic derivatives. So in particular, it commutes with the position operator z. And that really means that d on z psi is equal to z d psi is equal to 0. And so if I start with some 0 mode, I multiply it by z, I'm still a 0 mode. So z keeps you within the band. And so this exact flatness at the non-interacting level and vortexability are tied at the hip here. Now, unfortunately, this exact. Now, I'm going to talk a bit about the practicalities of getting fractional turn insulated twisted biographene now before moving on to other systems. But there's one issue which makes it actually very hard to realize fractional turn insulators in twisted baleographene, especially at zero magnetic field. Because in twisted baleographene, we don't just have one churn band, or even one churn band. One churn band, or even one churn band for Valley. We really have eight churn bands because we have spin floating around, we have valley, and we have the graphene, we have two flat bands for each one of those. And so there are eight bands in total in this system. And so if you want to get to a place where you're just filling one of these eight bands, you have to fill the other seven first or empty the other seven first. And so you have to go a relative three away from charge neutrality. Now the issue is when you dope electrons into this unfilled band, This unfilled band, those electrons will feel the electrostatic potential from all of these other electrons. And this is very severe in twisted biography, actually, because the charge density is relatively concentrated at the AA site in the system. And so these electrons in this band, they don't see the BM model. They see the BM model plus a huge charge density at every Mooray site. And that gives them a very large dispersion. And that gives them a very large dispersion for the following reason. It's the gamma point wave function of cystic biographene by symmetry has an exact zero. And so when you dope the gamma point, you kind of spread out charge relative to this AA site, or at least you don't put charge on the same place where you've already stacked a ton of it. And so just for complete classical electrons. It is nominally the end time. Okay. So I should have reminded you earlier. Oh, okay. Sorry. I'll just. Sorry. I'll just I'll close by saying that this issue is alleviated by adding a magnetic field, both theoretically and experimentally. And fractional turn insulators is subsequently observed in the non-zero magnetic field. By looking at the asymptote of these lines, you can convince yourself that it's really a fractional turn insulator, not a fractional quantum Hall effect, because in a fractional quantum Hall effect, you have zero electrons at zero. You have zero electrons at zero magnetic field. And then I'm not going to talk, I won't have time to talk about these, but fortunately, actually, there are going to be talks by both Sento and Hujitio Koshino on both of these systems. Maybe just put it in the very back of your head that I would have said that these are nearly more textable. More textable. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. I just want to thank all my collaborators. Yeah, so you know, it says vortex in the condition enables you to write down those in like states like a super potential. Uh suppose you don't have a voltage of the back. You know, numerically it seems like it and in some situations it may still support factual or the state. So what is there a is there an any other
