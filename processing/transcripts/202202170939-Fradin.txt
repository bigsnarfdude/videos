Thank you so much to the organiser for letting me sit in on those talks. So I'm not at all in the field of immunology, but what we do in my lab has so we're interested in diffusion in cells in general and this has led us to a number of projects that were related to signaling. And so although the systems I'm going to talk about are very different from the one we've heard, there are some common themes that appear. So what I want to talk about What I want to talk to you about today is our work that we've done on morphogens and two morphogens in particular. Oops, sorry. Something, but not the right thing. Biquid and capiquid. So the morphogens are the answer to a very important question in development, which is how do cells know where they are in a tissue and what time it is, and how can they in response to this. In response to this, so they need this information because they need to be able to differentiate according to this time and position. So, the answer to this question is a type of molecule called morphogens. And morphogens, by definitions, are substances which, first of all, form special concentration or activity gradients. And here, as an illustration, is the concentration gradient formed by Bicoid, one of those morphogenes. By Bicoid, one of those morphogens we're interested in. So, this is a fly embryo about one hour into development, and you can see this very high concentration at the anterior pole, very low concentration at the posterior pore. Those are nuclei that are in the cortical region of the embryo at this stage. The second characteristic of morphogens is they are able to elicit some kind of response in the cell in a way which In a way which is either concentration or activity dependent. And here again, as an illustration, is the transcriptional response which is elicited by bicoid in the fly embryo. So you see here expression of one of the target gene hunchback in this case. And the target gene is being expressed in region where liquids at higher concentration, there's no expression in the low concentration region. So there's an So there's an interesting, from my point of view of diffusion and how signal is transmitted, there's difference in time scale here. So the establishment of this gradient takes place on large scales, spatial scales, but also larger time scales, so about an hour to establish the gradient. Whereas as we're going to see, the response, the transcriptional response, is very rapid. In the order of minutes, you can make these decisions of Make these decisions of expressing or repressing a gene. So, the three proteins you're going to hear about are Biquoid, Capico, and Hunchback, and I just want to say a quick word about them. So, this is a time scale of the very early fly development between egg laying and until cellularization begins about two hours into development. Development. You see that when the egg is laid by the mother, there's only one nucleus. But then this is followed by a very quick succession of nuclear divisions. And at this point, we're still talking about a single cell, so the flambo is quite special. There's no cellularization until nuclear cycle 14. So here we still have a very large single cell, but with a lot of nuclei which are arranged at the periphery in the cortical area of the embryo. In the cortical area of the embryo. So, here this is like we've seen in the previous image, this is a section of the embryo, but these nuclei are there in 3D arrange just below the membrane of the embryo. So, Bicoid establishes its gradient during the first hour of development, and then in the second hour, as we go through this maternal to zygotic transition of gene expression, it starts being used as. It starts being used as a transcription factor because biquid is not all morphogens are like this, but biquid is a transcription factor, so it acts very directly on gene expression. And this is this part that I want to talk a little bit more today. There's a second morphogen we are interested in as well, which is a little bit less well known, and that's capicua. So, capicua is a very different shape of gradient, it's being the gradient. Of gradient, it's being the gradient is formed by localized degradation of the protein. So, Capicua is expressed throughout the embryo, but then it's being degraded at either pole and it works as a repressor. So, the gene package genes of Capicua are being repressed in the middle of the embryo, where Capicua has a higher concentration, and so it's involved in terminal region specification with its target gene being expressed at the terminal. Being expressed at the terminal regions. So, both of those, sorry, Len, could have been called master regulator of transcription, but not so much because they work on their own, as we're going to see, they very much don't, but because they have such a large influence over later, they are kind of the first, they are amongst the first morphogens which are acting on the embryo and setting this very general region of transcription. So, what's really very nice with the fly embryo is you can do both genetic work and microscopy work, and you can do a lot of quantitative analysis of what's going on, in particular, in terms of this transcriptional activation at the early stage. And so what's been done in the lab of our collaborator, Nathalie Dostatny, in Paris, is that they have used this MS2 MCP system to visualize transcription of. Transcription of target gene from bicoid in vivo in live embryos. So it's work as you insert into the genome this synthetic gene that has the promoter of one of the target gene of Biquin, so hunchback in this case, and it's followed, instead of being followed by the gene itself, it's followed by a sequence that codes for some messenger RNA that forms loops, and these loops have That forms loops, and these loops have a very strong affinity for the coat protein. And this coat protein, if you have it expressed by the embryo as a GFP fusion, then you get a very strong fluorescent signal in response to this transcription event as the transcription occurs. So here is an example of a movie that you get with this method. So now we're looking at, so we're looking at, so if the embryo is a football, you're looking at the Football, you're looking at the very lower part of the football, like just below the membrane in the middle of the embryo. This ah, oh, it's working now. Wait, okay, so this line here roughly indicates the middle of the embryo. You're seeing nuclei here because the histones have been labeled with a red fluorescent protein. And if we play the movie, we play the movie, you can see that. The movie, you can see that you're gonna see that we're going to go through a number of nuclear divisions. And after the division, you start seeing the expression in some of the nuclei that occurs at one precise position in each of the nucleus that are in this region here on the left, which is towards the anterior part of the embryo. So again, we see this just like the image. This, just like the image I showed earlier, we should see this difference between the region where the gene is being expressed and the region where it's not being expressed, which varies. So there's of course a lot of information in movie like this, and so the first thing that needs to be done is to do some image analysis to recover some of this information in some form. So I'm letting it run. We're now in nuclear. I'm letting it run. We're now in nuclear cycle 14, and you see that the nuclear cycle starts getting longer as we go. So there's some pretty involved image analysis, which in this case has been done by Huitran, who was a postdoc in the lab of Alexandra Valzak. So you start by segmenting the nuclei, then you look for the spot if there is one, and then you can follow this spot in space and time. And for example, you can look at the For example, you can look at the dynamic of transcription, and that's work that has been done in Alexandra's lab. So I tend to think of this information like this. So this would be a representation of the position of all the nuclei that have been tracked in a particular movie, both in space, like along the x-axis, and in time along the vertical axis. So here we're covering not quite the whole length of the embryo, but we're looking at the middle part, so 50. We're looking at the middle part, so 50% is the mid-embryo, and we're following it for about an hour. So each of these spots here is the nuclei that has been detected, and when the spots are colored, are filled, it means that transcription is being detected in that particular nucleus. So here we see that we can see a lot of information. So first of all, we clearly see the nuclear division when the number of nuclei roughly doubles. Roughly doubles, then we can detect this region where that delimitates a region where all the nuclei express the reporter gene during this particular nuclear cycle versus a region where none of the nuclei express the gene. And we see that this region, it changes position slightly, it also changes width. So we have here in nuclear cycle 14, for example, what we call Cycle 14, for example, where we call a very precise response because the embryo is able to discriminate over a very short distance whether or not it should be expressing this particular target gene. We also see interesting, we see over which period of time this decision is being taken. So between the first nucleus that decides to express the target gene versus the last one that in the Versus the last one in the region of those who decide to express it, you know, what is this zone of confusion in terms of time where the decision is being made? And we can also do trust analysis, I already mentioned. So I want to, so that's one type of measurements that we have, thanks to our collaborator, which contains a lot of information. So what we do more specifically in my lab is we're interested in measuring the diffusion of those proteins in general and these morphogens in particular. Proteins in general and these morphogens in particular. So, we used the technique that was described a few days ago, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. We just use, in fact, a simpler version of it because in our experiments, in this one, we only have one excitation color, so we only see one type of molecule, or protein of interest. So, the principle has been explained. So, you have a very small area of detection. As fluorescent objects diffuse through this area, we see a fluorescent. Through this area, we see a fluctuation in the signal. Now, if we had only one molecule at a time, we could do single molecule detection. And the duration of that fluctuation would tell us something about the diffusion coefficient of the molecule in this case. In reality, we have many molecules at the same time coming in and out, so we have some kind of noisy signal, and that's where they're calculating the autocorrelation. That's why the calculating the autocorrelation that you've seen before is useful because they contain information both about the dynamic of the particle, so this characteristic time over which the correlation decay corresponds to the average transit time of the molecule through that small detection volume. So they are inversely related to diffusion coefficients. And also very interesting, the amplitude of that correlation function is inversely related to the average number of fluorescent molecules in the detection. Of fluorescent molecules in the detection volume. So, these methods are actually also a way of measuring concentration in an absolute way. We're getting an absolute concentration if we do the measurement correctly. And that's also very interesting information when we talk about transcription factor. So, these example measurements have been done in vitro with some very nice little behavior. You will see curve in the embryo a little bit more noisy. So, typically, we would do experiments like this. Typically, we would do experiments like this. So, we have the live embryo stuck on a cover slip, and we are doing our experiments inside the nucleus, one of the nuclei, which is on the bottom part of the embryo, so either at the anterior or in the mid-embryo. So, when we started those type of experiments about 10 years ago, we were focusing on the anterior pole of the embryo because that's where we get the most signal, that's where we were working with bicoid, and that's where the concentration is the highest. Is the highest. And we also were very careful to work with very low excitation intensity, so we'd stand as little light as possible in the embryo because we didn't want to do any photo bleaching of our dye. And then we were getting curls, which was very nice. They were quite noisy. And you see that from this earlier work, we could see that the diffusion coefficient was on the order of 5 micrometers squared per second. And we got concentration at the entire pole of about 100 nanomolar. And these were both really. And these were both a reasonable number and they were interesting in terms of the grade information, for example. Now, we've revisited this work a little bit recently, and we've adopted quite a different strategy where we work in mid-embryo instead. And so the signal, we have less molecule there, but it doesn't matter so much. But we've also really increased our excitation intensity, which in a way is bad because what you can see is so if we Way is bad because what you can see is: so, if we take measurements in this nucleus, for example, after a series of measurements, the fluorescence has completely disappeared because we've destroyed the fluorescence of all the mercuries we are looking at. But in terms of curve, we get much nicer autocorrelation function because our signal to noise is much higher. We also get here a new, in addition to the decay that's due to the diffusion of the molecule, we get a decay that's due to the change in intensity of the signal over time due to. In intensity of the signal over time to do photo bleaching, but what we've learned to account for that, and then we can interpret this part of the curve, which is now much nicer. And that has led us to revisit addition coefficient being a little bit higher. But most of all, what has allowed us to do now is to try and apply models of diffusion that are a little bit more complex because now we can discriminate between different types of diffusion going on. Going on in the embryo, as I'm going to show you in a second. So I don't want to take time on this, but as I mentioned, we can also use FCS to measure concentration. And just to mention quickly that interestingly, we measured concentration for these two very different morphogen, the activator bicoid and the reprocell capicular, and for both of them in the region of the embryo where Of them in the region of the embryo where they are most concentrated, we find concentrations that are on the order of 100 to 200 nanomoles. So, this gives us an idea of what kind of concentration you need for this role to be active efficiently. And at the border, where you're just at the border between expression, so the threshold concentration for expression versus sorry, repression, non-repression are actually. Repression or non-repression or activation versus non-activation is more on the order of 5 to 10 nanomolar. And it's very similar for both proteins. So I told you that from the live imaging experiments, we could have some information about how fast this repression or activation happens. So just to show you the result here for Bicoid, so this is the, this shows So this shows you the fraction of nuclei expressing the target gene as a function of time right at the border. And we see that this happens in about two minutes, two or three minutes. Now a similar experiment has been done in the lab of our collaborator Stas Schwassman for Capicua. And in this case, we're talking about repression. And this is a complex experiment. I don't want to talk about it because it would take too long. But basically, they activate the repression activity. Activate the repression activity of capicuria at a certain time here at time zero, and we see that the repression of the gene again occurs in a few minutes. So, we really again find this very nice coincidence in behavior between these two different proteins. So, I'm going to skip this for time a sec. Now, the other information is about precision. So, if we look at the at the If we look at the width of this border, and this is the experimental result here for bicoid, so you look at, as a function of position in the embryo, whether you have activation or no activation here in response to bicoid. And so what is the width of this border and which change in bicoid concentration does it correspond to? And this tells us how precise the reading of the concentration of bicoid is by the target gene. And when you do this, you find that for bicoid. When you do this, you find that for bicoid, the error on the measure amount of the concentration of bicoid is about 10%, which is remarkably small. So of course, so you can also think of it as, you know, how does the activation work, what is the, sorry, the expression as a function of liquid concentration. And you see those hill plots. And so this is work that wasn't done by us, but a very nice work. Wasn't done by us, but a very nice work in the lab of Paolo Bisch. And so, what you can see is there is you can interpret this very sharp response as a cooperative effect, and the Hill coefficients that you retrieve are on the order of six, and they vary over time. And that's also an interesting question that I'm not going to go into right now unless you ask me. So, there's this evidence of cooperativity in the behavior of pico it's and other evidence of And other evidence of cooperativity is if you look at the promoter region of hunchback, there's a number of binding sites for biquid. There is at least six of them in the proximal region of the promoter with different binding affinity. There's also a bunch of other binding sites for other transcription factors, and we go back to the idea that bicoid is certainly not doing this alone. There is also in vitro evidence that bicoid is binding DNA cooperatively, so you can reproduce this in vitro with just the DNA. Produce this in vitro with just the DNA and the protein, so it must be able to do that. It is some cooperativity, it needs to be able to enact on its own. So now that we have all this number about diffusion and concentration, it's kind of interesting to think about the limit to precision that was thought about first by Berg and Purcell. So there's this Berg and Purcell limit to precision that's basically saying, okay, if I'm a If I'm a gene and I need to make a decision about expression based on the concentration of a promoter, then I need to be able to count, somehow I need to be able to count how many of these molecules arrive close to me, and I count them, and I make my decision based on this counting. And so then you get to this kind of error analysis that the precision on the reading should go as, could not be better than 1 over square root of n, where n is the number. Square root of n, where n is the number of proteins or morphogen transcription factor that arrives at the binding site. And we know this from the Sonyshovsky equation. So we can, and we have all the numbers now, we can approximate them. So if we enter our diffusion coefficient, the size of the single base pair, which is where the transitional vector is targeting, the concentration at the border, and the time. Border and the time in which the reading occurs, what we see is that we shouldn't be able to have a precision better than 33%, but of course, we see that we have a precision about 10%. And so here you can actually argue about those numbers. Like I told you, we actually think the dipshit is a bit higher. The concentration measurement has some error on it. What is the size of the target is also a matter of debate. So you can play with this number, but what it's really telling us is it operates really close to that. It operates really close to that limit. And so, and it's interesting to see how, but it motivates us to see if there was, you know, other, if there were any tricks that the transcription factor could be playing in order to increase this precision. So, one possible trick would be to have some kind of transcriptional memory where the nuclei kind of retain memory of whether or not they were expressing the gene in a Whether or not they were expressing the gene in a previous nuclear cycle. And with the type of data you collect about transcription, you could say, yes, we could look into these things. So here, for example, you see the trajectory of a single clone. So in nuclear cycle one, one of the daughter cells decided to express the gene, and cycle 12, now the two daughter cells did, the other one don't. So you could say, oh yeah, it looks like maybe there is some memory. But you have to, one really confounding factor here is that there is also spatial information here. That there is also spatial information here. So, this daughter's cell was more toward the anterior, so it's actually exposed to a higher concentration of liquid. So, it's actually really hard to test this hypothesis correctly. So, what we ended up doing is just looking at simply at the probability for nuclei at certain positions to express the gene, the target gene. So, anterior, you have a hundred percent chance of expressing the gene, posterior. Chance of expressing the gene, posterior 0% chance of expressing the gene, and here you've got this region, this border region. And now we compare that to the probability of expression for cells that, for nuclei, sorry, that had mother, which were already expressing the gene, and for nuclei that had mother that were not expressing the gene. And you can look at this at different cycles or different embryo, and we can never very clearly see any evidence of memory. So maybe it's there. It's been seen for other genes. It's been seen for other genes, for other morphogens in later stages, but certainly we don't see any evidence of it. So, what we then explored is the idea that maybe the target search for the target gene by the transcription factor could be a little bit more efficient than what is just assumed when you use the Smoleshowski equation, which is just a three-dimensional search for a target. At the position in the nucleus. So, the first idea that came to mind when you're looking to the literature is that maybe the search dimensionality is being reduced by the transcription factor associating with the DNA nonspecifically and then sliding along the DNA in search of the target gene along a one-dimensional track instead of in three. Dimensional track instead of in three-dimensional. And you can show, and in this case, from our experimental point of view, we should see both free protein and bound protein. And you can show that in this case, the search, so the rate at which you find your target, is changed because you have less, you somehow reduce the overall mobility of your protein because this sliding is slow here, but you basically increase the size of your target because now if The size of your target because now, even if you land a little bit away from your target gene, you're going to find it by diffusion. So, under certain circumstances, this can be a big advantage. And we can search for that in our curve. So, if here I showed a bunch of FCS curves that we record for capicuia, for bicoid, for a control, which is just basically the fluorescent protein. And sorry, and those lines here are. Those lines here are a fit with a model that takes into account the possibility that we have a binding event and partial immobilization of the protein. And you see it especially well, I think, in those blue curves that are collected at a later time, there is two bumps here that corresponds to two different dynamics. And those corresponds to, could corresponds to protein that passed through a detection volume unimpaired, and some that had to stop because they did really. To stop because they did a little search here along the DNA. And so if you look at the kind of, so then we from this, we can then measure things like the diffusion coefficient of the pre-protein and the k-on and k off associated with the association and dissociation from the DNA. And you see that if that's what we're seeing, then we're measuring residence time on the DNA due to non-specific binding of a few hundred milliseconds. Milliseconds. And what doesn't quite work well with this model is that we also see, so where we're plotting here, is we see this is the fraction of protein that are freely diffusing, that are not associated with DNA. And we see this changing over time when we repeat our experiments in the same nucleus. And this doesn't make sense because there's no reason why this would change over time. And the kind of time scale with which things change. With which things change here is the same time scale as which we photo glitch the protein. And here, if we just associate this association, this is so fast, 100 milliseconds or so, that we shouldn't see a difference between bleaching one or bleaching the other population because they interchange so fast. So, this is something that always bothered me as we were thinking of the data this way. So, a second hypothesis is the formation of Is the formation of condensed set by, so a modern hypothesis, formation of condensed set by the transcription factor. So all transcription, almost all transcription factor, seems to have a highly disordered, intrinsically disordered region. So here, for Biquid and Capicia, for example, there is a small region that has been, for which we have the structure, that's the DNA binding region, and then it's flanked on either side by region that have very high probability of being disordered. Of being disordered. So, this is true for picuid, it's true for capiqua, this is true for almost any transcription factor that you look into. And of course, we can also now look at the alpha fold structure. And again, you see here this DNA binding region, which is really being overwhelmed by a part of the protein that is unstructured. And so, this, of course, makes it likely that there is some kind of condensate formation. And in the case of Bicoid, there's some single particle. There's some single particle experiments that are very tantalizing in that respect because you see some kind of hubs that the protein is participating into. Anyway, so in this case we can think of our data in a second way saying okay we see this second slower dynamic in our data but maybe in addition to the free protein we just have protein that participates in this little content set and in our case this content set has to be moving because That have to be moving because, if not, they wouldn't appear in our curves as signal. So, now we have two components in two diffusion components in our data. We should have the one of the free protein, the one of the condensate. And then our correlation function is just the sum of two terms. And if we analyze the data this way, we get feed that are equally good. So from the feed, it's not possible to distinguish between these two models. Possible to distinguish between these two models. And we get here a number of time scales. So, what's important, sorry, there's a lot of data here, but is that we retrieve the diffusion coefficient for the two components. So, the freely diffusing protein has a diffusion coefficient of 20-30 micrometers squared per second. I'm almost done. The condensates have a different coefficient which is about 100 times smaller, which indicate that they are at most 100. That they are at most 100 times larger in size. And here we get the fraction of free protein, and this goes up, but this time this doesn't bother us because this time we don't think we have a quick interchange between these two populations, or at least not as quick. And so in this case, if we bleach, we're going to bleach, we're going to reduce the intensity of the condensate, and that has the brightness of this condensate as a really big wave. the Sconan set has a really big weight in how the correlation function in how the two components in the correlation function compare to each other. So as we reduce the intensity of this component, even with this condensate, even though they are still there and we still see them, we do expect this exact behavior here. So to prove this, we've done simulation that shows that that's what we expect. And so that's why we think that out of those two models, the second one is Second one is certainly the one that describes our data better. So, what we would like to see now is that you think, okay, we've seen those beautiful movie of condensates in other systems where you can see them so clearly and they fuse and they... So can we see them in the nucleus? If we can detect them in our experiments, can we see them? So we can't really see them. So this is a kind of high-resolution confocal image of a nucleus expressing big width, and you cannot see anything very clear. And you cannot see anything very clear. This is my last slide. This is a simulation of a nucleus that would have two diffusing components, one slower and brighter than the other. And you see that if the condensate only has something like five or six bicoid molecules, and maybe in addition it has a lot of other types of protein, of course, because there's no reason to think that those corner sets only have one type of protein in them. Protein in them, then we actually don't expect to see them very clearly. So, no, we don't see them, but this is not, this doesn't mean that they don't exist. And that's why I think the power of fluorescence correlation spectroscopy is we are able to, not directly, but we are able to tease out the existence of such components. So, yes, so in conclusion, I think what was surprising for us is to see how similar the behavior of the To see how similar the behavior of this repressed an activator were in terms of dynamic, in terms of diffusion, in terms of concentration, and this pointing to some general mechanism. And so the other thing that I think is really exciting is this possibility that we detect those condon sets. And again, that points to a more general mechanism. And a question I have, and can't answer on my own, is, you know, how is that related to cooperativity? Because now we're forming this condon set. We're forming this condensed set. From what we see, there's not 30 molecules of liquid in there. If not, we would see them more clearly. So they have to be a small number of liquid, maybe six. So how is that related to the cooperative behavior that has been detected for a long time? And yes, and that's where I leave it off. Thank you for your attention. So we're a bit late. So we're a bit late. Maybe just one quick question. Does anybody have a question on Zoom? This is what I should say. Go, Anton. Just quick question. Okay, very quick. So can you explain again how the condensation of transcription factor increases the accuracy of concentration sensing. And it's a current your point. Well, I don't know. You tell me. Well, okay, so I think the idea of having a hub that would be right at your transcription site would be that the local concentration of biquid is higher. So if you just naively go back to the Berg prosthel limit, it's like, you know, which concentration do you enter in this formula? Do you enter the average concentration over the nucleus or do you enter the Over the nucleus, or do you want enter the local concentration that the site is exposed to? Now, you still have to form this hub. So, I don't think we can, in fact, just use that formula and plug in the concentration of the. But that's how I think about it, is it allows for... But another interesting thought is this, is that, so we know that the target search, like the facilitated diffusion along the Facilitated diffusion along the DNA would increase, like would make things quicker. Now, and this type of behavior has been observed very well in bacteria, for example. But it still remains a bit of a mystery how, if you have a single transcription factor sliding along the DNA, and you know, this DNA has all these other things attached to it, how on earth do you actually search? Because you're going to bump into the other thing, and there's all this obstacle. Now, if what's searching along the DNA, If what's searching along the DNA is not a single transcription factor, but it's a condon set, it's a droplet basically. Now, I think that could explain how you could see a droplet being sliding along the DNA and searching a larger area than just the one. And I think so maybe combining those two ideas, you know, I don't know, that's how I think of it. I I have of course zero evidence of that, but um Evidence of that. But I think that there are ways you, and I think that's why it would be really interesting to go and do a bit of modeling now and see if some of those ideas could pan out or if they're just crazy thoughts. Actually, I think it's quite modelable. Quite what? Quite modelable. So so as soon as we stop here for the sake of time and morning, but you are the boss. You are the boss. I'm the boss. Okay, so thank you, Cecile. Okay, so thank you, Cecile. Okay. Okay, so next talk on Zoom by Carmen Monda Paris.
