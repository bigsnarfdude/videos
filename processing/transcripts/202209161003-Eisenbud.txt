Uh I have a big uh sling around my arm. I had shoulder surgery two weeks ago, so it didn't seem possible to make the trip this time, but another time I hope to be there in person again. I hope it's beautiful weather and you've been having fun. The talk that I'm going to give is joint work with Hailong Dao. Let's see if this will write. Yes, good. And we've been having fun doing a lot of experimenting and some proving. And I'm going to tell you what we've learned from the experiments, if they're true, and some of what we've proved. So, first, however, let me remind you. So, first, however, let me remind you who Lindsay Birch is. I think the history is rather fun. Lindsay Birch was an undergraduate at Cambridge in England, got a PhD under David Rees. She was born in 1939. As far as I know, she's still alive and in retirement. Three things she did are rather well known in our community. The Hilbert Birch and the The Hilbert Birch, and there are only about four or five papers altogether, so they were pretty much everyone a hit. The Hilbert Birch theorem, which characterizes ideals of projective dimension one. The fact that three generator ideals can have more or less arbitrary embedded components and trouble. This is a predecessor of Brunz's wonderful theorem that Theorem that every free resolution is the resolution of a three-generator ideal, which you probably all know. And then one slightly less well-known, that the analytic spread of an ideal is bounded by some expression involving the depths of powers of the ideal. So those are the three well-known theorems. But she did another thing, which is what Another thing, which is what Dow picked up on in an earlier paper, and studied the condition that if you have an ideal I, let's say in a regular local ring, that will be my standard situation, though you can do it much more generally, then when is I times M not equal to M times I colon M? So I colon M, of course, is the sockle of S mod I. Soccle of S mod I, or really I colon M mod I is the soccle of S mod I. So there better be a soccle for this to be interesting, otherwise I colon M will just be M, just be I rather, and this will always be an equality. So we're talking about rings S mod I of depth zero to get started. And I don't really like depth zero rings as much as I like Artinian rings, so I'm going to usually assume that S mod I going to usually assume that s mod i is actually artinian but it it doesn't matter very much and most of the things i say will be true very generally in that case so dow began saying that r s mod i is birch in this case if i m is not equal to m colon i m and it's maybe worth drawing for you my standard picture of what Standard picture of what this means. Let's see if this will work. Come on. I want another page. There we are. So I think of a ring as having one at the top. I don't know why. I need a white drawing implement, one at the top. And then there's the maximal ideal in some layer. Obviously, I think about graded rings more than I think about local rings, but But the picture will do. And then somewhere here, if it's an Artinian ring, maybe, so this is a sort of schematic picture of R, which is S mod I, maybe Artinian. Then down here is I. This is really a picture of S. Here's I. And a little bit below it is A little bit below it is m times i. Obviously, i isn't usually generated in a single degree, but it might be. And then there's the soccle, which sort of sticks up a little. So the question is whether the maximal ideal pushes all of the soccle all the way down into mi, or whether you get some minimal generators of i as multiples of soccer elements times Of soccer elements times elements of the maximal ideal. So that's really the question of whether the ring is birch or not. Now, it turns out to be convenient to, why didn't I make lots of these in advance, to actually quantify how much a ring is birch. So if you look at this funny looking quotient, i times m colon m colon i colon m right so that's the stuff that pushes the sockle all the way into i m that obviously contains m squared because m pushes m into i and then the second m pushes i into i m so this contains the maximal ideal squared and it's contained in the maximal ideal itself so there's a rather thin So there's a rather thin sandwich there. m mod m squared is a vector space. So it's convenient to set the birch index of i to be the dimension of m modulo, this funny quotient, im colon, i colon m. Takes a little bit to get used to this quotient. I'm going to abbreviate it as capital B of I, the merch ideal of I. The birch ideal of I. So that's this is the birch index. And B of I greater than 1 means the ring is birch. Okay, so you might ask, are there any of these ideals actually? Any of these ideals actually. For example, the picture I drew is in a way really a picture of a power of the maximum ideal in the regular local ring. So, e.g., if you take a power m to the d inside s, s is always going to be regular local for me. Then this is obviously birch and has big birch index because m to the d colon m. colon m is m to the d minus 1 and m times m to the d minus 1 is just m, not m to the d. So here, the Birch index of s mod m to the d is just the number of generators of m. All of the Birch idealists contained in m squared. So this is the EDIM of S. That's a kind of trivial example. You might wonder whether this is sort of Wonder whether this is sort of a normal condition or not. And there was one, oops, something happened. There's one case in which it's easy to characterize the Birch index. So again, in the case of Hilbert Birch, so if I is an ideal with projective dimension one, so I is the minors of some matrix. is the minors of some matrix sub n, I'll call it of a matrix A, where A is n by n plus 1. And I can take A to be with entries in the maximal ideal, I1 of A in the maximal ideal. I'll say A is minimal in that case. Then the Birch index of I over of S mod I I guess I'm going to confuse this. I'll explain why in a minute. Birch of i, I think of as the same as the birch of s mod i is the dimension of the space of linear forms in some sense in the matrix A. So is the dimension of I1 of A. The ideal of elements. The ideal of elements, entries of A, modulo m squared. So if you have a matrix with, you know, generators of the maximal ideal in it, then you get Birch index equal to the embedding dimension. If it has just one linear form sticking out somewhere, then it's Birch index 1, etc. And this works perfectly well in the local case. This has nothing to do with grade. This has nothing to do with graded, clearly. But I think of these as linear forms. Of course, in the associated graded ring, that's what they would be. So this shows that there are some Birch rings and some non-Birch rings. You might also ask about common geometric rings. So for example, you could take generic points, D generic points. Let's say gamma is D generic points in P2. generic points in P2. Well, the coordinate ring of gamma is not Artinian, has no soccle, so we have to factor out a linear form, x general x. So when is that birch? And it's almost always birch, and in fact almost always has birch index 2, which is the maximum it could have. The exceptions, how many of you will recognize? How many of you will recognize this sequence? Two points, that's a complete intersection. Four points, another complete intersection. 24 points, hmm, and 60 points, and the exceptions go on. In fact, so this is Birch index equals 2, except for for d equals 2 and d equal to 2s plus 1 choose 2 plus s for odd s. And if I calculated correctly, that leads to this funny sequence of numbers. So almost all the time a general set of points in P A general set of points in P2 is birch index 2. Now I've said that for a general set of points, and then I had to factor out x in linear form. So the right definition of birch has nothing to do with depth 0. You can say that a general ring R is Birch. Well, before it seemed to depend on a presentation, so I'll say if So I'll say if R hat looks like S mod I for regular local ring R, Cohen presentation. And then I take R mod, a maximal regular sequence, maximal linear regular sequence is birch. So that makes a general definition. Makes a general definition out of it. The generality is sort of spurious here, but this shows that it's a condition you can apply to any ring, any local ring. And you might worry, does this depend on the Cohen presentation and sort of standard arguments? So that it does not. So independent. And in fact, the Birch index, so B of not B. Of not b of i, but little b of i, the birch index, is independent of the presentation. And this is supposed to be a general regular sequence. So that's how to make this look more like modern mathematics and less like old mathematics. Now, the second part of my title had to do Second part of my title had to do with soccer summons, and I want to change to that now and make the connection. So what do I mean by a soccer sum n? Module M, well again, only the depth interesting, depth zero case is interesting, or the case of the module of an Artinian ring is really what I usually will have. Really, what I usually will have. So, an R module M could have has a soccle. Soc M by definition is the zero element of M colon the maximal ideal of R. I'll just write the maximal ideal script M for all maximal ideals, and I'm sure no one will be confused. Why is it the sockle? Does everybody remember the architectural term? Architectural term: if you have a pillar, it sits on a kind of a base, and the architectural term for that is the soccle of the pillar. And in the same way, the soccle of a module is sort of the bottom of the module, at least that's how I think of it. Okay, and it's possible that this, some element of this soccer generates a direct sum end of m. Direct sum end of M. So a soccer sum end is just a copy of the residue field K, which is our mod maximal ideal, that divides, let's try that again. Yeah, come on, that divides M as a direct sum end. Sum end. I'll use this symbol for direct sum ends. Okay, so that's what a soccle sum end is. And syzygies of something might have a soccle sum end. So I'll say that the kth syzygy of M has M has a soccle sum end. If it does, but let me remind you what the case is in this sense sum end. If, well, you take a minimal resolution of m over r and then everything is unique. And the kth syzygy is, of course, the image of the k-th map and the resolution. So k-th syzygy. So k sys g. Well, I'll write sys sub k of m is image of phi k. And then that might have a soccer summit or not. Now, you might be thinking, well, this has got to be a pretty rare phenomenon. It's actually much more common than I would have supposed, and this was shown by brute experience. Shown by brute experimentation using Macaulay 2. I'll tell you some actual experiments in a moment, but let me connect this first with Birch. So R is Birch. And now again, R will be S mod I. If the I don't need to do it, I'm going to use the same thing. Uh well, I don't need that actually. If the second syzygy, and I'll say the second R syzygy, I'm thinking it over R, not over S, R syzygy of K has a soccle sum end. This is if and only if. So that shows how common and how rare it is in a way to be birched. For example, if you had a Gorenstein ring R, then because you can dualize resolutions, any module with a Soccer sum n has to be a an Artinian Gorenstein ring, let's say. Any module with a Soccle sum n has to be decomposable. I meant has to be decomposable. And one of the components has to be one of the co-syzergies of the residue field. So Gorenstein rings are never Birch, except for singular hypersurfaces, where this is all rather trivial. But this is at least a connection between Sokol Samens and Birchness. So talks should have at least one proof in them, and I thought I would. Least one proof in them, and I thought I would prove this. So, proof. What does the resolution of K as a module over R look like? It's easy to get started. We have R mapping to K. This is very well-known stuff. And of course, if there are N generators at the maximal ideal, we have all. generators of the maximal ideal. We have Rn here, and these are the generators of the maximal ideal. I'll call them X. And then what about the next step? So this resolution, as you know, is complicated as it goes back. This was the study of the subject of infinitely many papers, and we still don't know very well what happens in it. But at least the next step is quite easy. So in the next step, Easy. So in the next step, this is now the minimal resolution that I'm writing down. Of course, you have the Kazul syzygies, edge 2 of Rn. And the other component is a copy I'll call R to the G, where I has G minimal generators, I minimally generated by G elements. And you write And you write the minimal generators of I as this row of variables times a matrix A, and then this is the matrix A. Okay? So you can express the generators of I in terms of the maximal ideal generators, obviously, with A as a matrix over R. Over R. And that's the beginning of the minimal resolution. So where is the Soccle sum n going to come from? If I is contained in the square of the maximal ideal, then the Soccle summ n certainly is not going to come from the Kazool map. I call this map K, that's unwise. Alpha, the Kazoo map. And big A. And big A for the other, because alpha is a linear map. It involves just the generators of the maximal ideal. So if I is contained in m squared, then alpha doesn't, can't touch the soccle. The image of alpha can't touch the soccle. And remember, what we're looking for is a soccle sum end of the second syzygy. That's the Image of alpha and A. So cis 2 of K is the image of this concatenation alpha A. And how would we recognize a Soccle summe end in this context? It would have to be the image of one of the minimal generators of the free module wedge. of the free module wedge to Rn plus Rg. So Soccle sum end, if it exists, must be the image of a minimal generator of wedge two Rn plus Rg. So So, under reasonable circumstances with I and M squared, by the way, the case of I not contained in M squared is rather trivial, so I'm going to skip it. So, let's assume that we're in the interesting case, I contained in M squared. Then, the soccer sum n can only come from a minimal generator of Rg. And what would that mean? And what would that mean? So, well, we're essentially multiplying A by X. So what we're going to get into is something times the maximal ideal if we compose A with X. So for there to be a soccle sum end, there must be something Be something in Rn which is not thrown into the maximum value by x. Now, it has to be a soccer element, too. What soccle elements are there in the image? This is an exact right exact sequence. So it's clear that the whole soccle of Rn is in the kernel of X and therefore in the image of alpha A. So notice that I colon M M mod I, the soccle, is contained in the kernel of this matrix which I'm calling X, which is the image of the pair alpha A. All right, so we need, what we're looking for is a minimal generator of the soffel, which is not thrown into the maximal, into I. Maximal into IM by the maximal ideal, which is, in other words, sum, so a sock of sum end is an element of. I colon m mod I really which is not which such that an element let's say t such that t times the maximum ideal includes the minimal generator of I. So that says the minimal generator comes from this map A, right? So it says as an element, a generator of Rg, minimal generator of Rg that maps to a soccer element. To the soccer element of Rn. Right? So what I've just proven for you is that if the ring is birch, then there's a minimal generator of Rg, which maps to a soccal element of Rn, and that's going to be a soccle sum end of the second syzygy. So we showed that. So we showed that our birch implies soccer sum end of says two. But if you think about the argument, it's reversible. If you have a soccer sum end, then since it can't come from wedge 2rn, it must come from rg. So a generator of rg. So a generator of Rg maps to the soccle of the kernel. But the soccle of the kernel is the same as the soccle of Rn, so that gives me birch. So this is a reversible argument. Converse is the same argument. Right, so that's the proof that birch is the same as having a soccle sum end in the second syzygy. Now, there are plenty of non-birch rings, as you've seen, but Soccle summons come up rather more often, as I've said. Before I get to that, though, I wanted to state one of our main results, which tells you something which I didn't know even about. Which I didn't know even about the rings that you get by factoring out powers of the maximal ideal. So there's a kind of big distinction. If the Birch index is just one, then you've seen most of the fun already about Soccle summands. I don't know how to characterize other Soccal summands. Although it must be said that once you have a Soccal summand in the second syzygy, then, and I should have said. Then, and I should have said this before, I guess, then you get sakosamens in all higher syzygies. So there's a sakal summon in the third syzygy. It's obvious that there's a sakal summon in the fourth syzygy. And it turns out that the places where there are soccal summons are always a semi-group. So this is a soccer summon in every syzygy of a birch ring, starting with the second. Starting with the second. But the case of when Birch index is at least two, like the case of the generic points or the case of S mod to power the maximal ideal, a much stronger result holds. So suppose again that R is zero-dimensional or Artinian and B And B of R, the birch index, I remind you that's the dimension of M modulo the funny quotient, I m colon, I colon M is at least two. Okay, M, any finitely generated module. Then sis P of M has a sockle sum end. For some p less than or equal to 5, 5 is a funny number, but that's sharp. And all p bigger than or equal to 7. So there are lots of soccer sum n's floating around in this situation. As I say, I didn't even know that for s mod of the power of the maximal ideal. The maximal ideal. And I found it rather surprising to learn. But there it is. And this depends on a, to give credit where credit is too, on a nice lemma of custon and vrasiue. This is a part of the proof, not by any means the whole of the proof. Rossiu. Rossiu. I always have trouble getting the I's and the U's in the right order. They didn't say it this way, but if A is a matrix over S standard notation Such that I1 of A, so the ideal generated by the entries of A, is not contained in the Birch ideal of I. Then the kernel of A tensor S mod I, which is R of course, has a soccle sum end. Has a sockle some end. So this is the source of Soccle summons in a lot of cases. This is not if and only if, but this is a way to produce Soccle summ n's. Remember, the Birch ideal of I contains the square of the maximal ideal. So this definitely requires I1 of A. Definitely requires I1 of A to have linear forms in it, or linear elements of the maximal ideal. So that's a useful fact. And in a sense, the rest of the proof turns on the fact that if the Birch index is at least 2, then the ring mod of the Birch ideal is three-dimensional. And so every codimension 2 ideal 2 ideal satisfies this property. And using that, one can construct a proof of this general theorem. So now let me turn to more speculative matters and begin by telling you the results of two experiments. There's one theorem we can prove in this direction, but a very weak part of what we see. So let's see, where's the first experiment I wanted to show you? I seem only to have written down one of the experiments, but that will do. So let's look at rings of the following peculiar form. So consider all rings of the form polynomial in three variables. We experimented. We experimented a lot with three and four variables. Two variables, as you've seen, is rather trivial because of the theorem about birch rings and one more theorem, which I'll tell you in a moment. But three variables is quite interesting, and four variables is interesting and hard to look at experimentally, harder. Five is really very hard because the resolutions grow so fast. Modulo, well, I want to make an Artinian ring, so I'm going to take some powers of Rings. So I'm going to take some powers of the variables. And by chance, I chose the fifth powers. And then let's say three more forms of degree five. I'll take monomials, M5, M5 prime, maybe M5 double prime, where the M5s are. fives are monomials of degree five. Now there are a lot of rings like that, right? And there's a symmetric group acting on them because the symmetric group on three letters. But Macaulay has a nice facility that Mike Stillman and I wrote for sorting them and choosing one from each orbit of the symmetric group. Of the symmetric group. So we use that facility. So among all such rings, it turns out modulo the action of the symmetric group, S3, there are 557 such examples of these rings. Of those, turns out. Turns out that 198 are birch and therefore we know the soccle summons of all their syzygies. It starts with the second syzygy. I'm always going to talk about the soccle summons of the residue field. Of those examples, thirteen are are rich index greater than or equal to 2, so not so many. However, all of them had a soccal sum end in the fourth syzygy of the residue field. So there are a lot of softwa sum-ins, a lot of There are a lot of sakal samens, a lot of rings with sakal sumens which are not birch, for example, and don't have them because of birchness. Some of these rings had sakal summons already in the third syzygies, some only when you got to the fourth syzygy. But that's the sort of general picture. I tried the same thing with degree four and putting in, I think, four. Putting in, I think, four forms of degree four. And there, there was one ring with no soccle sum ends in any schizygy visible out of the 50 or so examples. So it's certainly possible to not have a soccle sum n, but it's rare. So that's interesting. What else did we learn? Getting there. Getting there. So, what have we seen altogether? So, let's define KSS, the K soccle sums of a ring R, to be the set of integers P such that the cis P of the residue field has a soccle sum end. Okay, so lemma, an easy lemma, KSS of R is a semigroup. Oops. Try that again. That was unexpected. Uh back K S S of R is a semigroup. So, what semigroups have we seen? Possibilities we saw. This is looking at three and four. Looking at three and four variables, we looked at some non-monomial ideals, though it's a lot easier to compute in the monomial case. I'm missing some letters here, possibilities. But we didn't see very many different examples. So the birch case. As I've mentioned, the semigroup is 2, 3, etc., every integer after 2. We've also seen semigroups starting with 3, 3, 4, 5, and everything. This is for, let's say we have n variables, and n actually will be 3 or 4 in the examples. We saw for We saw 4, 5, 6, and everything after. I guess I have to put it as 7 to show that everything came after. And we saw, this is in four variables, sorry, in three variables, but we saw it in four variables also, four, and then skip five, and then six, seven, eight, nine, everything, ten. So the general pattern, the general So, the general pattern, the general conjecture might be every semigroup of the form p plus 1 wherever and also n plus 1 skip n plus 2. Skip n plus 2, n plus 3, forever. Those are the only possibilities we have seen of this birch semigroup or the KSS semigroup. That's a pretty bizarre statement, and we can't prove anything of that kind, except for the semigroup property. Um sorry, I have a leaf blower. Can you hear the leaf blower? Is that a nuisance? Let me see if I think you can go away. I'm on a Zoom call. Would you go somewhere else? When I was a graduate student, I was sitting in a seminar in which MacLean was the boss, and he was, of course, an elderly, distinguished guy at that time already, and somebody outside Eckhart Hall began mowing the lawn. And it was summer, all the windows were open, so this was annoying to MacLean. Open, so this was annoying to MacLean, and he would not put up with that. He stormed out of the room, and pretty soon the mowing stopped. So that's what being a professor is, I guess. Anyway, this is what we've seen. So one last result, and then I'm going to stop. The one case where we understand the resolution of the residue field a little better than other cases is the case of Golid. Of Golid rings. We still don't understand it all that well, I have to say. We can write it down some representation of the minimal resolution, but that's true for any local ring, really. And the one you get from the golden case is you get numerical information, but it's hard to get other information. However, here's one little piece that works. So if R is GOLED, then the Then the goal of embedding dimension n, then cis n plus 1 of k has a soccle sum end. And I believe this result can be pushed a good deal further, but we haven't worked on it yet. So that's what we know. That's what we know, but I must say I was surprised that this was a non-empty subject to begin with, and it turns out to have quite a lot in it. Now, you might ask, what about other summands? Why k? Of course, k is the easiest one to check numerically, computationally, but it's possible to check for a given module whether it's a sum end or not. That's computationally feasible for smallish examples. So one can check. Examples, so one can check other things, and we've done a tiny exploration of that sort, but we don't know very much. And I think the question of how syzygy modules decompose is much more interesting than I had realized. Of course, when you have rings of finite type, you can say they must decompose. But beyond that, I think not so much is known. Anyway, thanks for your attention. Anyway, thanks for your attention, and I will stop here and see if there are any questions which I might be able to see if I stop sharing my screen. Thank you. There we are. Are there any questions from the online participants? So, do you know Golo drinks that are not birch? Oh, uh gold, but not birch. I think I've seen examples, but we've sorted them all kinds of ways to see if we could detect any interesting patterns. But I think it's possible for it to start with n plus 1. So for example, oh, yeah, in fact, it's easy to answer. It's easy to answer that question. Sorry. If you take the case of a projective dimension one ideal, unless it's a complete intersection, it's automatically goalet. Oh, yeah. So such an ideal, not a complete intersection and no linear forms in the matrix, let's say in two variables, Artinian, will have a third syzygy with a sum n, but not a second syzygy. Okay. Okay. And I guess it will have a fifth syzygy and on as well. But I haven't proven that. For questions? Any questions from the people in the room? Let's thank the last speaker of this conference and all the speakers that have been participating in. Thank you all for being part of these adventures. Okay, bye bye. Thank you all. Thanks for organizing the event. Thanks for the organizing.
