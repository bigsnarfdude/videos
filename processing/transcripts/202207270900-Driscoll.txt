Me okay? Yeah. Excellent. So today I'm going to talk to you about more structure formation than pattern formation. And in particular, I'm going to talk to you about how you can use the structures that form when I throw a drop of complex fluid at the ground to actually learn something about how shear thickening and jamming happen. So, of course, I'm not the one who does any of this work. This is my group who's doing it. And in particular, the stuff I'm going to tell you about today is done by my former postdoc, the most of the experiments I'm going to show you. Experiments: I'm going to show you. And then my graduate student, Falguni Schops, actually graduating next week, did almost all of the analysis that I'm going to show you. So, the kinds of problems that I think about are in general, these kind of emergent structures that occur under strong driving and thinking about, you know, ripping things apart or applying really strong forcing and asking how these things destabilize and how I can use that destabilization to learn about the dynamics of these systems. And so, like I said, the thing that I'm going to talk to. And so, like I said, the thing that I'm going to talk to you today is about drop impact. And in particular, I want to think about how using complex fluids affects the way that these materials fail. Like, how does this reality reflect in the structures that form as these things destabilize? So, I think we are all familiar with complex fluids. You know, if they're not, they're all around you. A lot of food products, a lot of beauty products are non-Newtonian materials because these yield stress and things are exploited to make these products better. Are exploited to make these products better. And complex fluid is a really broad space. I just want to highlight the three kinds of reality that I'm going to think about. So, just to get us all on the same page, a Newtonian fluid is a fluid where the viscosity is independent of the shear rate. So, no matter how fast I squeeze this thing, it flows in the same manner. So, it's really different for a non-Newtonian fluid. So, one class of these is a shear-thinning fluid. So, when I squeeze it harder, or I squeeze it faster, it flows more easily. So, catch up. Faster, it flows more easily. So, ketchup is an example of this, and also blood. And then, sheer thicketing fluids, which I hope all of you have played with ooblek or cornstarch and water before. If you haven't, you should go see if they sell some at the store and do it tonight. Because this stuff is really fun. So it flows like a liquid when you're applying those stresses. But then as you start to apply a higher and higher shear rate, it's going to behave more and more as solid-like because this thing shear thickens very strongly. So, in particular, So, in particular, all of these kinds of interesting behaviors occur at very high shear rates. And so, this is why I would argue that drop impact is a really good system to study this because it's a way to actually get shear rates much, much higher than you can easily access in a rheometer. So, just to orient you, first, I just want to talk a teeny bit about Newtonian splashing, which is a huge field of study, and there's actually a lot of interesting histories there, a lot to do with splashing. But here we're going to think about a really simple case where a drop just falls and hits the surface. Where a drop just falls and hits the surface. So, this is a high-speed movie of a somewhat viscous drop, about eight times the viscosity of water. It hits the surface and spreads out. And what's really nice about this is you can actually use this really simple measure of how far the drop spread out to learn about the dynamics of the impact. Because before the drop hit, everything was kinetic energy. And then, after the drop hits and it spreads, that kinetic energy gets converted into surface energy, or viscous dissipation happens. And so, by just measuring. Dissipation happens. And so, by just measuring this simple thing, how far the drop spreads, you can learn about the impact physics. And, you know, the question I want to ask today is: how do these things change when I use a complex fluid? What if I take a drop of mayonnaise or cornstarch and throw it at the ground? How does it behave differently? And I told you drop impact was a good system to study this because of these high shear rates. And so, just to put a little bit of numbers on this, so these are just dimensional arguments. But if you, for instance, want to make a shear rate, you could say. For instance, once you make a shear rate, you could say the speed the drop is falling at and divide it by the size of the drop, and you get a shear rate of like 1300 inverse seconds. This is really, really high and is actually beyond the working range of a lot of conventional rheometers. If you want to make a stress, it's a little bit harder for me to figure out the right way to do this, but one way you could do it is you could take an energy and divide it by a volume. You do that, you get something like a stress of six kilopascals. So we're really in this like highly non-high range of shear rates, high range of stresses where you would expect. Rates, high range of stresses, where you would expect this non-Newtonian behavior to really manifest. And I'm not the first person who's ever studied these kinds of problems. There's been some work in yield stress fluids and kind of granular drops and non-Brownian suspensions and even a little bit of work in colloidal drops. But a lot of these studies have kind of focused on one range of parameter space, like what happens in a very dense suspension or at a very particular velocity. And what I really wanted to do was to kind of scan the whole range of parameter space and kind of The whole range of parameter space and kind of slowly turn on this non-Newtonian behavior and ask how that modifies the impact. So, the system I'm going to work with is a dense colloidal suspension. So, I just have water and colloids. There's not surfactant or anything else in my suspension. And if you're familiar with these, you might know that this is an ideal way to do what I just said and scan this whole range of parameter space. Because, as you change the volume fraction, you can really sample a whole range of reality. So, in particular, what I'm working with is just a What I'm working with is just silica particles that we make in the lab using the Stober process. They're a little bit less than a micron in size. Here's now the data from just as I take the stuff and put it in the rheometer. And what the different colors are showing you is different volume fractions. So this is the volume of colloids relative to the volume of water. So at lower volume fractions, you can see these curves look very flat. This just behaves like a Newtonian fluid, but with a higher viscosity than it would have. And then as I start to increase the volume fraction, And as I start to increase the volume fraction, I start to get shear thinning. And then as I increase it more, I get shear thickening that becomes stronger and stronger as I increase the volume fraction. Is this a two-dimensional system or three? This is a three-dimensional system. So this is just an SEM image of the particles. So, and they're equisized particles? Yes, they're actually. So the Stober process is great because it lets you make highly monodispersed particles. So like the spread and diameter is just a very small fraction of the size. And we're not seeing a slice. I guess we're seeing they all. Slice. I guess we're seeing they all look equally sized because. No, so like this is you put uh you make a monolay on a surface to do the SEM imaging, but in the experiment, everything is like a false suspension. But they really are quite equally sized. Like chemistry is great. Yeah, so here's the reality. And just to remind you of the numbers, I said maybe the impact stress I could estimate is something like six, 10 kilopascals. So it's like way over here, like beyond what you can do. Over here, like beyond what you can do, and so we're definitely in this high stress limit. And so, you have to be a little bit careful to do these experiments, they're a little bit more tricky than a regular drop impact experiment because now you're working with a shear thickening fluid and you have to figure out how to do that. You have to use a high-speed camera because things are happening very quickly. And then, instead of using kind of a tubing system to make your drops, you actually have to make them one at a time by hand because you really want to worry about whether the particles are going to settle out of the suspension or the densities. Settle out of the suspension or the density is going to change. You really want to know, have good control over your volume fraction. Also, it's really hard to push a shear-thickening fluid through a bunch of tubing. Also, I make these particles in-house so I have, you know, five milliliters of this stuff, not, you know, buckets and buckets of it. So, we want to be a little bit conservative. And then you can change the impact velocity just by moving this pipetter up and down. And we are also, because you've ever worked with high-volume fraction suspensions, you know you've High volume fraction suspensions, you know, you have to worry about them drying out because there's actually not very much water contained in this material. So, we worried about that a lot. So, we do everything in a humidity chamber, it's something like 70% humidity. So, that really slows down the drying rate by a lot. Then we impact them onto a glass plate, which we treat to make it very hydrophilic. So we kind of don't have to worry about wetting conditions. We just want it to be all the way in the fully wetting limit. And so, you know, the question I want to ask is how does this reality change every day? Ask is how does this reality change the impact? And so, here, if I look at the pink curve where the behavior is injustice, it's very Newtonian. Not surprisingly, when the strap hits, it just spreads like a simple Newtonian fluid. And then, if I go to this highest volume fraction where we expect this to be very straightforwarding, we instead get something like this, where you really completely capture this solid-like behavior, and this thing just bounces off the surface like a rubber ball or something. I do need sound effects. That would really enhance that movie. I will think about that for like DFT gallery. So, but what I want to argue is that actually, so these two states are maybe kind of expected. You might have guessed something like this would happen, but what's really exciting is what happens in the in-between and how this transition occurs. So, first, let's start by just looking at the simple metric. I said, let's look at how far the drop spreads when I throw it at the ground. Throw it at the ground. And so all of these different colors again are the volume fraction. So as I go down, I'm increasing volume fraction. As I go right, I'm increasing how hard I'm throwing at the impact velocity. And so you can see there's kind of two branches here, that you have a kind of regular liquid at impact, where as I increase the velocity, it spreads farther because I had more kinetic energy. Or as I go this way, I'm increasing the volume fraction, so I'm increasing the viscosity, so it spreads less. Viscosity, so it spreads less. And then here you see something very, very different starts to happen because this thing is kind of freezing, it's not spreading anymore. So it's actually not changing size at all when it hits. And I don't have time to tell the whole story, but I will say this branch right here where things are liquid at impact are shockingly Newtonian. Like you can rescale this data and use models developed for Newtonian fluids and actually fit it really, really nicely. So it's surprisingly Newtonian, even into the shear-thinning regime. The shared imaging. But I'm going to skip that for now and instead talk about exactly how this solidification happens. And in particular, looking at this transition. So let me show you one of the points in the middle. So this is now very high volume fraction suspension that we would expect to shear thicken, but this is kind of a lower impact velocity. So if we watch this, you can see you kind of get a half and half response. Get a half and half response. You see something that looks a little bit like a solid and a little bit like a liquid. So you see this thing hit, and then the top of it is still very liquidy and kind of falls around the solidified portion. And then as I can do the same experiment, but now I can turn up the impact velocity. And you see that a small, the same thing happened, but a very smaller bit of it remained a liquid. And then if I turn up the impact velocity anymore, that bit gets even tinier, but there's this little liquid bit at the top. So let's try and measure something here. So I'm just going to do a really simple thing, and I'm going to measure the height of this top point. So I'm going to look at the top point of the drop and just ask, how far is that above the ground? I get something that looks like this. So I'm setting time equals zero to be when the drop hits. And then just a measure of the top point of the drop. So you see it decreases and then it remains static at some height. And so you have this constant velocity regime. Have this constant velocity regime, and then it saturates at a constant height. And so, you can now ask what is that velocity? And if I set a line to this and measure the velocity and then compare it to the impact velocity, they're identical. So, what this says is that the top of the drop is still falling. It still really is a liquid. It's not just that it looks like a liquid, like really, it doesn't know that the bottom is hit. It's still behaving as if it was just part of the liquid drop. And so, I think. And so I think it's, you know, a stronger statement to say this really is a solid base that has a liquid now flowing down around it. And we're not the first people to see something like this. There was a study out of the Loser group, I guess, six years ago, where they saw very similar behavior to this. They even have a plot that looks a lot like this in their paper. But you see, their suspensions look quite a bit different. They're like very lumpy looking. I'm not exactly sure why that is, but if I were to speculate, I would say. To speculate, I would say because cornstarch is such a good system for sheer thickening, I think perhaps the drops were not completely liquid when they made them, and they were maybe a little bit thickened already. And so what impacted the surface wasn't a pure liquid. So the behavior was slightly different. So you saw that there was this transition from you have this solid thing with this liquid flowing over. And so let's ask how this thing is becoming a solid. Because we have a really fast camera, so we can really look at this process, how it's happening. Really look at this process, how it's happening. So, here is now a similar drop, but I've now zoomed in on it and I'm filming it much, much faster. So, I'm just going to play this movie on a loop, and I want you to look at the edge of this thing. So, I don't know if you can see it, but there's like two little tiny bumps going up. And also, this projector is not the best for CMAP, but I've made it easier for you to see using the same trick that Kara showed us yesterday. That Kara showed us yesterday: that if you subtract every other image to look at differences, this can be a really powerful way to highlight small changes. So you see here, now that bump corresponds to this white thing moving up. And so now you have a good way to measure things, and you can measure the position of this little bump going up because what that little bump is, it's the solid growing, right? It's the solidification front. And so here I'm showing you the position. I'm showing you the position of the solidification front as a function of time. And I've plotted it as a position on the surface of the draw. And you can see that it moves with a constant velocity. The different colors here are just different experiments under the same conditions. So it's really quite reproducible to measure the solidification front. And so we see we have this front that moves at a constant speed along the surface. And as people right here in this room have seen before, this is the fact that the front moves at a Is the fact that the front moves at a constant speed that's quite a bit faster than the drop is something that's been studied in kind of two-dimensional, even three-dimensional cornstarch systems where you either impact them with the impactor or you kind of push them with a pusher. Sorry, so you mean the tangent velocity is constant or the vertical velocity is constant? The tangent velocity. Like this is the. I mean, because the front is in the entire droplet, right? Yeah. So I would love to know exactly what the front is doing in the drop, and I think it's probably quite. Doing on the drop, and I think it's probably quite complicated because it's interfering with the boundary of the drop. But the edge is moving as if along a circle at constant velocity. Yes, that's what the measurement says. I don't have a really good explanation for why it should be constant along the surface and not constant vertically, but that's what the measurement shows. Yes. Yeah, so I guess maybe you just answered the question that I was about to ask. But if you could look inside the droplet and you say a solidification front, what does that front look like? I don't know. I don't know. So, like, Evo has looked inside of a kind of different system and has some ideas about how, if you have a big kind of bucket of cornstarch and impact it or drag something through it, what that front looks like. And I encourage you to ask him about that. I don't know. I don't even, I don't know. Like, surely right at the moment it hits, you have something very localized. And then you see that it reaches the edges really quickly, but all I can see is what's happening on the edges. So I don't have. What's happening on the edges? So, I don't have a really good way to look at it. We have ideas about how to do that. You can density match these suspensions, but then you're looking at meters per second. Yes, something like that. Yeah. It's much larger than the impact. It's like a factor of like five to ten. It depends on, it depends on the speed and the package. So larger. Yeah. Yeah. And so this is consistent too with what. Yeah, and so this is consistent too with what's been measured in these cordstarch suspensions. So here is showing you the front velocity. So yeah, so it's something like, I don't know, 10 to 50 meters a second. And the impact velocities range, the highest impact velocity we did was four meters a second. So that's here. And as you can see, it depends both on the impact velocity, but also on the packing fraction. And you should note here that I rescaled. You should note here that I rescaled impact velocity to put it into a shear rate because we want to try and connect this to our rheology. So, I've just done the thing where I take the impact velocity and divide it by the drop size because the top of the drop when the solidification front starts is moving at the impact velocity and the bottom is a zero. So, I think this is a somewhat reasonable thing to do. And then what we can do is go back to our reality. And now I'm showing you the same data I showed before, but instead of viscosity, I'm showing shear stress. I'm showing shear stress versus shear rate. And this is a good way to highlight kind of the critical shear rate for shear thickening. So you see this curve becomes steeply vertical at a point. And so this point is the critical shear rate where shear thickening sets in. And that depends very strongly on your volume fraction. I apparently just lost my internet. I don't know. Excellent. Okay, let's. Excellent. Okay, let's let's try again. I apologize to the unknown people. Yeah, EDU Room is not very stable. Oh, should I try that? It was working just fine until I was giving my double. You think visitor is better? I try visitor. Can I just quickly ask a question? Can I just quickly ask a question in the meantime? Please. So, yeah, so Chad, we talked about it briefly yesterday, but have you tried to measure the expansion in the width as well as we especially as this front is propagating? Is this like a constant expansion that you see happening? I think so. What's happening? My Zoom says connecting. I don't know what that means. My Wi-Fi is strange here, yeah. Yeah, but like I just I'm on the Wi-Fi, so I guess I have to restart soon. So let me reclip on the link. Okay, well am I reconnected? Okay. Oh my gosh. Scroll down. Oh, I have to scroll, yeah. Thank you. So come back up. Here we go. All right. Okay. So, yeah, so you were asking about like the width of the drop versus the height. So we've looked a little. Versus that. So we've looked a little bit about that because we thought maybe you could back out some solid. We haven't looked at it dynamically, actually. We were just kind of thinking about like at the end, but you're saying like measuring like kind of the width of the bump, like the width of the drop at the bump as it goes up. That would be interesting. I haven't looked at that. Yeah. Yeah. Why? Why should I do that? So, well, yeah, so it's because I cheated because I already saw other parts of your presentation. All right. Because, yeah, I think it would be, I'll explain more about it later. We talk at the coffee rate because I think that would be really, I don't know, that could, we need more information. So, where is it? So, we have the friend velocity as a function of shear rate and volume fraction. And then I want to, I notice these curves are similar. I want to try and collapse them. I look back to my reality and I can see the critical shear rate that shear thickening sets in. And so, what I can do is. Sets in, and so what I can do is I can just subtract that, and it collapses both of these. So, all I'm saying here is this collapses the data, and I think this is very suggestive that this front velocity is now kind of set by how far away from shear thickening you are, like how far beyond the shear thickening critical shear rate you are, which may seem like a strange thing if you're used to doing reality experiments. Because as you can see in the reality, you can't go beyond the critical shear rate. Your thing just thickens, but this is really different. This is a But this is really different. This is a steady state measurement, and what I'm doing is an instantaneous, very large shear. So I can apply any shear I want. I'm hitting the thing with a hammer. I can do that as hard as I want. And so we think that this is really what's controlling the properties of this. And this is something we really want to think about more and how strong we can push this idea that the nature of this solid is really dependent on kind of how far away from the sheer thickening point you are. Lynn, oh, question? Yes. Question? Yeah. In the previous, yeah, this slide. So, so, so, what's the again, it's like what probably I think you already mentioned that you want to study it more, but what would be your guess about the characteristic scale for the velocity? So, Eva, what I were talking about, I think that potentially it could be related to a sound speed, but I think that okay, so this was your comment, I did not follow it. Okay, so it was your comment. I did not follow it. Okay. Yeah. But so I have I'll ask me that again at the end. I'll say something about it when I get to that part. But that would be my guess. Is it something like a sound speed? But I don't know. And there's kind of other suggestions from these other measurements of jamming friends. So this may be not the right picture to think about it. So there's a lot of open questions about what sets the scale for the speed. And also, I think there's a lot of you can do here because now I can kind of access shear rates that you can't really get to. Shear rates that you can't really get to in other ways. And so there might be really interesting things that you can study about these materials that you can drive in other ways. And one thing I want to highlight is this solidification is transient. This is happening because the thing is shear-jammed. If I kind of turn down the speed on my camera and look at a video of this, you see that it very slowly liquefies in time. So this thing hasn't dried out or fully become a solid. It really is just sheer jammed. And then once you remove the stress, it reliquefies. Strauss that reliquefies ice cream. Yes, exactly. Melting, strange, non-Newtonian ice cream. So exactly kind of along the lines of the question Vinny was asked saying, we want to think about like, what are the properties of this solid? And it's a hard thing to study, right? Because it just lives for a few tens of milliseconds. But we think we have some unique access to this. And there's one chance where it's really easy to figure out what's going on. Easy to figure out what's going on here. Because if you have something that bounces, you can measure a coefficient of restitution, you can measure a contact time and a compression, and then turn these things into a way to get the elastic modulus of this material. So what you can do is you can get a force just by using the coefficient of restitution and the contact time. And then you can turn that into a stress dividing by the contact area. We don't have a good way to measure it, we're just assuming a Hertzian. Measure it. We're just assuming a Hertzian contact do this. So you should consider this more of a magnitude estimate than like a strong thing. We are very interested in trying to actually look beneath the drop as it hits so we can measure this more precisely and try and characterize it a bit better. But for now, this is what we have. And then also, since you can measure the compression as the drop hits, you also can measure a strain rate. And so then you can turn these or a strain, excuse me, and then you can turn these things into a modulus. And the number you get is about five megapascals. I was kind of surprised by this number. Pascals. I was kind of surprised by this number. If you're not too familiar with these, this is like a hard plastic, like ABS or acrylic or something like that. I don't know why. I would have guessed it would be a much softer thing in the kilopascal range, but I don't honestly know what to do with this number because right now I just have it at one condition. One thing that the new graduate student working on this project is instead of using a hydrophilic, do you have a question or no? Acrylic was more, that's more like rubber material. Is that more like rubber? Rubber material. Is something like rubber? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you. I apologize. So, yeah, so we just have this in one condition. I don't know what to do with this number, but my current graduate student is working on instead of using a hydrophilic surface. If you use, there is actually a bit of contact line dissipation that's happening as this thing hits. So maybe if you use a hydrophobic surface, you can now make this balance at many more conditions. And then you can actually, you know, see how this scales and maybe do something much more interesting than just have a number. And then we want to really look at the transition: like, how did this go to this is another interesting question. And so, I told you up here that everything behaved very much like a Newtonian fluid, but I was a little bit sweeping something under the rug because this very last point here, it's true that if I look at the diameter, it behaves like that. That metric behaves exactly like a Newtonian fluid. But as this picture suggests, something very different is going on. So, let me show you the. Very different is going on. So, let me show you the movie that goes with that picture. So, here is now a drop hitting, and you see it spread, but it really doesn't look like a Newtonian fluid at all. So, you saw there's kind of a lot going on there. So, let me play that again. But you can see there's these little isolated solid patches that then melt away. So, what we really think this is, is isolated regions of jammed materials. You have this very high-viscosity solid. This very high-viscosity solid embedded in the low-viscosity solid that's just spreading like a Newtonian fluid. And we're not the first to have isolated solid patches. And we think this is very related to something that was seen by Dan Blair and Jeff Erbach, where they did rheometry experiments, but then on a boundary stress microscope, I think they call it, like cell traction microscopy. So you basically have a gel with stuff embedded in it. So it lets you locally measure the stresses instead of just having a bulk average signal. Having a bulk average signal. So, this isn't imaging the particles, it's imaging the stresses on a localized manner. And they saw very similar things where they saw, like, right at the transition, these patches of kind of high stress areas that seemed very stochastic. And so, we think this is a direct visualization of exactly what they're seeing. But to put it all together, so as I increase shear rate or volume fraction, I go from something that looks like a Newtonian drop. Looks like a Newtonian draft to these funny patches to this, like crazy half-liquid, half-solid thing, and then to something that really is almost fully solidified. And you can, you know, put it all onto a state diagram, a large fraction, just because of the parameter space that's easy for us to access is Newtonian. And really, even these shear thinning things fit these Newtonian models really well. We can observe this approach to jamming, and then we can also really study the dynamics of the shear-jamming transition. Transition. So, I would like to posit that drop impact is a really complementary measurement to traditional rheology, because rather than getting bulk average information, you can now look at things in a localized way and maybe see things that would be very hard to get from Reamder data. And additionally, kind of as a bonus, you get to access very high stresses that are hard to think about how to access in other ways. So, I'll stop there. There's a lot of I'll stop there. There's a lot to do here. There's a very rich system. Three of the things that we're thinking about currently are thinking about shape effects. So, if you have rods instead of spheres, they jam at much lower volume fractions. And also there's kind of a larger range where continuous shear thickening happens, which we think might be connected to that localized jamming, like the little patches. And so, we'd like to use this system to kind of expand that range and see what we can learn about. I'm working with Xiang Cheng at the University of Minnesota. Ching at the University of Minnesota, and he has this really nice system for doing that same kind of boundary stress measurement. He's done it under impacting Newtonian drops, and now we're trying to put our complex fluids there so we can actually see what's going on with the stress field underneath the drop. So this is just getting up and running. And then also, I think this system is a really nice window to studying unjamming dynamics, which are kind of hard to do in other ways. So we can watch this drop, refluidize, and see how that happens. And we have some really How that happens. And we have some really exciting, kind of preliminary evidence that the refluidization seems to also contain a memory of how it was jammed. So how it refluidizes depends on kind of how far past that critical shear thickening point. But it's all very preliminary now, so I'll just say it in that way. In any case, I'd be happy to take questions. All right, thanks a lot. Let's maybe first see if the stove. Let's maybe first see if there's the original people with questions and then we'll get to Benny. Paolo. Hello. You're muted. Hi, Michelle. Beautiful work of Then it's really really nice. I don't know if this will help or anything but just a thought that you know when jobs impact right as they go and compress it's not really a sheer flow right see what Right, as you were suggesting, isn't the compression extensional fluid? There's both shear and extension, but it's certainly a fast oversimplification to cast everything in terms of shear rates. I completely that's right. And this, just like shear thickening, there's a lot of strain hardening of the situations as well. So it might be worth taking a look at that data as well in terms of the rheology. Terms of the reality. Okay. Because you might find, I mean, I don't think it changes everything that you have shown here. No, but that might be a better way to think about kind of the next steps. That's right. That's right. That's all. Thank you. There's another online question from Sonny. Hey, Michelle. Yeah, I have a couple of questions. First of all, when you plot the share rate versus the front, Is the front speed um the shear weight you define based on the impact speed and the size of drop? Is the way you okay? I wonder, I think maybe proper length scale for this case may be the prop the wavelengths of the propagating the front. I don't know whether that would be more relevant length scale rather than the size of the drop. Two things. I agree, the size of the drop is probably not quite. Is probably not quite the right length scale, right? Because I was arguing that kind of I know two things: that I was arguing the shear happens over the whole drop, but probably the drop remains liquid, not just at the top, but somewhere very close to the bottom. So there is probably some smaller length scale that might be more relevant. But I don't know how to reconcile with that with the fact that it seems to collapse the data when I use that shear rate to plot it. So, I think that's a really good question that I am still trying to figure out the answer to. And again, like, oh, go ahead. Sorry. Yeah, oh, go ahead. Sorry, no, I have one other question. Just finish, finish your statement. Oh, I was just going to say, like, this is why I'm so excited to think about looking inside the drop. So, the nice thing about silica is you can index match it with glycerol and water. And we've done that a little bit, like it works well, but then you're like, and then maybe you would put tracers in to try and see what's going on. But you're looking through a spherical lens, you're doing this with a high-speed camera, and so you can't use fluorescence or anything reasonable to try and figure out what's going on. So, like. Try and figure out what's going on. So, like, I really want to do that, but I'm not exactly sure how to do it right now. And I welcome any ideas that anyone has. Yeah. So, just another follow-up question, another question, more experimental side. So, especially low packing fraction, it's hard to make a very uniform the particle distribution inside the drug when you release. I believe there might be. No, so these are very small, right? These are less than a micron. So, it's really quite easy. Micron, so it's really quite easy to just certainly for like larger granular particles, but these are like a micron, so the settling time for a particle to go its diameter is like miniseconds. Oh, just one diameter. Okay, okay, okay. Just make sure. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Thanks. And then I think there was a question in the room. Thanks. So, so I maybe it will be somewhat, I'm not out of a very nice talk, really beautiful. Really beautiful. What we said yesterday, very high on Joy Paulson's scale. Okay. So, so the question is: how can we be sure that there is really solid there? So, how like here is what I suggest, okay? Yeah, tell me why it's obviously wrong, okay? So, so I would imagine that one can imagine a scenario in which you have the impact. Suppose you have a totally viscous film, yeah. A totally viscous film, yeah. However, you do it maybe on a very hydrophobic surface. Okay, you do the impact, so it really you don't, it doesn't like to spread, it doesn't want to spread it. I could imagine a scenario, and I'm not this, it's not obvious, but that you will have kind of phase separation, that you will have kind of shear bending sort of behavior, like you will have very high viscosity in the bottom. So, what about basically what I say that what you call solid is really not a solid, but it's really a very strong amplification of. Very strong amplification of the viscosity in some sense. I mean, I don't know how you would tell the difference. Like, in some sense, no, you don't have shear modulus. That's what I'm trying. You don't generate shear modulus. You just make you just make a really viscous. Exactly. So you will have phase separation between two highly viscous and how would the phase separation happen on that time scale? How solidification happened on this time scale? Sure, that's a fair point. I don't know. So I don't think from what I told you, I could tell the difference. From what I told you, I could tell the difference. You could not say there is shear modulus. I certainly can't measure the shear modulus by doing that. And I would imagine, at least I know when you presented it, I started to think, well, suppose that I have really a liquid rope, perfectly liquid rope, but I really drop it on a very, really hydrophilic surface. Hydrophilic surface. No, no, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I understand it. I'm not saying that it's, but that's, I want to simplify. I want to think of a since it's spread at all, it just stays. Why wouldn't it bounce? Oh, so the bouncing. Oh, so the balancing is complicated. And, like, for just a water drop, there's a. I guess it depends on the time scale, is the answer to your question. So, but I guess I could imagine, I don't know, maybe experimentally or people have looked at British proof, but I could imagine you get. So, people look at like water drops bouncing, and that happens in kind of a really small parameter space at really low Weber numbers. Because if you throw it too hard, it's not going to bounce, it's going to spread a lot of energy that way. Yeah, but I'm talking specifically about. Yeah, but I'm talking specifically about a very hydrophobic experiment. Sure. I don't know if I've ever actually seen someone doing that experiment. It wouldn't be hard to track. And I don't think by what I told you, you could tell the difference between, like, I can't measure the shear modulus exactly now. So, okay, thank you. Yeah. Thanks for the nice talk. Just a brief comment, really. So, with the module. Comment really. So, with the modulus that you measure on the basis of your velocity analysis, the sheer velocity of that material will be somewhere in the neighborhood of 37 meters per second. Exactly. So, if you do that modulus divided by the density square root, it seems very close to the shear front velocity, which I don't know if it's just like a pathological coincidence or that's really information. So, this is why we want to add many more conditions, right? Because it's really hard to know what to do with a number in isolation. Do with a number in isolation. My grad student, actually, in her thesis, did some nice analysis where you look at the ones that don't bounce, but you say, I'm going to make just the simple, crazy assumption that it's like a simple harmonic oscillator. And so I say, I see it go down. And I imagine that like the contact time would be twice the time that it took to go down. And if you do that, you actually get and take that and like compute the modulus and then look at it to compute the shear velocity. And then look at it to compute the shear velocity, you get something that looks a lot like that front propagation velocity. But that's kind of a crazy thing to do. Like, I don't think I could argue strongly that's a reasonable way to measure a modulus. That's why we want to do it better. But it's suggestive that that might be the case.
