Thank you. Awesome. So, yes, I'm Joel Martelot. Just for the nine people, I'm in Ex-Marseille University, senior researcher. So, the idea is to look a little bit at instabilities to make geometrical structures. And why do we need geometrical structures? So, we've seen for many reasons, for example, this morning in mechanics, but also in other fields, essentially geometrical. Fields essentially geometrically can induced functionality. On instabilities are nice ways of patterning surface on large scales at different scales. So for example, we can think about compressive stress in multi-layer systems in which we can get some kind of wrinkles and use them to use these ideas, for example, to make some kind of wrinkle structure at small. Wrinkle structure at small scales, or we can play, for example, with buckling instability. So, for example, in this case, constrained buckling of shells in order to make this kind of hexagonal lattice at the surface of a sphere. And so, I will illustrate a little bit this idea on a couple of different systems. We will see how much we'll do, but I will start with a very classical instability. Very classical instabilities in fruits. So, relative instabilities. So, the experiment we are doing is essentially we are taking a plate that we are covering with a thin viscous film. And for this, we are spin coating essentially to get a uniform thickness thin film. And then we adjust to put it upside down. So, what we see is that it's very classical. We get relative insanity. And so it's forming those kinds of small droplets. And the originality that we are doing this in thin film, which will cure. So essentially, then we get a structure which is elastic. So it makes this kind of small lenses like the structure. And so the question we were asking is, can we try to use those kind of structures? And so can we control the disposition of the drop? The disposition of the droplets, their shapes, and their size. And this is very classical phenomechanics instability. So we can compute, can get the dispersion relation, can look at the growth rates versus wave number, and we find that the most unstable mode occurs at something which scales with a capillary length with a quite large pre-factor, 2Ï€ square root of 2. Out of two. And so we work in a regime in which we are separating the two time scales in our problem. So essentially, we have the time scale which is typical for the instability to go, which depends on the viscosity, the capillary length to the square, on the effect of gravity. And this will be much smaller to the typical time scale for the polymer to cure. And so essentially, the And so essentially, the shapes that we will see there will be fully grown in sabetes, essentially. And so the first question we can ask is, okay, can we say something about the drops arrangement? And can we tune a little bit this drops arrangement? And so the very simple way of characterizing the shape is to do some kind of shadow graph of the droplets. And so we see this kind of structure in which... And so we see this kind of structure in which we see the position of the drops, which are the points that you can see here. You see, like some kind of acoustics which are there, and then you see this kind of very shiny parts, which are the flat areas that are essentially at the boundaries of the position of each tropes. And those are very thin. And those are very thin films, which are essentially very flat. And so if we look at the position of those thin films, essentially it's the Voronoi of the position of the drops. And what we see is that we have mostly hexagonal structure, but we have a lot of defects in the structure. And so the way the insality grows, it's usually it starts at the boundaries of our plates. At the boundaries of our plates because it's slightly thicker, and then the instability is going towards the center of the plates. And so, for a while, we tried to get rid of the boundaries in order to get something which was more uniform, but we never really succeeded. And so, at the end, what we thought was that maybe we can add some boundaries inside the plates in order to try to like Like guide the instability. And so, what we did is essentially now we made a bunch of small holes in our substrate before making the thin film. And so, because we are looking at flows which are essentially lubrication flows, the effect of those small holes are to relax the constraint of the The constraint of the thin film, which is everywhere, essentially. And so it will be easier to flow close to those holes and it will essentially drive the growth of the drops in between those small defects. And so if we play with length scales which are compatible with the natural wavelength. The natural wavelength of the instability. Essentially, we can drive the instability and we can get the most instable mode, which is an hexagonal lattice of small droplets. But we can also drive other geometrical modes, like this kind of square lattice. Okay, and so this is just movies of the experiment. So, what you see is that essentially we are looking from the top. And so, what we see is that all those And so, what we see is that all those small drops, they essentially grow uniformly along the samples. So, there are funny things happening at the boundaries. And you can also see that there is these very thin regions between droplets. And so essentially, the droplets, they will take all the volume which is available for them. And they are not talking too much to their neighbors, essentially. So, this is another movie from the Another movie from the side. And a parameter that we can change is the initial volume that we put initially in the plate. And so if we are increasing this initial thickness, essentially the insulinity will occur faster, but also the volume of the drops will be essentially larger and they can also ultimately drip. And so because And so because of the fact that those drops are quite, they don't talk to each other too much, essentially, and because we have this separation of time scale, we can solve for the equilibrium position with just considering the effect of the gravity versus capillary forces. And so it's an equation which looks almost like an elastic. So we can. Most like an elastic, so we can essentially predict what are the shapes that we should observe for a given volume. And we can experimentally change the volume by changing the initial film thickness. And we see that at some point we have a fold, and so we will get stable positions in which the drops will start to drop to actually detach from the subtract. And so we get. Track. And so we get, we have a control essentially of the shapes of the drops on the plate just by changing the initial fin thickness. Okay, but so the next thing we want to do is to change the typical scale of the network of drops. And it's very constrained because essentially, if I'm trying to drive the instability a little bit away from the most unstable mode. Most unstable mode, essentially the instability will not care anymore about the defects I'm putting on the plates. And what we saw is that also the most unstable mode is related to the capillary length, and this is very constrained. So I can't change too much the surface tension or gravity. Actually, the thing that we did is to change the effective gravity by putting this system By putting this system essentially on a cylinder and rotating the cylinder. And so now, playing with the centrifugal acceleration, essentially, I can change the effective capillary length in my system. And we can get smaller and smaller structures, essentially, which are exactly the same structure as the one we have before, but changing the capillary. Okay, I'll just say that we... I'll just say that we can do this process many times, essentially. So we do one rotation, we wait that it's occurring, and we do the process again and again and again. And you see the formation of those kind of structures in which one layer goes on the previous shape, which remains a little bit, even if it's much simpler problem, the kind of icicles that The kind of icicles that Steve talked of at the beginning of the week. Okay, so this we can do exactly the same kind of ideas, playing with another superclassical free decay instability. So we have here, sorry, we are injecting glycerol in a bath of PDMS. So we are playing with iso-viscous fluids. Fluids. And so the PDNS will be, will also cure at the end of the experiment. And what we are doing is essentially we are printing a small line of B cell inside the path. And so it selects essentially a diameter for the line, essentially, we can change it just by... We can change it just by playing with the flow rate on the velocity at which we are driving. And then we will get a relay platform stability where essentially the size of the drops is quite well set by the initial diameter of the jet. But still, it's so we still get some kind of distribution of size of drop and also the Drop and also the typical length is set, is well set, but there is some kind of defects such heterogeneity in the flow. And this is super classical. So we can derive also what's the growth rate as a function of the wave number. And yes, and so using the same kind of ideas, we are trying One question is: Can we get a structure which is a little bit more ordered than the natural worth of the instability? And so, what we played with is essentially we are templating the position essentially of so we are initially driving the instability essentially by playing with Essentially, by playing with a rough boundary and then essentially printing the different lines. So I don't understand how the boundary is talking to the thread and how that's driving the selection. Can you say a little bit more about that? Yes, so essentially what you can see. What you can see is uh so there is a hydraulic coupling. Uh, so your first, maybe I have a sketch, you're essentially uh printing a line on because of the flow that essentially you need to move the flow in the viscous bath essentially on on on this. Essentially, on because the flow here is perturbed by the position of the boundaries, essentially, you're driving the instability. But the second line of space exactly aligns with the spaces in the first line. Yes. So they're communicating. Yes, yes, yes. So they are all communicating in this case. Yes. So this is kind of model way of perturbing the Uh, way of perturbing the jet, but the next row essentially will be perturbed by the previous uh position of the drops, essentially. And they tend to be out of phase, essentially, if you are not printing to. Can I just a very quick follow-up question? So, is there something that dictates the distance between the peak of your perturbation and the droplet? Because somehow, intuitively, I would have thought that a droplet would form like symmetrically between the two fields. you use yes so there is also uh yeah so there's a flow uh which is associated with the motion of the so this is something that we looked but but it so you think it should be on the top and then it's advertised a little bit because i thought it the top would break that's right but it's okay we can make it another one well maybe so so by playing with the velocity of the by playing with the velocity of the of the needle essentially you can carefull Of the needle, essentially, you can perture the base flow. And so, exactly as in the other case, essentially we can force the instability a little bit away of its most instable mode, but not that much, actually. And so, if I'm forcing a little bit further, it will go back to the Back to the natural most unstable mode. Okay, and so as you already saw, actually, we don't even need like the initial perturbation. So, if we are just injecting parallel lines one after another, it will start with some kind of messy pattern. Of a messy pattern, but very quickly it will go towards a more crystalline organization. Okay. And by playing with the velocity of the needle, essentially, we can play with the phase between the drops, and so we can get a little bit more complicated drop patterns typing this parameter. Okay, so So, another example where we are trying to make some kind of architecture elastic films, we are playing with a very simple geometry in which we have an LSO cell, but we did some small holes at the top of the LSO cell. And so essentially, the viscous liquid will invade the structure. And because And because again, it's a polymer which is curing, we get an elastic structure at the end, that pill. And so the first question is, what is the flow around one source, essentially? And so we can make this with more simple liquids like a silicon oil. And we see that essentially the radius increases in time and depends on the viscosity of the liquid. Viscosity of the liquid and the spacing between the two plates. And the like basic physical mechanism is the competition between the Laplace pressure gradient, which is driving the flow inside the HO cell, and the viscous dissipation. And so we can, just in scaling, see that essentially the radius is increasing with the square root of time times the surface. Surface tension times the gap between the two plates over the viscosity. And okay, if we take into account the initial radius on the waiting angle, which is not completely zero in this case, we get the same kind of dependence in R. And we can also take into account the fact that gravity is not completely made. Gravity is not completely, maybe not completely small in the problem. And so we can take into account this by adding a collision with a bond number. Okay, and so if we essentially rescale our radius with this typical time scale, we see that we are able to understand more or less what is the variation of the radius in time. And we can simply look at Look at what is the so to predict what is the final shape, essentially we can look at what is the variation of the viscosity in time. And so for our polymer, we can characterize the viscosity and essentially it's constant for a while. And there is a typical time scale at which the viscosity increases quite a bit. On a very simple model, like with this initial viscosity on Viscosity on a divergence which goes like one minus t over this typical time scale to the square, capture well the viscosity. And so, if we are now integrating the viscosity in time, we can derive what is the final radius as a function of this characteristic time scale of polymerization. And so, we can predict for different polymers with different viscosities and different polymerization. On different polymerization time, what is the final radius? So, this gives us the scale of interaction between the different roles by the system. And so, now we can start to play with several sources. And so, what we see is that essentially, so if the distance between the two spheres are smaller than this final radius, essentially they will They will talk to each other, and so you will see this kind of boundaries which appear between the two sources. And so with very simple geometrical arguments, we can derive what is the final area of what is the shape, essentially, of the final elastic. Of the final elastic structure. And the other thing, which is interesting, is that we see that when the sources meet, the flow is zipping at a velocity which is quite fast compared to the simple propagation of the flow when around one source. And so essentially, it will go towards the solution where the Where the two boundaries essentially forget that essentially they were initially starting from two different flows, two different sources. And so we can start to play with Can start to play with different geometries essentially, so still two sources, but playing with different initial geometries. And so now the rule to know what is the position of the boundaries is essentially just given by the fact that we have a flow around the two sources, and when they meet, essentially, is the position of the boundaries. And so, this is a very classical watershed transfer. It's very classical, a watershed transformation in image processing. So we can account for different shapes of the initial source, but we can also account for viscosity difference between the different liquids. And so we can predict shapes that essentially Essentially, playing with the initial shape of the source and also with different viscosities. Okay, and so because those, so essentially it's a way of changing the geometric colour organization of a plate, and because we can also play with different illustrations. Different elasticity, essentially the stiffness of the polymer at different positions, or we can kind of get different shapes on different elastic properties in the plate. Okay. And so this was for two sources, but we can ask what is happening when we have more sources. And so essentially, we will see the creation of this kind of. See the creation of these kinds of bubbles in which the pressure increases dramatically, and so in which the flow essentially stop as soon as we have this formation of bubble. And so essentially with very simple geometrical argument, we can understand what is the shape of such structures and we can make And we can make those films on a way larger scale on those kind of lattices of hexagonal structure. I think I don't understand the geometry. Yes. You were injecting something into the space between two plates. Yes, so we are just pouring actually a viscous liquid above an Of an LHU cell. So exactly what you were saying. Yes. And but then when you showed a few minutes ago a picture of that it bubbled up. Yes. So the plates weren't there anymore? They were not saving. So you had removed the plates? I mean, after a while, you have a sheet. Yes. And then I'm pressurizing it. And it's solidified? Yes, it's solidified. And so at the end, you're doing. And so at the end, you're doing experiments on the heterogeneous elastic sheet that you created this way. Yes, exactly. But for, yes, so yes, so I can play with a more complicated distribution of sources. But exactly as you said, if I want to be able to budge the structure and have a continuous sheet, I need to get Continuous sheet, I need to get rid of those kinds of bubbles, and so the way we are doing this is essentially by doing a small hole on top of the plate in order to essentially remove the constraint of the bubble. And so, with this, we can make those kind of continuous structures on, okay, play with the initial distribution of the sources. Of the sources. So, to know where we should put the initial position of the small holes to get rid of the bubbles, essentially it's just the boundary construction of the position of the source. And so, at each of those boundaries, essentially, we need to put the holes in order that. Need to put the holes in order that the flow completely invades the bait. Okay, I think I'll probably stop there. And so, yes, and so it's essentially anything which is pixelated. We can make a thin film out of it. Okay, so this was a little bit ambitious. So, maybe I'll go there. Maybe I'll go there. Just to say that so everything that I presented is in collaboration with Pete T. Brown from Princeton University. Yes, and so this is also the work of Lindsay Kai on Trevor and Hen. They mostly worked on the stuff that I didn't present. I thank you for your attention. I'm going to take the first question as my privilege. So, with this boronoid tessellation, I guess before that you showed if you had different size of sources or different shaped sources or different viscosities, right? It wouldn't just be the... Is this still just the Voronoi tessellation, or how does that change where you would have to put these sinks if you wanted to fill in the space? No, so essentially, you can do the wet. So, essentially, you can do the watershed transformation of your poles in order to get the position of where the two sources will meet. And then you need to put the small holes at the intersection between the... Okay. Thank you. That was really cool. I was curious, going back to this phase offset of the dynamic instability. This hydrodynamic instability. I mean, the entire process is, I guess, pretty much equivalent to a synchronization or forced synchronization in pendula, right? In like temporal oscillators. And there it's basically known that you can have a phase offset between your oscillators. If it has a certain frequency and your forcing frequency has a slightly different frequency, then if they are forced, they will both have the same frequency, but there will be an offset to that. And I was And I was wondering if this is kind of what happens here. So, the wavelengths there without the triangles, would that be larger or smaller than the wavelengths from the spatial forcing? Just your last question is... So the triangles on the bottom, your spatial modulation that has a certain wavelength? Yes. And the natural process of the droplets separate. Process of the droplets separating, they would also have a certain wavelength. Yes. So you're saying if I can look at the mismatch of the frequencies as some kind of periodic oscillator. Yes. Yeah. Okay. So I don't have a definitive. So maybe it's a good way of trying to get the because segregation. Because you should get defects if there's an optimism. Yeah, I mean, eventually, if you try out all these different wavelength variations, you can also select this Analtang picture. And then you can find out where does the forcing work, where does it fail, and you get more complicated structures than where the forcing fails. So for temporal oscillators, that's the okay. Thank you. This is really cool. I like it. That's that's really cool. I could just on that, yeah. There's there's the systems where people force spatial frequencies, yeah. So, this is potentially what you're doing here, but it doesn't seem to matter very much because then you took away the wall and it seemed to have the same wavelengths. Was the wavelength the same? Yes, so essentially, if I'm forcing at the natural wavelength, so here you're forcing at the natural wavelength, very close to the natural wavelengths, but essentially it's it But essentially, it's it so essentially it was a way for us to probe different initial conditions, essentially, to force initial conditions. Because you think about these spatial forcing problems, if you force very far away from the natural wavelength, then you can get these really odd dynamics in a wave system. But here, obviously, that's the static system. So, I guess you would get these weird frustrations. Yes, yes, yes, actually, if you are driving a little bit too far from the wave. Driving a little bit too far from the wheel. We see that essentially it's more messy than if we're not forcing on. Yeah. Yeah, so I want to go back to the making of the materials. So, I mean, I see it. It's a really beautiful way to make really complicated, interesting patterns. I guess I'm, and then you solidify these things. I guess I'm one. You solidify these things. I guess I'm wondering, you know, what are they, what would you try? What kind of composite material do you envision? I mean, maybe this is too much of an engineering question, but like, what's the big idea with the materials side of that process? Yes, so I mean, like, so it depends a little bit on the problem, but I think like this kind of elastic lattice. These kind of elastic lattices that you can make in plates, essentially, with holes that you can basically control more or less the shapes of the lattice and the shapes of the holes and so on, are ways of making things which are close to what people do in metamaterial and stuff like that. But obviously, so in this case, it's quite at large scale and so on, but the cool thing is. Scale and so on, but the cool thing is also that you can expect. So, for example, in this system, we did also structures which are much smaller because now essentially you're taking advantage of the instability which will occur at whatever scale. And also, it's a little bit the idea that if we have a way of control. Of controlling well the position of the droplets or the position of the holes or whatever with instabilities, we can scale down. Okay. I guess my I was going to ask roughly the same question as Paul, but I also have a suggestion. But I also have a suggestion. So, in fact, in this architected sheets area, you're able to make a big variety of sheets. And I don't know quite what the contrast of material properties is, but you would imagine, for example, if I mean, if you made a balloon out of a mixture, if you wanted to control the balloon. If you wanted to control a balloon to blow up into a polygon, well, you should make it, you should create the faces with the right shapes, and you should make it bend easily where the polygon is supposed to have folds. And, you know, I wonder whether, for example, you could do that kind of design problem. Yes, so we didn't, so yeah, it's definitely something that if we Something that if we are able to make slightly larger structures, essentially bigger. Yeah, we were thinking about essentially doing some kind of Oriami structure, maybe by having exactly what you're saying, position in the sheet in which the structure will be easier to bend than positions. positions yeah in the story you didn't show that maybe you you you can give us a glance you you're depositing a film on the on a tube and i will expect the film to to to to get unstable and get modulations as well is it an issue or but let me first understand you're you're talking about you're you're asking an insider uh question yeah so the the the problem that uses refinery The problem that Josie is referring to is essentially we are doing the we are filling a tube and then we are so with the same kind of polymer melt, but then we are injecting a bubble. And so then the bubble, so then we are waiting, the bubble will arise due to gravity. And so we get a shape of a balloon, which is slightly non-symmetric, essentially. Second? Okay, so here I'm in. Okay, so here I'm injecting the melt, and you will see at some point. So, from there, you see that the bubble it changes color actually. Okay, and so this is super classical spreader term problem in field mechanics. And so, you can say again geometrical things which are happening when we get a large curvature. When we get a large curvature at the edges. So, this return problem essentially, just very quickly say that it depends on the velocity, but if we go fast enough, essentially, it's very independent on the velocity, the film sequence that we get. And so we can control essentially what is the initial volume inside the tube. Volume inside the tube. And by playing with the time it takes to drain, essentially we can play with the final shape of the final shape of the cross-section of the structure. And so then if I'm increasing the pressure inside this, that thing will stretch, while this thing will remain, will stretch less, essentially, and so I will get curated. Tack also, if I'm increasing the pressure, essentially I get a beam which will curl on itself. But then I can play if I'm making long tubes. Essentially, I will have a structure in which I can, with the pressure, change the curvature and play with instabilities that people have already looked at, in which you have In which you have curvature in a rod against gravity, especially. So you can predict what are the shapes that you get. And your question was. Sorry. Rele plateau or I don't know what? Well, we don't see them. Well, we make very, very long cubes. I don't have a very deep argument to say why we don't see a To say why we don't see helping the thing to not destabilize, I'm not completely sure. Right. Are there any questions from the online audience? If not, let's thank Joelle again for a wonderful talk. Thank you.
