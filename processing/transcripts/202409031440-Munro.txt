So I wasn't at yesterday's early career workshop, but I heard it was about developing a research program and marketing your research. And as far as I can tell, I think a research program is what happens when you split your research into multiple papers. So today I'll present to you a research program that's in part joint with Donnie Maharaj and in part joint with uh Mima Hoda. Later I'll have to try to market this, so Later, I'll have to try to market this. So, x I'm going to let be a combinatorial two complex. So I won't define this, but I'll just say some words as I draw a picture, an example. You have a graph, which is the one skeleton of the complex, and then two cells all have the structure of some polygonal. So, for example, here we have a square, and you should think. And you should think of this as being solid. And the cycle, or the boundary of the polygon, is just attached by some graph homomorphism into your one complex. And you can have multiple of these also. You can maybe have something like this all settled. And well, every group is the fundamental group of one of these objects. So one way to go about studying some class of groups. Way to go about studying some class of groups is to study some restricted set of combinatorial two complexes. So that's where I'll be headed. So the path, here P is just some one complex homeomorphic to an interval. It is what we call a piece. If it lies in the intersection, In the intersection of distinct two cells. So, here's a little cartoon. Here I have some half p, x tilde, and maybe there's a two cell on this side and a two cell on this side. I'll call them r1 and r2. R1 and R2. Okay, so they would miss that P is a value. Okay, and next I'll define a metric using pieces as the units. So the piece length of some path p into X, which I'll denote with a sort of NOR notation. Rotation is going to be the minimal n such that p decomposes into n pieces. Here I've just written it as a concatenation of n pieces, as a path. Okay. So you're assuming that x isn't a free one cell, but that's the case. Yeah, yeah, get away, kill any free faces. Basis. I'll lie a few times in this talk. This is already a white line. Okay, so here's a quick example. So here's some large path P, and maybe you see two cells that look something like this that go along it. You can convince yourself that this should have peace line 4. Okay, so classical small cancellation deals with definitions such as the following. So we'll say x is CN, or satisfies the CN condition, if, and I should mention this is a bit of an idiosyncratic definition, it's not the usual one, but it'll motivate what I want to. Motivate what I want to define later. So if you take some path P and you make it immerse into the boundary of a two cell, you moreover ask that the length of P is at least as long as the two cells, you want it to be surjective. Then the P's length of P should be at least f. Okay, and the cartoon picture for this is, well, picture for this is, well, maybe I'll draw a picture of C6. So if I have my two cell R and okay, let's say C6, that just means as I walk around the boundary, I should see at least six petals of a flower. Something like that. Okay. Okay, so let's consider groups. Let's consider groups which are the fundamental group of some compact is compact CN for varying elements. Okay, and now here's the sale pitch. Sales pitch. So T5 You get nothing. Every group is the fundamental group of some C5 complex. Then C6 we think of as being some form of combinatorial non-positive curvature. For example, these things will be bi-automatic. And then C7 is negatively curved, so these are all hyperbolic. Okay. So in joint work with Donnie, we consider the following condition. So we call these strict small cancellation conditions. And we say X is strict CN if now I'm going to take a path P, again immersing into the boundary of some two cell, but where I see these weak inequalities, I'll make them strict inequalities. So if P is strictly greater than the boundary of R, that should imply that P has a piece of greater than the same. P has a piece length greater than n. So maybe I should mention a few things about this. So Cn plus 1 will imply strict Cn. And strict CN is stronger than Cn, so strict CN will imply Cn. Lies. So here in this stratification of small cancellation conditions, we see strip C6 somewhere in between non-positively curved hydrovolt. And okay, the cartoon for these guys is, well, if you're equal to the boundary of R, you're allowed to be, so here I'll do strict C6, you're allowed to be six pieces long. You're allowed to be six pieces long. So your flower can have six petals. But if you walk around the boundary and then some, so here I'll draw one, two, three, five, six, then you should be seven pieces long. So this is not allowed because here you find a way to walk around and then some and use only six pieces. So this is So, this is right so six. Now, first theorem is that what? If we let X be compact straight to six, then the fundamental group of X is poral, relatively hyperbolic. This is in the sense that Damian defined earlier, where there's some collection of P. There's some collection P of virtually z squared subgroups for which gp is a relatively hyperbolic. So you know they have to be virtually z? Sorry? Do you know they have to be virtually z squared? Toral relatively hyperbolic means it should be hyperbolic relative to zero. Yeah, so you can do that. So uh yeah, sorry, I'm stating a bit of a weaker version because we usually just take a geometric action instead of assuming it's a fundamental group. And then there's And then there's virtual stuff, but uh, is it also a shorting free not necessarily just because you can have torsion. I mean, if it's the fundamental torsion, just C6 can have some torsion in like a silly way, but uh and if you have torsion, it's because some relator was a problem. Now. Now, let's see. So, Donnie previously did work tubulating C prime 6 groups. And this, in fact, wasn't the original motivation for this work. And in fact, we had a different definition of strict C6. So I'll give that definition now. And from this other definition, you get another theorem. So x is So x is strict. Here you have to assume that the number is even. So strict C2n. If this is for every one cell inside of a two cell, there exists some other one cell. Some other one cell so that any P containing the two one cells The two one cells has piece length greater than n. Just draw the cartoon that goes with that. So your C2n, that just means you take any one cell here, and there exists some E prime, which you should think of as being opposite to the E. Should think of as being opposite to the E, so that if you look at a path containing the two of them, this path must be long in the piece metric. It must be greater than n. So, because of this, there exists A sort of wall inside strict C6 complexes. Where what you do is you take some two cell and you consider sort of immersing a, you want to immerse a tree into the complex. So here you draw an edge of the tree joining opposite one cells. Opposite one cells. And then you continue to just extend it through opposite one cells. But you have to make choices along the way. So the quotations here mean that, for example, we don't know how to make these have open-packed stabilizers or be group theoretic in any way. They're sort of geometric walls, but not group theoretic walls. How much time do I have remaining here after? I'm like seven minutes. Okay. So even though we don't know if these things are cubulated or not, we get the following theorem which mimics the kind of cubicle behavior. So if X is compact strixy6, or let's just say assume. And we'll assume the fundamental group is hyperbolic. Then for any quasi-convex subgroup. Quasi-convex subgroup H inside of the fundamental group and any compact subset of the universal cover there exists a co-compact core so that means there's some Y living inside of the cover. Y living inside of the cover, so that H stabilizes it, and moreover, this action on Y is co-compact. And also, that Y contains the orbit of C and Y is quasi-convention. Okay, and that's done using these sort of walls, where what you do is These sort of walls, where what you do is you take the C, you consider its orbit, and you show that you can use, you can take sort of these geometric half-spaces and intersect them to get something which is convex in the piece metric, but it's quasi-isometric to the combinatorial metric. Okay. Right. So In the theme of cubulation, when Donny, well, in the paper where Donnie cubulated C'16 groups, so I should also mention, if strict C6 groups were co-compactly cubulated, this would follow from like work of Y's and C D. And when Donny cubulated C prime 6, he also raised the question of which CN groups were cubulated. And also, Kasha and her theory. And also, Kasha in her thesis asked if C6 groups were Cochin Patrick and related. Sorry? It's in the last page of the name. And I was preparing for this talk. So should note that C6 groups C6 groups, so this is using, I don't know, just waiting. C6 groups are not co-compactly stimulated. And this follows my work with Perry and I earlier this year. We found an example. Example, and it still leaves the question of whether or not strict C6 are open files. So, those of you who know Harry might be surprised to hear that he actually did something with groups. With groups. But our method for doing this was to find a strict C6 complex, which is in fact, sorry, a C6 complex whose universal cover is in fact not quasi-isometrical to and then it makes sense that Harry was both so Two minutes. Okay, so I'll just mention that the proof of theorem one uses an isolated flat theorem for systolic complexes. For systolic complexes. I guess no one's defined those yet at this conference, but they're sort of a triangular version of quadric complexes, which Nima defined. And if you take the nerve of a universal cover of a C6 complex, you get something systolic. And the proof goes by showing strict C6 here will imply that the association Will imply that the associated systolic complex has isolated flats, and then work of Elsner will tell you that if you act geometrically on such a systolic complex, you're more relatively hyperbolic. And with NEMA now, there's an analogous story with C4, T4, where there's some way to turn any one of these into a quadrat complex. And there is a strengthening of T4, which is weaker than C5, so something in between, which we call strict T5. Something in between, which we call strict T4. And the analogous condition will tell you that this quadric complex has isolated flats. So our work together is to prove, I mean, both that strict T4 will give you isolated flats and then that isolated flats will give you four microbialism. That's it. Oh, there questions. And you said that the walls were geometric versus groupy, or are they? Yeah, it's just that these don't have Cocompack stabilizers. So it's not a wall space in the sense that there's finitely many walls separating in two points. Since every time you extend, all you know is that there exists an opposite one cell, but there could be many. In opposite one cell, but there could be many. So you must have five or sorry? We show that there exists enough to get the scoping path port. But for cubulation, you would want some sort of like canonical way to extend these walls. And I mean, you don't know how to do it. So for now, it's just a wall space where there's infinitely many walls separating points, but they're all quasi-convex still. All positive conduct still. Any more questions? Let's think our speaker again. You have coffee break until half past three.
