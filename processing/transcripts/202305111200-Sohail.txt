Well, it's a great pleasure to be here. Thank you for the invitation, Gabriela and Maribel. It's been really nice to learn about all the different approaches using data science. So today I'll talk about the Mexican Biobank and this initiative that we started a few years ago. And I think it's great that it's coming after the Monte Alban visit yesterday, as well as the two talks before, because they provide important context that will be helpful for this as well. Well. So, this project started as a collaboration between the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico and L'Angebio Sinvista, which is the National Laboratory for Genomics for Biodiversity. And the idea was to genotype the samples collected by the National Institute of Public Health as part of their year 2000 survey and to use them for various analysis of population genetics and complex traits. And so, what's unique about this database is that it will be the first time in Mexico to have a genotypic phenotype. In Mexico, to have a genotypic, phenotypic database of the sort, which is covering all of Mexico. So we cover all 32 states. And while the database itself is 40,000 individuals in this first space, we only genotype 6,000 individuals. And we enrich for individuals that speak an indigenous language, as well as those from rural localities. And this project has been funded by a transnational initiative between the Newton Fund and CONESC. So, just to give a face to a name, this is Langhai. A face to a name: This is Langhabebyo Sinvista, where all the genotyping was done, and where I started on this project as a postdoc. And this is the Center for Genomic Sciences of Donam, where I started a faculty position recently, and where I'm continuing working on this project. So today, what I'll show you is really like the flagship, sort of using this database to do a first picture of genetic and phenotypic variation in Mexico. And the idea is now that we have that, there's many follow-up projects that we can do, and we're already doing. We can do, and we're already doing that both in my lab as well as in collaborating labs. So, this project comes at a time where there's a persistent bias in genome-wide association studies. So, to today, the majority of these genotypic phenotypic databases tend to have ancestries mainly from Europe. And so, this was a major motivation for this project. So, myself, I've been trained primarily as a population geneticist in my PhD and got a chance to work on, for example, the genome of. To work on, for example, the genome of the Netherlands, as well as like various fundamental questions in population genetics using databases. But what was becoming apparent to me towards the end of my PhD is exactly this bias and the complete lack of diversity in genomics, both in terms of data set, but also in terms of the workforce. And I thought that that was an area that I could enter and sort of put my efforts there. And so that is what asked for the move here. So I could like help make this initiative a reality. And so something. A reality. And so, something to think about throughout this talk and throughout this project is: why should we be diversifying genotypic-phenotypic databases? And what do we hope to learn? Because this question does have a troubled history and likely a troubled present. And so, I think it's very important to be thinking about the ethical framework as well as conceptual frameworks within which we're working. So, an important concept here is that of genetic ancestries. And genetic ancestry is basically a way to conceptualize how we're related to our near and distant ancestors and has been. Our near and distant ancestors and has been conceptualized using methods such as principal components analysis and admixture, to name a few. But something to keep in mind is this picture. And it's related to the picture that Lakshmi showed. It's really that our ancestries sort of show the path through the ancestral recombination graph through which we receive our genome, right? Through which we receive the various elements of our genome. And anytime, and so that's actually what the ancestry is, right? What is the ancestry, right? But that's obviously a very complicated framework to work in, computationally speaking, conceptually speaking. So, what people have often done is discretize ancestry at certain time slices. And whenever you're discretizing, it's important to keep in mind that all you're getting is a proxy of your full ancestral recombination graph, and you're focusing on a specific time slice. And so, a time slice that people have often focused on in the field has been the continental ancestry time slice, but it's important to keep in mind it's only reflecting the pointer doesn't actually work, but. The pointer doesn't actually work, but as you can see, it's only reflecting a certain time size in our evolutionary path. So, in this study, what we try to do is capture ancestries at different time slices and also highlight the fact that it's always a proxy of the full art. So, we start by looking at population structure in the Mexican Biobank. And here, so what you can see with several global reference individuals that are available through the 1000 Genomes Project, to the AGDP project, as well as through PAGE. And so, here in gray, And so, here in gray are all the individuals from the Mexico Biobank. And up here, nicely given that we're in Oaxaca, are indigenous individuals, Zapotecs, or as they refer to themselves as the Benza, which are the creators of the site we went to yesterday, Monte Alban. So we have those here on the left, and all individuals from the Mexican Biobank lie on a cline between what is representing indigenous ancestries and what is over here, individuals from Eurasia. And so this is obviously because of the And so, this is obviously because of the colonial history and the mixture. But you can also see a pull towards individuals from Africa, and that's reflecting also the transatlantic slave trade that happened during the colonial period in Mexico. And you see a small pull also towards Asia, which is less known and talked about. So, I'll just talk about that a little bit in a moment. So, we also looked at the population structure of the Mexican biobank individuals only by themselves. And here, what we did is in consultation. And here, what we did is, in consultation with anthropologists, we decided to use this grouping of Mesoamerican regions. So, here we have the north of Mexico, the north of Mesoamerica, the Occident of Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico in green, the center of Mexico, the Oaxaca region where we are right now in yellow, and on the southeast, the Mayan region. And so, when we do this using either principal components or UMAP, different dimensionality reduction approaches, with hopefully the parent. What hopefully is apparent is that the major population structure that you see is with the Mayan region in the southeast compared to the rest of the country. And even here, you see some overlap with the Gulf in the center. And this sort of reflects this old Atlantic corridor of exchange that's been previously posited as well. But other than that, while you do see some subtle substructure, it's clearly present across these regions. You also see a lot of mixture. Regions, you also see a lot of mixture, and that's reflecting both unique demographic histories as well as mating and mixtures and migrations that have happened both historically as well as recently until the time of the sampling of the Mexican biobank. So another thing we can do, and hopefully this approach is familiar to people. It's very commonly used in population genetics, the approach of admixture. And what it does is, in this case, we're just doing an unsupervised clustering and getting maximum likelihood estimates of what we can think of as. Estimates of what we can think of as proportion of ancestries from different regions of the world, because we're doing an analysis again with various reference individuals from around the world. And this actually started as the structure algorithm, which does a Bayesian inference, but admixture does the same thing much faster using instead a maximum likelihood approach. And so what we see is that in general, you have in general, you have ancestries in red. Ancestries in red that are colored in red that are very prevalent across Mexico. And these are ancestries that are predominant here. So, this is the Zapotec individuals in the very left from Oaxaca, and also in what can be considered admixed individuals from the Americas, from the thousand genomes. So, this ancestry, as you can see, increases, and here the states are ordered from north to southeast as you move south to southeast in the country. And the opposite is true for the ancestries that are primarily. For the ancestries that are primarily found in Europe, but also in the Middle East and South Asia and in the Americas, these ancestries are higher as we move northwards in the country. So as I showed before, you also see in blue ancestries that are prevalent in Africa and almost every state, though small, but it's definitely a part of the admixture. And you see ancestries that are predominant in East Asia, primarily in the state of Guerrero, which is on the coast. And so just to And so, just to also mention that, of course, like in doing an analysis like admixture and we've been thinking hard in other problems, such as with single cell and so on. You are sort of in this approach, assuming how many clusters one may have. And so you can do this approach using, assuming several different clusters. And as we run this kind of clustering approach, for example, using higher and higher number of clusters, you start seeing more of that substructure present within what may be called any one of these. Within what may be called any one of these geographic regions, right? So at k equals 10, you can start seeing more substructure within the ancestries from the Americas, for example. And in that sense, I think it's important to realize that Mexicans shouldn't only be thought of as admix, for example, between Europe, American ancestries, and Africa. If you look at a different time scale, they're also admixed within different indigenous ancestries, right? So admixture is something to think about on many different time scales. And it's important to think about that way to not essentialize sort of any. About that, we're to not essentialize sort of any one given time scale. And so, here's just a quick summary across states: that the majority of states in Mexico are have our indigenous ancestries, only three states have more ancestries from Europe, that all states have some African ancestries. And with respect to this interesting signal from East Asia, so this sort of just to give a quick thing on that in terms of the anthropological genetics. On that, in terms of the anthropological genetics aspect. So, this goes back most likely to the Manila galleon trade. So, Manila used to be a colony as well of Spain already in the 16th century. And there was a galleon that went once a year from Manila to Acapulco in the state of Guerrero. And this has only recently been studied also by historians such as Tatiana Sejas using sort of slave documents and so on and other kinds of information. And they tend to suggest. To suggest origins from sort of across a wide range of places in East Asia as well as in South Asia, because Manila was connected to all these regions through both Portuguese trade routes at this time in particular. And so in Manila, you sort of had a movement to Mexico of people from across these different regions. That's sort of what's coming out of history. And that's recently been studied by a number of historians. But we also did a detailed study of this signal. Detailed study of this signal in this study, you can see if you're interested, which also recently came out. And we find genetically as well, if we map these Asian ancestries onto a reference panel, that we can map it not only to the Philippines, but various parts of East Asia. So it's just an important way to think about the four-way sort of global admixture that is present in Mexico. So we can also look at metrics such as FST. And so here, again, I'm showing only for individuals from different I'm showing only for individuals from different Mesoamerican regions, and only those individuals that were inferred by admixture to have more than 90% proportion of their genome with ancestries from Americas. And so what we can see is again that the Mayan region in particular shows higher FST values, with FST being a measure of genetic differentiation with all other areas. And so I think this is an interesting pop structure angle to pursue further with respect to complex traits. With respect to complex traits. And so, another thing we did, another approach that we used is what has been called archetypal analysis. And since this may not be familiar, just a very quick overview is what this does is it uses similar to admixture allele counts of the individuals and reduces them in dimensionality to n minus one, where n is the number of individuals, single vectors, ys, V D, and then implements an alternating non-negative matrix factorization. Factorization to constrain that minimizes the constrained sum of squares to find ancestry proportion. This is again because we have been thinking hard about the visualization and approaches to infer ancestry is important to sort of get better at and like sort of trying to coming out of sort of what has been a very racist framework. And so this is just another way to think about structure in Mexico. So if we do the use this approach on only the Mexicobank individuals, again, we can do Individuals. Again, we can do this assuming three archetypal sources or up to 10 archetypal sources. You can basically just see the amount of the main goal with showing this is the amount of ancestry variation that is present within the different Mesoamerican regions and within just a single country when you can do this kind of sampling, which has never existed before because previous data sets have only been from Mexico City or from individuals in Mexico living in LA. So you get a very different picture. So, you get a very different picture with the diverse sampling. And so, if we do the same analysis with global reference individuals, the same ones that we've been using here in gray are the global, in the Mexican individuals, and colored by sort of global regions are the global regions. So, here, for example, you have the Zapotecs from Oaxaca overlapping with the Mexico Biobank individuals from Oaxaca. And here on the right side, instead, you have the references in gray and the Instead, you have the references in gray and the Mex B individual colored by the Mesoamerican regions. And I just think it's really interesting that, even in the presence of these global references, something like the Mayan region is being inferred to be coming from several different ancestral sources. And that is the one that really shows in particular that diversity, but the others you can see as well are sort of showing a lot of different ancestral sources in the presence of these global references. So also showing just like how much sampling sort of. Showing just like how much sampling sort of impacts what you may infer in terms of variation. So, given that we do get now this sort of first picture of that variation, what we can do is also get infer ancestries locally along the genome. So, so far I was showing approaches like that. And so, we can do this in this paper. We use RFMIX, for example, which is a random forest-based algorithm, but we also use GNOMIX, which is a very new approach. And so, you can color the And so you can color the genome like this using reference individuals with respect to ancestry from different regions of the world. And then what you can do is you can sort of mask regions that you may not be interested. So in this case, we mask out all non-indigenous segments of the genome and only work with indigenous segments. And then what we can do, for example, is an approach such as that of making admixture graphs. And here the goal is to now assume that each of these regions is. Assume that each of these regions is a population to try to understand their shared history. And so, in this approach, what we learn is a picture of north to south peopl across Mexico. So, starting off, the first population to split off being the north of Mexico, followed by the common ancestor of all other regions. And then you have splitting off what is the ancestor of the north of Mesoamerica and the occident of Mexico, followed by the common ancestor of the whole sort of South. Ancestor of the whole sort of south-southeast region, which spits off into the ancestor of center of Mexico and the Mayan region and the Gulf of Mexico and Oaxaca. So, this is also just to sort of understand the sort of shared history between these different regions. And another thing that we can do is using again these indigenous segments, we can put them into a principal components or MDS space that is, we can put reference individuals that. We can put reference individuals that we know are self-identified indigenous individuals into a reference space and then put our Mexico Biobank individuals, but only their indigenous segments into that same space. So that the goal with that is to get now a second axis of variation of ancestry that's not the continental scale, but now further along, capturing the variation within the indigenous groups. So in this case, it's an MDS plot, and the reference individuals that we have are different indigenous groups found in Mexico that were Indigenous groups found in Mexico that were sampled in a different study and that self-identify within these different indigenous groups, right? And on that, we place the Mexico Biobank individuals only, but only their indigenous segments. And so what we can see is, you know, even these admix individuals that we have sort of follow that structure that's present within the indigenous sort of tapestry, and that we can get this access that we can use for later complex modeling efforts. Efforts. Okay, so all of that is to show sort of a picture of genetic ancestries, which is, you know, both sort of going to be useful for complex straight modeling, but is also of interest for our anthropological interest and so on. And so what this does is it's reflecting the reason why we're interested also from the point of view of thinking about trait variation and genetic variation is because these ancestries reflect demographic histories. And so to think about demographic history, So, to think about demographic histories of these ancestries in Mexico, we can first get a quick picture of peopling of the world. And so, a key thing to keep in mind is the bottleneck that all individuals went through coming out of Africa as they transversed Eurasia. And another key point to keep in mind is the bottleneck that all individuals that people, the Americas, went through in the bottleneck crossing the Bering Strait. And so, we are interested in sort of now rebuilding the trajectory of population. Rebuilding trajectory of population size, sort of past this point. And so, to do that, what we do is we use segments of the genome that are identical by descent. And so, here, for example, is a segment in orange that's identical by descent in these two individuals because it comes from that common ancestor up there. And we can overlap these with local ancestry segments that we've inferred separately using GNOMIX or using RFMix. And then, what we can do is we can. And then, what we can do is we can use an algorithm called ancestry-specific IBDE, which uses sort of thinking about IBD and the coalescent framework to be able to build the effective population size trajectory within these different ancestries up to 300 generations into the past, because IBD has a direct relationship with effective population size. And so, here first, I'm just showing this for the whole biobank, and I've colored this by Mesoamerican chronology, which we Mesoamerican chronology, which we learned some about also at Monte Alban. But these are sort of the primary periods that we think about thinking about the civilizational histories of the region. But as we are learning that native ancestry is obviously not a homogeneous entity, but it's rather a conceptual construct to capture all the different indigenous individuals living here before the arrival of the Spaniards. So a more reasonable thing to do, which we do next, would be to do this analysis instead within each of these Mesoamerican regions. Within each of these Mesoamerican regions, to not have all of those histories superimposed, but to be able to look at them separately. And indeed, when we do that, so this is just now the same analysis within each of these regions, we see is hopefully a very fine-scale variation, which you would expect with anthropological knowledge and archaeological knowledge of the civilizational histories of these different regions. So, thinking about this, starting from the south and southeast, we already know from We already know from other disciplines that you had, for example, Ojaka, which we've learned the most about, the Zapotec starting sedentary settlements already in this region in the classical period. And so also with our genetic analysis, we start seeing large NE here already in that period in pink. And what we know also from anthropological record is that you start having more militarism and so on. Militarism and so on, in the post-classical, and you start also in the genetic inference, we also see a population decline starting to happen already before the arrival of the Spaniards, which is here in the colonial period. And so, similarly, in the Mayan region, we also have evidence of the Mayan starting civilization very early already in the pre-classical and post-classical. And you can see that also in the genetic inference and in the Gulf of Mexico, for example, you have the Olmecs already in the pre-classical, the Totonax in the classical. The Totonacs in the classical, and the Huastecs in the post-classical. So these are parts of Mexico showing, you know, these, just as you would expect, large and y early on, which is in compare, which is in contrast to what we see in the north, in the center of Mexico and in the north of Mexico, which is where like Mexico City and so on is, where you have more what have been called the Aztecs or the Nahua culture. And so that there, what you can see is that the NE only starts increasing more recently, right? Increasing more recently, right before the arrival of the Spaniards, in the post-classical, and you start to see a decline in effective population size after the arrival of the Spaniards. So, another thing I'd just point out is what is interesting and has also been found using some other indigenous sampling efforts is that you don't see that decline in NE across the board, across Mexico. For example, in Oaxaca and the Mayan region, which show the highest indigenous ancestries today, you actually see any increase. Today, you actually see any increasing in the post-classical period. And so, of course, to do this, we have to map generation time to years, and the range commonly understood at the moment from other studies is about 20 to 30 years. So, I did do this across that range. And most of the inferences that I give sort of hold across that range. And so, of course, we also did this for ancestries from Western Europe. And similarly, we see founder effects that are variable by region. That are variable by region, with the largest founder effects again being seen in the Oaxa region and in the Mayan region, meaning the smallest size of European individuals coming here. And we also do this for ancestries from West Africa, where similarly we see different founder effects with varying strengths in different parts of the country, and with these ancestries from Africa increasing more in some regions, such as the Mayan region in the north, compared to in others. To in others. So, the reason why, again, this is interesting beyond just sort of an anthropological interest is also because such founder effects and demographic histories can lead to patterns in the genome that can be relevant also for complex trait variation. And so, for example, they can create variable patterns of runs of homozygosity. And so, a random homozygosity is very related to the idea of the IBD identical by descent segment. So, if you have two parents that have a segment IBD, here. Have a segment IBD here in green from a common ancestor A, their child F would have that segment in homozygosis and it would be called a run of homozygosity. And so runs of homozygosity can also be a window into demographic and mating history. And so in particular, if you have small ROHs in the genome, that's likely from theoretical modeling work that's been done by other studies, that's likely coming. Studies that's likely coming from small population sizes or a bottleneck in the distant past, versus if you have a long ROHs, that's likely because of consanguinity or marriage among relatives. So what we do in the biobank is we similarly call runs of homozygosity across all our individuals. And here what I'm showing is that again, we see we do see a lot of fine-scale structures. So if we look at either the number of ROHs that an individual has in their genome or the total length of ROHs, In their genome, or the total length of ROHs that they have in their genome, we see that these are increasing again as we move from north to southeast in the country. And if you recall, this is the same axis along which indigenous ancestries are increasing. So to get a better handle at that, what we do is then look at the relationship of the number of ROHs as well as the sum, which I'm now showing here, with the ancestries inferred from admixture, ancestry proportions from these different regions of the world. And so, what we can see is. Regions of the world. And so, what we can see is that indeed we see a positive correlation of the number of ROHs and individual carries and the proportion of ancestries that they have from Central Americas, which is in contrast to what we see for the other ancestries. And if we do this, breaking down the ROHs by size, this is primarily, the signal is primarily coming from small ROHs. And so in that sense, it suggests that this pattern is mainly coming. That this pattern is mainly coming from small population sizes being maintained for a long time rather than from consanguinity or marriage between relatives. And so that's just one example of genomic variation that can be affected by demographic histories and that we can capture using ancestry proxies. But you know, you can also have differences in the allele frequency distribution, for example, which is another metric that we look at. And so here from a lot of work done, modeling work done by many different groups, the idea is that if you Idea is that if you have a group going through a bottleneck, so here, if each ball is representing different alleles, basically, say, for example, you have the yellow allele, fairly rare, because of the bottleneck event, you can just completely lose rare alleles. So in this case, for example, we completely lose the yellow allele, or they can go up in frequency. So given that that's the case, we look at this in the Mexico Biobank, given that these ancestries reflect different demographic histories. Reflect different demographic histories. And so, here, how I do this is I just sum up the number of derived alleles in a genome stratified by whether the allele is intergenic or missense or a deleterious, meaning that it's missense, predicted damaging, or loss of function. And so, here again, and look at the correlation of that with the inferred proportion of ancestries from these different regions. And so, again, what we see in this case is that the more ancestries from Central America, That the more ancestries from Central America that an individual carries, the lower is their rare variant burden. So, here the burden is only computed for alleles up to 5% derived allele frequency. And this would be extended completely from the bottlenecking event with rare alleles either being lost or going up to more higher frequencies. And so, you end up with fewer rare alleles in ancestries that have gone through more bottlenecks. And in this case, this likely represents founder effects that are more prevalent. Effects that are more prevalent in the ancestries from the Americas. And so, both of these, so very quickly, like because we use array data, we also did a number of checks to see that this was reasonable to do with the array data. And this is, for example, comparing the burden using the array data versus 50 individuals that we fully sequenced. And we can see there's a high correlation, meaning that it's reasonable to do this analysis of rare variants using the array data. We also repeated this with 1000 Genomes Mexican samples. This is with 1000 Genomes Mexican samples and got the same result. And so, this is just an example of ancestries reflecting histories, creating these different patterns, variable patterns of genetic variation, which can be relevant for trait variation. But ancestries are also reflecting different environmental histories. And as we are very clear in this framework, we sort of try to create for the rest of the analysis is that there's also an environmental present, which can be for Present, which can be, for example, different experiences of discrimination or socioeconomic opportunities, whether individuals live in a rural or urban environment, nutrition, etc. And while this environmental present can be completely independent of genetic ancestries in a post-colonial context such as Mexico, there's likely correlations between the two. And there's, of course, unknown variables that we don't have. So, because of this, we're interested in sort of these different factors and how they're involved in thinking about variation and complex traits, such as how. About variation in complex traits, such as how tall you are, or what your blood pressure is. And here, the goal is really to get a picture of what we'll call a trait profile, which is very different from drug discovery. It's sort of getting at the architecture of the trait, like what factors are most important. And so, for example, ROHs have been shown in the study done in primarily European individuals to be associated with a number of different complex traits. And so, keeping this picture in mind, Keeping this picture in mind, I'll focus first on the case of height. So, if we look at height in Mexico, for example, a complex, classic complex trait here showing average height per state, you can see that there's a clear pattern of increasing average height as we move from southeast to north in the country. And the question is sort of what are the factors that may be involved in that, right? And so, what we do to do this is we make a mixed model, we use a mixed model approach in which we make predictors both computed from genetic data as well. Both computed from genetic data as well as predictors computed from demographic and environmental data. So, in terms of predictors computed from genetic data, going back to this picture, we use ancestry proportions inferred from an approach such as admixture, and we also use an ancestry axis coming out of this sort of approach to capture sort of two time scales of ancestry. And we use the runs of homozygosity that we've inferred, as well as polygenic scores that we computed on this data set. And I'll talk more about that in a minute. And we use That in a minute. And we use, we have nicely access in this data set to a large number of environmental factors as well. We also use various socio-cultural factors as well as biogeographical factors and two random effects to capture the covariance structure defined by the genetic relationship matrix, as well as your locality to capture any unmodeled environmental variation. And while there's issues of collinearity to think about here, we still think this is a better approach than sort of just looking at genetic factors. Just looking at genetic factors, just looking at ancestry, which has been sort of how this kind of work has been done. And I think it's important to consider these others as covariates and would be very interested in talking to you all more if you have ideas of how to do strong modeling of genetic and environmental factors together in a way that's robust. So the goal is to then ask which of these predictors are important for trait variation in a number of traits that we have. And just as the first picture, our combined model using these factors. Model using these factors explains, for example, 66.6% of the variance for height and these values for some of the other traits. So, this is the kind of result that we get here shown, for example, for height. And so, what we can see, for example, in the joint model, sort of jointly modeling covariates, is that ancestries from Africa are associated with higher height, while ancestries from America are associated. Americas are associated with lower height. The axis of variation of ancestries within the Americas, which is sort of capturing the ancestry from the Hucho northern area to the Mayan area, is also associated with lower height. ROHs in the genome are significantly associated with lower height as well. And the polygenic score for the trait is associated. And so that's just focusing on the genetic factors. We also see some interesting things with the other factors. And if we look at height, And if we look at height sort of across birth here, here, first breaking down the individuals into quantiles based on their inferred ancestries from the Americas, we can see, like, as we found in the model, that individuals with higher ancestries from the Americas do show lower height, but that when if we look across birth year, all individuals across the board are increasing in height. So, this is again showing in that case that these could be environmental factors of height increasing changes or height-reducing aging effects, both of which. Or height-reducing aging effects, both of which seem insensitive to ancestry effects. So, again, just sort of showing the genetic and environmental effects together in terms of thinking about trait variation. So, we did this for a number of other traits, and the FDR value is always shown. We did it for 10 quantitative traits, but here just showing a picture for a few other traits. So, interestingly, for example, ancestries from Americas are positively associated with glucose levels and with triglyceride levels. Triglyceride levels, both of which are potentially relevant for thinking about diabetes and so on. But if we look at BMI, for example, in the full model, we don't see any association with ancestries, but only with ROH. So I think BMI is a very interesting case because obesity is a major problem in Mexico. But if we look in our data set, which is actually very rural, it's 70% rural, we actually see that BMI is lower in individuals that speak an indigenous language. Language. And when we do the full model, that's just in a univariate sense. When we do a full model, any association with ancestry or indigenous language drops, but we see an association only with ROH as well as living in an urban environment. So in this case, I think it seems that living, the factors associated with living in an urban environment, such as diet and so on, might be much more relevant in terms of curtailing this obesity problem in Mexico. So, this is just like if we look at So, this is just like if we look at a summary by predictor for all of the traits that we look at, which I've mostly gone over already. And this is if we look at some of the interesting environmental factors that we look at, just to show that they also show in the full model associations with the traits that are likely relevant to think about when thinking about public health interventions. And so, to close, in terms of thinking about the architecture of The in terms of thinking about the architecture of trace, the last thing we did is genome-wide association studies and polygenic prediction. So, what we did to be able to see how well we can predict and sort of the whole issue of transferability that was already mentioned by the last speaker, we break up our database into two-thirds that we ran a GWAS on using Regeny. And that's been out by Regeneron recently. And in the other one-third of the database, we computed polygenic scores using either our own GWAS or using the GWAS. GWAS or using the GWAS that is publicly available from the UK Biobank to be able to compare performance. And we did this both in the genotype Mexico Biobank database as well as the database that was imputed using TopMed. And so, for example, here's what we get for triglyceride. So in general, across the 22 quantitative and binary traits that we look at, we had a number of hits that have previously been found in other cohorts, but we had no novel hits. Uh, novel hits. Um, so this could be either because of power, but it can also be because, you know, like in terms of having region-specific variants, they're actually expected to be very few. For example, from the AGDP, you only expect to have like thousand variants that are only found in the Americas and nowhere else. And so if we do, um, so same starting just with triglycerides, and we do the polygenic score analysis. So here on the y-axis is the polygenic score computed as a weighted sum just using. Sum just using pruning, thresholding, and clumping and thresholding. And on the x-axis is the trait value that's been inverse normal transformed. And you have either the computation using the imputed data set, which has many more SNPs that have been imputed, or using the genotype data set. What we can see is like overall, of course, we don't see an amazing prediction performance, but the point here is that even though the Mexico Biobank, and in this case, it's only 4,000 individuals, and the UK Biobank is like 150,000 or more. Like 150,000 or more. I think, for depending on the trade, it's from 150,000 to 350,000 individuals. We see better prediction performance with the Mexico Biobank than we do for the UK Biobank for something like triglycerides. For glucose, we see the same thing, better performance with the Mexico Biobank. But on the other hand, for some other traits like BMI, we see a better performance with the UK Biobank. And even in this case, the Mexico Biobank does not do too much worse. And similarly for height. Is just Mexico Biobank by itself or UK Biobank by itself in terms of the source of the effect sizes for the polygenic score computation. And so for height, for example, as well, we see better performance, better ability to predict the trait using the polygenic score using the UK Biobank GWAS. So I think this is a very interesting also follow-up thing to think about. And some other people have been working on this theoretically, why different traits have different transferability, which is also something people are coming. Which is also something people are coming upon from other angles. And this could be because of various empirical issues, but also because of sort of more conceptual things about the trait, right? The architecture of the trait itself, for example, its mutational target size, the heritability per mutation, and the strength of stabilizing selection on the trait. So, for example, in our case, triglycerides and creatinine, two traits that show better performance with the Mexico Biobank, are inferred to have small mutational target size compared to BMI and high. Mutational target size compared to BMI in height. So it appears that traits, maybe perhaps, that have smaller mutational target size are better predicted by cohorts that are very similar to the cohort you're doing. Prediction is, whereas traits that have higher mutational target size can be fine with out of different cohorts as well. And I'll just close with this another tiny little story. So, for example, for HDL cholesterol, this is from our GWAS. We see these hits and ABCA1 in particular. Hits and ABCA1 in particular, this is a paper from 2010, was shown to be associated with lower HDL cholesterol and is one of those few alleles that is primarily found in Native American groups. So, you know, looking across sort of all AGDP is not really found in individuals from Africa, Asia, or Europe, but only in Native American groups across America, not only in Mexico. And so, in our case, we do also see both a hit for ABCA1 and we do see that this. ABCA1, and we do see that this allele is found in higher frequency as you have individuals having more ancestries from Central America, and that individuals that have a higher frequency of this allele do show lower HDL values. But nevertheless, when we do our full joint model that I've been describing, overall, we don't see any correlation of ancestries from the Americas with HDL. If anything, we see a correlation of ancestries from the Americas with HDL. Ancestries from the Americas with lower LDL, which is in the opposite direction because having lower LDL is healthier. And so, in that sense, this is, I think, also just an example of not using single SNPs as predictors for global ancestry predictions and vice versa. Just in terms of thinking about like how important is ancestry, right? It may be important on a genomic level for some traits, but in some cases, maybe it's just single variants that are important and it's not sort of scaling in sort of a genome-wide way. Sort of a genome-wide way. So, this is just some perspectives that I take forward and sort of paid a lot of attention to in this study to embrace complexity when thinking about complex traits to think about environmental and genetic sources together. And this is really feel like a start in that. And I'm hoping to sort of extend these kinds of approaches further and generally considering ancestries at various time scales. So, for this first sort of genetic phenotypic picture that I've shown, our conclusions are how, you know, Conclusions are how multiple genetic ancestries and contemporary Mexicans are diverse in origins and variable across the country in light with historical evidence. We see elaborate fine-scale structure and population histories inferred using IVD in different Mesoamerican regions. We see genomic patterns such as a large number of short ROHs within native ancestries due to multiple founder effects and lower rare variant burden within native ancestries. We see ancestries and ROHs as important predictors with some, but not all. Important predictors with some but not all traits. And we show that polygenic prediction is better using the Mexico Biobank GWAS for some traits, despite much smaller sample size. So, and all of this is generally very promising, you know, as even such a small set of 6,000 individuals, what you can do in terms of making these diverse sets larger to be able to have a more complete picture of variation, both with interest in evolution as well as interest in medicine. So, this has already been pre-printed, and hopefully, she'll be in press. And hopefully, she'll be in press very soon. And if the data is publicly accessible, if anyone is interested in working in it, and of course, we're now starting initiatives to meta-analyze it with other groups and other data sets. And I'll just end by thanking the whole team. So, of course, firstly, the individuals that gave their samples to be studied in this initiative. And the whole team, which, while international in composition, was firmly rooted and led in Mexico. Rooted and led in Mexico and helped train a number of students and postdocs. So, overall, you know, it's multi-dimensional in that sense, and that's always how it was envisioned. So, I think the next step will be thinking also best about how to communicate this back to Mexicans in sort of the short and long term. And so, that's all, and thank you. Thank you very much, Panasha, very good journal. We generally hear the questions for myself. I have a coming up a question. Recently, I saw a presentation of a very nice work done in population genetics on the different populations, Afro-American-origin or European urine origin in the States and in Colombia, comparing Afro-American-origin populations. Afro-American origin population in Colombia and Afro-American-oriented people in the States and European-oriented people in Colombia or in the States. And what they discovered was that diabetes and obesity, especially diabetes, was much, much higher impact in the Afro-American genetic background in the States. Genetic background in the States than in the Afro-American and Colombia. And despite the fact that the population genetic analysis revealed that those populations were very much close from the genetic point of view, but the incidence of diabetes and obesity was totally different. So in this case, they demonstrate that the genetic background is over. run by the let's say habits of the people especially most of the Afro-American in Colombia live close to the coast and the eating habits are very very different so sometimes population genetics you have to Population genetics, you have to put also some other information. No, exactly. I think that's fascinating. And you should, if you can, please point me actually to that study. But that sort of little bit, hopefully that was came through the kind of framework we're going with as well, that it's not just genetic background, but rather likely G by E and so on, that's relevant. And I think for something like diabetes, that's likely what's most relevant. So in our case, the similar thing that we can do is just the The similar thing that we can do is just the rural and urban areas, and another thing that I've done is sort of segment the mixed model analysis and only rural and only urban areas. And you see different things again as well, right? Again, because of different, completely different environment and nutrition and so on. So I think that's like very, very important to consider. I think it's very easy to make claims about ancestry being associated with a trait. And I think the important thing is to do it in different environments to see when it is and in what particular. When it is, and in what particular environment it is versus not. So, fully on board with that. There's also like an example of that for hypertension in African Americans. There was all these claims of how hypertension is associated with African ancestry because it's higher in African Americans. Then there were studies done in Africa and people from rural Africans have some of the lowest hypertension in the world. So it's clearly not an ancestry effect, right? But African ancestry in the US leads to higher hypertension.
