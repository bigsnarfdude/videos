The main content of this talk is related on the exact solutions for business system. This is a joint work with Professor Frank Nighhaus, Shun Wai Yi, and Professor Zhang Daji. This is the outline of my talk. First, I'm going to give First, I'm going to give a backlog transformation which connects the continuous Bosnesk system and with the lattice bossness system. This backbone transformation is constructed by West Trust elliptic functions. And we can also use it to construct elliptic solvent solutions. In the last part, In the last part, I will introduce elliptic multi-soluting solutions for lattice Bosnesk system. In this talk, backlong transformations are presented as a method for transforming one solution of an integrable equation to another solution of the same equation. By iterates the backlog transformations, we could get a permutability property which leads to a nonlinear superposition formula. This formula can be regarded as a discrete equation. So let's take an example the well-known K-D lay equation. If we take this transformation, we could get its potential for. Potential form of W. If we perform the backlog transformation from the seed solution W with the parameter A, which would get another solution W tutor. And from this W tutor, if we perform the background transformation with the parameter B, we could get another solution, W tutor. Another solution, W tutor hat. We could also follow this line to get W hat and W hat tutor. It could be true that W tutor hat is equal to W hat tutor, which is the community property. So there's one in this box, W tutor hat is okay. And by the permissibility property, permittability property, we could have the four solutions w tilde, w hat, w w tilde hat satisfies this pure algebraic relationship. And if we continue to perform this backlong transformation, we could get a lattice of solutions. And after identifying the equation on the lattice, we could get a lattice potential KDV equation. KDV equation. So the background transformation provides a way to connect the continuous equation with the lattice equation. When I was a PhD student, part of my study was on this three component lattice potential business system of UVW, P and Q here are lattice parameters. Are lattice perimeters. This system was first given by Professor Mahos and Congress in 2005. If we eliminate B and W, we could get a nine-point equation Q. And if we do the make the continuum limit, we could get the continuous potential boostness equation through. Bothness equations today. By staking capital U is the derivative of a small u with respect to x, we could get an equation for u. This is the post-net equation. The post-net equation, the background transformation for the post-net equation was first given by Robert La Chen in 19. In 1976, but there's no parameter, a backlong parameter in that background transformation. And also we say the nonlinear superposition formula they give contains the relative resilience factor to a continuous variable x. Around at that time, around the Time around 2016, we noted that there's no connection like the last page, the figure show us a background transformation between the continuous bookmass equation three to the connection with three to rate one or three rates two. And in 2017, In 2017, we read a paper written by Yuzeng and Schiff. We also considered this question, but we didn't start from, we didn't study this question directly from this equation degree, but from two component post-NESC system four here. So of U and V. Of U and V. If we eliminate V from 4, we should derive the Bushness equation. This system is derived from 3 times 3 Lux pairs. We also presented Fedman transformation for this system given by this. Here, you tutor, we tutor a new solution for the Are new solutions for the potential Bitcoin system? And S is a function of X and P. If we apply this Bacon transformation to the Bolsoneski system, we could find the S satisfy an equation state, which where the Python transformation parameter appears. We also try to identify this. Identify this. We also give the nonlinear superposition formula of this Eiffel transformation and try to identify this formula to the system one on last page. But we found another lattice equation, not one. Fortunately, we try to modify this spectrum transformation and get an updated one. Get an updated one which connects the system lattice system one with the continuous system three. So now the updated background transformation is written with form six. To compare, I also wrote five here. If you say these two background transformations are quite close, very similar. The first one is the same. First, one is the same. The second one is a slight difference. Here is a minus sign, U5, and here is a plus sign. And here is U and U and U6 is they are replaced by U tutor. U tutor. U tutor is the new solution of the Bustan equation. We apply this background transformation, this updated background transformation to the business system for we find S satisfies the equation set. Now we see the background transformation parameter 2 here. So what we want to do is clear, we want to connect this equation This equation, we want to connect the superposition formula of this Batman transformation to the lattice system one. But in lattice system one, it's a three-component system, UVW. And in the system here, given by placement and the shift, only has u and the v. So next, we introduce a new variable w by. new variable w by setting w in this form and if v is v tilde u is u tilde we could have the w tilde from the back mountain information we we apply this back mounted information to the bosneska equation which will define the age formula wq is equal to u u t minus To u2 minus v. And if we denote the solutions obtained from uvw by using the Bachmann transformation with a younger parameter like Q by U hat V hat W. And we get a similar dimension. W hat is equal to U U hat minus V. And if you call the equation set for S, we also use We also use the background transformation on this equation set and get four equations. By doing some calculations, we could have another superposition formula 10. And 8910, if we identify this very algebraic relation on the lattice, we could derive the lattice business system. So now we get an updated VT, a background transformation. Updated VT background transformation, which connects the lattice with the continuous system. Next, I would like to explain why we take this backlog transformation. The first one is the same, but the second one is different. So, why we take the second one in this goal? We use real stress functions here, these three functions, sigma, sata, t functions. Their relations are like this. Here only p function is an elliptic function. Sigma and the t theta are not elliptic functions, but we can use them to construct every elliptic function if we know the information. They know the information about poles and zeros. PZ satisfies the differential equation and the second one is after doing one derivative of the first one. And the third one is after doing twice derivative. The last few formulas are additional formulas for p-function and the cetera function, which are Function and the theta function, which are also very useful and fundamental formulas for us. The potential Bosnask equation, in fact, has a stationary solution expressed by theta. Here we use theta f plus the one. C1 is an arbitrary constant. As we mentioned before, if we take the derivative of u derivative of u with respect to x, we put the With respect to x, we could have the capital u. So the capital u becomes the minus p function. So after we have this solution, then we substitute this solution to the system for. I will write it here, and we could derive a solution for v. It's written, it's expressed by a theta and the p function. Here, c1, c2 are up to. Here, C1, C2 are actually constants, and D2 is one of the invariants for P function. And we can perform the background transformation on the Business equation now by giving the seed solution as theta for U. And we perform the back notification to get another. get to get another solution u tuka is written in this form in fact it's a trivial uh it's a trivial process to get this solution but it helps us to get the relation uh what we want to have so uh this is the u tutor tutor x plus theta minus t plus cy and the v tutor uh we get give it in the similar in a similar way In a similar way, then we could find V Q minus V satisfies this relation, which means the second relation in the background transformation. And we call the equation set for S and S is also can be replaced by U tilde minus U, we could obtain P is a minus half P prime delta. And similarly, we can use the background transformation. Similarly, we can use the background transformation with the parameter Q, also expressed by P prime. And if we identify these seed solutions on the lattice, we will derive the emitting seed solution for the lattice Business system written in this form: U0 V0 W0. Here, Cassi is M delta plus M epsilon plus Okay, so what do we have now? We have updated epsilon transformation for the Bosnesk equation and we have its state solution pressed by theta. And also we have by performing the background transformation from this state solution, we could get a state solution for the lattice Bushman's. Solution for the lattice Bushman's system. Okay, so from these results, we could have these two lines in the following. The upper one is for the continuous equation. We know its spectrum transformation now, so we can try to construct its Lux pair and double transformation or generalize the double transformation. The double transformation. And if we give a proper state solution, we could get some explicit solutions. And for the lattice Business equation part, as we know, it's a safe solution now. And lattice potential Business equation is consistency around the Pube. So we can use this property to get its elaborate. Property to get its elliptic one-soliton solution. And from the elliptical one-soliton solution, we can get a very important factor: elliptic plane wave factor, which gives which helps us to define elliptic field root of unity. And after that, we establish elliptic direct linearization method to give elliptical. Give elliptic unsoliced solution for lattice book net system. Okay, so now we see the continuous part. To obtain the last pair, we set S is the in this form, and we can linearize the equation set for S. Then we get the last pair. Then we get the last pair for this Bolshevik system, the system, this is 11, the last pair. And if we take the transformation or we introduce a new quantity, a positive one, in this form, so this Poissar one, this Poissar one satisfies 11. 11 system when P is P1 and the PAFI1 satisfies the last pair. And we can prove that PASI1 also satisfies this system. So we say the system 11 is covariant with respect to this transformation, which is also known as the one-step double transformation. Double transformation. Next, we want to use this result to construct und step double transformation and give elliptic solutions solutions for the continuous Bolsonesk system. The results are given in the following main theorems. The first theorem presents the solution structure of the Structure of the footman's system. Here, U and we can say U V here are safe solutions. You can say here W represents the ground state determinant and UJ, Way J satisfies the bothness system, and Pasai N satisfies the laxica. So we so we substitute substitute this result to the this formula, we could get the solutions of the Faufnet system. So after have these results in theory once we give Once we give a said solution, we could get if we could solve the related Lux pair, we could get an explicit solution. So now we set the seed solution is theta function, theta x. And the last pair becomes the x part becomes the Heisman equation. Parson equation. So we use electric field roots to solve this equation and found phi T L can be expressed by Lame function. Here, phi alpha L J phi function is defined by sigma function, your slide sigma function. And U n are UN are elected unstable solutions. That's what we want to have in the continuous case. So now we come to the latest potential bootload system. We have the system as well as a CD solution. As I mentioned before, this is a multi-consistency around. Multi-consistency around the cube. Chen, just he has not explained this property. So I escaped the details. Just want to say the consistency around the curve property helps us to get a background transformation for this system. The background. The background transformation are equations on the left space and the backpeace for the bottom equation, for the equation on the bottom. S here stands for the real component UVW. And if we give a safe solution, S, after the background transformation with a parameter kappa, we could get We could get another solution as far. So here is the video how to derive the elliptic one-solution solution by using this spectrum information. I omit the details here and present the result here. We could say electric one-stove solution for the Electrical one-solving solution for the latest fitness system is written in this form. There's a very important factor is UI, ZO1 and ZO2, which are called elliptic language factors. Here we have kappa, omega 1, kappa, and omega 2, kappa. Their solutions of this equation, P prime x minus. P prime x minus t prime kappa equals zero, we call them lipstick cube roots of unity. So when we have this result, we go to establish electric graph linearization scale for the lattice Kp equation. And we use the electric, we use the electric field data. The electric field rate of Unity to reduce the lattice KP equation to the business system and the KDV to the business KDV to the Business equation. For the KDV equation, I just mentioned we use the notice grade roots of unit. And in this game, we say many equations like lattice potential business equation, lattice mode. Equation that is modified Bolsoneska equation, that is Schwarzenegger Boston equation and also trilinear equation for toll function. And we also show the electric multi-solution solution for the lattice potential Bushmanesk equation by using Cauchy matrix scheme. That's for the lattice equation type. Lattice equation part. Okay. So these are the main good references. Okay.
