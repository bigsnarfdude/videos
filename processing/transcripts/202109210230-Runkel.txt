Happening now. Can somebody see these slides? Very good. We can see everything. So, yeah, let's just start. So, thank you for the invitation and for the introduction. As David said, this will be about non-semi-simple modular categories, modular group action, and a Velinda formula. A Velinda formula and the outline is this. It will start with a reminder of how the story worked in the semi-simple setting. Then we will have a quick look at an example and see how various bits break. And then we will try to generalize the TQFT. And then having done that, there is a sort of natural way to see how to generalize one version of the Generalize one version of the Linde formula. But this, you know, there's no proof. That's just a that might work statement. Good. So before we go into the semi-simple setting, let's start out slightly more general. So I want to look at braided monoidal categories that you get out of VOAs. So the VOAs I will look at are very Are very well behaved. They are firstly C2 co-finite. Then they are n-graded and have this V0 is spent by the vacuum vector. The grades individually finite dimensional and V is simple as a V module and isomorphic to its control gradient module. So these VOAs are still very well. So these VOAs are still very well behaved. And I want to look at representations of these VOAs. Now, in VOA world, one has to always say what sort of modules one wants to look at. And I hope I collected these words right, but please feel free to bash on me if I did that wrong. And also feel free to ask questions, of course. If I don't get to the end, that's good because then there are many. There are many questions, and people are interested. So let's see. So, what does it mean? These V modules, I want to look at. I want to point at one thing in particular. So, if I have such a module, then it can be written as a direct sum. So, there's this horrendous formal expression where you sum over C, but really, there are only countably many of these which are non-zero. And in the individual summons here, they are. Summons here, they are not L0 eigenspaces with this eigenvalue, but they are generalized L0 eigenspaces, and I want them to be finite-dimensional. Okay, so that's the setting. Now, about these VOAs and about this category of representations, there are quite a few things known. One is that it's C-linear and finite abelian. So, the finite here means that. So the finite here means that home spaces are finite dimensional, there are only finitely many symbols. And then the category is bradybinoidal and it has a simple tensor unit. So maybe I go back one slide. So the simple tensor unit, that's sort of natural if you come from the world of braided monoidal categories. But if you come from the world of VOAs, it's not because then Of VOAs, it's not because then that's basically this condition here, and that sort of in this context drops a bit out of the sky. And we will maybe hear later talks where this is dropped. But I want a simple tensor unit, so I will keep this condition. Good. Now to make more progress, we enter the semi-simple world for quite a while. So So we open a bracket where we talk about the semi-simple setting. And now, if this representation category is, in addition, semi-simple, then Huang has shown that it is, in fact, a modular fusion category. So by modular fusion category, I mean a semi-simple modular tensor category. So a semi-simple tensor category is also called a fusion category, hence the name. And I also um and i also want to point out um a recent result by uh mcray which is that this condition which is a bit annoying because it's not intrinsic to the voa you should look at all modules can be rephrased as the jue algebra of v being semi-simple anyway so we are now gonna be for a while in the semi-simple For a while in the semi-simple world. Then, if you are given such a gadget, which such a VOA produces for you, namely a modular fusion category, then you can produce a topological field theory by the Richard-Tikin-Turayev construction. Now, and I mean TFT in the sense of having asymmetric monoidal functor from some category. From some category of bordisms to vector spaces. And the bordisms one looks at here: well, the objects here are surfaces with marked points. The points are marked by objects in your category. And then the bordisms are three-dimensional bordisms, and they have embedded ribbon graphs, which are colored in this modular category C. And then there is a little hat, which I will mostly ignore, which is a Will mostly ignore, which is a central extension which is needed to make this an actual function, so to cancel an anomaly in the gluing. So, I want to review a little bit how to build this TQFT because we will do something similar in the non-semi-simple setting later. So that's a quick review of Rishtik and Turai of TQFT. And we'll first remember what what um what to do if we have a closed manifold so so no boundaries so we have to produce a number um so so so i have some manifold m and then there is this integer which is to do with the anomaly and i will not talk about it further and then in this manifold m there is an embedded ribbon graph as here and then the construction says okay so pick a surgeon Pick a surgery presentation of M and then evaluate that as a string diagram. So that's what we do. So here's S3 with some surgery link. So doing, so it should be framed. I didn't draw the framing. And doing surgery along this link, the idea is produces back the manifold here. Then there are some constants decorating this to make this really invariant under the choice. Variant under the choice of search relink because several of these can represent the same manifold. And okay, so now we have to compute an invariant in S3. And this amounts to basically thinking of this ribbon graph as a string diagram, thinking of it as a morphism in the category C, and then you get a number. Except for what you do for the search reeling, right? Because that wasn't there before and that doesn't. That wasn't there before, and that doesn't have a label by an object in C. And so, what you do here is you just sum over all possible simple labels. So, for each component of the third reling, you label it by a simple, here i and j. And then you multiply with a dimension and you sum over symbols. Okay, and then the statement is that this is indeed an invariant of m with an embedded ribbon graph. Good. So, that's how the theory works. So that's how the theory works for closed manifolds. Then we need to say what it says to objects, so to surfaces, and it has to produce a vector space. And so if I feed in a surface of some genus with some marked points, then the vector space it produces is a home space in the category C, namely the home space from some object L to the G. some object L to the G's tensor power into the tensor product of all the markings here and this L is a sum over all simples I dual tensor I okay so that's what it says to surfaces now the TQFT which you produce has two important properties which are related to something called the universal construction of Something called the universal construction of TQFTs. One is that it's boredism generated in the following sense. So if you take your TQFT and you apply it to morphisms from the empty set into sigma, that has to produce vectors in this state space. And if you run over all m's, then the images span the state space. That's the first property. And the second property. And the second property is a sort of non-general pairing, which says you can detect if two vectors in the state space are equal by composing with all morphisms from sigma to the empty set. So two vectors are the same if and only if they are the same after applying z of n for all such n and so what this all together So, what this altogether allows you is, in the spirit of the universal construction, to notice that this determines the TQFT completely. So, suppose you want to say what the TQFT says to abortism. Well, then you have to give a linear map. The linear map has to act on vectors in that state space. And, well, write the vector in this way. Then you can compare. Then you can compose with the Bordism by using the gluing properties of that. And then to work out what linear map you get, you just contract with all possible such n, and then you have reduced it to a question about closed invariance. So these properties determine the TQFT. Good. So that was my quick review of Pristiken to Reyev TQFT. Then one thing you always get out of a thing you always get out of a tqft is mapping class group actions but for for the surgery series these are typically projective and that's because i didn't i didn't tell you all the data for the surfaces there's a lagrangian subspace and i will i will not go into detail there so um how do you get these mapping class group actions well Group actions? Well, if you have an element of the surface mapping class group, you can use it to glue. So you can take a cylinder, cut it in half, and glue the two halves together with the element of the mapping class group. That's called a mapping cylinder. And then if you apply the TQFT to the mapping cylinders, well, that gives linear maps on these state spaces and they give this projective representation. For example, if you do this for a torus, And for example, if you do this for a torus without mark points, then you get an SL to that action, which is the mapping class group of the torus, on this home space, which was by definition the state space here. Good. So now that ends my little review of Reshtik and Turaev and mapping class group actions in the semi-simple case, and I want to link it. Case and I want to link it to VOAs and in particular to Taurus one-point functions. So here I'll be even more sketchy. So V is the V. Can I quickly ask a question? Can I interrupt with a question? Please do. Is there an analog of this spanning property which appeared on the top of a couple of slides ago when you have these XIs? So when you have these field insertions? So these can have field insertions. Is that what you mean? Yes. So M has then a ribbon graph that ends at these field insertions. Is that what's happening? Yeah. So these M's have ribbon graphs, right? For my spending property, I want these to contain ribbon graphs. I'm not sure if that's even true if M does have ribbon graphs in it. Okay. Good. So VOA. So VOAs. So V is one of these VOAs with the condition we initially set, like C2 co-finite, and so on and so on, and we want it to be rational. And so we now want to look at something called Torus1 point functions, which is denoted by C1V in this original paper by Zhu. And it's a subspace of functions from the VOA times the upper half plane. VOA times the upper half plane into C. And it's linear in this argument, analytic in this argument, and satisfies a long list of further properties. And in the setting here, one can then show that this space here is finite dimensional and it closes under the action of the modular group, sort of will act simultaneously on V and H. And given a representation of the VOA, one can produce elements in here by taking these traces. So, O of V is a little bit like a zero mode of V. I will not define how this looks in detail. And then this is what you would usually have for a character. Right? And now, up to this point, that's actually still true if you just have C2 co-finite. But now the rationality comes in in the next point where Point where Zhu proved that if M runs over irreducible, then this gives a basis of that space. So, in particular, you have a basis in terms of irreducibles and you have an SO2 Z action on this space. Good. So, then the question which was open for a long time and then proved by Huang was. And then proved by Huang was that the SL2Z actions which you get from transformations of these characters and the one you get from the TQFT, that these agree projectively. That's sort of one of the more magic outcomes of VOA theory. But I sort of wanted to add a little question mark to which I don't know the answer, which may also be because I don't know the literature. May also be because I don't know the literature enough. But you see, this result is for the Taurus, right? So, and but you're not done if you have proven the statement for the torus. Really, what you should do is you should develop this for a surface of an arbitrary genus and with insertions. But even without insertions, there should be another theory which is like Zhu's theory for genus two surfaces, say. And then one should compare it to the mapping class group on genus. To the mapping class group on genus 2 surfaces, which comes out of the TFT. So, as far as I know, this has not been done. But please correct me. But in any case, there are still things to do, even in the semi-simple setting. Good. So, what is, so suppose you know this result, what's that good for? And an application of And an application of this result is the Wallinde formula. So suppose you wanted to count how often does the simple object K appear in the tensor product of I and J. Then you're looking at the dimension of this home space, and that's usually called a fusion rule. Now, because you're computing the dimension of a home space, you can write this as a TQFT expression where you look TQFT expression where you look at the three manifold as two times as one and you just place these three ribbons in here. Then it computes the dimension of the state space, which is precisely this. Then we had, so that's the closed manifold, and we understood how to evaluate this. We have to do a surgery presentation, which I claim is this. And then for the red link, you have to sum over simples. And if you stare at this for a while, you will arrive at the usual. At the usual Walinda formula. So that's useful because these S's, one can also convince oneself are actually implement the action of the modular S generator, let me go back one slide, also on the space of these Taurus one-point functions. So that gives you surprising results that the modular properties of characters have something to do with the Have something to do with the tensor product properties of representations. Okay, so that's the semi-simple overview or review. Are there any questions about this so far? So, sorry, how exactly does the modularity intern to this picture you drew? I know you just explained it, but I kind of missed it. For you, Drew, I know you just explained it, but I kind of missed this point. Please, sorry, I missed. Can you say it again? Yeah, so you're saying this is an application of, I suppose, the thing you've just been talking about. And so I'm just missing where the modular, the modular group action is. Yeah, sorry, I didn't say that so clearly. So these numbers here, these coefficients, they are They are the action of the modular S generator in a basis. So, this is the modular action on the Taurus state space, written in a basis. And you can either get it out of the TFT or you can get it out of modular properties of characters. So, it's this S. Okay. So, Ingo, there's a question. But, Inga, there's a question in the chat from on the. I can't see the chat. You see, that is. I will read it for you. I'm a very, very gracious host. Is there an analogue of the spanning property in the presence of field insertions as in your top picture on the previous slide? I think that's, was that Andre's question? Sorry, I've already asked that. It was answered. Thanks. Oh, my apology. So the answer is yes. And my manifolds always contain ribbon graphs. Otherwise, that doesn't work. Very well. So then we want to get rid of semi-simplicity. So we still have this result here, but we don't know if this category Rep V is modular. We don't even know if it's ribbon. So let's just conjecture that that's true. So we conjecture Rep V is a modular tensor category. And so usually this is taken to mean some... So, usually, this is taken to mean semi-simple, but I will include non-semi-simple tensor categories in here. And I take this now to be a finite tensor category, which is also a ribbon category and where the braiding satisfies an on-degeneracy condition, which is that the only transparent objects are direct sums of the tensor unit. Good. So, that's not known in general. So that's not known in general. What is known is that if you would already know that this Rev V is rigid, then you can prove that it's modular, which I find very funny. But that's also a recent result by McRae. Good. But so, because in general you don't know this, you don't know if it's a modular tensor decor. So it's still a conjecture. But we will work with this. But we will work with this. And I want to give one example of such a modular tensor category or one family of examples, which I like, which is called symplectic fermions. So these categories, I will call them SF, N beta. So these are the categories. N is such an integer, 1, 2, 3, and so on. And beta is just some internal parameter which can take four different values. And I will. And I will describe a little bit what these categories look like. So, as the C linear category, they are Z2 graded. They have a non-semi-simple bit, which is representations in supervector spaces of the Grassmann algebra in 2n generators. So, I have 2n anti-commuting quantities. So, this has dimension 2 to the 2n, and you look at representations in supervector spaces. And then there's a semi-simple bit, which is just another copy of super vector spaces. So the tensor product here will respect this grading. And so just from looking at this, you see that independent of n, there'll always be four simple objects, which are the tensor unit, which is just C10, then its parity shifted version, and then the two simples in here, which I call T. Symbols in here, which I call t and pi t. And for example, the tensor product of t with itself produces something which lives here, and it produces the algebra, the Gassman algebra as a module over itself, for example. And should I say more about this? So in structure, this is a bit reminiscent of Tamba Yamangami categories. There is a framework in which you can fit both this and Tamba Yamagami. This and Tamba Yamagami categories. So, anyway, so that's my example. And this example is motivated by a certain VOA, which I will not define in detail. I'll just give it a name. So it's the even part of the symplectic fermion super VOA at central charge minus 2n. So this is C2 cofinite and has all these properties we want. finite and has all these properties we wanted. So you look at its representations. And conjecturally, for a specific value of beta, this is given by the category I just described. And so this equivalence is a fact as C linear categories, has been recently proven for n is 1 as part of some more general statements. And for n greater than 1 is still a conjecture. So that's the connection to VOA. So that's the connection to VOA. So, why one might want to look at these categories from a VOA point of view? They are also good to work with explicitly because you can give a factorizable ribbon quasi-Hopf algebra, which produces this as a representation theory. So, in general, you can't do this with the Hopf algebra. You need this more complicated thing, but that gives you a very explicit description of this category. What will be more important for me to show? More important for me to show the sort of things which go wrong is the following little table of quantum dimensions of the simple objects. So, remember, we had these four simple objects independent of n. And their quantum dimensions are, well, the tensor unit has dimension one, that's good. The odd dimensional, one-dimensional supervector space has dimension minus one, but t and pi t have quantum dimension zero and um. And so that, so in particular, it's not the vector space dimension of these, right? And so that's sort of a shadow of a general statement, which is that if you have a non-semi-simple modular category and it has, or just a non-semi-simple spherical tensor category, is good enough. If you have projective objects, then their categorical trace is zero. That's the shadow of this because these are projective. Good. So we remember these numbers: one minus one and zeros. And now we try to do what we did for the semi-simple Rostikin-Turaev theory in this example. And what happens then is that you get boring invariants. And so let's look at two boring invariants. So pick a link R colored in this category. In this category, I just described in the symplectic fermion category. So it's a link, so it gives a morphism from the unit to the unit in my category. So this is SF. I should have said SF here. Let me say. This is SFN. Beta category. And so this gives a number. Now I want to. So in particular, I'm excluding coupons here. So that's just a link, right? It's not a general rhythm graph. Now. Now, if this link contains any of the colors t or pi t, then this invariant is just zero. So, okay, so that's not so interesting. If none of the edges is colored in this color, in these colors, then so it only contains colors from the grade zero component. So, that's a non-semi-simple bit. One can show that it actually factors. Show that it actually factors, this invariant factors through the Grotendieck ring. That's a bit of a terrible notation. That's the Grotendieck ring. This is the Grassmann algebra. Nobody will be confused. So it factors through the Grotendiek ring, and the Gordon Dick ring of this category is just the same as that of S vect. So it's the group algebra of Z over 2. So the invariance this produces are the same as those for S vect. And that's symmetric. And so the invariant doesn't see anything, it doesn't see any. Doesn't see anything, doesn't see any structure, it just counts components. So that's boring. So we had something which is pretty, which is a non-semi-simple modular category. And we try to do what we do with usual modular categories, and we get nothing. Now let's try also to do what one does to compute link invariance via surgery to see that it's also boring. So now let R be a link in a three-manifold M. Then we pick some surgery. Then we pick some surgery presentations. Here's my little example of this. Then in the usual Restikin-Turayev theory, we are instructed to sum over symbols and color the surgery link by simples. Now, if I do this in this SF example, I have four summons, right? The simple can be one, pi one, t or pi t. Two of these are straight off zero. And for one and pi one, these are transparent. So, one and pi one, I can just compute what I get by the previous argument, and they just don't do anything. So, they just always give one. So, it can't even detect the third reling. It can't detect the manifold. So that's also disappointing. You had a pretty category. You do your previous procedure and it gives something which doesn't depend on the manifold. So, what that So, what that shows you is that you need to modify what you are doing to get your T curve T. And that's what we will do next. Are there any questions so far? Good. So, what are the ingredients which we need to get an interesting theory? So, to make this problem with the ribbon invariants go away, that they were just too trivial, what one does is one replaces the categorical trace by something called a modified trace. I'll explain this a little bit. Then the surgery color, which happened to be just sum over symbols, will be replaced by something more complicated where this L becomes a coand, which is a Hopf algebra, and the surgery color will be an integral for this Hopf algebra. integral for this Hopf algebra. And then if we get there, the VOA characters have to be replaced by pseudo-traces. So traces go to something more complicated. But for the purely categorical part and the topological part, the top two things here are relevant. So modified traces. So they can be defined quite generally. So already this setting up here, finite tensor categories which are spherical. Finite tensor categories, which are spherical, is already quite restrictive. So, but in this setting, a modified trace or modified write trace, I should say, but later we are braided, so it doesn't matter. So, a modified trace will be defined on an ideal in this category. And I'll only consider the projective ideal. Again, this can be done more generally. It's an ideal in the sense it's closed undertaking tensor products. And direct sounds. Then, a modified trace is a family of linear maps from the endomorphism algebra of a projective to the ground field. And we want it to behave on the one hand like a trace. So it should be cyclic. That's this condition. And we want it to be compatible with this spherical structure which we impose by. Which we impose by this partial trace property. So, if we trace over a tensor product of a projective with anything, and because it's ideal, that's again projective, so that makes sense. Then we can do the categorical trace on this leg, then we only get an endomorphism of p, and that has to be the same. That's the notion of a modified trace. It's only defined on the projective objects. Okay, so that's a definition. So that's a definition, but the good thing is they also exist. And in fact, they are kind of an intrinsic property. So if you have one of these modular tensor categories, not necessarily semi-simple, then a non-zero modified trace exists and is unique up to scalars. So there's no choice up to a normalization in this modified trace in this setting. So what have we gained if we do this? So let us assume C is such a modifier. C is such a module tensor category, which is not semi-simple. P is a projective, which is not zero. Then the categorical trace for any endomorphism of P, the categorical trace will be zero, simply because something which goes from the unit into something projective into the unit is zero in this setting. On the other hand, you can always find an endomorphism of P such that the Of p such that the modified trace is non-zero, right? So it's sort of much more non-degenerate than the categorical trace. Okay, so that we achieved. So that was the first ingredient. The next ingredient is these coens and integrals. So here I'll be more brief. So do coens and so to explain. So, to explain this in detail, that would take too long. So, I'll just throw some words at you and do an example. So, if C is a modular tensor category, then we consider a particular coand, which is the coand over the functor x dual tensor x. And so, this now is an object in C. And one can show that that's actually a Hopf algebra in C, so internal to this category. In C, so internal to this category C. And for Hopf algebras, also in these more general categories, one can develop a theory of integrals. One can show in this setting that there is a non-zero integral from 1 into L and they are unique up to scalars as for usual Hopf algebra. Now, the example I will do is what happens if C is semi-simple. Then L is this object. Then L is this object we used in the Rustik and Turayv theory before, just the sum over symbols, I star tensor I. And the integral is this, will play the role of the surgery color. It is this sum over dimensions times, well, the co-evaluations, which is then map into here. Right, so this is how the surgery color will generalize from the semi-simple setting. Good. So now I want to define using these two ingredients, modified traces and this co-and-Hopf algebra and integrals to define a TQFT which is built out of a not necessarily semi-simple modular tensor category. And we have to pay a price, or at least we do not know how to. Or, at least, we do not know how to not pay the price, which is to restrict the bordisms on which this can act. So, we had the full category of borderisms, which were marked surfaces and ribbon graphs, three manifolds embedded ribbon graphs. And we select only some. So the objects are the same, but we don't have quite as many borders. And the bordisms must satisfy the condition that they should have a The condition that they should have a projective ribbon in every connected component disjoint from the incoming boundary. So, whether this is incoming or outgoing, that's a choice you put into the theory once, but it has to be one. And the reason why there has to be a projective ribbon somewhere is that we want to use a modified trace at some point, and it wants a projective. So, so what does this slightly opaque condition do with our borders category? Do with our Bodism category. So here's an example. So one thing it kills off is invariance of three manifolds without embedded ribbon graphs, because there is no projective that's certainly disconnected from any boundaries. So these are gone. So if you want to compute invariance of a closed manifold, you have to put some projective ribbon somewhere in this theory. The other thing which happens is that no longer are all objects or all surfaces dualizable. So, all surfaces dualizable because sort of the evaluation map is okay because it's connected to the incoming boundary, but the co-evaluation map is not because it's disconnected. And if it's just empty, that's not okay. So you need to put some projective ribbon in there for this to be in the category. So this means that only some objects will be dualizable, namely those which have at least one point marked by a projective. Okay, so. Okay, so that's the category we will work with. And well, so how do you compute invariance in the theory? So the setup is precisely in the same way as I described it in the semi-simple Russiken-Purayev theory. You do something for closed invariants, you say what the state spaces are, and then you have this Bordism generation and test properties. Test property. So, if I have a closed manifold with some ribbon graph in it and at least one edge which is labeled by a projective, then the procedure to assign a number to this is now much more complicated. So, it has more steps. So, the first thing is as before, pick a surgery presentation. So, here's my surgery link. Then you pick one of your projective Pick one of your projective labels, say this one, and you cut the projective label and you cut the two surgery links and you bring them to the bottom here. And now you can think of this as a morphism from this tensor product to the tensor unit. You've made choices, and in the end, you have to prove that it doesn't depend on the choices. So, this is true and has to be done. Good. So, now comes something. Now comes something which I didn't explain properly, which is that this morphism in A star A and B star B is dinatural and satisfies the universal property of the coand. So this gives a map where I can replace this by a copy of the coand. But then I lose this graphical presentation. So the universal property of the coand just tells me there is some F where I now start with two copies of the coand and I still have the other two. Of the coand, and I still have the other two arguments, p and p dual. And in the two legs which are now labeled by the coand, I plug the integral. Okay, and now I'm just left with p p dual. And well, I bend one leg up and I take a modified trace. And that's my invariant. And then one proves that that is indeed an invariant. And it now is also a more non-trivial invariant. Okay. Okay, so that's what it does to closed manifolds. And for state spaces, it does the same as before. So this is exactly the same formula as before, only that what L means is now has been appropriately generalized to the non-semi-simple setting. And the other property, the Bordism generated and this test property also hold, and they fix the theory uniquely, and one can then show that you get a T curve T out of this. You get a T curve T out of this restricted Borison category into vector spaces. Okay, and it has two important properties. One is that the projective mapping class group representations you get out of this, they agree with mapping class group representations which Lubashenko has found many years ago, working directly with these non-semisimple categories. But for a long time, there was no TQFT known. Was no TQFT known which would produce these. So that sort of fills this gap. And also importantly, if you plug in a semi-simple modular tensor category, then you get the original Restikin-Turayev construction back. So in this sense, it's a generalization. Okay, so that's about the non-semi-simple T curve T. Are there any questions about this? So, does Lubachenko also want you to label something by projective somewhere? So, right. So, for the projective, so to get the mapping class group action, you have to look at these mapping cylinders, and they are connected to the incoming boundary, and there's no requirement for there to be a projective. So, Lubashenko doesn't need any projective mark points, and also here you don't need any. Also, here you don't need any because mapping cylinders, all of them are allowed, no restriction on the labels. So, if I flip back a little bit, so there's this opaque condition, which only applies if you're disconnected from the incoming boundary. But the mapping cylinders are not. Ah, okay. Oh, okay, okay. I see, because this was also with your evaluation, co-evaluation. One was okay, one wasn't because of the If not, then we come to the actually, do we come to the I still have like eight minutes or so. Yep, that's right. Oh, good. So we will see how far we get with this. So then we come back to VOAs. So Come back to VOAs. So, that was my we take a non-semi-simple modular category and we get a TQFT and mapping class group representations out of it. Then in the semi-simple setting, we looked at the torus and we were able to link that to something to do with VOA and compare actions. So I want to do something similar here, but I won't be able to prove anything. So let now V be a VOA with our initial condition, so C2 cofinite and Initial conditions, so C2 co-finite and the other conditions are listed, minus it being rational. So it's allowed to have a non-semi-simple representation theory. Then I want to pick a projective generator in here that exists because it's finite. Then I look at the endomorphism algebra of G and I should probably have defined this. I should probably have defined this. So, and then I look at these symmetric forms or central forms on here. And this sim means that is a map from N V G to C, which is a symmetric linear form. So f of phi of A times B is equal to phi of B times A. And so if this were also non-degenerate, were also non-degenerate would turn this into a symmetric Frobenius algebra but we don't demand it to be non-degenerate and then in terms of these phi's one can produce a generalization of characters so these are these pseudo-trace functions which I saw called psi and then depends on this phi and it depends on an argument from the VOA and the tor and the upper half plane. In the upper half plane, and there, if this were a trace, that would be what we had previously for characters. And now I replace it by this more complicated construction, which uses something called Hatori-Daling's traces. So, I don't want to go into the details of how this works. I just want to give some intuition for this. So, if you think of, I'll say, an upper triangular matrix, then the usual trace to take. matrix than the usual trace detects the diagonal. But these Hattoris-Darling's traces are built to also detect off-diagonal terms in a coherent way. So think of this as a generalization of a trace, which can detect more of the linear map you plug in. Good. So So these pseudo-trace functions, one can show that they still are torus one-point functions, right? So this is a space defined by Jou, and also these lie in there. What else can one show? One can show that for each representation of the VOA, there is some such symmetric form, so that if I do this ψ phi m construction. Do this ψm construction, I get the actual character, no funny traces, the honest trace over the representation for this representation M. So it includes... I interrupted to ask a question about these Hattoi-Starling's traces. So the way I like to think of traces is not so much in terms of the formula, but in terms of the properties, like trace of X times Y equals trace of Y times X. Are there some properties of these Hattori-Stalings traces that I should keep in mind? Straces that I should keep in mind the one you just said, that's true. Um, oh, it actually applies that same property. Um, so I don't think I can come up with a universal description of these right now. I could, um, if there's time later, I can define how I can tell you how they are defined. I'm not sure if that's helpful. Okay. Well, maybe actually, maybe I can do a little example. So, so, so, so, this is something you do in the context of um algebra. So, so here's a little side show. So, let me take an algebra, which is c of x over x to the d and let me take a linear map, which is, say, right multiplication by some. Write multiplication by some x to the L. Right? Then if I take the vector space trace over a, so a, yeah, never mind. So if I take the vector space trace over a of R L, then that's going to be zero for L greater or equal to one, right? Because it's purely off-diagonal. But I can I can for phi, I can now take any map I want. In particular, I could take for phi the Fubinius form on here. So phi of x to the d minus 1 is 1. And then this construction here, this Torre-Stalling strace for phi of RL would now instead be delta L T minus 1. So it sort of detects the top component. Detect the top component. So, in this sense, it's much more non-degenerate than the vector space trace. So, I didn't explain why that makes sense and how it comes out of a general formalism, but in this example, that's something which happens. Any other questions? So you can get the usual characters back. And so now comes the conjecture, which it would be nice to know, is that in fact, in this way, you parametrized the torus one-point functions. They are in bijection with these symmetric forms on the generator. It's true in the semi-simple setting and in Setting and in the general setting, I don't know. So let's conjecture this. And then we can compare SL to Z actions. So let me sort of go back a slide. Sorry. So we have an SL to Z action on here. So it gets transported here. So that's now on the side of the category. So now let's produce one which comes out of the TFT, which also acts here, and then we can have a statement. So we have one of our non-statements. So we have one of our non-semi-simple modular categories. And then one proves a little lemma that the natural transformations of the identity functor are the same thing as these symmetric forms on end G. And one can give an explicit map, which takes the natural transformation and does something with the modified trace, evaluate the natural transformation on G, and then compose with anything and some prefector which I. Compose with anything and some prefactor, which I will not explain. So one shows this is an ISO, that's an algebra statement. And then you get an isomorphism from TQ of T state space walking through a number of isomorphisms. So let's see. So this is the definition of the state space of the TQ of T. This is isomorphic by the natural universal property of the coand, and then this is the ISO I've just described. And so now I've got another. And so now I've got another SL to Z action on this space. And so then the conjecture, which is the analog of this conjecture, which leads to the Willindo formula in the semi-simple case, is this. So now, for these more general view A's, you look at the representation theory, and then the TFT action on T2 gets via these isomorphisms transported to the modular action on torus one-point functions. One-point functions, so we have so this is a conjecture, it's not proven. Um, it's proven in the semi-simple case, right? That's the theorem by Huang. I quoted it is actually proven for symplectic fermions for N is one and checked to some extent for higher n. But it would be good to know this in general. And so, again, if you know this, you can compute fusion rules, which until rules which until the chairman shouts at me I will explain briefly so so what does it have to do with fusion rules so first we have to say what we mean by fusion rules and what we will do is we compute structure constants of the Grotendiek ring now so let's see be a modular 10 So let C be a modular tensor category. And for an object in C, I can define a natural transformation simply by saying if I evaluate an object, it's the map where I have a ring labeled X around a straight line labeled W. And then one can show that this defines an injective ring homomorphism from the Gordon Beak ring to the natural. The Gordon Dig ring to the natural transformations. So, ring homomorphism is easy, injective is the thing you have to think about. And so then, again, we have this transported action. And then I do something slightly bizarre, which is I take this natural transformation sigma of x and I look at its pre-image under the s action. That's another element in here, and I want to call this phi x. To call this phi x. And the reason is that one can show that these correspond to characters of the VOA and under this map xi I had defined. Okay, so conversely, if you use this conjecture that the torus one point functions are the same as this, then you can take your character and transport it back here, and it gives you these elements phi. Right? And if you have this, then And if you have this, then you can compute the structure constant of the Grotendiegring by applying this S to the phys and apply S inverse and expanding it again in the phies. And so you only use the phase and the action of the S generator, and you again learn something about fusion rules. And I think maybe I show this: that there is also an invariant of a TFT invariant which computes this, and I shut up. Thank you very much. Computers and I shut up. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much, Ingo. So, any more questions for Ingo, please? Feel free to shout out. So, should I understand this labeling by objective is just to make sure that you're not getting trivial information, or should I understand this as? Or should I understand this as necessary for the axioms of the TQFT to hold or something? So well, so I would say it like this. So we have a construction of a TQ of T and it requires there to be a projective. So otherwise the construction doesn't work. Therefore, it's only defined on this. It's only defined on this smaller borderism category. Now, it may be that some other construction allows you, in some cases, to extend it to the bigger border category. So we haven't investigated obstructions. So clearly, in the semi-simple case, whether or not there's a projective ribbon is artificial, because you can always place a sort of a loop and label it by the tensor unit, which is projective, and thereby would make it allowed. Projective and thereby would make it allowed. But in the non-semi-simple case, because we are using these modified traces, we need at least one ribbon which is labeled protective. Okay, so okay. So the modified trace is necessary for the functioning of the of the TQFT in an essential way. Well, right. So in and the essential way is, so you can, so let me. So, you can so let me go back a little bit. Um, so so you can still define these closed invariants, but they'll be too degenerate to define a TQFT. They'll be too often zero. So, if you were to do these invariants here in terms of the categorical trace, it would be too degenerate and you wouldn't get a TQFD. Okay. I have more questions. Okay, I have more questions, but maybe I'll save them. Well, that's very generous. Does anybody else want to ask a question? Otherwise, feel free to carry on. Okay, so maybe, yeah, go for it. We'll carry out. So, is there supposed to be some kind of relationship? To be some kind of relationship, I guess the other paper is about extending this to octocomology, where you, you know, I mean, that's setting the fact that you have vanishing homs isn't going to, I mean, well, anyway, is there supposed to be some relationship between what you, what you're doing here and what's happening in that case where they're using comology? So indeed, that's something we want to look at. So one can, on the one hand, One can, on the one hand, take this mapping class group on the Taurus, for example, and its action on the Taurus state space as defined by Lubashenko, which is the same which this TQFT would give you, and lift this to an action on cohomology. So basically, because you have an action on C L1, then you can just take a projective resolution of one and then Then you sort of have a derived version of this home space and you get an action on that. Now, it would be nice if there's a sort of a derived version of the TFT which gives you this, but we don't know. That would be the hope. Okay. Okay. All right. Yeah. Thank you. So maybe I can ask a silly question. Silly question. So you have a path to a Belinda formula, which is guaranteed to work in the rational case, of course. But have you applied this to our good friend the C equals zero triplet, just in case it's add anything useful? The C equals zero triplet? Yeah. Sorry, what's it again? You know, the one that you studied back with Matthias. The C equals zero theory. Zero theory falls outside of our. So let's see, I go back. So cunningly, maybe. So this can't be can't be, you need the, what do you call it, self-dual or self-contragradient? Well, so can't, you know, we can't is maybe the honest answer. So right, so we still work in this setting. In this setting. And so the way the theory is set up, it starts from this module tensor category and it produces a TQFT, and sort of this is the algebraic framework in which you compare things. Now, clearly, what you want to do is look at things which are natural on the VOA side and extend the categorical framework to encompass them. And so the C equals, so this case is C equals to 0 W to 3, for example, it doesn't have a C. It doesn't have a simple tensor unit, its tensor product is not exact, so some things break. And so, what is the correct algebraic framework in which these fit? And is there an analog of some TQFT or maybe at least mapping class group actions? And how would you define them? All this is open as far as I'm aware. All right, so related question, if that's too hard, what other examples do you know that you? Examples do you know that you can try to work with? By know, I mean, you know, not necessarily proof, but we had symplectic fermions. What else was out there? Right. And so then the other one, you know, these so these also work. But these are the two example families we checked. Be checked. So, W1P, the triplet models, and the symplectic fermions. And the reason is, in a way, that you need to compute the categorical S action, and that requires quite a detailed control of the category. And the only way we manage to do this is to find a quasi-Hof algebra which describes this and then compute in terms of the quasi-Hopf algebra. Right. This is sort of super. Um, this is sort of super inefficient, but it gives an answer which one can compare. Okay, so no other examples are on the cards at the moment. Um, you know, so the symplectic fermion, PhD student tick. And maybe, yeah, it's just painful. It would be more interesting. So, if I had the choice to do more examples here or think about this, you know, I'd think I'd go for this, you know. You might be able to find more examples using parafermionic constructions. So, if you take affine SL2, it has a very bad category. But if you look at its parafermions, then that's a much nicer category. And it's very much like the singlet. And so, if you do the extension to the analog of the triplet, you get something which is conjecturally C2 co-finite. So, I don't know whether there's any way of getting. I don't know whether there's any way of getting your hands on a quasi-Hof algebra in that case, but at least it's a natural example. So, the quasi-Hof algebra that these work I see are sort of an accident. So in all of these examples, you can compute Frobenius per one dimensions, and you get a quasi-Hoff algebra if and only if these are integers. So, in a way, the examples where this doesn't happen are more interesting because you're walking outside of this whole. Interesting because you're working outside of the soft algebra domain. Yeah, okay, fair enough. Fair enough. Then the OAs are always so complicated. All right, were there any other questions from the crowd? Yeah, I was wondering, I guess, kind of going back to that question of the The equivalence of the symplectic fermion category and the symplectic fermion VOA for n greater than one. Yeah, I was thinking with the n equals one equivalents that is now available, whether it could be possible to do all of them pretty easily just by, I mean, to get and greater. I mean, to get n greater than 1, I think you should just have to take a tensor product of n equals 1 and then do a simple current extension. Is it clear that the same construction is happening from the quasi-Hopp algebra? I mean, can you describe your category as like the local module category for some simple current extension in a Delian product? The lean product of a bunch of n equals one n equals ones so um all right so i'd expect something like this to work but we haven't tried to make this work so you would up here you'd probably want to take a tensor product of the super view a's and and but then you don't so you don't want to take the even parts and tensor them together because you sort of want them together because you sort of want you want the twisted and untwisted sector for the tensor product VOA, not for each individual factor. So you have to take some more, you can't just delineate product the categories together. It has to be something. Right, right. And then you take, yeah, then you take the simple current extension like some like tensor product over something or do a simple current extension, which I guess will be the same. Yeah, I was just wondering if that's something that's Yeah, I was just wondering if that's something that's clear on the side of the category that you constructed. Not to me at the moment, but you know, after I understand it, it'll be clear. But yeah, I'd expect something like this to work, but we haven't worked it out. And when, so I mean, if you, for example, if you tell this to Zimo Len, he says, yes, yes, that'll work. So it's sort of intuitive to more than just. To more than just me, for example, that that should work, but we haven't done it. Yeah, because that would be the construction from the VOA point. So, and I agree with you that probably at this point, if one were to sit down and stare at this long enough, but maybe does have all the ingredients together to actually say now that it's also true for general. Yeah. So, I just wanted to add that on the talking about Simon Lennon, I guess, wanted to add that. Wanted to add that on the quantum group, on the quasi-op algebra, what happens is if you have n copies of one pair of symplectic fermions, then you have basically n copies of the small quantum group, and you have n different carton parts. And what happens with the simple current extension is mainly you combine all these carton parts to one single cyclic group. So somehow you make the co-radical much, much smaller, but the whole the Borel part stays. But the whole borel part stays as it is. So that's exactly what you would see. But as Ingo says, of course, saying that it should be true and doing it is a different story.
