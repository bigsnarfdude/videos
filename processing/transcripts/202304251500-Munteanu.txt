All right, so thank you very much for the invitation. It's a wonderful place, wonderful people, some friends, some that I just have to know. So this is something that I've been working on and off for some time. So some of you may recognize some older results. May recognize some older results, and towards the end, there's some new results. So, let's see what you already know what spectrum means, and you'll see I put some definitions there, which now they're absolute. Nobody needs those. So, I'll just skip quickly. This is again just in case one wants to see the sign that I'm using. I use the maximum principle a lot, so I like the plus sign. And this is about functions, L2 spectrum. So, in fact, we're not going to compute any spectrum here. So, it's just an introduction. But I'm always going to consider the L2 spectrum, which, as it was pointed out before, is usually a subset of the real line of zero infinity and it's closed. So, you can talk about So you can talk about the bottom spectrum, and that's the notion I need. So I'm not going to compute the whole spectrum for various bases like in the previous talk, just the bottom spectrum. So I'm interested in seeing how much geometric information does the bottom spectrum encode. And as you can see, this already has been discussed. So in Dietchin's talk and you've seen that this number appears a lot for the hyperbolic space, that's the bottom. Uh, for the hyperbolic space, that's the bottom spectrum for the L2, right? So, so they talked about L1, L3, this is L2, which this computation is quite easy to do. So, no need to use heavy machineries. And for me, I'm just interested in the bottom spectrum. So, when I say positive structure of manifolds with positive spectrum, I mean that this number is positive. So, there is a positive constant. Is positive, so there is a positive constant, which I'm going to call lambda one, so that you have the Pointary uniform. So it's a very simple characterization, and that's all we need to know on the spectrum side, on the functionality side. So for any function with compact support, you have this comparative inequality for some positive constant lambda one. So it's not always positive, right? Like in our end, this lambda one could be zero. Be zero. And in fact, there are some examples when it's not zero, like these two. I'm not going to need the first one that much because these are assumptions that I'm not going to make. But just to revisit this result, it's an old result from the 60s, that if you have a Cartan-Hadermart manifold with sectional curvature bounded by that of the hyperbolic space, then lambda one is bounded from below by lambda one of the hyperbolic space. Lambda 1 of the hyperbolic space. So it's a comparison estimate. This one is closer to, I mean, I'm going to use this result later on, or at least mention it. So this is Brooks in the 80s. He proved that if you have a, like we've seen in Paquell's talk, if you have a compact manifold N, and you take its universal cover M, and if the group And if the group, the fundamental group of N is what we call non-amenable, we don't need a definition here. I'll just give you an example of non-amenable, and that's all we need to know. Then lambda one is positive. So non-amenable is something that measured theoretically and it's hard to check. Amenable is somewhat easier to check, but what's known is that free product with two generators is non-amenable. And more generally, And more generally, groups that have such a free product as a subgroup, they are non-aminable. That's more or less the story about this. And we're going to need this example. So if M covers a compact manifold with fundamental group Z product Z, 3 product with Z, then the bottom spectrum is positive. That's Hooke's theorem. This is not a, I mean, it's not an explicit, it's not a dimension. It's not an explicit, it's not a dimension bound or something like that. It's just there is a number which is number one. So you say it's not explicit, it's not attractive, it's atmospheric or something. Yeah, so it's kind of like, right, it depends on many things from that cover. It's not like something that you can, you know, it's dimension alone. Right. So, on the other hand, So, on the other hand, Cheng, this is SY Cheng in the 60s, he has a very influential paper for this kind of business. He proved that if you want the upper bound, so lower bound, as I said, it's more difficult to get, but the upper bound is always there, as long as you have a Ricci lower bound. So, Ricci bounded by Ricci of the hyperbolic space, lambda one is bounded by Richter. Space lambda one is bounded by lambda one of the hyperbolic space, so it's a classical result in comparison geometry. And I sketched here the proof just to see how things like this, so it's definitely something that we can teach in a graduate class. So on comparison estimate, Laplace comparison theorem, which is the basis of many of his results, says Laplace of R is less than n minus one cotangent of r. One cotangent of R, cotangent h of r, and then you use the Lirichle eigenfunction on the pole on the hyperbolic space that depends only on distance, so you import it on your manifold, and you think of it as a function now on the manifold, you use it in lambda one, and oh, you get this. It's just a larger and larger radius. So, there's something that I didn't say on the previous slide: that this lambda one can be. slide that this lambda one can be seen as the limit of lambda one of larger and larger balls so lambda one of m is the limit as r goes to infinity of lambda one of the ball of radius r so if you if you write r of x and get some paris r is the distance on the manifold to some fixed point to some fixed point that is always the same yeah yeah yeah so so this one now you make capital R go to infinity and you're done. capital R goes to infinity and you're done. Right. So R of X is the distance on M, R bar is the distance on the hyperbolic space. R bar of course doesn't matter which point you choose. So this is actually the result that is the basis of everything I'm going to say from now on. So you will see like two more instances of the same result. So this is not mine at all, this is about 20 years ago. This is about 20 years ago, Peter Li Japping one. He proved this statement. So there were some discussions about this kind of rigidity earlier. If you remember in the previous talk, there was this, this rigidity in the sense that if the manifold covers a compact manifold and the spectrum is maximal, then it has to be hyperbolic. The manifold has to be the hyperbolic space. And I think there was even a question. And I think there was even a question: what if it doesn't cover? What happens then? So, in that case, it doesn't have to be hyperbolic. It doesn't. In fact, there are examples like this, which shows that it's less rigid than in the compact case. So, condition on N? On N? Yes, so I didn't put it here to kind of save time. I'll say in a second. So, suppose the manifold is complete, peachy by. Suppose the manifold is complete, beachy bounded below maximum spectrum. Then there are two statements. One state, I mean, there are two cases. Case one, the dimension is four and above. Then you have just this example, the exponential. So this one has an end which is growing exponentially and another end which is a cusp, exponential cusp. And in dimension three, you somehow magically get another example which has two exponentially growing ends. N's. So that only happens in dimension three and not in higher dimensions. N here, so the n that the only conditions that you need on n are to make this work, not for lambda one. So just to make the Ricci lower bound. So that means for the first example, Ricci of N has to be at least non-negative. And for the second example, Ricci of N has to be at least that of the Einstein manifold of negative curvature. So manifold of negative curvature. So in this case, n minus 2 that I made, minus n minus 2. So it's just to make it work the lower bound, nothing else. You don't need it for line. So again, I somehow, this wasn't planned. So this, I didn't know there will be talks about this subject. So yeah, so this is related to conformally compact. I don't know if you've seen this already or not. If you've seen this already or not, of course, you have. So, it was just in the previous talk. We didn't coordinate. So, this is good for me. I don't need to explain what this is. But this result of Witten and Hao somehow surprisingly started the whole business. So, the business was not started as a question: okay, we have Cheng's estimate. What if we have more than one and can we characterize equality? But it was kind of Quality, but it was kind of developed through this theorem of Witteningho in early 2000. So this apparently has nothing to do with end. Conformally compact Einstein, if the boundary, this boundary of M has positive MRB invariant. So I said non-negative, that's the improvement of chi and gallow rate, but we can now prove this for positive steps. Then it has to be connected, which means it has only one end, right? The manifold has one end. So the connection to spectrum comes from Lee's theorem, Jack Lee's theorem, that if it's Einstein, so here I mean in this setting, compact, conformally compact Einstein, this has spectrum exactly this. So then you somehow see that. See that there is a connection with. Okay, so I'm skipping two pages at once. There is a connection with this. Yes. So you mean by this format with Linux? You mean your army invariant objective? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. Parse MRB invariant folder boundary. And also or non-negative, right? So positive was written now, Chi Galloway was improved to non-negative Yao. Was improved it to non-negative Yama being valid. Yeah. So I put it non-negative, but we didn't now really prove the positive case. And then the development which kind of relates to what we're doing here came from, this is a different one from before, this is Chao Dong-wang from University of Michigan State, who realized that you can start to eliminate some of these assumptions. You don't need Einstein manifold, and you don't need. And you don't need non-negative scalar graphs, you don't need non-negative gamma invariant. So you can start to eliminate those. He added an assumption on lambda one, which was not this one, was a different one. And then he realized that besides Wittenyao, you get this example. All right, so this is how things develop. This example was also remarked by Witten and Yao. They said, remarked by Witten and Yepp. They said in their paper they say of well our theorem is sharp because if the conformal metric doesn't have, if the is the Yamabi is not non-negative or positive in that case, we have this example, the cos H, which shows that the cos H again, since you asked the assumption here, has to be that this for this to be Einstein, n has to be Einstein as well of negative. Einstein as well of negative constant. So they said that violates our assumption that the Yamabi is positive. So somehow they already kind of found the example that will appear later in Xiaodong-wang's paper. And Xiaodong-wen says, well, their example is the only one that can appear. And then later, Ja Ping and Peter, they say, well, you don't need Einstein, you don't need conformally compact. Conformally compact, you don't need Yama bits because there's no discussion about that. All you need is spectrum to be maximal and you have a theorem. And then you get another example, the exponential example, which does not fit into this function. It's not conformally compact. The exponential e to the 2p example is not conformally compact. So I'll explain how, I will not explain how this is done, this is done with. Explain how this is done. This is done with the so-called brain action. So it's a different proof, but I'll explain how Li and Wang proof go, which is important for later discussions. So I'm not really sketching their proof. They published two papers essentially on this subject. But the theorem that I stated is actually made out of two papers put together. So I'm just going to sketch a little bit. A little bit. So we use. Could you go back one more thing? Right. So it's true for I understand, isn't it? Whether circumstances like just ask them planned with all they can to scale their curvature? I'm not aware of a result like that. But I just thought so again. So I'm going to go ahead and do Condition is there? I think it's just asymptotically hyperbolic, which means it can be component, I understand, and maybe scalar curvature greater than minus 85. Yeah, I think that I probably from yeah, scalar culture we we all scale matches that scale culture exactly how it's got. Exactly. My second second minus one. Because you have the above number, it's all sure. So, okay, that's kind of marginally related, just to motivate the results, so that I guess that we could discuss it later. But this is related not to the proof of Wittenyal, this is related to the proof of Li-Wang, which is, as I said, more general because we don't need any of I said more general because we don't need any assumptions about the geometry of infinity. So there's a whole theory that actually started in the public 50s, 60s with Syria and Nakai and independently somewhat later by Li and Tan. They studied more systematically. This is a theory for all manifolds, not just for ones with positive spectrum, but in their paper about positive spectrum. Paper about positive spectrum, Peter and Japping, they clarified exactly what could happen with the sequence. So, what sequence? You can think of the manifold as having two ends. It can have more, but you just take one end, which again can have many other components. You take one end, you take the complement. So, you're kind of thinking like you have exactly two ends and you solve a boundary values problem. So, function is zero and one, take the limit. The limit. Make sense? So that's what you're doing. And you're interested to know what happens with this sequence. So you'd like to know you are, does it converge? So it will always converge. The problem is it might converge to a constant. So in some cases, we will see that that's exactly what happens. So these are the two scenarios when the spectrum is positive. It's quite neat, I would say. Need, I would say. So, first of all, the volume of the manifold has to be infinite. So, manifolds with passive spectrum have infinite, in fact, have exponentially volume growth. So, they're big, big manifolds. So, one of E can have, let's set E to be the one, at least one of them has infinite N, so infinite volume, so let's set that to be E. And then F, the complement could either be finite or infinite volume, right? So, in the case where So, in the case when both sides are infinite volume, then indeed the sequence UR with 0 and 1 or larger and larger spheres converges uniformly to a harmonic function which is of finite energy, but not just finite energy. In fact, you have very good decay of the L2 energy outside the ball. The point here, of course, the ball is at the The ball is at the fixed point. I don't want to make the slides too complicated. So, if you choose here a point P, C will depend on P, R is it. But this is about how it behaves for large R. And the function, you will never be able to prove that the function in general, right? In general genetic, it's not true that the function goes to zero and goes to one, but it goes along a sequence to zero, it goes along a sequence to one, which is enough for most. Which is enough for most applications that you care about. It may not go to zero uniformly. That's a problem. In the other case, when you may have a cost, right, the volume could be finite for one of the ends, then the sequence goes to zero. There's nothing you can do about that. It will not go to a non-constant function. But you can rescale it inside. So you can fix a ball. So you can fix a ball and say, okay, it goes to zero, but if I rescale the sequence to be one in that ball, to be supremum equal to one in that ball, then that rescaling will converge to a harmonic function, which now on the infinite volume end behaves exactly like before. Nothing has changed. But on the infinite volume, no, on the finite volume end, the function just converges to infinity. This time it's a limit, not just a limp zoo. Just the Lin Soup. And again, just like before, but not here, not on F, just on E. So the functions have good behavior, right? It's proper on one of the ends, and it has finite energy on the other end, or here or the same way. So U and V, these are the harmonic functions. These are the test functions that you use in the lambda one. And they give you rigidity. Right, John, in one of the talks earlier, there was a question, how do you? Earlier, there was a question: how do you get splitting? How do you get the rigidity? You need to construct a Busman function or something to give you the splitting. So, here it becomes from the harmonic function from either U or V. So e to the 2t, that work product, is of case 2. So, case 2 is one end is big, one end is small. And you use this as a test function. They didn't use the They didn't use this, but I'm kind of changing it for today's talk. So you use this as a test function and plug it in. This is a big line. It's not exactly this. You have to add things because this is not with compact support. So you have to add the cutoff. But I don't want to put cutoff terms here because it gets too complicated. But if you just formally replace, this is a test function. This is a test function, and when you do grad squared, you get the 1 over 4. And the other way, you get it by using the Buckner formula and with the improved cutting equality. So you can see that this guy is n minus 1 squared, and then they cancel out. So it gives you that one number equals the same number. So everything you've done has to be faulted. Defaulting Barnard formula gives you splitting. Gives you splitting. So that's the idea. But the major thing, so this works like a formal calculation, but the major thing is you have to worry a lot about how this grows at infinity. And luckily, you have estimates at infinity, so they might help. So you have to worry about the terms. Again, here you have to put a cutout. Here you integrate, but you get some integral on this. Integrate, but you get some integral on the larger and larger spheres. How do they behave at infinity? I can tell you that they don't just go to zero. There's a balancing phenomenon that something that you get on one on the end has to cancel with something that you get on the other end. So they don't go to zero, the kind of the Karas terms, they're not zero. One is negative one, one is plus one, and they cancel out. That, unfortunately, That unfortunately doesn't happen for the cost H case, and that's why n equals 3 doesn't work. Only in n equals and n greater than 3 doesn't work. Only n equals 3 works. So in n equals 3, those you can use the same principle, the same idea, and formally it should work. And then you're surprised how come the theorem is true only in n equals 3, not in n equals 4. But the reason is because here I'm not including the Not including the terms involving the cutoff, which they cancel out and they give you the splitting in one of the settings in case two, but in case one they don't. So that's a tricky business. And in fact, this example, the bottom spectrum of this one is n minus 2. It's not n minus 1 squared over 4. n minus 1 squared over 4. It's n minus 2. So it's because of those cancellations, you shouldn't get the result you're looking for. It's n minus 2, not this. But in n equals 3, n minus 2 and n minus 1 squared over 4 give you 1. That's why it works. So it's kind of, and I've never heard a better explanation than this: that there are two numbers that just are equal to each other. So I've heard them both speak. So, I've heard them both speaking, and yeah, they're two numbers, and when they hit equal, then you know. All right, so let's see. Does it work? No. All right, so since this is about M Pasa-Einstein manifolds, I have a slide, two slides with Rigisolibens, which we use this theory developed by. Developed by my collaborator Jia Ping and Peter Li to prove this theorem. This was a long time ago, but I thought it's good to include it as part of this theory. We prove that a steady solitant, so you've seen in Hernano on Monday, you've seen that the definition, so steady solitons exist only in the Steady solvents exist only in the non-compact case, and it is an interesting question to see: can they have more than one end? Like, can we understand the topology at infinity of steady solvents? And this sketch here is what we did in 2012 when we realized that there is a connection with the previous slides, with the Li-Wang theory. So, we proved that it has more than one end space. One end is fixed. And this time we didn't work with the usual Laplacian, we worked with the weighted Laplacian, and we did everything for the weighted Laplacian. But the question is: what's your model space and what is your Ricci-Lohrba? So in some sense, we prove that the model space is any steady solute. So it's not a hyperbolic space. It's any steady solute, and it's a model space. So there's a Hamilton identity which you might. Hamilton identity, which you might have seen on Monday, and the scalar curvature is not negative for steady solid density. So, this gives you the potential F has rows at most linearly, and you can normalize that to be one. You can put here any constant, it's just a rescaling of your soliton metric. But I choose it to be one. So, then this is the theory that I mean, this is what relates to D1, and I'm going to stop with that. I'm not going to do any. Stop with that. I'm not going to do any other proof. So now you look at the manifold N with the measure, smooth measure attached to it, and you will assume that the back immediately is not zero, but it's non-negative, and the gradient is not, is bounded by one, just like in the previous. And then you can prove this, right? So this is something that we proved. It wasn't known. And we proved that. And we prove that the bottom spectrum has a sharp upper bound. And the sharp upper bound is actually achieved by any steady salt. So any steady salt then has maximum bottom of spectrum. In fact, we have the same theorem for entropy that was discussed before. So it's the same result for entropy. All of them, so they will be equal in this case. In this case. So then, of course, there are a lot of details that you have to check, and the query doesn't quite follow the usual route that I mentioned earlier. But in principle, it kind of tells you that you're on a good idea, right? That you have a manifold which achieves maximum baron spectrum on all similar manifolds with the Ricci lower bound, with an appropriate Ricci-lower bound. So that was the idea. Lower bound. So that was the idea. And then we followed some of the previous calculations. So for the rest of the talk, I'll present real development. As I said, this was done about 10 years ago. And recently we did the same kind of period, but now we want to replace Ricci by scalar. So of course this makes no sense in general. Makes no sense in general. It won't work. But in 3D, we prove that it does work. So this is the theorem that we proved last year, last year. So we prove that if you have scalar lower bounds. So here for your entertainment, let's put k to be either 0 or 1. So let's include also scalar non-negative. Even that case, I think it's very interesting. So scalar could be either non-negative. So, scalar could be either non-negative or scalar could be minus 6. So, 6 is, of course, corresponds to the space form, right? Hyperbolic space in 3D has scalar equals to minus 6. This, we hope one day to remove this. The constant here plays no role. So it's just a constant because we don't, as you know, the goal of this is to do analysis with just scalar curvature, but we need some Ricci curvature too, right? So we can't just do scalar alone. Can't just do scalar alone. Some reach is needed, but the constant doesn't play any role. In fact, you can put here minus c times log of the distance or minus c times r to some power. You can do something like that. But here, the k is the same one as in lambda one. So this is sharp. Before that, it was n minus one squared over four. So in dimension three minus one, which is exactly what we proved. What we prove. And somehow, surprisingly, you need either one of these assumptions, so not both, one of the assumptions is needed in the proof. So either that homology, so there's no sphere that is in H2 or that it has finite dimensions and the Petty number is finite. First Petty number is fine. First that the number is R. So we need these assumptions to prove that you're. So A means is only torsion or does it spherical classes? I don't know. Does it mean? Yeah, so you can have torus or genus positive genus. Right, so H2 doesn't have, like, if you have a surface that's non-trivial, Non-trivial, then it it can't be a sphere. So if it's a sphere, it has to bound a domain. I mean, it's so topology. I mean, there are some sets, yeah, there's a language, some petty number, and then there's some torsion. Can you translate it in that language? Or does it? But this is in Z, so why torsion? I'm asking what the statement means. The statement means that if you have a hypersurface in this three-dimensional manifold, if that is a sphere, if it's topologically a sphere, then it has to bound the domain. So this is what you mean by that's what it means. So the only non-trivial surfaces in in H two can be tori or genus part genus. Or genus alpha genus. And this one means that in H2, right, you can, well, in H1, then you can, that these loops that are non-trivial, they have to be bounded. They have to stay in a compact set. They cannot go to infinity. So we thought for some time that these assumptions are kind of Assumptions are kind of strange and they shouldn't appear, right? We've never seen problems where you have topological assumptions to prove lambda one estimates. Why would topology influence the lambda one? So after giving this talk a few times, Chotoshin and Lee, they told me that they've been working on something else, on minimal surfaces, and somehow ended up using this fact that this man. This fact that this manifold has vastly spectrum. So recall Brooks said that if the fundamental group is Z product with Z, free product with Z, then lambda 1 has to be positive. But this manifold has positive scalar curvature. So in fact, you can make it constant scalar curvature, a positive number. So the result cannot. So, the result cannot be true in general. So, k equals 0, scalar non-negative, should imply lambda 1 equals 0 in our theorem, but it does not, right? So, because that example. But this example has infinitely many ends. So, that's why our assumption makes sense. And also, you see the s2s that are not trivial. So, this example. So, this example shows you that some assumptions are needed, some topological assumptions are needed, otherwise, the theorem cannot hold. And also, in dimension four, as I said, there's no hope to get a result. So, you can make scalar, you can also make just like here, you can make scalar to be non-negative. So, the result would be okay, lambda one has to be zero, but it's not, it's actually a positive number. So, um Right, so this was kind of surprising to us that you can do analysis and you can hopefully use just scalar curvature alone, but it turns out that it's not the case. You need some analysis, I mean you need some geometry, the scalar curvature, and you need the topology as well. And finally, for the next few minutes, this is even more recent, like as of this year, we try to analyze what happened. We try to analyze what happens in the equality case. Can we prove a theorem, a splitting theorem? If the manifold has scalar curtains bounded by that of the hyperbolic space, and if the bottom spectrum is equal to exactly one, so it's the maximal value, can you prove the manifold must split? And we can, and in fact, it splits with exactly what we would hope for with the exponential factor. And then this is Taurus. So, again, related to your question, right? So, I'm assuming this has no spherical classes, so I will not have products with spheres, because those would be the non-trivial elements of H2. But I can have products with Tora. I cannot have products with other things because then the scalar curvature lower bound is violated. So, to have scalar bounded by minus 6, this thing ends. Six, this thing n has to be of non-negative scalar curvature. So it could be either a sphere or a torus. And we are ruling out the sphere case by assuming this. You might wonder what happens if we don't assume this. We don't have a theorem yet, and we don't know what to expect. Because when you prove rigidity, you use this assumption somewhere, right? And then rigidity will improve. And then rigidity will imply that scalar curvature has to be a constant. But the scalar curvature is a constant exactly this case. So the other examples when you take spheres, this is still true. They have maximal bottom spectrum and scalar curtain is bounded by minus six from below, but it's not constant minus six. So we don't know how to do it, right? There's no idea how to prove such. There's no idea how to prove such a result because any rigidity theorem will imply scalar equals to exactly minus six. So it's a bit tricky. You will see that there's no cos H in this theorem either, right? Then I'll try to explain what's going on. So this is only case two, not case one. So case one was two infinite volume ends or more. We don't know how to do that either. So we're just like we have half Either. So we're just like we have half a theorem from D1. But to tell you why we can't is because this time, if you just work with scalar curvature, there's a whole class of examples that you can find in five minutes which satisfy the same lower bound as before and have maximal spectrum. So I don't, I think this is already a bit tricky to, it will take some time to prove a splitting theorem because you have new examples. So I suppose You have new examples. So, as opposed to rewang for Ricci, in that case, you only have one example cos h. So, a equals one. So then at least you know what you're going for, right? Your whatever harmonic function will detect that example. But here, because I have a just for this simple manifold, there might be other more complicated manifolds. Just for this one, there's a whole class of examples. Of examples, and some of them, only one of them is Einstein. So, only one a equals one has constant scalar curvature. Only one of them has constant scalar curvature. The others don't. So they're kind of different. So, I'm not saying that it's impossible to classify. I'm just saying that we got stuck in this, and this is the best we can do for now. We can do for now, and even that required some work that took some time. I'll explain for the rest of like two or three minutes that I have, I'll explain how scalar curtain appears in this business because it might be surprising that you can, and not just scalar curtains, but also the topological assumption. So you will take a harmonic function. This could be Function. This could be one of those harmonic functions that I defined earlier for ends, or just a Green's function if you don't have, if you only have one n and you're trying to prove the lambda one estimate, you don't have a globally defined harmonic function, maybe, but you still have the Green's function which has a pole, and we're employing that one. And you use the cutoff, you use the test function exactly like we did before, but not on the whole manifold, just like. But not on the whole manifold, just like sub-level sets of the harmonic function. So this t can be fixed, and this epsilon eventually will go to zero. And then Wagner formula. So I'm kind of following the previous slides, the previous procedure, just that at some point reach is not useful to us. So on each level set, so I'm working on the level sets of this harmonic functions. And on each such level sets, I'm using Gauss equation. such level sets I'm using Gauss equations. That's what makes it relate rigid to scalar. And of course you will immediately make the connection with what Sheniao did for minimal surfaces in 3D. And there's a whole business now started by Daniel Stern to use level sets of harmonic functions to prove theorems that like parses, mass pen roles and so on. And we And we realized that you can use the same kind of philosophy to prove this theorem. And also, in a separate project, we proved sharp volume estimates that address some conjecture of Kromov. So we made a connection with different things in 3D. So then plug in and you get the content. And you get the constant. But the constant, what happens is you have this Gauss curvature of the level set, the Gauss curvature of the level set, you can use the Gauss on a formula to relate it, to calculate this. So that's how it goes away. So in this formula, you just want to get rid of Ricci and everything else will follow the usual route that I mentioned earlier for League 1. But Ricci. But Ricci is replaced by scalar. Scalar, you have the lower bound. This guy is the Gauss curvature, which now you can use Gauss bonnet. But you need to know how many level sets do you have, how many connected components do you have, right? That's why we assume in one of the assumptions we said there are finitely many ends, so that you know there are finitely many components of the level set. So then that Then that is helpful for you. You can control this number here. In the other assumption, we said H2 doesn't contain any spheres, so that this guy doesn't have a positive contribution, right? If it's a sphere, it has a positive contribution, and there might be many of them. So then this constant, when epsilon gets smaller and smaller, this constant just blows up. So you don't want that. So either H2 doesn't contain any spheres, and then those levels set. And then those level sets cannot be spherical. Therefore, you can control the Euler characters, or you just say, well, finitely many ends, and then we can prove that there are finitely many components of the level set. That requires an argument, and in either case, it works. The main problem, and this appears also in other words that we have, is that Uh, that we have is that the level set may not be compact. So, you can, when you use the Glaus Bonnet, you have to be very careful. So, there are two ways to fix this. Stern and collaborators in their proof of the Pulsit mass theorem, they work with Glaus Bonnet for manifolds with boundary, but that's because they assume the manifold is very special. For us, we don't know how to do something like that, so we work with the cutoff. Work with the cutoff, which seems natural, but you lose harmonicity of the function, so you lose a lot of the properties that are nice, but you gain the fact that the level set is compact. So you can use Gauss for net, but you lose a lot of other things in between. So it's kind of a trade-off. So I'll be happy to explain more about this. I think I'm running out of time. Thank you. And again, great to talk. Again, great to be here.
