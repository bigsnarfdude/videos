So I guess we can start our afternoon session with Hari Kondori from McMaster University. It's titled Sun Slides. Thank you. So first I'd like to thank the organizers. And all the talks have been very accessible, especially the overview one. I'd like to thank the speakers for that. Making things very accessible. So what I'll be talking about today is the Quasi-Einstein About today is the quasi-Einstein equations, which I guess we've seen in one of the talks by Hermani, I guess on the Christian, and some more as well. So I'll just give a quick... Okay, let's not screw that up. Okay. Yes, good. Right, so I'll talk about, in this order, so I'll talk about neural issues and geometries. Now, James already discussed these at some left, so I'm going to agree with that very quickly. Because he didn't, well, I gave an overview, I wanted to talk about some explicit constructions. I want to talk about some explicit constructions and classifications. And the overall goal of my talk is then to understand, see if we can use some of these techniques to study things in the general case for general quantity metrics. So that's roughly the outline of my talk. So it'll be probably a little bit more explicit than many of the other talks here. So the nice thing here is, if you remember, my initial title for the talk was special solutions. The topic was special solutions. So, by special, I meant usually by assuming something like a symmetry, a common thing would be homogeneity. Here, we'll assume something like axisymmetry, so some kind of symmetry which allows you to integrate the equations explicitly and that enables you to get a classification. Now, once you get into certain complexity in higher dimensions, you may not be able to achieve a classification. You can still derive explicit examples. So, examples are kind of useless sometimes, but if they illustrate a specific point, If they illustrate a specific point, it can be useful, and especially coming from the relativity community, examples are useful because this is why people then go on to study deformations and what they'd call stability, so looking for solutions to imply, and so on. So if you, since black holes are of interest, maybe the theoretical physics community, I'd like them to read these papers. So if you write them in a sense, or it's just classifications and type 1, exceptional KC, part 2, they'll sound like. See part two, and they'll sound like a counting document and they may not read it. So having nice explicit examples that they can work with is very useful for them to test out the as a laboratory to test their theories out. Okay, right. So what I want to talk about first is just the quasi-ISAN case. So this is the equations you can see. So the three pieces of data are vector field, they're one form x, a metric g. Again, this m is a positive number. I understand that there are cases that is. I understand that there are cases of it, m negative could also be of interest. The case of m equals infinity, of course, is the Richie-Solton case that Wani talked about Monday. M equals one would be the static Einstein equations. If you go to one dimension higher, you solve Einstein's equations with one Killing vector field, that's sort of time-like or time-independent solution. You recover this on a spatial slices, up to some subtleties, which Eric can tell you about. Which Eric can tell you about. The MH2 case, James talked about. And finally, what is of interest is Ronnie told me just a few days ago, I guess it could memory, he said, look at page 267 of Bessie's. So I checked this out. Indeed, Bessie in his book gives you precisely these equations for worked product Eisenometrics. So you say you work product Eisenometrics and reduce, let's go to take a space N, and you reduce, as dimension M, say, that M is related. Dimension M say that M is related precisely to that because you're M. It's it. The precise factors, you know, I don't have to worry about that, but they do arise this way. And so if you remember James' thought, if you were looking at near-horizon geometries, you can think of the horizon as a co-dimension 2 kind of surface. So it's not surprising you get m equals 2. What is surprising is that these cases have x being a gradient, whereas in the horizon case, they don't actually be closed. Horizon case, they don't actually close leg on the 3. And indeed, the case, an example that Eric Bau, Eric Wolgar, and Sharmeller will be talking about next, we did some work together over the summer looking at what you might call a static Aussie Isom case where X is closed, although we don't have to assume it's a gradient. And indeed, one interesting thing that we did is we found an example which was closed but not exact. Well, I believe you've managed to misspell two of your volume. Oh, no, I misspelled Eric's name? Sorry, Eric. Misspelled Eric's name? Sorry, Eric. I got an excuse, but I can't see. I think I got Cheryl's name on the site. No, it doesn't matter. I just changed it before I can't believe it. I didn't sell it. That's the only way that I was. That's how I get out of it. Okay, good. So, having insulted them. I proceed. Right, so this slide I always give to people, you know, obviously, which are not relative to this audience. You're not relative to this in the Ramadian spectrum. But all that really matters is this quantum equation. So I'm interested in the space-time I said equations without any extra matter. So we simply have Ricci tensor of this bold face g equals lambda g. And lambda is just a constant and plus negative or zero. So this is like the higher Lorentzian space. So as James explained in his overview, the case we're interested in is the study of black. interested in is the study of black holes and this Lorentzian space time. So the state of the art in four dimensions, so that's n equals three, n is the spatial dimension. It'll get confusing as we go, is the following theorem, which is a realtor of many authors. And roughly it states that if you look at stationary and axisymmetric black hole solutions of the vacuum isine equations, their exterior region, so the outside of the black hole, is isometric to a certain solution found by Kerr in 1963, which has two fractions. In 1963, which has two parameters. This is what's called in the physics world the black hole no-hair theorem. It's no hair because you only need two parameters to specify a solution. For the curved solution, that would be its mass and roughly the angle of eta, m and j. So you only need two numbers to tell everything about a black hole, which is odd when you play it, considering all the ways it could have been formed. That information is lost. Now, if one would like to get rid of this. If one would like to get rid of the strange assumption of axisymmetry, you could assume analyticity, but that's also quite strong. There's many people, including Spiritus, Alexakis, Heinrich, Unescu, who are doing work in trying to drop analyticity and just use smoothness, because obviously analyticity is quite strong. The underlying fact that goes underneath these theorems is that the Einstein equations are integrable in the symmetry class, so it's actually a two-dimensional harmonic model. Dimensional harmonic map problem. Actually, it's better than a harmonic map. The target space is a symmetric space, so you have all these beautiful symmetries. That essentially is what underlies this theorem. So, right. So, the question I'm interested in, or I was interested in the years, is the higher-dimensional case, and you'd like to know what sort of geometries are allowed, what sort of topologies are allowed, and furthermore, what kind of parameters, characters, and parameters. Parameters characterize the solution. So you'd expect there'd be more. If you're in a higher dimension, you'd expect there's more directions to rotate, for example. So there's more angular momenta. That's obvious, but there's other things which could characterize the solution. Other length scales, for example. So these are the big questions. Now, the main theorem, based on a very nice variational argument by Shane and Galloway, and then as a follow-up paper, is to show that. Paper is to show that it is required, a necessary condition for multiple toggles of LB flat is for it to have Mazda Yamabe types. This generalizes Lysis Hawking's theorem, and this gives you these examples, three spheres, S1 times S2, quotients of three spheres, and connected sums, for example, in that case. So of course, these are just allowed. You'd like to know which ones actually exist as solutions, actually solving Einstein's equations. Solving Einstein's equations. And indeed, there are examples of these three kinds. There's a three-sphere example found by Myris and Perry, 1986. There's an example which sort of started researching interest in this field found by Abir Adron and Abby Rural. A black ring. So this is a horizon of S1 times S2 topology, but asymptotically it's flat. That's very interesting because you can see from the geometry, you start sort of like one boundary is S1 times S2, and then it turns into an S3. Turns into an S3. You can sort of see it explicitly by looking at the metric. And then there was an example found by George and myself a few years ago. We had a horizon which has the topology of a black one. L21. There's actually extensions of that by Tony Zala. Straightway. Oh, L21. This would be RP3. So it's a quotient of a three-squared by Z2. Yes. That's if I use. Use hopefully. It's not simply connected, but it is orientable. So we do have that example. Now, there are actually more abstract PD constructions and solutions using this harmonic map construction. This is due to people like Gilbert Weistein, Marcus Spiri, Superior Yamada. There's some work built on this, like myself, Marcus, or a PhD student at U.L.A. But these constructions are abstract, so unfortunately, you prove existence from these hormones. You know, you prove existence from these erratic map equations. They're variational, so you can prove existence of minimizers and uniqueness. However, the problem is there's some issues roughly to check regularity, you need to have an explicit, you need to have the functions to actually check that things degenerate smoothly. So you lose information about that. So although this is very nice, these abstract constructions, you you really would like the explicit metric to check smoothness. So you unfortunately you lose that information. You lose that information when you do these abstract methods. So it's nice to have an explicit metric, which obviously. Yeah, so this is kind of where James took off his talk. Let's recover this. In the case of extreme black holes, these are the ones which he's saying are degenerate. Roughly this means there's this quantity called the surface gravity he explained. This is uh a measure of the strength of gravity on the horizon. So on the earth it's like nine point eight meters per second squared. That's about as much physics as I know. As much physics as I know. So, something called acceleration, which is like meters per second spread off the Earth. So, if you set that to be zero, and you can, in some of these cases, you have a degenerate horizon. So, we have these coordinates R, which run off the horizon, V is a coordinate running parallel to it, and these X's are coordinates on the horizon. I'm sorry, someone I asked. So, I mean, is this, would it be extremal? So, I guess if it's if you have the symmetry of the surface gravity, maybe. If you have the symmetry, the surface gravity may be constant over the horizon, but if you don't have enough symmetry, you can surface gravity take different values of the width of the horizon. And so it's extremely soon as it hits zero at one point. Is that right? Okay, so here that's very nice. So if the black hole is stationary, you can prove that the surface gravity is actually a constant. So it's one of these, maybe some of you are these black hole thermodynamics rules. This is in a thermodynamic system, something in equilibrium will have constant temperature. So this is sort of a nice theorem you can throw at the black hole level. Theorem, you can prove with the black hole level that if you have a stationary black hole, the interpretation of this cap is like sort of a temperature and it's constant. So everything we do is constant. Now once that is dynamical black holes, then it can vary. There's average things you can define and so on. I only look at time-independent things. Never look at time-dependent things. So, well, that's not totally true. Fake it sometimes. So, yeah, so this is sort of the general. Yeah, so this is sort of the general metric that one can introduce near the neighborhood of that horizon. So essentially, if you replace all these quantities with their evaluations on the horizon that are equal to zero, let's say you get this near-horizon geometry metric, which James left off with and was talking about. And you see the data here are this vector field x, one form x, the metric on the horizon, which I'd use, g, so the capital G, and a function f. And the idea is if we can classify solutions to these equations, the Einstein equations for these space-times, then you can learn about what properties of the parent black hole without actually solving the full equation. So in a sense, you're just losing one dimension. You zoom in on the horizon, you don't worry about the asymptotics. That's an advantage. But the real advantage, which is of interest to us, because we don't care so much about that, is that it turns out the equations of the space-time then we'll put. Of the space-time, then will become totally intrinsic equations on that horizon h, which is what I call m or the quasi-Einstein space. And so, this they are quasi-Einstein equations of n equals 2. So it was actually Eric, who apparently from Marcus Curry, observed this. So, one day he said, you know, all you're doing is putting quasi-Einstein metrics of n equals 2. And so, our work, this work that James and I did, that he discussed, most of it was done some time ago, maybe more than five years ago. So, writing this talk. Years ago. So, writing this talk, I had to remember a lot of things which I haven't looked at in a long time. So, I'm assuming I'm no expert in the quasi-Einstein metric literature. So, is that all this positive or negative values of that of interest as well? Now, I believe the main interest is for M between zero and infinity. But I was like, Will, or I think Eric, you mentioned to me there are people who study. But so that's different. It is less work, right? It's less interesting. I see. Okay, I get but I'm not familiar with those uh negative six-pounded case keto already going. No. Oh. Okay, then interesting. Okay. Now, I should say that this equation for F, which showed up in that Horizon drug view, that's just an algebraic equation. So that's not, that doesn't tell you anything. So it really is just that. Telling you anything. So it really is just that quasi-Einstein there. One nice thing you can do is by integrating that equation over h, you find the integral of the Ricci's and the scalar curvature is positive. So in dimension two, of course, that telling you it's possible more than interesting. But in higher dimensions, it's also useful. And what is interesting, though, is I mentioned this Galloway Verizon result. A chain showed that you could use this intrinsic equation to also prove that it has to have polymorphic types. Prove that it has to have osiomatic type. So there's an independent proof of that. When you have extreme or degenerate horizons, just from that equation, you can recover the Galloway Shane result a little bit more in a simpler way. And this is work that I also did with my misspelled collaborator, who's Eric Eric and Shamila. We generalized that into the general M case as well using James's observation, which actually that itself is based on something by Rats, right? To James? Or that's spelling his name right? But that spelling isn't the same way. Alright, straight. What is f here? F is just a function which shows up, but it's irrelevant from the point of view of the intrinsic geometry of the horizon, but it shows up in the space-time metric. So it's almost like a warping factor, if I were thinking of this as work-Einstein metrics. But at the level of the horizon, we don't care what f is. So it really has something to do with the space-time. It's completely determined once I know the metric. Determined once I know the metric, once I know the behavior of x and g, I can work on what f is. In a sense, I only care about the horizon, I don't care what f is. It's actually the norm of the killing field as you approach the stationary killing field as you approach the horizon. Right, so uh yeah moving on, so I'm sorry to finish here. Right, so um what was I going to say here? Classifications of that equation are possible when you have symmetries. Equations are possible when you have symmetries. So, today I want to discuss one quite rather explicitly. James mentioned this before. In the case of lambda negative, m is equal to 2, an axis symmetry, you can prove the only possibility is a certain inhomogeneous metric on a 2-sphere, which turns out to be coming from an actual degenerate black hole found by curves. So it's a double-curved ADS solution. So we proved those unique ones in the symmetry class. Okay? Graxy symmetry. There's also a class. There's also classifications which are possible through three-dimensional m equals two quasi-Einstein metrics, and you get these possibilities here. Three spheres sometimes as two quotients like lens spaces. And these examples are actually realized by full black hole solutions. So everything we found, in a sense, they're actually realized by actual black holes. So it's not just things you could find, but there's no black holes that go with them, in a sense. Yeah, there's some work here when you have matter, but that's of less interest, of course, to this audience. You know, Maxwell feels and so on. So, what I want to discuss today, very quickly here in a few minutes, is how do you actually derive that? Like, how does that work? Because I'll go into the quasi-eystock case eventually. So, how does this actually work? That's a good question. So, I'll work in the two-dimensional case. So, we have our manifold. I'll call it H to focus on the fact where M equals 2. So, if we're looking at Two. So if we're looking at black hole horizons, we have a metric G and X. I assume we have some symmetries that generated by some Kelan field, it's called eta. So it generates V1 field, which leaves those things invariant. So it turns out that you can geometrically define a coordinate, which is sort of like what you might call an areal coordinate. So in this coordinate system, the determinant of the metric is one. So it gave me a nice picture of what a coarial coordinate looked like, but you can define it geometrically. It's just like you take the interior product. It's just like the, you take the interior product of the volume form with the generator of the U1 action, and it turns out that thing is closed. In fact, it's globally defined, so it defines a function that's a session of that coordinate. So now you can use a Large decomposition to split that vector field, or one form X, into a co-closed piece, or divergent piece, and an exact piece. And that's what this lambda is. And it turns out it's convenient to rewrite it slightly into the form down here. So you can just read. The form down here. So you can just redefine that exact function in terms of this guy which you can call it gamma. So that tells you what x has to look like up to some unknown functions. And you know what? G has to look like up to an unknown function b. So the idea is that it's a substitute looks into those equations, and then somehow, hope against hope, you can solve them. And amazingly, you can actually solve them. So I thought I would just run through it very quickly here. So that's, of course, the m equals 2 quasi-Einstein equation. If you use the Bianchi identity for... If you use the Bianchi identity for that two-dimensional equation, it turns out you get an equation that tells you the right-hand side of essentially the left-hand side is the exterior derivative of f. The right-hand side has to be exact. So that's identity. Given if you knew G and X, it's telling you that, yes, that's how it's related to this exterior derivative of F. If you don't know X and G, you can use it as a non-trivial fact. It's telling you that the right-hand side of that is exact. Because you know, it's closed. Because you're just closed. So you can use this fact in a nice way to actually find x and g. And that's essentially the way you can solve these equations. Not the way we originally did it, but there's a cleaner way of deriving these things. So this is a bit of a mess. I won't, I'm going to bore everyone that explicitly put elementary ODEs and put this into there and substitute the out. Simply say, if you look at various components of the Ricci equation and this equation two, And this equation 2, you can then integrate explicitly for gamma, and you can explicitly integrate for that function b. So you derive very nicely a very simple ODE for that function b, and it's first order. That's the beauty of it. So it's roughly not too hard to integrate that. And integrate for gamma as well. That's a nice feature. Integrate for gamma. So it's actually sort of a quadratic. There's one integration constant. So let's see, there's a piece squared. So once you know gamma, Squared. So once you know gamma, you can then go and integrate this equation here for this unknown function b. If you solve it, the nice thing is, you find that it's equal to a quartic divided by gamma. So it's an explicit quartic just depending on these other integration constants. You can just solve it exactly. And one nice thing about this quartic, it's not a general one, but there's no cubic term. Don't look at it that there's no cubic term. So you can analyze this quartic, specifically if lambda is negative. You see it's Is negative, you see it's an upward-facing quartic. If you want to have a two-sphere topology, which is the case you're interested in, x would be that thing here. So you see, once I know gamma, I know that bit. So what's the point at x? Oh, the point at x would be defined to be right, okay, I'll just point that thing. So it's, if you take the volume form, then if you, in general, so. And if you take the interior derivative, basically take the volume form and give it the killing that Trifields generates a thing. That defines a one form. You can prove it's closed. And furthermore, because it turns out you're working on a closed interval, it's simply connected. So that defines a function, x. So x, you can basically define it geometrically. So you missed the column. Right, but it doesn't have a qubit term, but the chord is. But recording, sorry, can't you always eliminate the cubic recording by translating it? Yes, it's probably not a surprise. Yeah, I think you could. It's so-called reduced cubic equation, but you always. Yeah, it's probably not a surprise, actually. I mean, somehow I remember from the general formula the solving where it's the right lucky process. Oh, no, you're definitely right about that, Jack. That's funny, it comes out that way naturally. It's not out of some. I think it's because you fix some interpolation constant in gamma first. Yeah, to make it even. First, you gotta make it even. Yeah, yeah, that's exactly right. So, this gamma is an even function. That actually, yes. Notice it's also positive. But okay, I should move otherwise. So the right, so you can integrate for this. I know it's ugly stuff, but we'll look at it. The one thing which is important is regularity. So essentially, whenever you have a killing field, as it degenerates, you can have partial singularities. So you have to look at Singularities. So you have to look at this ratio, essentially the radius of the circumference. So that ratio has to equal to one. Two pi times the radius of the circumference. That's to equal to one as I look at the degeneration sets of this killing field. Roughly the poles of the two spheres. Sorry, if you want it to be smooth. Yes. And I want them to be smooth. And so it turns out once you do this, this implies other conditions and constraints. Other conditions and constraints. And using those, you can then show that precisely leads to this extreme curve solution. So that's essentially how you go and solve things explicitly in this case. There's a similar construction in odd dimensions. You'll see the real trick. The reason why this works is that we assume axisymmetry, so the problem is one-dimensional. All these, this horizon is congenity one. It just depends on one function. So James and I looked at the case in one higher dimension and solved that. One higher dimension and solve that when lambda is equal to zero. But there's a very nice work by Ishi Vashi. Oh, actually, before I do that, actually, to talk about, I know someone asked me, what does it look like? Well, that's what the metric looks like. There's nothing weird with it, it's just rational functions in the square root of x, which you can think of at cos theta, where theta is a polar angle. So just a squash two-sphere, and that's the vector field x, the 1, 4x. So it's actually very simple. The scalar curvature, just out of interest, it's integral. Taylor curvature just out of interest. Its integral is positive, but it's actually negative in places. So, this, you can't embed this into R3. Interesting enough, this is somewhere. You mentioned Gibbons work on this throw-off. Sounds very expensive. Good, so what I want to mention was work by Ishi Vashi and Hollands. I hear Ishivashi and Stefan Hollands because of lifestyle. What they did is they sort of generalized their work in a very elegant and beautiful way. In a very elegant and beautiful way. So, what they do is let's just consider horizons which have enough torus symmetries, enough U1 symmetries, so that the metric would be RJ1. So, essentially, they just... In this case, you can study the orbit spaces that you left over, and those correspond to those following possibilities. In a sense, this is too much abelian symmetry to have an asymptotically black hole, but it's still very interesting as a case you can solve exactly which are it. This only works when. This only works when lambda is equal to zero. So the space-time vacuum equations are just reaching equals zero. This does not work if you have a lambda. Lambda is zero, you could just solve this explicitly. And the key fact underlying this is that the Einstein equations, as I mentioned, form a harmonic map. In fact, a harmonic map has a target, which is the symmetric space here. So in the two-dimensional case, it's just hyperbolic space, with the Eisen metric, the Eisenetric. In general, this space has negative curvature. This space has negative curvature, so it has all these beautiful properties. The metrics you get are these hard maps. So, using this, you can actually just integrate everything exactly. And it's a very nice paper. I don't want to go through it in too much detail. Just roughly say, there's data you can define. Once you have these generators, you can define a matrix of the killing inner product. That's this FIJ. Just take the metrics, compete it with the killing fields, define a matrix. You can define functions to what are called twist potentials. These are sort of measuring. These are sort of measuring the failure of these generative killing fields to be hypersurface orthogonal. These are called twist potentials in the relativist language. So you can define these functions and you can define this matrix and then using this you can construct what's called cosine representative. It's a matrix phi. So some horrible matrix, which we can define. And then beautifully, the entire eyes equations decouple to a single ODE. Decouple to a single ODE for this matrix phi. And you can disintegrate this very easily. Oh, easily something. After some linear algebra, which is hard to understand, if anyone asks you why is linear algebra important, read this paper by Hollis X Blashi, and you see why. Anyone asked him why is this important? Elementary linear algebra is really neat. And so you can integrate this explicitly and then do classification of the allowed sigma or regular solutions. What's really neat is. Regular solutions. What's really neat is the topologies are encoded in the behavior of f. So this function f, as I wrote down here, this matrix f, you can see it will be degenerate at the fixed points where some linear combination of the killing fields vanish. That encodes the topology, essentially. So if some linear combination of those killing fields vanish, then f will become rank one and has zero determinants. And if you study the kernel or the null space of that matrix F, you learn what the topology is. Of that matrix after you learn what the topology is. So that's that case. So now, okay, moving on to like 15 minutes. So I want to discuss some higher-dimensional generalizations of this, because this will lead on to the quasi-Einstein case. So one thing we were interested in is what are there possibilities you allow as you moment at higher dimensions? So I want to study an even-dimensional case. It's a classic construction by Berard Vergerie and also independently by Don Page and Christy Pope in the early 80s. Oh, the early 80s, where they they studied Einstein metrics, which are two-square bundles essentially over some Taylor Einstein space which has positive curvature. So that's just a classic construction, very famous paper. So James and I studied this problem, and there's a natural assumption of what the vector field actually looked like. So here we're not attempting a pure classification, we're just asking, can we find solutions in this class? Essentially, you can think of them as quadru-Einstein versions of these famous Einstein methods. Versions at least famous Einstein metrics found by Gerard and Margaret, which you can find in the Messi's textbook. Okay, so there's a nice instruction. Indeed, we found examples of solutions. Oh, I'm losing my voice now. Sounds super dare. So there's a neat example of solutions you can find, which are characterized by just two integers. So you have two at a two integer and one continuous parameter family. integer and one continuous parameter family of quasi-Einstein metrics is n equals two, which live essentially on two spherical bundles over Keyler-Einstein spaces. I just want to mention, they're actually infinite classes. You can get quite interesting things. And the one case which I think is really neat is for the four-dimensional case, the four-dimensional quasi-Eisene metrics, you can get two sphere, like S2 times S2 cases, and the other non-trivial bundle over S2, which is the famous C. Over S2, which is the famous CB2 bar connected sound with C2, CB2 bar. Also known as the first L Petzel surface. So it's the other, the non-trivial bundle of S2 of S2. So famously, Page found an inhomogeneous metric of that space using this construction. So we actually found examples for all M corresponding to each of these two different topologies. So for each different integer M, you actually get a different metric. But topologically, there's only two possibilities. And if you actually send And if you actually study higher dimensional cases, you get non-tradable finals of two spheres. So you actually get a countably infinitely, countably infinite set of different, for each choice of K, you sort of get a different topology for each choice of M. That's labeling, essentially M is like a U, the characterizing as a churn number on the U1 bundles of this Kayla-Einstein space. So like I gotta say, you get a lot of different topologies which are allowed by these equations. Allowed by these equations. And essentially, you could predict these from understanding how the Einstein constructions work for Einstein manifolds. This mirrors them very closely. In fact, in a sense, there's more freedom in the quasi-Einstein case, so it's not a surprise. And indeed, there's odd-dimensional versions of this. Some oracle details don't look. But if you go, if you study, instead of two-share bundles, you can study three-sphere bundles over Taylor Einstein spaces. And indeed, you can construct. And indeed, you can construct quasi-Einstein metrics in this class. And now they're characterized essentially, you have two U1s instead of a single U1. So you have torus bundles over this Kayla-Einstein space K. Those will have two churn numbers associated with each of those U1s. And then you can construct associated three-spher bundles that you have this torus bundle. So it's quite a complicated construction, but let me just say you can end up with these quasi-isometrics characterized by three integers. By three integers. And indeed, what they all talk about is that you can generalize these probably for general m, hopefully. Because we know how to do this, there's probably ways of doing this. I should also say what's interesting to me is that you can construct Einstein metrics as well. So no one had constructed Einstein metrics as far as we thought, except for, and apparently at the same time a student at Kenzie Wang's, John Chen, actually did this at the same time, James Light did this. It was around 2012. To this, it was around 2012. So, a good lesson is don't read literature and other subjects, and then you find out people have done the work. So, the worst thing I can do is talk to experts in this audience geometry. We probably have done many things I'm doing. We ought to be doing things I'm doing. So, close your ears. And we can live blissfully ignoring each other. Yeah. So, we used to have probably once said the only people that I read. Once said, the only people that I read that's written by anybody else's name of the times. Sorry, I don't know if this first hand was attributed to by a former master's student. Actually, that's pretty funny. That was quite mature of him to say that, actually. That's about as cynical as I expect someone, quite a senior person, too. Well, okay. Well, okay. So in any case, we can just show a quite complicated example. m equals 2 plus the Einstein cases. And you can even get Einstein metrics out of this, actually. It's kind of neat. All right, so where do I want to go with all this in my last 10 minutes or so? I wanted to discuss a case for general end. So this is just some stuff. I looked at this very briefly with Eric Eric. Do you remember that last year and I looked at this? I was looking for a certain type of solution. I was looking for a certain type of solutions that I was completely off with. And then I realized a little bit much later on, Thomas and James, that we could use some of these older constructions of near-horizon geometries in a nicer way of it, sort of see about. The interesting fact is when you work in the quasi-ISAC case for general M, there is no space-time, and so there is no function f, and there's no sense that it really comes from some higher-dimensional embedding to some space-time. So you're really out to lunch, so that construction doesn't work. So you have to work on the Don't work. So you have to work a little harder to work in sort of maybe an artificial way. You can define a function which is playing the role of f before, but now it depends on some weird parameter m. So this is essentially educated guesswork to understand what the function f you want to be so that the Bianchi identity will then give you an exact something which has to be exact. That's sort of going on it's an identity, but it takes you several pages to prove. It takes you several pages to prove, but the unconc identity for your metric g proves that this right-hand side is exact, which is going by logic. So sort of knowing where the factors of m have to go. This, you have to know for m equals 2, this reduces to what you'd expect for the space-time case, the Einstein equations. You have to understand that it's not a surprise that these things work for the Einstein, the space-time case, because secretly there's an underlying integrable system hiding behind that. So Einstein's equations are very nice. Seinze equations are very nice. The m equals 2, or the general m quasi Einstein equations, at least when x is not gradient, don't come from some beautiful thing. As far as I know, they don't have a nice origin. There's no reason why you should be able to integrate them in a nice way. It's not surprising that the m equals 2 case, at least for me, because I know where they come from. And I've been looking at these for many years. Good, so I thought this is just some stuff we did. Good, so I thought this is just some stuff we did recently, so I thought I'd just discuss this very quickly. Instruction. So how does it work? Well, I go through it again slowly. You can define this coordinate little x that I defined before, and it's essentially just so basically. The point is that you could take the volume form on your metric, you can just give it the generator of this killing field. So this defines a one form, and then you can clue, let me just. One form, and then you can prove, let me just call it, oh my god. It's a one form. And then you can prove this guy is closed. This is just identities which follow from the fact that this is a killer. So once you have this volume form, you treat it with this guy, you get the one form, you get this is closed. And then essentially, if you study the orbit spaces, the allowed possibilities of what this m is, so this is m function out by this u1 action, essentially it'll have to be a closed interval like this, or it has to be. This, or it has to be, well, essentially, it could be a periodic direction like the S1. So that would correspond to the full space. That means M is an S2 or T2. So I'm ignoring the Taurus case. We haven't ruled the Torah on how to complete. I'm just looking at the cases of two-sphere. So this possibly occurs if you have the function x is not, it wouldn't be globally defined because the parameterizes the circle. And assuming that it's not parameterized. And assuming that self-characterizing the circle, the orbit space isn't close to it. Otherwise, we're looking at a torus. So, in this case, if we're looking at two-spheres specifically, then again I have this nice decomposition of X into an exact piece and a co-closed piece. Because I know it's co-closed, that puts some s puts some restrictions put some restrictions on its form. It really tells you that it can only have a leg in the fly direction, which is the killing direction. Which is the killer function type. That really fixes the one-form field X very close to the end. Here, I bring down the metric. So, as before, it just comes down to: can I solve for this unknown function B? Can I solve for this unknown function gamma, which is essentially this exact piece? And can I solve for this unknown function, which I call k? And it turns out that if you, this function alpha, this constant alpha is chosen arbitrarily, it's up to us to choose it. If you choose it to be n over 2, To choose it. If you choose it to be n over 2, turns out if you practice the equations, you can prove that this unknown function is actually constant. So you designed it in such a way that it mirrors very closely the m equals 2 case that we understand quite well. But there's no loss in generality doing this. So if you run through the same rigamarole of pain, which is this completely elementary, so sorry, I wish there was some really cool stuff we're doing here, but this is just analyzing ODEs. Just analyzing ODE. So the first-year student could do this if they believed in it. You have to believe there's a sluice underline. So knowing that a word-string equals two, you sort of have some hope. Good. So you can solve for this gamma, but once again, it takes a very similar form. So here's the interesting bit when you study the quasi-Einstein case. So you can define an auxiliary function p in terms of b. Here's this function, this class. Here's this function. This constant kappa is just built out of the integration constants for you. So just treat it like a constant. You can even fix it to be one if you want. Yeah, there you go. So we have this arbitrary thing p. If you then substitute that into the equations, you find, remarkably, you got a first order ODE for this p, just like you do in the m equals 2 case. I don't want to write it down. Now the solutions, instead of being Now the solutions, instead of being quartics, i.e., polynomials, which is as nice as you get, now you get hypergeometrics, which depend on this quantity m. And m is not an integer here, just some positive real number. Basically, you get hypergeometrics, which is probably why I couldn't solve a year ago or something when I was looking for polynomials. They're infinite series, but they converge in hypergeometrics. So you can sort of have hybrid metrics with two pieces. So, how would I actually solve this thing? How do I solve this? Things. How do I solve this? Because I don't know anything about hypergeometrics essentially. I taught a course on hypergeometrics for many years, but I don't really deal with them and work very much. Essentially, when you deal with one of these things, you're looking for this function b of x. Let's say we're on some closed interval. So x maybe goes between here. And you want your function b in your metric to be such that it's positive in that. such that it's positive in that interval and you want your sort of b prime to be positive here because the function is increasing and down here it's decreasing so I don't want b prime of x2 to be negative down here so that's essentially the shape of b that you would like in the case of a quartic the m equals 2 sample I showed you before it's not too hard to analyze sort of see that if function b has the behavior you want you can always find necessary and sufficient conditions which Here it's a little bit trickier as the hypergeometrics and a little more difficult to deal with. But I should just say, this is just stuff we did very recently, I'll just say that in the lambda equals zero case, you can indeed show, essentially, because you don't have this term here. This lambda equals zero, that second hypertrophy equals there, so you just have one hypertree. A linear integration term. So it turns out that if lambda is equal to zero, you can prove indeed that b will. You can prove indeed that V will have the property that you want. So you can restrict the integration constants to construct Busy Isymetrics for general M, positive at least, on a two-script. So they completely exist. I know I realize many people here, Monty, of course, expert, study gradient solutions. So I'm not saying these parameters are not even closed, like alone gradient. These vector fuels X, there's no restriction on essentially, apart from the fact that it can solve. Essentially, apart from the fact that we can solve these equations, so it's not a huge surprise. There's one extra condition that you need, which is regularity. So, it turns out that to have a two-sphere without conical singularities, then I'll put some restrictions on the period of five. So, these conditions put additional restrictions on the values. If lambda is negative, you can also show, at least in certain conditions, that you do have solutions as well. The case for lambda positive, we don't have an analogy. For lambda positive, we don't have an analytical argument for that, a good argument. Just study things numerically by studying these hypergeometrics. Yes, there's evidence that if you choose the parameters just numerically, you can look at the hydrogeometric and say, oh, look, it has the properties that you want. We don't really have a nice explicit proof of that because I don't know how to deal with hypergeometrics. There's a whole classical literature of books we never look at in the nineteenth century, which probably has all the properties of hypograms. All the properties that they could get that we'd like to see, so we just have to look those up and find the things that we want. Okay, so thanks for your patience, and thank you very much.
