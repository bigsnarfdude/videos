Good afternoon. My name is Zhu Chili, a PhD student at Zhejiang University, and I'm going to talk about handling topological changes with high-order accuracy under the mass framework. This work is joined with Professor Qinghai Chang. This is the outline, and I will start with motivations and objectives, and then introduce the insights for modeling. The in-sets for modeling continua, the MARS framework, here Mars means mapping and adjusting regular semi-analytic sets, and then the algorithms for handling topological changes. Topological changes are key processes in multi-phase flows. Many phenomena in nature involves topological changes, like the breaking of the ocean waves, the breakup, and the merge of the drawls and the drawdrops. And the draw drops and the drop left hitting a water surface and forming a prong-like shape. Topological changes also occurs in many geometric PDAs. The left figures shows the evolution of the interface of mean curvature flows, and during which one connected component splits into two. And the right figures come from the works of Professor Bo and And it shows the structure-preserving panometric finite element method for control in surface diffusion. A popular interface checking method involves front-checking method, volume of length method, level depth method, and so on. A common idea of popular interface checking method is to avoid geometric modeling and topologic computing. And topology computing by converting topology and geometric problems to the numerical PDS, like in equation one. Here, U is given a priori and open C1, and F is the volume fraction in volume of flat, and the sine distance function is level set method. This method has achieved many success in past decades. However, with the research of the multi-phase flow. Of the multi-phase flows becomes increasingly complex, the limitations of this method are becoming more apparent. Firstly, the topological changes are not even alluded in the framework of traditional interface checking problems. The traditional interface checking problem, namely the interface, is involved point by point by the ODE whose right-hand side is commonly. Right-hand side comes from equation one, the U here. And the unique solution of the equation two implies an exact flow map phi, which is shown in equation three. And this flow map can be naturally defined in a general point site M because that U because that U is C1, the flow map phi must be a homomorphism. homomorphism always since homomorphism preserves the topological strategy the point set should should not should not undergo any topological changes second in traditional individual checking there are no precise definitions of continuum the points we have discussed which present the regions cannot capture the futures of the continuum Of the continuum. It may be an open set, it may be a closed set, or a set which is neither open nor closed, and the set may contain the isolated curve or isolated points, which do not appear in physically meaningful regions. As a result, the analysis of interface checking is difficult without a precise notion of continuum. This limitation indicates that we need a new theory. That we need a new theory to precisely model the continual and topological changes. Besides, current methods are at best first thought accurate in handling topological changes. Some methods like the classic wheel app methods. If once two connected components appear in one single control volume, they will be automatically. Volume they will be automatically merged into one connected component, even if they are disjoint. This treatment will occur as an error of order H power D for a single control volume during a single time step. By the sort stream, the number of time steps including the topological change is order one, and the number of merging control volumes per time step is order one over H power demand. 1 over H power demand as well. For multi-phase flows with frequent topological changes, the current interface checking method can only achieve first-order accuracy. The last motivation is that it is difficult to incorporate physics into numerical schemes. Some methods like classic VOF and LevelSet method do not have a special Methods do not have special algorithms for the merging or the merging and the operation of the interface is often considered as an advantage of this method. However, this automatic merging, this so-called automergic merging is more of a disadvantage when the process of topological changes depends on some physical factors like the material type, the web number, the surfactant, and so on. The surfactant, and so on. The numerical result only depends on the volume fractions and the velocity field. This automatic merging deprived the opportunity of modeling different physics with different algorithms. This limitation indicates that we need new algorithms for handling topological changes with both high-order accuracy and the physics incorporating. Different from that of the current interface checking method, our central principle is to tackle geometric and topological problems with tools in geometry and topology. We will model continuum by insights, equip the in-space with a Boolean algebra, we formulate the interpretation checking problem and deviate high-order algorithms. Well, first we introduce insight. First, we introduce insights as a tool modeling continuum. We recall some notation in general topology, like the complement, the closure, the regularized union. And we present the definition of regular open sets and regular closed sets. Notice that these sets, the regular sets, capture the silent future of the container such that any physically meaningful That any physically meaningful regions are free of low-dimensional features, such as the isolated points, isolated curves in two-dimensional, and the Dungling phases in three-dimensional. All regular open sets with corresponding operations form a Boolean algebra. However, the regular sets is not perfect for representing the physically meaningful regions. Physically meaningful regions. That's because some of them cannot be well represented by a finite number of simple structures. Let's consider the set AP and AS in equation 4. Both of them are regular sets, but their intersection is a disjoint union of an infinite number of regular sets. And this imposes a fundamental problem that the results of Boolean operations. Results of Boolean operations, the Boolean operations of regular sets cannot be well represented by computer by finite number of entities. And therefore, we need to find a subspace of a regular set such that each element of which can be finally describable, and this search finally returns to the semi-analytic set. A set is said to be. A set is said to be semi-analytic if there exists a finite number of adalic functions such that the set is in the universe of a finite Boolean algebra formed from the set in equation 5. And the regular closed semi-analytic set have been essential tools for solid modeling. However, requiring a semi-analytic set. Requiring a semi-analytic set be closed would make the boundary representation not be unique. On the other hand, for the regular open semi-analytic set, the boundary representation of the disjoint, of the pairwise almost disjoint Jordan curves is always unique, hence we only employ the regular open semi-analytic set. Based on above discussions, we present the definition of insight. Present the definition of insight and in space. An insight is a regular open semi-analytic set whose boundary is bounded, and the class of all such insights form the in-space Y. These two figures give examples of insights. Notice that the insight and a boundary of the insight should not necessarily be manifolds. The singular points like Q, Q1, and Q2 actually. The Q2 actually characterizes the topological changes. Next, we will talk about the boundary representation of insights to obtain the global topology. A Jordan curl. The Jordan curl theorem states that a Jordan curve divides the plane into three parts. Itself is interior and is exterior. A Jordan curve is said to be positively oriented if it is interior, namely the. If the interior, namely, the component that led to the left of the chosen is the bounded component. Otherwise, it is negatively oriented. And we have proven the theory on global topology of insights, such that each inset can be represented uniquely and effectively by the boundary Jordan curves. Each connected inset can be uniquely expressed as the intersection. Priced as the intersection of the interiors of a set of oriented geodetic curves that are pairwise almost distort, namely the intersection part of the equation 6 from the connected inset. And each inset can be uniquely expressed as the regularized union of the connected inset. That's the meaning of the equation 6. These two figures give the examples of boundary representation. Of boundary representation. It contains four connected insights with the last one represented by the intersection of the interior of one positively oriented Jordan curves, that is gamma 4, and three negatively oriented Jordan curves, that is gamma 5, gamma 6, and gamma 7. The unique boundary representation indicates that to check interface. Uh, to check interface that the checking the anterior flow phase can be simplified to checking its boundary. The topological space of in set are also equipped with the Boolean algebra, which is critical for the topological handling and coupling with PDE solver. The inserts form a Boolean algebra with all with regularized operations and Operations. And next, we consider the design of the Boolean algorithms. The curve of the Boolean algorithm is to identify a boundary representation space of the use space and try to establish the isomorphic mapping between them. According to the boundary representations theorem, the boundary representation space is the Jordan space, namely the class. Space, namely the class of precise-oriented boundary of insights. Since the in-space and the Jordan space are isomorphic, we can implement the Boolean algorithms of the in-space by using the algorithms defined on the Jordan space, which simplify the intersection problems of the two-dimensional insights to the interfraction problems of one-dimensional. Problems of one-dimensional curves. And we introduced the fundamental function pair, the cutting map and the pacing map, to help us with the designing of the Boolean algorithm. The cutting map is trivial. It casts oriented Jordan curves into the set of oriented curve segments. And its inverse pacing map connects each connected Jordan curves. Jordan curves connects each oriented Jordan curves until the chain frames a loop so that the positively counterclockwise angle is the smallest. And with the help of these fundamental functions, we can construct the isomorphic complementation operations, which is given by applying the cutting map, the flipping map. Cutting map, the flippy map R and the pasting map in sequence. Here, the flippy map R flips the orientation of the oriented curve segments. In other words, the complementation operations essentially flips the orientation of all boundary curves. These two figures give the numerical results of the complementation and in a panda as an inset. The next is the isomorphic meat operation, which is given by equation 10 and with composition of the cutting map, the selective map F and the pacing map. Here, the selective map F selects the oriented curves, which constitute the boundary of the intersection of the two insets. And the last, the isomorphic The isomorphic isomorphic joint operation on Jordan space is direct directly comes from the complementation operation and meet operation by equation 11. And these two figures give the numerical results of regularized union and the intersection of tender and mickey as two insets. Our algorithm is complete and simple. It handles all degenerate cases and the arbitrarily completed topology. Completed topology and only entails intersecting line segments and checking whether a point is inside a covilinear polygon. Next, we introduce three-dimensional insight, which where the key point is the same as the two-dimensional case, and we just list the main result here. This well-known theorem gives the classification of the orientable surface. An orientable compact surface is An oratable compact surface is homomorphic to the sphere of the torus or the connected sum of vanada of the torus. And similarly, we give the definition of the interior of an orientable surface. An orientable surface is said to be positively oriented if it is unit normal vector from the bounded component to the unbounded component. And the interior of an orientable surface is the component that is pointed by the inverse normal vector on the surface. By the inward normal vector of the boundary point. So, should we use the oriented surface as the basic unit of the three-dimensional boundary representation? Just as the oriented Jordan curves in two-dimensional, the answer is no. That's because, for example, the the left voice in the right figure is not a closed it's not a simple closed surface at all. A simple closed surface at all. The basic unit of the boundary representation should be glued-oriented surface or the G-surface, which is the gluing of an orientable surface as a lone subset homomorphic to a one-dimensional CW complex Q, such that R3 minus SQ has exactly two connected components. And the orientation and the interior of the G surface. Material of the G-surface is the same as that original orientable surface. Our global topology theorem states that the boundary of the three-dimensional insights is homomorphic to the gluing of a set of G-surface, which are pairwise almost disjoint. And based on this theorem, we proved the boundary representation theorem, such that any 3D material. Such that any three-dimensional inset can be represented uniquely by its boundary G-surface. The statement of the theorem is similar with the two-dimensional case with the only difference being the substitution with the oriented Jordan curves with the oriented gene surface. And it's also straightforward to identify the topological information with the numbers. Information with the numbers of positively and the negatively oriented G-surface in its representation. And we could also present the fundamental function P, the cutting map and the PC map, and use them to design the effective Boolean algorithm. The cutting map in the three-dimensional case cuts oriented G-surface into the oriented surface patches and the pasting map paste And the pasting map paste the oriented surface patching until the networks forms a closed surface. And here we just skip the details of Boolean algorithms and just show the numerical results. These figures give the results of regularized union and intersection. And these four figures give bullying operations of ambedillo and the rabbits. Of amydillo and a rabbit as two insects. Both of them have complex geometry, and our algorithms effectively produce the correct results. So far, we have introduced the insights as a tool for modeling continuum. And now we use the insights to reformulate the interface checking problem such that the topological changes. Such that the topological changes are incorporated into the framework. As we have discussed, the traditional interface checking the traditional interface checking implies a homomorphic flow map if the UX is C1. And this flow map can be naturally defined on the in-space Y. More generally, the involution. The involution of the interface may also depend on the geometry of the interface. Like the Gauvian equation can be augmented to the UXC kappa n and so on. Here, the n and kappa are respectively the unit normal vector and the curvature respectively. According to the global topology of the insights, this problem can still be defined on the insect. Can still be defined on the in space. And furthermore, to admit the topological changes, we assume U is piecewise episodes continuous with respect to the connected component of insights. About discussions indicates that the curve of the interface checking indeed is a continuous flow map which acts upon in space acts upon the in space. And this well point leads to the This will point leads to the general interface checking, which seeks the final position of the insight from its initial condition and the continuous flow map. From the perspective of the flow map acting on the insights, we propose Mars as a general interface checking method. A Mars method consists of three unitary operations at each time step, namely At each time step, namely the augmentation operations, a fully discrete mapping operation, and adjusting operations. All of them maps inset to inset. Here, the mass means mapping and adjusting regular semi-analytic sets. Based on the MARS framework, we propose the ARM strategy, namely the adding and removing markers. The strategy used the The strategy used the explicit representation of the interface. Well, the augmentation operations add markers at each time step to enforce the upper bound, and the adjustment operations remove the markers at each time step to enforce the lower bound, imposing a range or tiny HL on distance between adjacent markers. The objective of the The objective of the strategy is to maintain the regularity of the interface markers. And in three-dimensional case, in addition to assuring each A length is in the range R tiny HAL HAL, we should also guarantee that no angle is less than alpha. Here, HAL, alpha, and R tany are three user-defined parameters. To achieve this, we use Achieve this, we use a series of local measures like dividing long edge, removing short edge, and sweeping it just as shown in the figures here. Based on this algorithm, we design three order accuracy marks in three-dimensional interface checking. And here is the new here is the numerical test for the text of the Stanford Buddha. Of the Steinford Buddha, it can be observed that the complex geometry future as well as the topological structure are well preserved under the homomorphic flow map. So far, we have designed high-order mass method preserving topological structures both in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases to obtain a high-order mass method which can handle topological changes. What we need is a What we need is an algorithm capturing topological changes with high order accuracy. Next, we talk about the problem of capturing or pinpointing the topological changes. At these figures, the two spheres gradually approach to each other and finally collide at the purple point. In that instance, the topological changes of the material regions. Of the material regions occurs with the two connected components touching each other. And our objective is to pinpoint the position and the instant of topological changes with high order accuracy. Here, HL is the spatial size and K is the time step. We use standard algebraic topology to characterize the topological changes. Topological changes. And here we present the algorithm of pinpointing topological changes. In figure A. At each time step, we apply mass method to involve all the insights and check for the critical control volumes. Here, the critical control volumes refer to the control volume with more than one connected component of insight boundary, just like the marked control volumes in Figure B. The control volumes in figure B. Once the critical control volumes are formed, at each time step, we update the critical control volumes and check if the interface within it intersects. The objective of the critical control volume is to approximately locate where the topological changes might occur with avoid and conquer strategy. And in figure C, if the interface has intersected at a certain time step, we can determine the time interval during which the topological change occurs. And at last, we use the explicit representation of the interface to locally solve a non-linear system by integration, pinpointing the position and the instant of the topological change. At this point, we can adjust. At this point, we can adjust the flow map to incorporate the physical vectors. And next, we talk about error analysis. For Mars method, it can be used to analyze error of topological changes and a wide range of explicit interface checking methods. We can prove the We can prove the theorem that the total interface checking error is bounded by a sum of individual errors concerning with the boundary representing and constituting operations. And the definition of these individual errors are listed here. The representation errors is the final interface checking errors. I was by causing by appreciating the initial regions at the initial time and the augmentation error, the mapping error, and the adjustment error are the accumulated errors of the augmentation position opposition, the fully discrete vaccine operation and adjustment operation respectively. Respectively. Based on the error analysis of mass, we can present this theorem about the error analysis for topological change captured in two-dimensional case. If certain conditions are satisfied, the location and the instant of the topological change are determined to third-order accuracy both in space and time. In the case of K equals order H L. Here K the time step and HL the spatial size. Time step and each other the spatial size. At last, we present some numerical results. We start with a simple test with the two initial curves as two circles and the velocity field of texture shear and translation, respectively. After topological changes at time t star, the evolution. Evolution continues with the velocity shear, velocity field, which is specified by the user. And the figures show the results. And the errors on the convergence rates are shown in the table here. It can be observed that the error results can indeed achieve the third-order accuracy, both in space and time. All the accuracy both in space and time. Next, we solve the image segmentation problem by considering geodesic active counter model in equation 17 as a general interface checking problem. Here, the flow map is designed such that the initially randomly partitioned terms are motivated. Are motivated to the two concentrated circles completing the segment of the image. And this work is joined with Professor Du Wang. The figures here illustrate a test involving two types of topological changes, the merging in the figure D and the separation in figure G. It can be observed that It can be observed that our algorithms handle topological changes effectively during the image segmentation process. And for this test, the initial curve is a rectangle, and the flow max comes from the surface diffusion equation in equation 18. After a series of topological changes, the regions finally evolve into four parts, four circles. Circles and Professor Bo Jiang and Dr. Li did an excellent job in solving surface diffusion equation and part of our program courtesy of them. The error results with respect to the first topological changes occurring in the negatively half plan is shown here. It can be observed that our results can achieve secondary. Our result can achieve second-order accuracy. That's because the employed surface diffusion solar is second-order accurate. At last, we briefly present some numerical tests in three-dimensional case. The first is four initial spheres with the velocity field vertex and the translation. And the second is two initial spheres with the velocity field deformation and the translation. Both of them have. Both of them have the topological changes in the last figure, and the specific algorithms for handling topological changes in three-dimensional is a work still in progress. Well, that's a summary. We have developed for insights the unique boundary representation and the efficient Boolean operations and the high-order algorithm for handling topological changes. In future research, we In future research, we will develop high-order mass method in three-dimensional case and try to couple PDE solver, like the G-Pop, to mass and handle moving boundary problems. That's all my representation. Thanks for your attention.
