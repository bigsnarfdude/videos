So the last talk of this workshop is by Kimbo on the other verbatim. First of all, I would like to thank the organizer for organizing the conference. And for me, many new friends and a lot of new mathematics. Okay, so. Yeah. So this is the John. So this is John work with Dan Barbish, Jiang Yunga, and Jim Yong Sen on the solution of asset barbish work and content for real-time groups. Some of you may notice that, you know, in my name, so this is my academic name, and without Name and without a G, and you know, in my official name is a G due to certain mistakes happened exactly 40 years ago. I sort of carrying this background. Start with some background about representation theory or real reductive groups, and then I'll introduce to you that sort of this particular class of representation that was singled out by Arcelor and Bob Schwogen in the 1980s. So the main thing is we are going to give a classification of all those representations. And as a result of the classification, we are going to show. The classification: we are going to show that all such locations are unitary. This is the main scene, and then I'm going to sort of tell you the basic approach of a solution, which consists of three parts. First of all, is to count irreducible representations. So, and the framework is the theory of coherent families. And the second one is after we count how many representations we are supposed to have. Many representations we are supposed to have, and then we try to construct all of them. Okay, and the construction is through the theory of theta correspondence. So this is the later, we have been after you have construct the representation and you need to make sure that you have construct, the representation you have to construct are really different in order for you to show the exhaust shape. So this is So this is the basic approach is you try to distinguish representation we construct by certain invariant and this is where theory of social cycle come in. And later on I'm going to just tell you that what is sort of the final statement or the sort of this so please just feel free to stop me. All right. Okay, so we have a real deductive lead glue. We have a real deductive Lie group, for example, you have general linear group, orthogonal group, and syncretic group. And there are two types of objects that we study in representation theory for real reductive group. You have a fundamental algebraic object. These are admissible GK module finite lens. These are algebraic objects, Helsand module. And the basic analytical object in the theory are That in the theory are what is called now called the customer wallet representation. So these are the canonical globalizations of Herr Shandu margin by a very well-known result, a Casimon wallet. And these two sort of categories are equivalent to each other. So it's the same thing you can study there. Okay. All right. So, you know, in representation theory, real deductive rule, there are two basic. There are two basic invariant that you can attach to irreducible representation. So the first one is infinitesimal character. And a version of Schur's lemma said that any irreducible representation has an infinitesimal character. So by very early theorem I have changed, an infinitesimal character is represented by an element in a linear dual of sub energy. So this is Sub-arguments. Okay, so this is the first basic invariant in representation theory. And the second basic invariant is the complex association variety. So what you do is, if you have a GK module, or you take annihilator of this, and then you take a graded ideal corresponding to this annihilator ideal, and you look for the variety of zeros of this graded ideal. So this is usually called complex. called the complex social variety. Okay, now because the representation we study are finite lens, you can see that the complex of social variety is contained in the null cone of G-star. Okay, so these are the basic two fundamental invariant and you can have more refined invariant and so in particular to refine the complex social variety. So you have a social variety Variety: so you have a social variety and more sort of social cycles, which were defined by David Wogan in 1989. I remember that in 1989, this is the place that I knew Toshi and Ochai Sen, some other people. Okay, so you also have this sort of more refined analytic invariant defined by. Analytic invariant defined by Roger Howe and Barbish Vogen is called a wavefront set or asymptotic support, both in the 1980s. Okay, so these are the fundamental invariant. All right, and so with respect to these two fundamental invariants, we have two fundamental results in representation theory. And the first one is due to Heritage Chandra. If you fix any infinitesimal character, the set of Infinitesimal character, the set of irreducible representation with infinitesimal, this given infinitesimal character is finite. The second theorem is due to Bolobrudinski and Joseph. And if you start with an irreducible module, and the complex social variety is the closure of one single new potential. So, this is the complex argument. Okay, so with these two. Okay, so with these two, let me see. Okay, so now I want to tell you exactly what are the special unipotent representations that we'll be looking at. So these are, so these concepts were originated in the 1980s. So I'm going to give you the definition slightly later on, but let me just describe it to. Just so describe to you what is the problem that we are looking at. We would like to determine all special unipotent representations. I will give you the definition later in the next slides and show in particular that all such representation are unitary. Okay, so the unitary assertion is what is called the Arthur-Barbish-Wogan conjecture, and it was motivated by Arthur's conjecture on L2 automorphic forms in the 1930s 1980s. The 1980s. Okay, so we solved this classification problem. In other words, we are going to construct all such representations for all real classical groups by three steps. First of all, try to know how many counting. Secondly, for each of the counting, we construct one representation at a time. And thirdly, to show that every representation we have constructed are really, really different. Structure are really really different. Therefore, we have an exhaustion of classification problem as a consequence of classification problem because we know enough about the construction, therefore we deduce unitarity as a direct consequence. Okay, so let me just first state sort of the status of the answer of this conjecture. In the case of complex classical groups, In the case of complex classical GU, it was due to barbish as part of the classification for unitary dual of complex classical GU. So that for real classical GU, including the real mathematical GU and the spin GU, etc. Later on, I'll give you the precise statement. And this is our work. And in the case of quadratic real classical group, it is independent due to Adams, Aranshiba, and Method. Adams are Shiba and Mezo, and their perspective is the perspective of endoscopic classification of others and the scopic classification. So they basically show that what is now called the ABV packet is the same as the other packet and representation in other packets are automatically unitary. So this is their kind of approach. So this is for real classical quality space real classical group. Real classical goo, and for exceptional goo is due to Adams, Van Luvang, and Miele of Vulgan. And so, essentially, using the Atlas sort of algorithm to handle this problem. This is the status of this. So, I guess, you know, Arthur Barbishvogan conjecture is now sort of completely done. All right. All right. Okay, so now it's time to tell you exactly what is this. So you take Lennon's dual, you take an important orbit in the Lie algebra of Lehnand's dual. It's called O of chat, and then one can attach an infinitesimal character. So the way you do it is, you know, according to You know, according to Jacob and Molotov, every new potential orbit can be embedded into an SL2 triple. So, you take a new sort of neutral element of this SL2 triple and you take half of it, the neutral element, and that will give you an element inside actual star. So, you take this, and this is exactly the infinitesimal character. So, you can say this is the oscillator's infinitesimal character. For each new potential orbit, Each new potential orbit in the dual length, you can naturally attach an infinitesimal character. Then, by a theorem of Duflow, there exists a unique maximal ideal of UOG with this infinitesimal character. So among all the sort of the primitive ideals with the same infinitesimal given this infinitesimal character, you can find the maximum one. Can find the maximum one. So, this is the maximum perimeter ideal. And the associated variety of maximum permitted ideal is the closure of new potential orbit in G of star. Okay, so this O here is usually called the Barbish Volking dual of O ch. So, O is sort of, and you put an R in the Lie algebra, it's due. The O chat is an important orbit in its Leonard steel. So this is called a Barbish volume. And it turned out that this O is special in the sense of loose state. Now it comes to the definition of this special in a proton reference. So this is in a famous paper of Bar Schwogen about in 1985. In 1985, we call an irreducible Casimir water representation is said to be special unipotent attached to this particular new potential orbit in the Lehman steel, special unit attached to this, if this representation is annihilated by this maximal primitive ideal attached to object. So it's uh very, you know, it's a one line kind of statement. It's a one-line kind of statement. So, for each new potential orbit in the Lennon steel, you attach and you can decimal character. And then you look for the maximum perimeter ideal. And, you know, and you want to know what are the representations which are annihilated by this maximal perimeter ideal. So, in a way, because the ideal, the primitive ideal is sort of the maximal, in a way, the representation sort of is smallest in some sense. Smallest in some sense. Small sets. Now you could sort of give this definition in slightly sort of more concrete kind of term, which is first of all, the representation has infinitesimal character. It's given infinitesimal character. Secondly, the complex associate variety is contained in the closure of Abishmogen tube. The two conditions, if you want to, you know. If we want to, you know, without using this language of primitive idea, et cetera, it has infinitesimal character, and a social compressor social variety is contained in this Barbish-Wogan dual of OCA. So now let's give a notation. So this is special, the unipotent representation of G attached to O chat. This is a set of equivalent class of irreducible cosmologic representation. It is specially attached to O chat. Especially attached to OCHA. And nowadays, it is also known as weak ABB pack. So attached to this. But I mean, we don't need to know anything about ABB. It's just that this very simple definition. It is a given infinitesimal character and the complex associated variety, and all of it are attached to an element inside Newport orbit in. Is Newport on orbit in the laminar steel, let's say. So the conjecture is all such representation. Maybe I'll stop for just for half a minute to see whether you have any questions. Yeah. Is it possible that the associated variety will be smaller than the closure? Smaller than the closure, uh, no, it cannot be, it has to be equal, yeah. This is subtle, you know, it's a it's uh, the condition is less than equal to, but they actually have to, yeah. All right, uh, okay, so uh let's uh okay, so I'm going to now I'm going to tell you uh our approach to this particular problem, which is to to problem, which is to classify all such representation, all such representation. So the first part of the approach is we want to, because you already have infinitesimal character and there's finite number of such representation and we want to count the set. So a general, the more general counting problem is you take an edge stable Zariski curl stance of the null core. Of the null cone. And you look at all irreducible representations with the infinitesimal character and whose complex associated variety is contained in S. And a general kind of counting problem is this particular set. How many irreducible representations are there with a given infinitesimal character, which with a bound hold and a complex associated? One slide. One glass so uh here the main tool this is uh coherent uh continuation so so the basic idea is any any irreducible representation can be placed inside a coherent family of virtual representation i'll give the sort of the precise definition a little bit later and so so each irreducible representation you place it inside sort of a family coherent family of representation and you put all these coherent families And you put all these coherent family representations together, together all coherent family, it turns out it forms a finite dimensional representation of the integral variable. So this is called a coherent continuation representation. So sort of the coherent family of the representations sort of indicate is more symmetry. It has a representation or integral by Representation or integral variable, and you can study this structure of this coherent continuation representation by Karstanglistic theory. So, I mean, Karstangli is a broad terminology that in particular involves sort of theory of primitive ideals, theory of left cell, a double cell, and special representation, etc. So much as this implemented this type of ideas. Implemented these types of ideas in a paper in G Suite journal. In which so I think that's a paper in J Sup? Yeah, that's published in 2 o'clock now. So are these the same ideas or some ideas were missing from there? I guess broadly, broadly. So of course these work was sort of studied in the 1980s and published with responsible for some of the very, very early works. Some of the very, very early works, and so we together with yeah, yeah, that's right, that's right. But our construction of representation is something completely different through the theory of child space. Yeah, yeah, right, yeah, very good. Thank you. Yeah, okay, so this is a notion. So I'll just explain the sort of the key concept over here. This is coherent continuous representation. The concept was due to Jansen and Schmidt, Zuckerman, Spearwogen. So you take the growth and category of a customer wallet representation or Hero Shanjo module. It's the same thing. So this is sort of those with the given infinitesimal character. So for each new here, you take the translate of a weight lattice. So this is a total. Lattice. So, this is a coset of the weight lattice. So, and the Kg value cohedo family on this translate our weight lattice is a map from this translate our weight lattice to KLG. So it may not be irreducible representation, it could be sort of, you know, in a glow-centric group of representations such that for each parameter, you get a representation. You get a representation with infinitesimal character μ. And this family behaves well with respect to the tensoring with any finite dimensional representation. So you take, psi or mu, tensor with phi, f is given by sum of phi or mu plus, you know, nu plus mu when nu runs over the set of all weights of this finite dimensional representation. Finite dimensional representation. This is coherence. So those coherence really mean coherence with respect to tensor product of with finite dimensional representations. Okay, so now with this notion, we can state sort of our main result for this counting thing here. So I want to count irreducible representation. irreducible representation with the infinitesimal character mu and whose complex association is contained inside S. And so first of all, we have the inequality. Such represents the number of such representation the most by a certain summation. So what is a summation? And it's some over a certain subset of irreducible representation of integral variable, which has and so the subset. Has and sort of the subscript s here. Remember, s is a closed set in the new potential form of g star. So this particular subset is defined, I won't give you the definition, is defined through the string correspondence. So this is then a particular subset of irreducible representation of integral by sum over this, and you take sort of co-invariant space. This co-invariant space, so you take for this infinitesimal parallel, you take the stabilizer of this, you take the triple representation. So, this is the space, so co-invariant of this stabilizer group, and multiply by the multiplicity of this irreducible representation or integral whereby group inside this coherent space of coherent family of representations. Okay, so this is the first kind of result. The second result is: so, okay, so this is sort of a refined version, or I should say, it's a specific version for the space of, so the all special unipotential representation. Remember that both the infinitesimal character and complex social variety are defined in terms of this dual Newport object. Putting up. Okay. So this cardinality is the set is at most, so this is sort of a more simpler hyperscale, it's just this multiplicity of certain irreducible representation or integral variable, which are said to be in something called a root state left cell attached to this particular infinitesimal cap. So I won't go into that sort of precise definition, but Sort of precise definition, but the message is we have a nice upper bound for this set. In the case of special unipotential representation, we have a nice upper bound, which is sort of very, very expressive. Left close to the left side. Okay, so now when you're in the inequality, you want to go when is the equality? So the equality is very difficult. So we're gonna inequality, so here is. equality so so here is the claim is the equality hold if certain hypothesis on the heresy cells of g some hypothesis which i'm hiding holds true okay if if you know there's some hypothesis about her shander cells of g so this is a sort of heritage so this is a question about her shander cell and the double cell etc okay and Etc. And so, in order to show this, you have to use some theory of tau, invariant, and vaulting duality, etc. And for us, what's important is this hypothesis is true or classical. And which would be the first non-classical case where you fail? No, that is expected to be true all the time. Like a Fujitu is obviously true, but I mean, what do you mean? What do you mean by the sophisticated special contributor? Okay, so there's a sort of you know there's a sort of basic um so this tau in variant is to so basically is to to tell sort of you know when you have large infinitesimal parameter when you go to the small infinitesimal when it's going to vanish etc. But that's that's the basic use of how this is but we need to develop something new for the tool for this taught and then if your previous formula they it contains a factor that is the A factor that is the multiplicity of the 3D of representation. So, in the previous formula, that's right. So, that one is to be able to get into this user's leader conscious content so you can get that factor, but that's why, yeah. Okay. So, this is this is, I mean, where does it come from? Can you give me an intuition? Is it to be able to have a normal value with certain. No, no, for example, let's take a new to be regular infinitesimal character. And then, of course, the stabilizer is the triple group. So it's a triple group. So there's nothing there. So essentially, as you know, that if you have a regular infinite tectonic character, there's a unique coherent family of representation continuing this. But in general, if the infinite But in general, if the size of the mechanical gets smaller, this is sort of the algebraic algebraic aspect of our approach. So the geometric part will come later. We do have a geometric part, but this is only the algebraic aspect. Yeah. So each term of right-hand side is non-negative. Yeah. I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So in Glutenic, we may have a bunch of representations, but still each time we do not negative. Okay, so now, so as I mentioned, the new quality are relatively easy to establish. So that sort of we just have to use. We just have to use some of the theories that developed by Barbish Wogen and Joseph Lutz essentially until the 1980s. One could establish inequality, but equality is more sophisticated. Now, I want to say that all the terms in this can be explicitly computed. So, this, for example, this is the structure of coherent continuation representation. Structure of coherent continuation representation is a representation of integral value rule. There was a result from Barbish Vogen, essentially using the Langland classification. And so this particular sort of this loose cell can be explicitly computed. And so this is branching rules. This is related to the theme of the workshop. The branching rules, you could actually, so now it's a possible. Because you could actually, so now it's of course branching loads or vibrou representation, finite groups. Okay, so basically, it's a, so the other thing that I want to emphasize is, you know, when you evaluate those things, and this branching rule are usually described by certain kind of commentatorics. Okay, so in extracting this sort of each of this here, it actually leads us to some kind of commentator. To some kind of commentator parameters for special unipotent representation. In other words, this thing here, the dimension of this thing here, will give the number. But actually, there's more structure inside this. We actually know what are the commentarial parameters which give rise to this particular context. Okay. All right, so now we have so that we have first finished the first time, we know how many representatives you got. We know how many representatives you have, and then the task is we want to construct for each parameter, commentator parameter, we manage to extract that we are supposed to construct one representation. And so the basic construction is set up response. I better have a clear idea, like how much time do I have? I mean, can we automate okay? So, ah, this is this here. Okay. Okay, so the basic constraint is hit a correspondence. So, you take the basic framework is, you know, you have a finite dimension, real syncretic, say, you have a pair of reductive groups. They are called reductive dual pairs. They are basically, they are mutual centralized of each other. So, this is the reductive dual pair. And they are, in fact, they are the reductive. There are in fact there are the reductive dual pairs, irreducible reductive dual pairs can be classified. There are sort of seven families. The first family is sort of general linear group type. The other is sort of the classical group. So the basic construction is this. This is an isometry of symmetric bilinear form. This is isometric group of skew symmetric bilinear form. You take the tensor product of symmetric bilinear form with skew symmetric bilinear form. You get a skew. symmetrical bilinear form, you get a skew symmetric binary form. And so this one is this isometric of the larger sympathetic space, the two isometric group form dual pair inside this. This is the basic construction. Okay, so then I think you take the so-called available or set to representation of this. So you have to take a cover of this. This was the representation construct, I guess, in the very very. I guess in the very, very early, maybe in the 1950 or 60 by Seago. So this is called the oscillatory representation. So you take the smooth version of this. So basically, you take the minimal representation of this larger group and you restrict to this, you know, the product of the two groups. And the important thing is you look at the quotient representations. So you take this. You define the following for each reductive subgroup that you take an inverse image of this, you consider irreducible representation of E of Telta, which are realizable as a quotient of the oscillator representation. So you consider, think of the oscillator representation as kind of sound, and you would like to look at the shadow of this particular sound. Okay, so this is the famous theorem of Hau, just called the Haudi War Day theorem. Divide the CRM for any reductive dual pair that so that you look for sort of LED superrepresentation of one member dual pair, which are realizable as a function of the authentic representation. That's this. And similar, you look for the other one, and it turns out there's one, one correspondence. And the correspondence is defined by this particular condition. So this is the irreducible representation of this member. This is the irreducible. Of this member, this is the irreducible representation of this member. If the tensor product occurs as a portion of the oscillator representation, and then you say they are sort of they are related, you have a corresponding key statement is this is one one to one corresponding. It turned out that how do I also hold your periodic local field? So and an important question is. An important question in describing theta correspondence is in terms of the Leynas parameter. So there were many words, but still no full answer for this. And another important question in this subject is to understand how unitarity behave on the set of correspondence. And so this is some earlier work of Jian Shu Li, and we sort of refine it in the Kalan context. This is unitarity preservation. Now, okay, so I'm just going to use one slide. And I'm just going to use one slide to explain to you what are these constructions, what are the representations. So we are going to repeatedly apply theta rifting, starting with the triple representation of one member of the two pair. And so you take a triple representation of an orthogonal group, leave it to something predictable, and then for something predictable, you go to another orthogonal group, etc. Another orthogonal group set that you keep doing it. And when you reach orthogonal groups, possibly you need to tensor with a determinant representation of the orthogonal group. Okay. And the construction is completely guided by the certain index structure of this combinatorial parameter. In other words, we have this combinatorial parameter which sort of parameterize all these representatives you will find. From the parameter, we know. Parameter, we know how to sort of go down. So, you know, you get a parameter for a big group, and I know how to go down to the smaller group. And all the information is hidden inside the computer parameter. Sorry, I was thinking why we were speaking. So, what are you, so where are the organizational parameters coming from, from the county? From the French. From the branching rule of bio representations. Okay, so yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what kind of country. Yeah. Okay, so now I want to just give a few minutes to distinguish representative. And the mentor is a social cycle. This is defined by Vogon in 1989. So let me just, I'll quickly go through this. And so now, because our construction is through and it takes a Through and theta correspondence, right? Tether correspondence, and we want to distinguish some representations. So, clearly, you need to understand how the sort of social cycles behave under theta correspondence. And so, and this is some earlier work of Nishiyama, Ochai, Tanikuchi, and Yihube. The main thing is there are certain geometry or moment maps that you have to pay attention. Pay attention. Pay attention. Okay, so again, and you want to compute these sort of associated cycles in the same way, it's relatively easy to establish upper bound. And we show in the case we concern that, in fact, it's a size. It's but difficult to establish lower bound. Okay, we show that in fact, upper bound and lower bound are the same. So, okay, so maybe I need two or three more minutes. I need two or three more minutes just to wrap it up. Now, I would just want to sort of what is the general theorem that we prove. You take any connected reductive complex Library, you take any real form of this. So the Arthur-Barbish-Wogan conjecture, this can be defined as exactly the same way. And the claim is all representation are unitized. Unitarian. So it's clear this suffice to consider the case when GOC is simply connected. C is simply connected and when the Lie algebra G is simple. Okay, so this is that sort of key case. And okay, so type A. So the GOC could be SLNC or the product of this. And the real form can be SLNR, SUPQ, and SLN over 2Q, etc. So these are the real forms. And without a sort of a fairly easy kind of paper. a fairly easy kind of paper show that all special unipotent representation of for these group income wall are unitary. So in fact, you could write them down easily, basically based on Vaughan's idea of unitary. Okay, so I type V of D. So we first were looking at genuine representations, genuine representation. So the complex group is a simpler connect one with the spin group and the product of spin group. The spin group and the product of spin group, and then you have the real form, these are the possible real form. We load another paper, sort of which is moderately difficult, but not so difficult, and show that genuine special unipotent representation of all these groups are unitary. So, this is uh, I guess uh, this volume in honor of Toshi is coming out maybe next month. Okay, so okay, remarks. So, this is. Okay, remarks. So, this is a type B of G, but these are genuine representations. Genuine representations. And the most difficult one is when B and D, sort of classical or classical. In other words, exactly the circumstances where we have due pairs. So these are, you know, SOM, C, so that's that. SO, et cetera, all these things. And we do two papers. And we wrote two papers on the special unipotential real classical. The first one is sort of algebraic at SPAR, accounting and reduction. The second one is about construction and unitality, which I have explained in earlier sort of pages. And so here is the final result that we prove. Take G C be a connected reductive complex Library, G, any real form of Z. G, any real form of this. Assume that every single factor, simple factor of the Lie algebra G is of classical type. Just any. You take O chat to be a new potential G chat, R B in G, then all representation, special new potential representation, unitarians. So it turned out that the same result holds for the real mathematical group, in which case we have a notion of Case we have a notion of metabolic special. So the claim is, you know, there's an analog of special unipotent representation. In the case of real metabolic boo, they are also unitarized. Okay. So with that, I'll just end my talk. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. There has been some unitary representations which have been have been recently uh constructed by Lucas Mazu Pond there. And how do they fit in your scheme at all? Do they fit at all in this or? Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, I mean, I guess their point is they come up with some parameters which are not sort of special unipotent parameters. So, in other words, they come up with some the With some infinitesimal character, which does not necessarily come from OH. So they were able to sort of construct some sort of representations. I do not know whether they have sort of, because the thing is, this is it's not so easy to show sort of exhaustion. So you could define some, you know, some incident testimonial character and you can. Some infinitesimal character, and you can't you can certainly consider such representations. But the question is whether you can show these infinitesimal characters are really the right infinitesimal character. In other words, whether the representation, all representation with these maximal primitive ideas are indeed unitary. And the key thing is to show sort of exhaustion. And I think that there's more work to be done. That there's more work to be done. So, in all the cases, we can give implicitly the associated cycle. So, the cycle actually is recognizable from the communication with the help of paddle vibration geometry. Yeah. So, paddle geometry has like a communita. Any more questions? If not, that's the same speech again.
