And what we saw. So, if we start from the two-dimensional standard Brownian motion starting from zero, then we can define the so-called Leby area process by defining this solution of S D E, then equip the process as one of the components of this Markov process X T. Then Ito's formula gives the infinitesimal generator, which I will denote it by L. So L is exactly given by the one-half times X squared plus Y squared. And as a matter of fact, this gives. clear and as a matter of fact this can be seen as a usual Laplacian on R3 minus the Laplacian on R1 and where does this R1 come from well we have the map pi from H3 to R2 by assigning the XYZ to just XY then the one point inverse image I mean the fiber is nothing but R1 and the corresponding Laplacian is in the subtraction so in that sense there are many ways to call this L as a sub-Laplacian but this L corresponds to the This L corresponds to the Markov process that we consider, and this is the major object L that today I'd like to talk about. So, in fact, what we saw is not just a special case in the Heisenberg group, but also for the other situations. So, now let's consider the complex numbers. So, for a moment, so instead of the R4, but we can regard S3 as a subset in C2 with the known relation. So, we can define the similar vect as a Heisenberg group. Defined a similar map as a Heisenberg work case. So we can define the map from S3 to S2. So just assign C1, C2 to is so-called homogeneous coordinate. That means just the equivalence class of lambda C1 comma lambda C2 with our non-zero complex numbers. Then one can immediately see from this explicit map that one point inverse image, I mean, the fiber is S of minor manifold. This is nothing but S1. In other words, S1 is embedded in S3, so-called S. In S3, so-called S totally geodesic fiber. This means that our derivative of normal direction or the second fundamental form essentially vanishes. So, this has a many nice structure in algebraic topology, but I want to go that direction today. But from this fiber structure, one can also see that S1 is just a collection of E to the I theta, so that this has a Lie group structure, so that one can associate the Lie group action from S1 to S3 in this nice manner. So, from here, one can also define the infinitesimal direction. Also, define the infinitesimal direction of this data. So, this can be written also explicit from this Liebrove function. And once one takes the dual differential form, this is usually called by the standard contact form in three-dimensional sphere. So, also we have the similar interpretation as the Heisenberg case, so that we can also decompose the tangent bundle into the horizontal distribution with the vertical distribution. And the horizontal distribution is given by the corner of the standard context. Given by the corner of the standard contact form, so that the horizontal distribution with the bracket generating condition gives the full tangent bundle. And one can also compute the sub-Laplacian by using either the Ligur-Besson action or the standard contract form. There are two methods to get this L explicit. And L can be also regarded as the infinitesimal generator of the microprocess. And two components are nothing but the Brownian motion in S2, which is coming from the base space. And the area process. And the area process is studied by Simon and also Barbara Spodin. And the corresponding infinite general area is exactly nothing but the sublock plus n over here. And even though we are talking about the three-dimensional sphere, but this can be easily generalized to any 2n plus 1 dimension with the same fiber as well. So now let's just change the field from the complex numbers to the quaternion division algebra. So this H is as a vector space nothing but R4. So we can also define the subset which is. Also, define the subset which is seven-dimensional sphere inside of H2. Then we can just play around the same game. So define the same map from S7 to either S4 or this is usually carved by the quaternionic projective line by assigning the Q1, Q2 to the projective coordinate, then each fiber becomes isometric to, I mean, as a manifold as a SU2. And one can say that this also has the nice Lie group structure so that it can be associated to the Lie group action. So from the To the Lie group action. So, from this explicit Lie group action, one can also find the three different revector fields at this point, T1, T2, T3. So, that this generates the tangent boundary of SU2. Then one can also find the quaternion recontact form. So one can see that all those structures are quite similar to the complex hope vibration. So, as we expect, so we can also decompose the tangent bundle as a horizontal distribution with the vertical distribution. So, that horizontal distribution generates the whole tangent. Generates the whole tangent bundle with the bracket generating condition. So, as the same thing, the sub-Laplacian is the generator of the Brownian motion with the generalized area process, which is also stated by Z1 and Fabric Bowden around five years ago. And this L can be also computed by the either Lie group SU2 action or the quaternary contact form. And this R observation can be easily generalized to any 4M plus 3 dimension with the same SO2 fiber. Okay, so. Okay, so this is the whole preparation today I'd like to say. So before going further, there are two known facts that I should mention. So if we have a finite dimensional vector space equivalent to norm and multiplication, that multiplication is compatible with the norm structure, which is already given, then such a vector space must be isomorphic to either real numbers or complexes or quaternions or octonions. And there are some important results of Richard S. Cavalius. The Richard S. Coveless, which says that if we have a Riemannian submergent from the n-dimensional sphere to the base manifold, so this submargent means that the map is surjective and induced differential map is also surjective as well with the total egoistic fiber, which we saw all those cases. So there are only three possible cases. Either it should be the complex of vibration or it should be the quaternion of vibration. And there is one more case, which is we call the octonion of vibration. Octonian hook vibration. And this case is somehow special because this only holds for the 15-damager case. This is coming from the fact that octonions do not satisfy the associative law. So the 15-damager space can be only defined in terms of two elements. That's the whole reason. So in terms of the octonian Hoof vibration, so this is also quite similar if we define this 15-dimensional sphere as either subset in R16 or just a subset in O2 with the same norm relation. And O2 with the same norm relation. So we can associate with the similar type of dummap. So just assign x, y to the homogeneous coordinate, and its fiber now becomes just a seven dimensional sphere. So now there are a bunch of issues. So first of all, this seven dimensional sphere is not the topological group any longer. And there's also proof that there is no context structure comparable with this octonial Hoof vibration. So as long as we care about getting the explicit sub-Laplacian, and if you want to study, Plausion, and if you want to study the corresponding generalized area process, then the very first issue is how to obtain the sub-love Plausion because the previous tools are lost in this new case. So this is what I did with Professor Barber's audience. So the good news still we can use is that the 15-dimensional sphere is locally the product of the S8 or Octonian project line and the seven-dimensional sphere, and both of them are so called a And both of them are so-called the complex random quantum symmetric spaces. What does that mean is that the flat maximum sum manifold is just generated by the geodesic directions. So one can reduce all control to just the radial or geodesic distribut directions of both of them. So what we prove is that even though it might be difficult to determine the sublaplasm, but once we extract the radial part from this L, then this L tilde can be written in terms of L. Tilda can be written in terms of R and L are those two variables only, and this has this explicit form. And this, in fact, L tilde is sufficient to extract the information of a sub-elliptic hit corner. And from here, we deduce the explicit grain function and we computed the sub-Riemannian distance explicitly. And we extend this previous work to the case of the octonial anti-dister vibration. So this is very recently published. So, but there are several sort of differences over here. But there are several sort of differences over here because this space is non-compact. So, that when we deal with the sub-electric heat corner integral representation, it has a bunch of technicality issues, but I will not talk about it today. But those two work complete the study of the sub-laplaze and also said heat corners coming from the so-called H-type submergence, which is studied by Dr. John Marco, over Lancuan's metric spaces. So, here is just a basic strategy of the probe. Strategy of the proof. So, in order to extract the radial direction, so we just use the so-called cylindrical coordinate because we have a fiber structure. So, this cylindrical coordinate can be written explicit. Then from here, we can just extract the radial directions. Then one can just choosing the just patient functions to extract the L tilde instead of L. That's what we did. So, still, there is open question because we couldn't determine the L, but we just used the L. The L, but we just used the L tilde. So, still, the study of L is missing, and corresponding generalized area process must be obtained. So, this is still open. So, I'd like to work about it in the near future. So, thank you very much for your attention. Thank you. Is there any question for Ganheim? I have one. So you gave the explicit expression for the Laplacian on the Octoniana case. Can you say something about the procedure for finding this or is it just very highly technical? Or is there some intuition where this comes from? So as I said, the whole idea is written the 15 diameters, but actually this works for the complex and quaternary case in fact. So in terms of the local In fact, so in terms of the locally product with respect to this explicit coordinate, and from here one can extract the radial directions are so explicit, and from there one can just find a special function which depends on just the geodesic directions of each pieces. And then one can prove the LSD radial part of the sub-long positive. That's the whole idea. And does an analogous method work in the anti-desiter case? Yes, LSD, finding the Yes, at least the finding the radial part of the sub-block doesn't work in the same way. However, the space is not compact any longer. So, in terms of the representation of heat corner, there are several differences in subtlety. Thanks. Sure. We have more questions. If anyone has a question, I'll point out that I love your little diagrams. They're the little
