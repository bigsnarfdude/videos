There's not many examples. But Chigershi showed that in any space with a doubling measure and a Poincaré inequality, you do have these charts. And he initially showed that the dimension of these charts is bounded by some constant depending on the doubling and the Poincaré inequality. It's in his proof. We need both of these constants. I'll say something about that in a bit. And so you have these charts and they cover almost all of the space. And with this, And with this, I mean, this gives you literally a first-order Taylor expansion at almost every point in terms of these charts. And with that, for example, you can express the change of the function by integrating its differential. Of course, now there are charts, so you have to decompose here to think of charts. And here, just to simplify this expression, I'm assuming that the charts are pairwise disjoint, which can always be done by removing, by redefining the charts, for example. And, um, And one aspect also of this theory that we have is that you can define a norm. This norm now depends also on the point and the chart. So that this minimal d work upgrade is the norm of this df. Okay, I mean this norm doesn't have to come from an inner product, and this was mentioned in one of the earlier talks, so that doesn't necessarily mean that you say have a early microorganism operation for kinetic microscopes. But you still have the the quality of that. But you still have the quality of that almost everywhere. So, but no, this is very nice, but as we've seen also during this conference, there are many settings where you don't have a px space. You want to still understand maybe is there some modification of this structure in a more general setting? Can you understand what software functions do without a polymer problem? And there are two examples I'll mention. So one is the Rickman Rug. One is the Rickmann rug. So you have the even square with the Lebesgue measure, and you take the x distance, but then the y distance is snowflake. It's raised to power epsilon. And the other example is you take just usual Lebesgue measure and Euclidean distance, but then you just take a fat counter set times the interval and you restrict bound to this. Both of these spaces are doubling, but they don't sound. But they don't satisfy all for inequality. And in these cases, one cannot hope for a strong statement, such as here, because there are certain inaccessible directions. So in this case, there are no curves that go in the y direction, because it's totally disconnected in the y direction. Here, you are connected in the y direction, but you only have curves of infinite length in the y direction. And then there are, of course, And then there are, of course, a host of other examples like Seerfinski carpets, where you still have lots of curves, but they're not still very poignant. So we wanted to have some kind of differential structure. Here you can define a non-degenerate solvent space. So not a solvoid space that is not equal to LP. In some cases, when you have absolutely no curves, or curved fragments like zero modulus, these spaces are equal, but then these settings are not. And you might want to Or not. And you might want to still analyze this hole space and ask whether you could define this differential in a natural way at those segments. So, what would be natural? Well, as I said, you cannot expect that you see all directions. Like, this definition, this is really seeing every direction in a uniform way. But perhaps we can see partial directions, some partial differential structure, that we will see only the accessible directions, like the x. Like the x. So, if one thought for a while and thought of all the things that we've also heard this week, then the extremely natural definition suggests itself. What if we don't look at all pairs x and y, but we only look along curves? And we've heard that there are always exceptional curves, so only d almost every curve, modulus d almost every curve. What if we ask, say that the chart is the same thing as before? That the chart is the same thing as before, a measurable set U in a Lipschitz function on the entire space, so that there exists a unique differential. The uniqueness is necessary for this, that the change in the function along almost every curve is a differential of the charp plus the low of the distance. Now, there's some annoyances here that are also in the previous edition. Of course, the curve gamma might not. The curve gamma might not, these charts, the sets u might be, say, backhander sets are totally disconnected. So the curves might go in and out of these sets. So you only assume this condition for points that align in that set. Yeah, and almost every such point. And if you think a while, this is not so unnatural, for example, because almost every point will be a levy density point. Somehow there's points where it just goes in. That's where it just goes in at one point and leaves immediately after, they don't matter to this definition. Because there's a normal string. Okay, so you're at liberty to define anything and hope for anything. But it turns out that indeed these structures exist and exist essentially in the at least in the generality that I'm quite happy with. Completely separable, run on moder measure that is semi-locally finite. So Locally finite, and so finite, a positive and finite on the whole balls, according to restriction support. And one assumption that you can replace with other things, but the simplest way to state this is with finite Hausdorff dimension. For example, if you're metrically doubling, or your Oswald dimension is fine, then P T P we could charge exists exactly in the previous sense, and then you can write things like that the change of the function is actually the integral of its differential. Of its differential. And this differential is unique in these terms. You know? Without neither. Without compare or doubling. Of course, some ghost of doubling is in the hauser dimension. In most practical settings, I guess, you would have metrically doubling space. But the measure doesn't have to be doubling. So it could be any weighted measure. No pump rate, no measure doubling assumption. And one feature. And one feature of this was that we got a stronger bound. Well, we don't have a Pokemon constant, we don't have a doubling, so it couldn't depend on those. But it just depends on the Hellstream dimension. That the maximal dimension of the chart is at most the Auschwitz dimension space. This was a new result, actually, even in the cheaper theory. So if you had a PI space, that the chart would be less than the Auschwitz function. There were earlier results, for example, Skiopa had a result that was found by the Auscoa dimension. If you are ellipsoid differentiable, these phase of this. Okay. So, what can you? I want to just give one example of why you might want to use this structure, because there are some calculations that it makes easier, for a time. One thing is that if you have a solvent function and you look at its bounded solvent function and you look at its square, you might want to say that you have a chain rule, that the df squared is twice f times df. And how And how can you use this structure to prove such things without doing really much effort? Is that, well, you have a uniqueness. So you look at P almost every curve. Along P almost every curve, you're absolutely continuous. So you can just use one variable differentiation theory to say that this is twice f composed with gamma prime. And now this thing, because you have a chart, is expressed by that thing. But now you look at the red thing here, the change of this f squared. The change of this f squared is expressed by this differential, and this is expressing it almost every curve or almost every point along in the chart. And by uniqueness, it has to be the only differential. So ps squared has to be this point. So you can really do calculations as you do differentiate one-dimensional functions. So yeah. So you can prove whiteness rule, for example, in a fairly complex way. Like this rule, for example, in a fairly compact way, you can get useful properties there. Okay. I want to say just briefly a little bit about where this finite half-strip dimension comes from, and also because there's also a different way of thinking about these charts. So, and this is very similar to actually what Cheeber does, and Terry will say more about that. But you can define, instead of a chart, you can define what it means to be T independent. Well, it could be T independent. T-independent, it means that no linear combination is zero. Well, linear combinations are b dot phi, and what I mean by not zero is that the minimum weak upper gradient is not zero. So I can define it with this essential infimum, or like an infimum over a dense set. I mean, since that in the chart, this is almost everywhere positive. It can be very small, but still positive. Okay, so this means that kind of this is not a chart, but the difference is that. A chart, with the difference is that it might not be the most coordinates that I have. So it might be a soft set of a chart. You just think of these as linearly independent sets. So linearly independent, but not necessarily a basis for the space. And what we showed with Derry using the Philippes and Rindler's theory was that if you are p independent, then your Hausdorff dimension has to be at least 100. So there's a bound on the size of P independent. On the size of P independences. And now, those of you who have read your cheeker very carefully, you recognize this as one of the integral parts of this argument. Once you get a dimension bound for independent things, that immediately, by abstract measure theory nonsense, leads you to maximal p-independent maps. And voila, maximal p-independent maps are charts. So things are actually convenient. And that immediately gives you the existence. And the way you think about this is linear algebra. The way to think about this is linear algebra. If phi is maximal, and you want to say that you can differentiate with the unique differential, well, what do you do in linear algebra? Well, you add one vector. It's no longer linearly independent. So there exists a linear combination of these that is zero. But of course, here, you end up in an ocean or a sea or a swamp of measure-theoretic nightmares because everything is only defined almost everywhere, and that's where you have to work hard. Have to work hard. It's still the same intuition workers. Okay, but I'll stop here. Any questions or comments? I mentioned almost the record. So if modulus is zero, then if modulus of the curve family is zero, then then wouldn't be easy. Is a zero, then N1P is equal to L. With this, with this upper gradient. Well, yeah, the software space is just L P, so in that case, the minimal upper gradient is zero and differential is zero. So I think the other take that's right out of it. This would give zero. That's right. So it doesn't give anything that the previous structures wouldn't. Yeah. Yeah. That is. That is. Yeah, so for me, the main motivation here was that, yes, so in these degenerate cases, I don't expect that the differential will control all the directions, but I wanted to somehow precisely say that P almost every direction is controlled. And I think of really them somehow spanning a tangent space. Like in this picture, they're kind of nice. The differential here, said that, but GF. Said that, but GF is just absolute value of the expert. Do you expect to something also in three dimensional places? So there. So you mentioned this, that you can still do a bundle structure there. You have this. There, that you have this, yeah. So, I'm not sure if there's something better than that. So, at least I ended up in some issues thinking of what would be an infinite-dimensional chart, for example. So, I don't, yeah, but that one, what you mentioned with the BX, the fibers, I think that's yeah. I'm not sure if it would be much better than that, for example. Just so the problem is that the norms uh Problem is that the norms uh cannot be equivalent. You have to find uh well one thing is also this maximality, I mean this Hilbert hotel problem. You can always fit one more vector in a thing, in your Hilbert hotel. So, like, what does it mean to be a maximal? I'm not sure if one can define in this way a maximal thing. I mean, one can try, but one thing, the measure theory really requires that there's a dimension upper bound. Because it can be infinitely authentic. Because if it can infinitely often increase, then it doesn't. But maybe there's some. I see what you say, and I think there are ways probably of dealing with this, but I. I think you can substitute some, but you have to know a priority basis, you know, something like that, uh, so difficult. But there are ways to overcome the numbers. There should I agree that probably a yeah. So Probably a yeah. So maybe that that would be an interesting thing for to consider, I think. Maybe we pass over to the next. Oh, I want to have a light question. Is it a typo on the lower right corner, or did you give exactly the same talk two years ago? It is a typo, yeah. The this is this work done in twenty one. But uh as I said to Luca, with the pandemic it feels like we lost two years, so this is We lost two years. So this is where you are. Best tax investment.
