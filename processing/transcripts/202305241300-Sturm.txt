Probably. And the title of his talk is Random Riemannian Geometry in Even Dimensions. Thank you. Yeah, thank you very much for the invitation. It's my pleasure to present some of my recent work. It's a joint work with Lorenzo de Vastiabo, Rona Hari, and Eva Kopfer. And what we are doing in this project. Are we doing in this project is we try to extend stochastic calculus in two dimensions towards higher dimensions. So, in two dimensions, we have plenty of beautiful results concerning SLE, Gaussian-free fields, conformal stochastic approaches to conformal field theory, and so forth. And typically, people believe that none of his results can be extended to higher dimensions, but at least some of his results. At least some of his results have a higher-dimensional counterpart. And what we want to study in general are stochastic perturbations of Riemannian geometry. And what we have in mind is we look on. Can you hear me? Can you put full screen your slides if possible? Okay, I can try, but there is a danger that this. Change or that this then does not work. If it's a problem, no, but let's try. Uh, whatever happens now. Nothing changed. Is it better now for you? Yes, yes. Okay. Okay, we look on conformal classes of compactory many manifolds, and we look on we are. And we look on, we are interested in probability measures on objects which we consider as fields. And naively, we think that fields are continuous functions. In practice, typically these are distributions on the given manifold. And what we want is that these measures on the fields are conformally invariant in the sense that if we perturb the metric tensor by weight, then this probability measure should. Then this probability measure should not change. And if we push forward a manifold M to a manifold M prime through an isometry, this isometry also should push forward the fields. So we ask for measures which are invariant under these two canonical transformations of the many manifolds. And throughout the sequel, we fix M, so we consider this as grounded, but everything. Granted, but everything which we construct only depends on the isometric class, and for a given manifold, we want that everything which we construct is invariant under this conformal changes of a metric tensor. And typically, the measures on fields which we consider or which anybody else considers are Gaussian fields. So, we think that these fields can informally be written as an exponential of some energy functional time. Of some energy functional times a uniform distribution, both in a very naive sense. We all know that there is no uniform distribution on functions or on measures. But at least this is a quite helpful guiding principle. And we think that this bilinear form, which indeed plays an important role, is given in terms of an operator. And if we invert this operator, If we invert this operator, we get another bilinear form which can be written in a kernel. And this energy functional here, this inverse one, this gives us the Ricochet's definition of this measures via the Bocheminder's theorem. And what we have in mind is that this typically or in classical cases the directly energy, whereas this is the integral with respect to a green curl. Integral with respect to the green kernel. And if we define our fields this way, these are centered Gaussian fields, and the covariance function is given by this kernel, which indeed is the kernel for the inverse of this operator. So this is just the naive guiding principle. And the conformal invariance we are interested in simply means then that this energy is conformal invariant. Is conformally invariant. So, whenever we define an energy function on a manifold, we are interested at the moment only in froze definitions, which leave this function invariant if we replace a metric tensor by a weighted tensor. And the celebrated example in two dimensions, the Dirty energy, so if we have Dirty energy in standard form, integral of a gradient of u squared times the volume. Of u squared times the volume. This is invariant, so if you change the metric tensor, you get two times for weight here with negative power and two times for weight here with positive power. So the volume comes with square times for weight and the gradient with each of the gradient with weight to the minus one. So this cancels out and you have a compound invariant energy function. And this is one of the reasons why Gauss. This is one of the reasons why Gaussian free field in dimension two is so fruitful. So, all this work by Sheffield, Miller, and so forth is based on this definition, just making rigorous meaning of this heuristic definition and the conformal invariance of this probability measure comes from the conformal invariance of a Dublin energy. And when And then this leads to an interesting construction of a so-called global quantum gravity, which is a random measure heuristically defined this wave. So you take the conformal weight in terms of this random function times the given remaining volume. To make this a little bit better behave, you subtract this variance. Variance times one-half to make this a marginal. Still, this is typically not well defined because this measure lives not on the space of functions, but on the space of distributions. So, E to distribution is not really well defined, but you can give a precise meaning to this expression by replacing these fields by regularizations. Regularizations HL, and then you pass to the limit of these normalized weights and do this Martigal convergence result, which provides you with a limit on the level of random measures on the given manifold. And all this is linked to many other important random objects in two dimensions, SLE, Schwann Lügner. SLE, Schwann Lügman evolution to Brownen map of Le Gaulle and Miamo and many other things. But all this is related to or restricted to dimension two. So as I mentioned in dimension two, this durable energy is conformally invariant as written here. In higher dimension, this is no longer true. If you look on the conformal transformed energy, you see you get a Energy, you see, you get e to the n times phi from the volume, and you get a e to the minus 2 phi from the gradient. And this cancels only if n is 2. So in a dimension different from n, Turkey energy is not the right quantity to end up with a conformed invariant energy. More promising is the bilacian. If instead of a gratin, you have a Laplacian here, you expect that you get four here. Four here, but this is not completely correct because the Laplacian itself does not scale with a square, it scales with a square times low order terms. And if you make a reverse engineering to get rid of these low order terms, you see, here you see these low order terms. If you make a reverse engineering, you see that the right object to have conformal invariant energy is to start with. Energy is to start with a Laplacian to the power n over 2 plus well-defined low-order terms. Now, without low-order terms, you end up here in the energy with these perturbations, and you have to get rid of these low-order terms. So, you should not start with this, you should start with this plus low-order term, and then you can prove conformal invariance. So, in dimension four, this is Q to the finite. And in even dimensions, arbitrary high physics is Gramchin, Mason, Spaling, write famous result. Let me concentrate in explicit formulas on dimension four, because in dimension four you can write down the results, but more or less everything which I present is true for all even dimensions on compact manifolds. In dimension four, you can write down formulas. In dimension four, you can write down formulas explicitly in dimension different from four. Okay, in dimension six, formulas are also known, but things get more and more complicated. So, what is the correct energy in dimension four? It's the Laplacian of U squared. As I mentioned, you'll be corrected by low-order transfer, which is the Ricci tensor plus colour curvature times quad U squared. So if you have If you have Einstein manifolds, for instance, this simplifies, this is just Laplacian u square plus a constant times quadrant u square. And in particular for the sphere, you have this nice formula in on the chaos where curvature vanishes, you have simply the Laplacian mu square. So it's the bi-Laplacian which pops up here as a generator and the Laplacian mu square, which is the energy. Which is the energy. So, this is the replacement of the Durham energy if you want to end up with a conformal invariant energy. And yeah, this is the results of Panett's. Whenever you make this transformation with a smooth weight or even lesser angularity, you get invariance of this energy due to the fact that you correct this Laplacian u square. Laplacian u square. But the take-home message is that it's essentially Laplacian to the power n over 2 plus low order terms. For the rest of his talks, you don't have to remember these low-order terms. But these low-order terms, they are responsible for the fact that the corresponding operator is not always positive semi-definite, or in other words, this form is not necessarily a non-negative form. A non-negative form. Because you might have quite a lot of negative contributions coming from the curvature. Even if it's low order, you could have some negative eigenvalues. And for the SQL, we have to assume that the energy is non-negative or positive on this space, the circle here means we factor out the constants. So on the orthogonal complement of the constants, we want that. Complement of the constants, we want that the energy is positive. These manifolds are called admissible. In dimension two, every manifold is admissible, every compact manifold. In dimension four, compact manifolds with non-negative compact Einstein manifolds with non-negative free curvature are admissible. And hyperbolic manifolds are admissible, for instance, if the spectral gap is large enough. Enough. But there are also counterexamples. For instance, if you have a product of compact too many surfaces, you can achieve that this is not admissible by choosing one manifold with a small spectral gap. Here is now a very short notation conventions of this circle or grounded space, how we call it. This means orthogonal to constants. All to constants, and this is this allows us to invert the Laplacian on this compact manifold and the inverse of a Laplacian we call grounded green operator. Grounding means always factoring out the constants. And yeah, if we agree on considering Agnes. Considering admissible manifolds, then we can consider the Penins operator, which is the generator of this bilinear form. And this is then a non-negative or positive, definitely a non-negative operator. By compactness of underlying manifold, we have a complete basis of eigenfunctions, and we can use this to define the kernel for the inverse operator. kernel for the inverse operator just taking the inverse eigenvalues and the eigenbasis and we have this uh bilinear form which in classical cases is just the integral of a green operator and we write it here with a corresponding basis and for inverse of eigenvalues of course we don't want to have here for eigenvalue zero but this is achieved by this browning operation This grounding operation. And this integral kernel, this is now for crucial observations. This has a divergence or a singularity, which is exactly the logarithm of a distance. So as in the two-dimensional case, in two-dimensional case, if you invert the Lagrangian, it's just a little bit worse than bounded operator. So the current is with logarithmic singularity. And the same with. Singularity and the same with a Laplacian with a power n over 2 in dimension n. So each kernel is logarithmic, and we scale this operator exactly in such a way that there is no factor in front. So we really want logarithm times distance, not four times logarithm or 10 times. This is one important quantity that the kernel is exactly logarithm of a distance or negative logarithm of a distance. Second important property, the conformal invariance of the energy gives us a conformal invariance of It gives us a conformal invariance of this green kernel up to some renormalization, but this is just a trivial business taking out appropriate constants. So essentially, we have the same kernel for the transformed metric. And this gives us then the right random objects. Namely, we define the random fields, the Gaussian fields as Gaussian fields with. Gaussian fields with this covariance operator, which has a logarithmic kernel. And if you prefer a more explicit representation, you can really write them as negative square root of eigenvalues of his permits operator times eigenfunctions times standard Gaussian random variables. So this is the representation of this noise, which in abstract terms is Struct terms is defined here in terms of this covariance function, which is the inverse kernel or inverse integral of an operator. And here it's the explicit representation. Once again, this representation of his random fields with this sum of these eigenvalues can be written as the operator, a squared of an inverse operator. Operator and what does this sum mean? Okay, we should be a little bit more careful. We take a partial sum and we can prove that this random object, which consists of C infinity functions, converge to something in L2 in probability and in negative Sobolev space with respect to a space variable. Space variable, and the limit object is indeed almost everywhere in this negative in this Sovolev space of negative order. And we also can prove that pairings even with functions in negative Sobolev space converge in L2. So these are very strong convergence results for the fields in a very similar manner as we have in a two-dimensional case. So this is. Dimension case. So, this is the construction of our fields. And yeah, maybe I should not spend too much. And again, these fields are conformally invariant. So if we consider the fields H prime, which correspond to a weighted metric tensor, then these fields are exactly the previous fields corresponding to the metric tensor G. And we subtract something which amounts to the fact that our field. Amounts to the fact that our fields are again grounded. So, by construction, our fields have mean value zero with respect to the space variables. But since mean value with respect to the space variable, of course, is different if we are in G and in G prime, we have to subtract something just to make this H prime again a grounded field. So, but essentially, if a message is this is the same random fields if you change. Random fields, if you change the metric tensor by this conformal transformation. And then the next goal in this business is to define what is typically called clearable quantum gravity. So when I idea is if you make a if you use this field to define a conformal transformed metric tensor, then this should give rise to a conformally transformed volume measure. Okay, this is indeed true. Okay, this is indeed true if H were a function, but H is not a function. H is a distribution, so this has to be treated with care. So as I mentioned already, we first of all take the martingale regularization. We subtract here the one-half times the expect times the variance of this variable. Still, this is not meaningful because also the variance is infinite. But the next step is we approximate this random field by approximations. And typically, approximations are these approximations which we already have seen. Namely, we take here for partial sum. If you do not add up all this series, you stop at eigenvalue L and then you construct this measure with the HL here and you subtract here one half of this. Subtract here one half of this corresponding variance. This is well defined. You have a C infinity function here. And then you get a nice measure with a C infinity density. And on the level of measures, you can prove convergence. This follows the work of Kahan and Shamov, and we get these important results which Which are true if this gamma is not too big. In our multi-dimensional case, in dimension two, the threshold is the number two. In the general case, the threshold is square root of 2n. And for gamma less than square root of 2n, we get convergence of these measures in this weak sense. So, weak convergence, if you put in a test function, you get convergence. And this convergence as an object in randomness is in L1 or also almost truly. And this random measure is then called the quantum gravity measure. And okay, I skip all the piece. And again, for this measure, we have a conformal invariance. I have mostly now argued. Now argued that this is two in dimension four, but without any significant change, this works for even dimensions. And as I mentioned, this operator then no longer can be written down explicitly, but we know that it's the n half power of a Laplacian times an explicit constant and low order terms. And this kernel has a logarithmic singularity. A logarithmic singularity and also the low-order terms do not destroy the logarithmic singularity. And what we gain are two important facts: namely, we have an operator which is conformally invariant. And secondly, we have an operator which has a logarithmic divergence. So its inverse operator is a kernel with logarithmic singularity. And more precisely, with a singularity, which means one times logarithmic of a distance. Of a distance. You have this amounts for killing the constants in front of a logarithmic kernel. And yeah, maybe here are some interesting approximation in discrete case. Again, I will switch this and I jump to the last challenging object in this theory, namely we We are interested to construct counterparts to the so-called Polyakov-Leoville measure. So, this is a quite fascinating object. It's more complicated than the standard Gaussian measures. In the standard Gaussian measures, you have the H here and here, just a quadratic functional. Now, our action functional is more sophisticated. It has this quadratic term, which you know from all this Gaussian measures. But then there is also. But then there is also a term which is just the curvature of an underlying manifold in the given metric tensor R and the given metric tensor G. So this is just the Gauss curvature of this two-dimensional space, V t is a constant. And there is this e to the gamma H, which amounts to the volume of a transformed space. If you think of the integral with respect to the volume. integral with respect to volume if each of the n times h this would be the new volume of this random transformed space and okay in in heuristic approaches to to field theory uh you then the interpretation then is that you have a coupling of gravitational field and matter field or in other words a quantization of the classical Einstein-Hilbert action. Classical Einstein-Hilbert action. What is interesting for us in two dimensions, but later on also in higher dimensions, that the minimizes of this action functional, if you make an appropriate choice of this constants feature, they satisfy the Liable equation. And therefore, the weighted metric in which you put in this age. In which you put in this H has constant curvature. And more generally, it turns out that if you give a rigorous meaning to this object, as was done by David Carvin Kubiainen, then you can study the semi-classical limit of these objects as gamma goes to zero. And if you scale these constants theta and m, it turns out that this polyakov Liou will measure constant. out that this polyakov neural measure concentrates on the minimizers of these functionals and thus on surfaces of constant curvature. So in this respect, this polyator Liurville measure is a random perturbation of manifolds of constant curvature, of surfaces of constant curvature. And of course, this random perturbation are no longer manifolds because this measure again does not sit on functions. Ferrigo's definition of The rigorous definition of these objects again leads to distributions, but things can be made rigorous. So, these are metric measure spaces, random metric measure spaces. This is a probability measure on random metric measure space, and the semi-classical limits are the constant curvature surfaces. And now the question is, can we do anything in higher dimension, anything meaningful? We do not claim that this is really the solution to. This is really the solution to the physical problem. We consider this as a challenge in mathematics. Now, what can we do in higher dimensions? Okay, the Dual energy should be replaced by our Pennett's operator, or in general case by this corporate harmonic operators. So it's the square root of a Pennetz operator squared. This is our bilinear form. Now we claim that the Gauss curvature should be replaced by Branson's curvature. I will say some word later on. And for certain purposes, it's also good to add just a constant here, constant times the p, whereas here it's curvature times the p. And here, okay, you have this object. What do we think of that? Here we think that this should be Liural quantum gravity measure. Liouville quantum gravity measure. Measure. Liouville quantum gravity measure is essentially this times this regularization. So I don't write down the regularization, but we think that this should be the regularized measure. So this weight times the volume measure should be the Liouville quantum gravity measure. And altogether should be then a meaningful object. But before I come to this Riga's construction, let me say what is Let me say what is Branson's curvature. Branson's curvature again in dimension four can be written down explicitly. Here it's a fourth-order object. It's the Laplacian of scalar curvature times a constant minus Ricci curvature square plus scalar curvature squared. So the importance of it comes from two facts. First, it's a conformal invariance. And secondly, And secondly, it has an important transformation property. Of course, the conformal invariance would follow from this property. Namely, this transformation property is S you know for the transformation of Gauss curvature in dimension two. If you want to consider Gauss curvature in dimension two in a weighted space, you probably know that this is the old Gauss curvature times a factor plus the Laplacian of this weight or minus whatever. What I am, yeah. New Gauss curvature is old Gauss curvature plus Laplacian of a weight, and here new Branson curvature is old Branson curvature plus Panett's operator of a weight. And this is the important transformation rule for the Panett's curvature. And in some sense, because the combination of Panett's operator and weight here, this is the natural pairing. And the fact that Panett's curvature is invariant is, of course, also quite. Invariance is, of course, also quite interesting. So, to give a rigorous meaning of these informal answers, we proceed as follows. We put this object and this volume and this measure on fields together and make it a Gaussian measure, which we have considered before, with this covariance function coming from the Panel's operator. This simply is a parent between the distribution and the random field. Between the curvature and the random field, random field is a distribution, curvature is a smooth function, that's fine. This is in with a mean value of a distribution or pairing with a constant one. This is again fine. And as I mentioned, this is the quantum New World gravity measure. So this object will be replaced by the quantum New World measure with this weight H. Will measure with this weight h. Again, this is well defined. We have seen how to define this before. And the results then are for certain ranges of gammas, which are necessary in order to give a rigorous meaning for this measure, and certain ranges of a parameters. This is a finite measure, and people in two dimensions are very much interested to do finiteness because then you can re-normalize this measure and make it your program. Renormalize this measure and make it your probability measure. And for a particular choice of these parameters, this polyakov urban measure is conformally quasi-invariant. So it's a rather technical object. So you have this Vwasi invariance modulo shift, okay, okay, what's the shift, whatever this means. And people in physics were in particular interested in this pre-factor, like in Gerson of transformation. Of transformation, and this pre-factor family is called conformal anomaly. And the question is: can you identify it? And indeed, we can identify this also in higher dimensions. And surprisingly enough, also in two dimensions, these results on this last slide are known only since quite some years. Only in 2016, the first result in this direction was proven for surfaces of genus zero and then for genus one and later on for high. Then for genus one and later on for higher genes. And what is also known in dimension two now is that if you look on this object in the sense of a rigorous definition and you put in a gamma here and pass to the semi-classic limit, then indeed this measure concentrates on surfaces of constant curvature. And of course, we hope to prove we have. Hope to prove, we have an heuristic argument that in higher dimensions, these measures concentrate on manifolds of constant Q curvature, of constant transcent curvature. So the holistic argument is quite convincing. Of course, we have to put this in a reverse theorem, which has to be done. Okay, so far my presentation. Thanks for your attention. I'm happy to answer your questions. Thank you very much. Are there questions? Yes. So in the definition of the four, can you hear me? Yeah. Okay. In the definition of four-dimensional energy, there is a scalar curvature, Richie curvature. But in four-dimensional, there is also a wow tensor component of the total curvature, which is Of the total curvature, which is already automatically conformal invariant. In other words, I want to ask if you can add that wow tensor into your energy? In other words, do you have different energies which is also conformal invariant? The wow part? So no, there is. No, there is. Okay, if you ask for energy which is quadratic in the arguments, so that you can make it your bilinear form, if we want this as a constraint, then this is for only conform invariant in dimension four. Because then you can, if it's symmetric in variance, you can extract the operator and Can extract the operator, and this Panett's operator is the only conformally invented operator in dimension four. So, there are also, if you look in the literature, there are different definitions of conformally invariant. We need that the operator, if it's transformed, then it's the old operator times the weight function to the power four, because this cancels out with a volume. And there is only one operator, the finite operator, up to a concept, of course. And the same in even dimensions. Okay, yeah, thanks. Maybe how much is in two dimension, you have a DOZZ, conformal bootstrap, and the axioms, single axioms. How much is conjecture to be true in 4D? Sorry, one small, please. In two-dimensional, in two-dimensional. in in two-dimensional in two-dimensional case uh they prove that uh you know the leuvio quantum field theory has uh has a d o z right you can they can prove d o z form like also a conformal bootstrap and so on is this conjecture to be true in 4d i i don't really know i'm always surprised if one of these results has a counterpart in higher dimensions and what i mentioned as a very last And what I mentioned as a very last result, the semi-classic limit, I also was completely surprised that we can prove something. We have, and actually we had also some problems with various results in dimension two, because let's say in dimension two, people can simplify their life very much because, in dimension two, essentially, you only have very few. You only have very few classes of conformally invariant objects, and you always can go to model spaces. People mostly prove things only for constant curvature. This is not what we can do in general. And so, yeah, I don't know. Maybe it's true, maybe not. Okay, thank you. Any other questions? Okay. So, if not, thank you very much again. Thank you. Thank you.
