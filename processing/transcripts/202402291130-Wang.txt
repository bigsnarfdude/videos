So, I want to talk about the so-called high-old scale cultures. That's actually a little bit older research, but I think it is maybe suitable for this conference. But the scale culture actually is a generalization, and hopefully, so in audience can have some idea to study this one. Idea to study this one, so this I want to slow introduce this one, but yeah. So, this joint work was Yushin Give Ying and Wujie Ying Zhejiang University. So, he's also in the conference. So, let me slowly introduce the so what I mean high order. So, it's the if the so let's skip. Uh, so that's either we have the Liam curvature tensor and multiply Lehman coverage tensor k times, and you take the generalize the clonical data symbol. So it's somehow so you can prove this only the well-defined quantity and the non-zero, non-trivial quantity. Yeah, so this is. Quantity, yeah. So, this is uh there. So, if the k equals one, it's easy to see the scalar curvature, just take twice the contraction, yeah. So, and if k equal to two, now you maybe also already see in the, should already see in the uh in the for in the four-dimension case. So, this is the especially in the four-dimensional case. So, this is the square of the Liam curvature tensor minus. Curvature tensor minus four times the least curvature square of least curvature plus scalar curvature. And can also express, so maybe in this talk, not quite related. So y tensor squared plus the time of so-called sigma two. I will later mention the definition of the sigma two. This is somehow the lich curvature as an actual shortened tensor curvature, but Actual shortened tensor curvature, but you take the second you have the eigenvalue of short shortening tensor, so-called shortened tensor. I will mention later, and you take the consider the eigenvalue and take the two-symmetry elementary function of so this one. So, it's especially important is the k equal to n over two. Then, this is actually the overlay density, just the so especially. So, especially the integral in the compact manifold, this is a topological constant. So, this so it's we're defined from k between k and n over 2. Over k into 2 is zero. Yeah, so if you can also define, but this actually is zero, so it's trivial. So, as I mentioned, so this actually appeared really early already. Uh, really early already, this quantity. And in physics, I did not know much about the physics. So, so together with this one, they usually call the gospel net gravity. So, that so that compared to the scalar curvature, so this as the Einstein gravity, so this is the gospel net gravity, usually used in the perturbation of the Einstein gravity, so it becomes the sigma. So here comes the sigma scalar culture plus epsilon time here sigma R2. So as a perturbation. So there are some meanings. So use there are actually lots of papers on this direction. If only consider R K they usually call the Q Gauss name gravity. Parallelities also. Okay. This is the definition quite a complicated definition. So let me. So you actually can generalize also Lich curvature and Einstein tensor curvature. And also actually the Lehman curvature tensor can also generalize. So I did not write down the Lehman curvature tensor generalized, just use the K leach curvature and Curvature and curvature. So here I use for the leach curvature is right as a Lehman curvature time P. So here is the tensor. I will mention this. What is the meaning? P actually quite important in our research. So if you see this, then the instant our literacy is actually not too complicated. Just see P, you know this P coach. P is you know this p culture then time limit culture tensor, yeah. And there are also the instant tensor, yeah. So, this instant tensor has a very, very similar meaning. Uh, the I will later uh claim, so this also divergence free. This term is also diverging, okay. So, this can generalize this, so you can also see you can generalize the Einstein equation, something like uh, so. So here P is a you so if you just the for the so ah here as K as I mentioned so here for for this one you're just keeping the the the the the last one as a Liam culture tensor that put as a part as defined as a four tensor P. So this is just the definition. So we decompose this P and Decompose this P and it's one R. Yeah, so it's easy to see. So here, so we like just the first part is P, the other part as the Lima curvature tense. So P, I repeat here. But important P is divergence free. So actually for so here I write the divergence for free for respect to the I, but actually for every any of the four are the Any of the four are the coordinates, also, because the P is a tensor symmetry is similar to the leach curvature, Lehman curvature. So for example, Pi is anti-commute and the Pi here is also symmetric. Yeah, so it's similar. And important, as I mentioned, so this divergence free. So this is actually the consequence of the second Bianchi identity. The second Bianchi identity. So, you can see also the because the secondary Bianchi identity, you can see the invalids of the differential form. So, this also the invalids of the diffimorphism. Then, this implies, as I already mentioned, so Einstein tensor is just the one as a contraction for this P tensor. So, that's also the Hence. So that's also the double ding spring. Yeah, so if we use the, so for example, the validation, like then it's easy, they are completely same as the scalar curvature and the validation structure. So if you consider the OI here, right as LK, this is RK, the scalar curvature water. So if you consider the functional, so integral of RK, then you can compute the validation. You can compute the valuation. It's very, very similar as the scalar culture. Just that the instant cancer, k instant tensor time, scalar product was your validation. So this computation, this computation is a follow from them before the stability as a property. So you can also consider that as a critical point. For example, if you validate. For example, if you're evaluating over every metric with the volume fixed one, for example, then you get the litch curvature, the k litch curvature is proportional to the matrix. So like the Einstein equation. So I here use the Keinstein equation, K stein equation, because Einstein in German just Weinstein. So, here it's very suitable. It's case style. Stein is a stone, you know. So, so case is very suggested by my colleague. So, it's very suitable to call the case stein with the case to measure. So, and also they are very, very similar so-called Shaw lemma if the Keinstein equation satisfies this. If it satisfies this equation, but only Lambda is not constant, then you can prove Lambda also automatically constant because the divergence free. Yeah, so this is similar. If you restrict on the conformal class, then the problem becomes this sigma. So IK equal to constant, scalar curve to constant. You found it like a Yamadi problem. This actually is our. As my previous research direction, so we started the generalized fully non-linear KMRB problem. Then I came to this problem like that. So a little bit different. I will show you this so-called sigma KMRB was respect to it. Very, very close, but not completely same. So here is so this is good. So RK is better than letter. So, Rk is better than later. Well, I want to introduce a sigma k. So, here, as I show you, is a variation problem not only in the conformal class, but also in the whole space of metric. So, this variation form. For sigma k, I will later introduce the is in principle only in conformal class. So, outside conformal classes, they become the fourth order equation. Okay. Okay. So let me repeat a little so have so that you have a little bit of feeling. So scalar curvature, so you have the normal curvature. And then you have this P operator. I introduced. So in this, okay, good one, just the chronicle, the operator. All you can see just the metric, too much metric. And for here you can And for k equal to two, then so here it's a little bit complicated. So, instant tensor also maybe appeal to some kind of evolution equation, this leach flow. I did not check. So, here I want to emphasize this p operator for p equal for p k equal to 2. So, p this tensor, you can see just a leach. You can see just a Lehman curvature tensor minus some kind of leech tensor and scalar curvature. So I write in the letter this form. Lehman curvature tensor can be decomposed by the P plus this Kokani nomitsu product was metric and also the scalar culture who the metric product. So you can decompose. So important is So, important is so the P tensor here is just the divergence free part of the Lehmann curvature tensor. Yeah, so other part, other two part is not the divergence free. So, this divergence free part. So, in this case, k equal to two. This case, so here I mentioned, so actually the second Bianchi is equivalent to the P this tensor is double in split. That's completely equivalent. This complete equivalent. So, as I mentioned, the second direction implies that P dividing three, but in K equal to two, they actually reverse direction also true, just the equivalent. So, one can also decompose, you know, the income, especially in conformal metric. So, has a wire tensor plus, so here I mentioned this so-called shortened tensor. Yeah, so shortened tensor is the normalized reach. The normalize the leach curvature tensor. So, in the conformal geometry, it's important. So, as I mentioned, sigma k is just to take the take the sigma k on the eigenvalue of this short intensity. Okay, so this is one and two. So, as I said, mentioned the one over ng over two is just the our density, yeah. Our density. Yeah. Okay, so I hear you. So some examples. So also I will later interesting special case. So shortness, as I mentioned here, so then we come so-called sigma case scalar curvature is just some kind of elementary symmetric function, case, symmetric function on the shortened tensor. So this some kind of. Yeah, so that's some kind. So if you're determinant, if k equals n, then just determinant. Yeah, so sigma k can be seen as a special case of the k i introduced, but on the special case. So the if the so I decompose the y as a lemon closure tensor as y tensor plus shorting tensor, as I said, if y tensor is zero, then the post. Then the post is actually the same. So if locally conformal flat, then the scalar post-scale curvature is the same. That's I mentioned. So the sigma case, so this is the corresponding Yamabi problem. And so ask what exists in the conformal class. So is the schema k constant, scalar culture constant. So this is the become a fully. This is the become a fully non-linear elliptical micro. So, this can see as a special case. Another special case I will later also introduce. If we use the manifold you considered is a half surface. For example, half surface in the clearance space, then because the Gauss equation, so you have a scalar literacy curvature tensor can be. Curvature tensor can be just expressed by the as a second fundamental form. If you write as H, maybe later as A, but it's the same. So the second fundamental form, then you can compute just as Rk equal to the H2K. So in this talk, HK means that we take the symmetric elementary function on the eigenvalue of the signal. The eigenvalue of the second fundamental form. So, this is a 2k. So, let's also prove that if there's such kind of high-order mean curvature, so we call the h k or the h2k high-order mean curvature. If the even case is actually intrinsic, yeah. So, as a so that if the scalar curvature is just H2, H2 can be scalar curvature. So, H2 is Gauss curvature. H2 is Gauss curve, which is here. So, if the hyperbolic, they are a little bit complicated, but it's almost the same. So, because that's minus one factor, so you can see the RK is equal to the combination. It's here, HK. So, here, also I should mention this element symmetric function I normalized so that they are not code. So, so that they are not coefficient. They actually have some coefficient without normalization. So, you'll see it's quite simple, but with the normalization. So, for example, the scale curvature just in the hyperbolic space, just the H2 minus one. So, if R2 then is the H4 minus 2H2 plus 1. Okay, so this later may maybe also one can see also as a special case. So, in this conference, there are many problems related to scale culture. So, one can ask whether this is true for the K bigger than or equal to two. Yeah, so K equal to one is the same. So, for example, we one can ask here, for them, here is. Here, for them, here is the talk related to this group. So, we can also ask this on the tallest whether yeah, because that's positive magic. Yeah, so for example, k equal to one just in this conference, the amendment talk, and the k equal to m over two, that's true because one side is positive in integral, integral, this coach, other side is. This coach, other side is topological constant. So there's zero, then it's a contradiction, it's trivial. So as that, so somehow it's very, very close to the scale curvature for the three dimension. So our case, I should mention it. So if you consider the k equal to two, then it's very close to the dimension four and five. Yeah, four. So one can ask something for. One can ask something for dimension five. For four, maybe just a topological constant for five, then it's maybe can consider some so also can ask for this such kind of results exists. Yeah, so I mentioned here is L2, L1, one cannot see which is stronger. Yeah, that's not not. Yeah, that's not not at least locally, you cannot see which is only just one condition. But later in the for the PDE, so we want to have the ellipticity tit, then usually consider key problems, then usually ask is positivity is from one to k is every one to k is positive. That's certainly the k bigger is a condition is strong. So here is for fixed. So here is for fixed the K, then it's not easy to see, at least locally, yeah, globally we don't know. So the problem solved for this scale curvature is they are not actually normal methods. They are not completely non-methods, for example, spin method. So it's, we cannot find it possible. Maybe it's a high-order spin, but I check it, so still not searchable. Yeah, for the minimum surface, I also don't know all the harmonic function or the here is a potential theory. Maybe can do something because harmonic function generalizes to the Hessian equation. But usually because the needed for the Hessian equation, at least we can only study for the elliptic. So you have a strong condition. Then the strong condition is not really natural. Really, nature, so to post. So, I want to just show you that what as a minimum service method, what you should consider. So, just one slide. So, if we hope to consider the minimum surface related to this scale culture, it's suitable in this way, maybe. So, just see the minimum consider minimum surface in a manifold. So, you actually consider the For the so you actually consider the earlier surface, yeah. So I see the earlier surface just the integral of one, and one see the R0. I denoted this just convention. R0 is one. So we usually denote zero is one, then R1 RK. So you can see that if you consider the R1, you use the functional O as the integral of the. Or at the integral of the R0. You can compute. So if we want to study R2, maybe you consider the scalar integral of R1. So scalar curvature. Then use the, so this as the Lagrangian equation now is actually the Einstein tensor, the scalar product or the contraction was the here actually the H before. Here, actually, the H before, the second fundamental form. So, you have this equation. So, this is actually natural. As an evaluation problem, it's really natural. So, you consider should ask the instant. Then, so now, so we call this, for example, this two minimum surface. Then, if you want to see the in the special case, the in as a the the The sigma in R in Euclidean space, then you become H3 equal to zero. Then H3, I did not write down H3. Somehow, if the, if the graph, so you see the divergence of the gradient u over square load one plus the normal of. Plus the norm of the gradient. Yeah, so this is being curvature. Now that you have the noted divergence, so here is the nabla and in this term. Nabla of the, then you take this as a second order operator, but you did not consider the trace, but use the here sigma 3 consider this. So it's become the important is become the problem, it's become fully. The problem is become fully non-linear. So, usually, we for the fully nonlinear, we needed the ellipticity. So, without elliptic has no in this theory, yeah. Our EG is instant tensor, sorry. So, this is a standard instant tensor. So, it's a standard instant tensor. Yeah, so if the general, there is also generalized standard and so if the Tensor if you consider the sigma k or r k integral of r k as a function, you become the because the valuation just the instant tensor time variation valuation or for the minimum for the highest half surf half surface is just the second fundamental force. So you should have this one. Now, as I say, so it's actually, so the many problems. The many problem, so if you're especially for topological also, you can so that this ellipsoidity usually is for HK, H3. So you should ask the mean curvature positive usually and H2 positive, H2 in this case is scalar curvature positive, then H3, maybe even H4 positive, then you have ellipsic their results in this. Their results in the state 20 years ago, so one can also have the English type the results, but very strong condition and very strong condition. The Binstein results is stated not in the usual way, it's in the way if you satisfy such a kind of country, then there are no solutions. Because trivial solution cannot this. Previous solution did not, this plan did not satisfy the ellipticity. You only quite ellipsoidate already, exclude the plane. The results is under such conditions, you have no initial. Yeah, so this is okay. So, but we can do a little bit. So, what I want to claim is that somehow you in geometry. Any geometry, the property is very similar, but analysis is very difficult. Yeah, so the geometry, all the valuation structure. So I want to show you. So one can use this consider the asymptotic flat manifold, but with different decay. So I will show you. So here what I emphasize now the decay order term as yesterday already has the previous. Yes, they already had the previous talk. So, I will make a little bit quickly. So, we have the decay order term and you define the editing mass. So, outside the bigger sphere, you define this term. Then one can prove this is what we're defined if tau larger than n over two, n minus two over two. And the scalar curvature is. And the scalar curvature is in A01. So, this is the ADMS. So, this scalar curvature, so you know, there's actually the scalar curvature, you expanded the scalar curvature under this decay condition. The first order is just the divergence of this ink current. Yeah, so then the other is the low order. So, in our case, when So, in our case, one can also expand it. So, that is nature to define. So, this scalar curvature can also expand it. So, I emphasize here is the P, this is two four tensors are keeping here. Then you expand actually quite easily, just expand it at the least element curvature tensor. Yeah, so then you get you can prove this also that diverge leading term is also. Leading term is also divergence term plus the suitable the decay tensor. Then one can define this as just as a quantity. So certainly you should prove the convergence and also the invariant lengths. Yeah, so that's what are our results. So one can also prove understood about decay. So now decay is different. K, so now decay is different. Power is larger than n minus 2k divided by k plus 1. So if k equals to 1, just the usual one n minus 2 over 2. So not at all is in this case. So somehow this decay is slow then. So if bigger, decay is slow. So we can define the invariant for slow decay. You can see that. Can see that. And one can prove that also well defined under the similar condition. So Rk is integer, is in L1, and so defined is well defined. So it did not depend on the coordinate, the big outside coordinate. So one can prove this one. So I may mention here, so that for any decay, you can only. For any decay, you can only one k it's maybe can define and the finite. So if k, so if for k equal to two, you can define. You can define that corresponding to k equal to one. So this invalid, this ada mass is infinity. Yeah, if k equal to two can define is finite, then the k equal to one is infinite. K equal to one is infinity and k equal to three is zero. So you can divide it by the interval here. So one range is finite. So the bigger than this is zero or the infinity. So only one can define. So this is the situation. So they are also d and quite. D and the new tends quite a similar definition. Okay, so then we can ask whether the uh positive mass some kind of so whether this mass is positive if the scalar if the RK is positive or non-negative. Yeah, one can ask so the same. But now, as I already mentioned, so we have not any method, previous three method, we have not any success. Method we have now in this, but the very special case you just integral by path somehow, yeah. So you can, for example, you can for the for the conformal uh the in the conformal class, you can do, but this should global conformal class has a suitable function u satisfy every condition, then you can show this mass should be positive if the Positive if the corresponding scalar curve is positive, and this can be proof. And also, the important for us is a very special case, also the graph. If your manifold is as a graph over R in, then one can compute the mass. Then mass related to the, then one can see this actually the positive. Yes, this actually our further the The our further uh the research so in the collection. So now the manifold is very, very special. Is the is uh the whole space uh is i in the topology is just the Euclidean space and the metric is a graph corresponding if yeah if has some condition so that this total uh is asymptotically flat. So here is f is sympotically constant. Simple totally constant, but infinity is a constant. Then you can actually write down the match, the mass is just this term. Then if L k positive, certainly this positive. So this is the important is so here, L k equal to one is the student of pre former student of lamb. There are corresponding results. Yeah, that's a good question. Ligidity is difficult. Ligidity is following. Ligidity is respect to the Peinstein problem. So now if zero, then the RK is zero. So let me consider K equal to two. So RK, as I mentioned, is H3. Yeah. So in the European space, you have to have. In the Euclidean space, you have a graph and the H3 is equal to zero. You have the outsider, you have suitable decay, so that is flat. Yeah, some of flat. But inside, you have not any condition. Then this is not elliptical. If it was elliptical, you can prove this is constant. You have not any condition, so there's no problem. So you have to come on a fully non-linear equation with a very good decay. Was really good decay condition outside, but inside you did not drop. Yeah, this is difficult. Here I mentioned the one and diamond woo, they have some results for the in this direction. For the dimension, maybe equal to five, so they can do, they can prove is rigidity. Otherwise, it's quite difficult. So this is related to the This is related to the analysis. Should be true, but no method, even because here is even outside is constant or not constant, asymptotically constant. Right. Right. Okay. And the kill lemma in the computation. So this is quite a long computation, but the important is this really can be written down as a divergence form. As I mentioned, the yogi. Divergence form. As I mentioned, usually is a leading term is divergent. This really can be written down divergence form, but should pay attention. This is not the divergence form. It's divergence with respect to your metric. So we have metric, this induced metric. So this is the divergence form with respect to your clear metric. So it's not really divergence form. But this can help us. But this can help us that in the Euclid space, you integral by parts become this one. At the end, you can prove its convergence to the mk. This is the reason here. It's a very long computation. Okay, so there's positivity as a regulator. Now, a little bit interesting is that one can also consider in this special case the panels inequality. The Penelope inequality. Yeah, so we have here, let me show you. So the Penelope inequality for graph, very, very special, as I said. So now we have inside has a boundary. So we have the domain in R in. So we just consider outside part. So outside part, you have a graph. So at infinity, you have a symportal. Has the asymptotic flat or asymptotic constant. And inside, you want to ask this is become induced metric is a polython or the minimum surface. Then this is implied by the condition here. The divergence or the gradient of F tends to boundary should be infinity, so that your manifold looks like this way. Like this way, then the inside induced metric is a minimum surface. Actually, minimum surface, they implies it's actually total short disk. That's a very strong condition, but you should put such high condition. So under this condition, is it very similar to here? So now, sorry. So here, no. So here's So here, this, this, here I write as actual R k. So R k, so you integrate this R k when infinite end, as I said, can be convergence to the, so, so use the partial integration, then the boundary term converges to M key. That we have no other side. No. No, we have other side. The other side is. Other side, the other side is related to this domain. One can compute is equal to the h2k minus one integral of two k minus minus. So you have a domain. This domain now see this boundary now see as a manifold in R in. Yeah, so in this manifold in I, so that there you have the H H 2 K minus 1. For example, if Minus one. For example, if k equals one, this is mean curvature. So this work by the actually is I do not mention. So this is the huge foremost, the brace foremost in the lamp. So for general case, we computed our mass is actually this way. So for example, I just heard the mentioned example. Mention the example. So now, if the scale code is positive, then we solve this term. So this mass is larger than the integral of the H 2K minus 1. And 2k minus 1 is some kind of so-called mass integral of this manifold, this domain. So if this if there's come convert convex order somehow then they are corresponding so-called alexander fins inequality here you're so the here just the example if the we consider k equal to two then m2 is larger than h3 integral of h3 so h3 is not the intricate terms so so we use for example the the alexander reference uh inequality if Reference inequality: if that domain is convex, is the boundary is convex, then it's larger than the integral of suitable powers. That's H2. H2 is a scalar curvature. So I write here the sigma, the scalar curvature. So you have both side is intrinsic. Although the manifold is the H3 is extrinsic, then you become. You then you become an intrinsic inequality. Then, between you can be bigger than the integral of H1. So, I did not write down this one. Then, you're also bigger than the area. So, the area of the now you can, this area is the same as this as the area of the Holy Trinity if the manifold is. So, somehow you have the penalty inequality. The panels inequality. Even you have more panels inequality. If we only consider the both sides is intrinsic, therefore k equal to 2, you have two panels inequality. One is compared to the integral of the scale culture, another is compared to the area. That's very suitable to our case. So one is R1, another is R0. R0 is one. Is one yeah. So manka, I want to ask whether this is optimal. This is actually optimal at least optimal. So, so this panels for the graph one can prove as a general case here is larger than this one. So, power is not the same as the previous. So, all the k equal to one certainly the same power here. And there are the metric actions there. Actually, the satisfy the equality. So, that's also in physics. You can find this. So, as a generalization of the Schwartz shear solution, and also it's only the power is different. So, here is the K, here, N over K. Yeah, so what do you see the N minus two? So, here, N over K minus two. So, this is they call the Schwab shared shared solution. Schwartz here solution. So you can prove this. You can check this. Actually, the normalization at the beginning, the coefficient, we use this metric as a test. So far, the best coefficient. Okay, so one can ask whether it's true for the general case. The story at least can ask, but as I mentioned, so that they are not messy. So that yeah, now my set maybe. Okay, so this one sense. So as somehow we can see as in this case, in graph case, the mass of the panels inequality as the application of the Alexander sensor inequality. Yes, as a Euclidean case. So one can consider this also for the hyperbolic case, one can. Hyperbolic case, one can also count the similar. So, I will really, really quickly review. So, harmonic, so hyperbolic case. So, you have this model. We use the first model. Here, the I is the hyperbolic distance. Then here has hyperbolic case is not a constant. The mass is not constant, actually, is a homomorphism. So, I will. So I will just not. So with respect to the Kelling vector field, so they are N minus diversity. I just here want to mention that the K-Ling vector field, the function satisfaction is equal to the NBPs. Here is a hyperbolic space, and V is one of this. So V use V to as a weight to define the weight to define the as a quantity. This is the hyperbolic case. So I just show you. So phi is the coordinate, big phi is the coordinate. And V is the function as I mentioned, one of them. And here is the so here E is the difference between the metric and the background metric, not background metric. Now, back on the metric is a hyperbolic space. That's very close to here, so, but the form is in this way, so related to v, and still that's p tensor. So, this is the invariant one can also prove. And the important is also the expansion. Now, expansion has two terms. So, one term is as I use defines the mass, the second term. Mass the second term has then you should choice the v satisfy the the identity this equal to zero yeah Hessian of V is equal to the V time P. So this is what we used. So V here is the potential of the Kelling field. So it's also vanishing that then you use the first term define the mass here. Okay, so this is the one. Okay, so this is one can still prove the word defined and the mass really defined as the infimum of the every such kind of choice of V. V so that V is not normal is one. So this is called the mass hyperbolic mass. Then one can also ask the positivity and the penalty inequality. I just show you maybe the just the penalties. Panels. The post-mass is a similar equation. So one can still, in this way, the expression is not a little bit complicated. So the integral has this weight. Then the problem is if AK is positive, then the mass is larger than the last quantity integral. Then we need to establish new external Fensel inequality. Alexander Fensel inequality for the hyperbolic space. This we need. So, if you I will later show you the this inequality. With this inequality, now you have this panel inequality. This form, there are two terms, extra minute term because power k. And it's also the equality is achieved. So it still has the entity. So here. Still have the entity C. So here is the entity that this was previously the generalized Schwartz. So that's the generalized entity. They are very similar. It's only the other term is R plus R2. Yeah, it's very close to this case. Okay, as I said, so rigidity is still valid. One has not measured through equality was only the even in special case, it's not. Even in special case, it's not easy to prove the equality should be this one. That's also difficult to prove. Okay, so now our research somehow should be first established the Alexander Fencer inequality in hyperbolic case. So it's interesting. So this, then several results I did not mention, or maybe also mention other people's results. Okay. Okay, so they should ask. So now, here is the convex state, should be a little bit stronger. So, so-called holospheric convex mean means the mean curvature is at the curvature, principal curvature should be larger than one. So, this is a nature condition in the hyperbolic space because the closed ball actually satisfies this condition. And now the HK integral of HK has. HK integral of HK has this term. So, as I so this cannot directly use in our case because we have the weight, so we still needed to prove the similar. I want to mention interesting is that as you know, maybe for the hyperbolic case, the isoparametric inequality is only in the dimension two. You can write down simple form. So, the general case, you even cannot explain. uh general case you even cannot express by the for uh element so your uh so element mentor function yeah so it's a complex but this form is complicated but you can have a very nice form for for this one and we need also as establish the inequality for the weight so weight here i mentioned here is cosine hyperbolical function of the Of the hyperbolic distance. But now, here it's actually only the power is different. So here, so also the space at the optimum inquiry. So there are many results related to this direction and also having some kind of flow method to prove that this. So you should prove that the. So, you should prove that the monotonicity along the proof and proof that the convergence to the model. The model here is the centered or the short escape sphere. So, and okay, so that's what I want to show the for the you can at least so for this one. So, you have now for the graph, you can do something. Do something and the later want to mention. So, if the really considered analysis, then in conformal class, maybe you can consider. So, conformal class will become the one equation, the scalar equation. And as very beginning, there's two problems. If we ask this to metric, is it limiting the Two metric is living in the same conformal class, then one can prove by the maximum principle. So if you have the solution, the function u is bigger than another one and also satisfy the scalar code bigger than some, you can prove this by the maximum principle, actually. So, but it should restrict to on the conformal class. So, here I want to just mention, as I said, it's also actually. As I said, is also actually somehow we our research is from this direction. So if the so-called sigma k, yeah, might be a problem. So just in the conform, local conformal class, you can local conformal flat case, you can just see that this RK is equal to sigma k is some kind of eigenvalue, combination of eigenvalue of the shortened tensor. So there are many results. So, there are many results. I want to mention the two applications here. This is a very nice application, the first one by the Edison, Girsky, and the Paul Yang. So they prove, so if the four dimension, four dimensions, so if the Yamabi constant positive, that's equivalent to the meaning the scalar curvature positive, at least one of. If the sigma two, as my, so here you can see the R2. 2 oh, sorry, it's a little bit different because he's not conformophilate, but still the sigma 2 on the short intense. If this term is sigma 2 in the four dimension is quite easy, or the sigma 2 is actually quite easy, some kind of norm of the instant tensor minus the scalar curvature tensor power of 2. Yeah, so if the sigma 2 is larger. If the sigma 2 is larger than the integral of the wire tensor, then they can prove this is actually diffimorphous or locally diffimor, maybe locally spin. Here is the diff end all the projective space. So the fourth dimension three, we can also prove the similar, but now it looks a little bit stronger. Look a little bit stronger condition. So, skeletal curvature positive and also sigma k integral positive. So, here is a skeletal positive already rule out many surface, the manifold. So, here only somehow that is too close, it's too close, it's one and the county. The kinetic sum of this one. Now, the another condition, so the integral of the sigma two positive, they rule out other things. So this is different. This should be locally as a local diffimorphism to the S2. So the both of the proof now use as a fully non-linear. So difficulty is here. So as I mentioned, so we consider the I mentioned so we consider the sigma 2 equal to constant, et cetera, equation. Then the ellipsoidity you should ask us which code scale code positive, sigma 2 positive. No, we actually have no sigma 2 positive, pointwise, pointwise positive. So we only integral positive or the integral satisfy this one. So we have no ellipticity. So this is a difficulty. So we can prove, so we can pull a little bit of. So we can pull a little bit at the end, we can prove in this two case at least, one exist sigma two positive, pointwise positive. From the integral positive, we prove the metric pointwise positive. Then it's easy to show this which curve positive, for example, they implied that H3. Only H. So okay, so I stop, I think.
