All right, two more to go. So the next one is Maggie Failey, and then we'll have Zhang Wei for the last one. All right, thank you. So yesterday we had a nice introduction to spatial downscaling, and today I'll be talking a little bit about temporal version of this for solar radiation data. Again, my name is Maggie. I'm a PhD student at the Colorado School of Mines. So, why solar radiation? Well, when we think about photovoltaic plants, like what we see here on the right, or P. Like what we see here on the right, or PB arrays. These plants have a lifetime of around 30 years, and researchers are working to increase the lifetime of these plants to 50 or more years. So across five decades, as we know, we might expect the climate to change as well as solar radiation. So we don't really know how cloud properties might affect incoming solar radiation in the next 50 years. And we'd like to maybe understand the future of this distribution as the climate changes. So we can infer this distribution from climate model output. As we know, climate model output. As we know, climate model output tends to be very coarse, spatially and temporally. For solar radiation data, we're looking at time scales across the order of days. But to model the PV power generation downstream, we'd like data that is maybe on the order of hours. So here we'll be working to downscale this daily data from the daily data to hourly data. And we'll be doing this using a diurnal template model. So, again, our goal is to build this. So, again, our goal is to build this relationship between our hourly data and our daily data for global horizontal radiance or GHI. And we can think of GHI as the sum total incoming solar radiation that is available to produce power using a PV array. We're using data from the National Solar Radiation Database across 23 years, and this data is housed and operated by the National Renewable Energy Lab. So, DHI has a nice kind of parabolic structure, like we see here, if it's really sunny. Um, if it's really sunny, so as the sun rises, you know, we have incoming solar radiation, we reach a peak solar noon, and then the sun sets. So, within our diurnal template model, we'll be kind of taking the basic structure of this and then adjusting it according to three parameters. Beta, which will shift the time of peak solar noon, alpha, which shifts our height of the profile. So, if it's really cloudy, you can imagine the height is fairly low, and if it's sunny, it's fairly high, and then tau adjusts for the length of the day. So, once we have So, once we adjust this profile, we get what we see here in the dashed line. So, these are our adjusted templates, and then we have two observed profiles that compare to these templates associated with their colors, black and red. So, with the red line here, we can see that the template kind of overall captures the structure of the observed line. However, this isn't true for the black observed line. This is an extreme case here where maybe it was sunny in the morning and then some clouds moved in and it was cloudy in the afternoon. Overall, the templates capture the Overall, the templates capture the average structure of these profiles, but there's obviously a lot of cloud properties or other things blocking the sun, some noise that isn't captured by this template. So moving forward, we'd like to be able to represent these cloud patterns or other blockers of the sun by adding, excuse me, adding some noise to the profile in a meaningful manner. So we'll be working to estimate some basis functions for these residuals. So we'll take away that template and look at the remaining structure. And look at the remaining structure and model the coefficients for these basis functions across space. And we'll be conditioning the model of these across space using daily average GHI along with some other covariates. So the spatial model for these coefficients is our classic spatial model. We have a fixed linear portion here that acts on the locations and then a matrix of covariates, including, as I mentioned, gi, elevation, and then past coefficients that we've already estimated. Estimated. We also have our spatial process here with the stationary covariance function and then our mean zero white noise process with the variance term tau. So to dive into how well our model is currently working, we implemented a sort of white noise test here. Ideally, we'll be seeing just white noise across our study location in California. The closest we get is in November for this U1 coefficient. But clearly, there's an additional structure across the space. So, particularly along the close. Space. So, particularly along the coast, there's some increased variability. Also, in California, if you're not familiar with the geography, we have some mountainous areas in the eastern part, and there's some additional variability there. And we can see kind of the central valley pretty clearly, as well as some areas in the southeast. So, we're not capturing all of the structure that we want quite yet with this model. So, moving forward, we need to add some additional covariates or some additional structure to this model to capture that that we're not getting right now. That we're not getting right now, and maybe explore some non-stationarity of the coefficients if needed. Although, ideally, we won't go there if we get the right numbers individually. So, thank you, and I'll see you at the poster session. Hopefully.
