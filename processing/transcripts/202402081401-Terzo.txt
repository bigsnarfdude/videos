I would like to thank the organizer for inviting me to give this talk. And it's very fun. It's your pleasure. Thank you. This work then speaks on prime, maximum, and radical exponential ideals. This work is in collaboration with the Paula Dapino de Antonio Fondacero. The study of exponential ideals seems useful to understand better the exponential rings because, as François remarked, Francois remarked that there is a correspondence between kernel of exponential morphism and the exponential ideal. Especially if we understand better, I mean, if we study maximal ideals, of course, maximal exponential ideals. And today I want to, I mean, it's natural to ask when we consider exponential polynomial. In particular, we see these prime maximum radical exponential ideas in exponential. Exponential years in exponential polynomial rings. So it is natural to ask if some properties are preserved, if classical results are true. Well, today I want to show that some classical, some properties are preserved from exponential ring to the e-polynomial ring. Unfortunately, many classical results fail in the case of the ring. Fail in the case of exponential polynomial ring as niderianity, Hilbert theorem, Besis theorem, Non-Stan and Sat, Segwart ring, and so on. And I want to concentrate on Nederianity. Later, I want to give the notion of exponential prime, maximal EIDRs, and in this case, we have two different notions of maximality. One, maximum. One maximal among exponential ideas, and the other notion which is maximal among ideals. And we see that these three notions are independent, as in the classical case. And at the end, I want to give the notion of irradical ideals, and I try to give the enhanced a characterization of exponential. A characterization of exponential radical ideas. Anyway, Francois introduced, George Geber, the construction of the e-polynomial ring. The construction was introduced by Van Denries and also by Mickey Tyn with many notions on exponential algebra. But I want to give some basic notions, especially on exponential partial rings. Exponential partial rings because it's useful in our context. I want to give a generalization of the construction of the polynomial ring for partial urinates. So we recall that the partial urine is a figure D V E where V is a quad. V is a quadrant V is a collector space subspace of V and E is the morphism from anti-group of V into multiple group of V. So starting by a partial exponential re. A partial exponential ring, we extend freely the exponenti on it in the following way. So we started by an exponential, a partial exponential ring, a partial free one extension of the partial unit. You mean is a triple where we have A is a co-vector subspace of D such that A intersect V is zero. intersect V is zero and D or T A is a D algebra. V prime is the direct sum of V and A. So in elements is V plus A, where B is V and A is A. So the exponentiation of V prime is E over V times D over A. Of A If A is a complement of V inside D, we call this D prime and we call just one free one free extension, free one extension. So, if we repeat this construction, we have the free completion of a partial of a partial being easily because we can define inductive E-B we can define You can find that a chain of a partial earrings where R0 is R and R n plus 1 is n plus 1 is the free one extension of Rn so this is for so in this way we can obtain the free one the free completion of a partial rings as the union of Rn This is a generalization of the construction of the polynomial ring. In the case of the polynomial ring, R0 is the polynomial, the classical polynomial ring over R. And so. Anyway, so we have this construction and we use a lot in the proof. But as I told before, we ask there are some properties that are preserved from the ring. Preserved from the ring, the exponential ring, to the e-polynomial ring. And very easy is that if, I think that Francois told, if this is a domain, then each polynomial ring overlap is a domain. Exponential domain. Are you okay? Okay. So this is an exponential domain, of course. The invertible elements in this case are invertible in our times in pure exponential terms. Anyway, a very interesting result is on the e polynomial ring. On the e-polynomial ring is the ALMOS factorization theorem. Rit was the first to give an almost factorization, now explain why ALMOS, an Almost factorization theorem for a special sub-ring of the E-polynomial ring over C over the convex field. In particular, reconsider exponential polynomials with just one iterational exponentially with the coefficients. Exponentially with the coefficient in the complex field. But later, many people extended this result to a larger class of exponential polynomials. There is a very general result of this factorization for group ring on the group is Toshofriabian group over a unique factorization domain. But today I want to recall the result. The result on the e-polynomial ring over an exponential field because we use this result in our context. And this theorem, this result is due to Enson rubble as singular. So if k is an exponential field And we consider an exponential polynomial in the polynomial ring over K, then F can be written, can be factorized uniquely up to An invertible element times a finite product of irreducible exponential polynomials and a finite product of exponential polynomial just one variable with this extra. Be K where Fi are irreducible and Gi over P to the Bi are exponential polynomials in one variable. And no B I are cool linear combination combination any B J where it is different from J. It is different from J. Almost because we have this finite product of a special exponential polynomial one virtual. For this reason, it's almost. Anyway, so this theorem implies a nice result for us, of course, which is the following. As a consequence, that the equal number of your things over K is the greater common device of the mean. So, any irreducible exponential polynomials is a prime prime element. And any irreducible exponential polynomial generates prime ideals as ideals. This is useful in order to characterize the exponential prime ideas with one generator. So we see later. Well, now we recall that if R is an exponential ring, any ideal I I oral is an ideal and for rule of E9 then E of half minus one is nine. As Francois remarked this is uh this condition is necessary to have the correspondence be between exponential ideals and the current. And the curve of exponential MOFI. Now, I want to give the notion of prime maximum exponential ideals. So, if I is an E ideal of an exponential ideal that I is E prime If it is prime as a vehicle that is R over R is a zero, we say that I is exponential maximum if is maximum. Maximum among the agents. And we see that I is a stronger maximum if it is maximum. It is maximum among ideas. So there is the obvious implication, strongly maximum E prime, E prime and E maximum. But later we see that this is the only relation because we have a technique to construct so we are able to produce many contract samples of E maximum at not T prime. Essentially we start by an ideal, we have the construction of An ideal, we have the construction of a deep polynomial ring. So we consider an ideal with some step, and we are able to extend with some properties. And we are able to extend this ideal to be an exponential ideas with the same properties. Later, I give the idea. Okay, now I want to spend some time to speak on Nedelianity, because it's natural to ask if Nedelianity holds. Is it true for any um union of co-prints? I think that it's a we need that case if you mean these results. Yes. The the factorization? I think that you can obtain also. I'm I am not sure, but probably you can. You can sure for K words. Making time in this paper about exponential algebra include that invert basis theorem fails. Fails for the e polynomial link over the complex theorem. The proof is very easy because C is median but the e polynomial ring null is not median. Because it is enough to consider the exponential ideas generated by point one minus one. This is not fine generative. So the situation for the complex field is very bad because it is not an abelian space respect to the exponential zero for this reason. Oh, just for this easel. As McIntyre remarked, the complexity is not not in space space respect to exponential the institute of order. This is easy because the zero set of ux minus one contain On chainsaw set on what has this chain and the shining and inactive. So for the reality is better because Dujerin nineteen eighty-six, I think, proved that R2N R2n is an idirian space with respect to the exponential Darisky topology. It's natural to ask if there is some measure of linearity. For example, for differential polynomial rings, this is true because there is a result of linearity doesn't work, but there is a version due to the pronunciation. Which says that if any differential radical ideas in a differential field, a differential rings Is finitely generated. So, in the polynomial, differential polynomial ring, any radical differential ideal is finitely generated. So, there is a version anyway. Differential random ideas the differential polynomial ring is finite and generic. So we try to do that. Unfortunately, we could Next the e-polynomial mean we will see does satisfy the SCC condition, the Schenning Chain condition for E prime and Elsa. Ideas so we don't add and Franz Wance proved that the ring, if we consider, I mean Stellensatz doesn't work, but there is a version of François Sérénon, and Hilbert also Hilbert being this is not. ring this is not an inverter ring this is approved by François Renou and we we relativized his notion to exponential ideas that is we proved that there exists a new Hibert ring means Hiber string means that any prime ideal strings are intersectional maximum ideals. We proved that there exists an exponential prime ideal which is contained exactly in one imaxima ideal. So it is not the intersection of imaxima ideals. So there exists my idea. P of which is contained in exactly one one maximum maximum area. Um if if I'm sorry. If I can say relax well unfortunately we have many negative results, but probably is nice to know. As I told before, there is no relation between among the notion of prime maxima and strong maximum. Because we are able to prove that, so E prime, E maxima doesn't prime doesn't price imply uh E prime yes, um Yes, I am thinking about. So, because if we prove the following, we consider always an exponential field and so there exists E prime E maximized. Yeah, actually, I suppose I want to give an idea, just an idea, because this is crucial, because this is a way. Is crucial because this is a way to construct a contract sample. So, how does your system related to that machine part? So, you have this that there is not ACC for E prime ID. He says there is no ACC altogether. I'll say again, please. So, how does it relate to that? Because, I mean, this says that this is an option. This is serious that this is not an Iberian, but we ask there is some version of it, but uh we don't have because also for uh differential polynomial ring it's no Niderian, but there is a version for differential ideals. So but we have we don't have a version. Essentially, we use we are working in this ring. We find We find a special ideal. In this case, in this particular case, we consider these ideals, which is an ideal of this sampling and this is a sampling of the people in a wearing over K. People in a lingover k. Okay? So the idea is this. We find these ideals as an ideal and we extend, this is a sub-ruling. We extend this to be an exponential ideals because essentially the free completion of this lingua is exactly the e polynomial lingua MK. This is in general it's not true, but for this particular subway. this particular subway. So we considered this as a an exponential ideal. So we add that there exists an immaximal ideal which contain properly Of course, p is not prime because if x squared is in p, so x is in p, e to the x minus 1 is in p and so we have 2 in p. And this is this is a or less the idea that we use in to give these contract samples. Again, we showed that there exists In prime angle which is not maximum sorry, E prime idea. Sorry, E prime ideal and the E maximum which is not a stronger maximum. So we need only to prove that E prime ideal are not the maximum, and later I will see. I will show you, but I want Show you, but I want to show that we have a characterization of exponential prime ideals with just one generator because we could if is an irreducible exponential polynomial. Then the E ideal generated by F is an exponential prime ideal. So the proof is very easy because a sensory Essentially, use the fact that K of X is greater common device or domain. And secondly, we extend, as I told before, we are able to extend any prime ideal to be an exponential prime ideal. So this is prime because this ring is a greater common. This ring is a greater common device of domain. So this is a prime if we extend it to be a prime. So I want to have a question. The natural question is: we have some characterization of in prime ideas finally generated. Of B prime ideas finally generating. We don't know. So I think this now I want to okay, quickly. T prime doesn't imply C maximum. implies a maximum. Because if we consider an irreducible exponential polynomial, irreducible and we suppose, we remember that this is a union of Rn. So we suppose that this is in some Rn but not in R0, is not the classical polynomial. A classical polynomial. So we know from this result that this is just one variable. This E prime. So if we take roots of f roots of f then we add that This P' ideal is strictly contained in the E ideal generated by x minus a and this is the E maximum. So it's properly contained because f of x is an optical polynomial. So there are no relations. But now I want to I want to focus on strongly maximal ideas because Yes. Well, we consider K in the field. We consider an empty plan in K. It's natural to study the set of exponential polynomials which which vanishes on A. A. Natural. And it's natural to ask: this is an exponential, here is maximum, what we can say about it. Well, it is easy to see that this is an exponential maximum. Maximum maximum. It is not so easy to prove to prove that for any A e to the A E to the A is the exponential ideal generated by x1 means A1, Xn means AN. So the natural question of this question, the strongly maximal ideas are all of this kind. Of course no. Of course no. I missed the what is the conclusion? This is no, this is a this is we know that this is a strongly maximum, we know this is of this kind, and this is a nice exponential ideal, no? So we ask every strongly maximum ideal sound. Maximal ideas are of this kind. No, of course, otherwise, we have the correspondence. But we prove that in this case we need that the field is algebraic of the field. So if It is an algebraic position with the cardinality greater than all, then there exists a strongly maximal ideal J. J and K of X such that J is not of this kind again the proof is not easy but the idea is the same the idea is Is I want just to show why we need the carbonality grader in this sorry and also it's um multi-variant stiffness. No, just for me. In some I mean, some proof we I mean in some cases we are able just to prove for one variable, as in this case. That's just a linear fact which is single linear. We actually have a stronger restructuring. Right? But you are reading other results, we think it's not easy. Here we need that the caser to be constituted and you wrote with me anyway. So what we can call X minus sorry, just Minus 3. Sorry, just one task for it's minus 0. Yeah. The idea would proof. So the cardinality is greater than omega, so the cardinality of the collinear basis is the same, K B collinear basis. So we can we denote in this way this certain for convenience so we consider this ideal the ideal generated by Y C means X means C where C in C versus in K. This ideal we can consider as an ideal of this particular of this particular summary summary of the epolynomial in a way K Okay, so this is an ideal and it is I mean we can prove I call this ring S so is it possible it is possible to prove that this is a field so J one is maximum and again And again, this is maximum. So, if we consider the free completion of this ring, this is exactly the e-polynomial ring. So, we extend this ideal to be an exponential ideal in the e-polynomial ring, which is strongly maxima. But of course, since contained is it is not of the kind A. A IA Okay, so we can extend so we extend the G1 to be in strongly maximum. And so J, of course, is the factor of A. This is the result. Okay, I have a little bit of time. Okay, just I want to introduce the radical ideas. This is on the maximal and prime ideas. Maximal and prime ideals to prove that this is a field. So Sorry, okay So we give the natural the natural notion of erraticas is the following if we consider J any ideas of an exponential ring Exponential meaning. The natural notion of the iradical of J is to be the intersection of E prime ideals which contain J. Yes. Okay, but I won't. Okay, but I want to show that with this natural notion we have that a classical radical ideas in the classical case when we put the exponentiation with this notion is not radical. The E ideal generated by X times Y is not radical because it is not the intersection of these not the intersection of these E prime and ELS because for example x times C plus 1 is in this intersection but not in this so another I mean of course we are we are interested to the ideal See the two ideal two exponential ideals in the e-polynomial ring. So when we consider j and the ideal of we want to give the notion of irradical. Of course, as Francois points out, when we look for When we look for a solution of exponential polynomials, we found it outside in an extension of the field. So for this reason, we consider F an extension of K of K. And we can see that an area. So we can define a V. Define V of F the elements in F such that F of A is equal to zero for all F in J and so we can define V over J as the union of V over F over J. Of B over F over J, where F are extensions, but it varies among extensions of K. So all these functions are there? Yes. So it is easy to prove that in this case, when you That in this case, when J is an E id of K of X, then the E radical of J is exactly, sorry, of course the E over J So we can have easily that the E radical of a J is a a subtlety, E over B over J. I have time to to give the operators. To give the operators. So, anyway, we are able to very quickly give a characterization of irradical ideas, introduce an operator. And we prove using, I mean, inductively, we consider a subset of the ring, we can define this as a union of. This is a union of and where E of 0 of x is the EID of created by x and n plus 1 of x is the n roots of the set of the elements in R such that the x is b one v2. V2 that V1, V2 is in the of X and A is in the radical n of X V1 intersect this. Anyway, we are able to introduce operators and we are able to prove that the irradicals of iradicus of J is exactly this operator. But I mean, we give also another characterization using a theories, but I mean, I don't have time to say about it. And just I want to otherwise it doesn't make sense. So, this is the sense of the etiquette. J is irradical if and only if for any a A, B1, B2 in all, we have that the product, if the product is J and A is divisible of J B one per second of J V two W A Z G. This is the characterization to see. This is the characterization to say that J is an exponential radical using these operators. Can I answer any sorry? I don't know the power series. If there is the embedding of the epolynomerine you are asking in the power series, right? Yeah. I don't know with the question. Probably yes, but it's a union of group rings. So it depends on the power series. No, no, no, useless. Exactly. Sorry. I have a very stupid question, but it's very. A very stupid question, but it's very intriguing that you agree to have like this class. But maybe there are very few contributions also at the time Vf of G is empty? Yes. No, but on what probably needed to look at You don't need to look at the bigger one. Yeah, what is the colour to move on? The same as the power, the field. So it's the usual tree. Yes, okay. Yes, and how do you check that that union is still a proper idea? Ah. Well, I can still check the one. This one you mean, right? No, I don't think the question. Any more questions? Presumed questions? I have one actually. So the maximum ones, do you have any characterizations in terms of what happens to the portions? Also, for the E prime, we are able to calculate as one. Why I want to see how that okay, there's no more question and let's thank using it. Any words you might have cost?
