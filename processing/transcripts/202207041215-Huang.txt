Very nice introduction. And I apologize that I cannot join in person. I tried, but for some reason, it never worked. But nonetheless, today I'm happy to share with you my somewhat recent work, a recent in the mean that it appeared not too long ago in the journal that I put it down here. This is a joint work with Adam Monaghan and Francis Rayer. Monaghan and Francis Rayer. And also, I'm happy to show the three out of four logo down below has to do with Canada. So the picket led by Francis and University of Victoria. And also I was a Cancy Sensei joint postdoc before I joined Clanson University. All right. So this is sort of the game plan of my talk. Plan of my talk. So, first of all, I need to tell you what I mean by concurrent extreme. So, it is a situation that several climate variables, for example, temperature, extreme, and so on, they experience extreme values simultaneously. And this topic has become a very, very active research area in the climate community. In this talk, I'm going to talk about one approach to estimate the To estimate the distribution of a concurrent string, and where the conditional approach is sort of clear from this equation here, which is the familiar condition decomposition formula you guys probably have seen if you have took the probability course. Specifically, in this talk, I'm going to focus on this red part because once we decompose this bivariate. Once we decompose this bivariate distribution, this part is well, there's an existing tool that addresses this part. So, therefore, in this talk, I will mainly focus on the red part, which is the estimation of conditional distribution, given that the conditioning variable being large. And in the last part, but not the least, I'm going to use the large initial condition. Large initial condition regional climate model ensemble that Francis used in the later part of his talk to do a couple of things. So, first of all, we are going to use that to illustrate the conditional approach. Specifically, we are going to estimate the concurrent wind and precipitation extreme. But moreover, the large initial conditional ensemble is very useful, not just to give you a better estimate in terms of extreme, it's also In terms of extreme, it's also useful as the testbed to assess the statistical performance between different methods. All right, so here I'm going to show you a couple of examples of concurrent extremes so you can see at least that two, more than two climate variables involved. So in the left-hand panel, you can see it's kind of a heat and drought happen simultaneously. And on the right hand And on the right-hand side, you can see there's a happy rainfall and strong wind speed happens simultaneously. This will be the application I'm going to focus on for this talk. All right, so this is the data set I'm going to use throughout the talk, although this is not the real data in a sense, it's coming from the large initial conditional regional climate model. And for this data set, I use a model grid cell, which is not too far away from Kelowna, I believe. So, this is the Vancouver grid cell. And we focus on the autumn time in terms of the model. Specifically, we focus on September, October, and November. In the excess access, we have a daily precipitation from that model, and the white axis, we have the Wednesday. In the climate community, so most often people will focus on estimating the occurrent probability of an concurrent extreme event. And usually how people define the occurrence of concurrent extreme event is that when both variables exceed a certain high threshold, and those thresholds are typically chosen as their respective high percentile. So in this case, High percentile. So, in this case, I add the 0.95 percentile for the precipitation and the wind speed. And so, essentially, the question people are going to addressing is estimating the probability that a data point will fall into this upper right corner, which is sort of like the situation where we have heavy precipitation and wind speed simultaneously. And one can also ask. And one can also ask me this probability for the present climate condition and the future climate condition to say something about the climate change with respect to the occurrence probability. So be able to estimate a current probability is useful, but it's not entirely satisfactory in the sense that in some application, we want to know a little bit more, not just whether a point happened within this corner, we want to be able to. Corner, we want to be able to say something about the tau distribution, in which I will make a little bit clear in the following slide. Okay, and again, so this is just a recap. So in this talk, I'm going to only focus on the simple situation where we only consider two variables. So in our application, we have daily precipitation and daily average wind speed. We have those two. Wind speed. We have those two variables, and the situation we consider is at least one of them being extreme. Because if none of them being extreme, there's no way it can be qualified as a concurrent extreme. So let's say we want to look at this joint distribution, in which I call this is the distribution of concurrent extreme of interest. This bivariate distribution can always be decomposed in this way, where we first look at the marginal distribution of x. The marginal distribution of x when x is large. And another part is we need to model this conditional distribution that is when the distribution of y given that x is large. And then we have those two seen together. So basically now we decompose the bivariate problem to two of the one-dimensional problem, which is usually easier to deal with than the two-dimensional problem. Okay, so first I'm going to talk about the Going to talk about the quantile regression master, how we are going to use the quantile, a class of quantile regression master to estimate this conditional distribution. Okay, so okay, so before I move to that, so let's do a very quick illustration about our approach. So again, here we have a two variable, and let's say x be the daily precipitation distribution. Daily precipitation distribution and Y be the daily mean wind speed distribution. So, first of all, last condition on the daily precipitation being large. And so, there are many ways we can define large or extreme mean. So, here for the illustration purpose, so let's say we are going to look at those annual maxima. So, meaning that for each year, I'm going to take the maximum value over that three months time. That three months time window. All right. So we further do that conditioning, and then for the wind speed value, so first of all, we extract those annual maxima precipitation value. And on the center, we extract the simultaneous wind speed level. And then we can have this scatterplot here. The first step, we need to be able to model the X, the marginal distribution of X, in which I make In which I make a histogram for that annual maximum daily presentation. And then here we do have some method to fit the distribution to this. But here's the question for those who are not necessarily very familiar with extreme value analysis. The question will be which distribution, so in particular, which distribution you use to fit the data? It turns out, based on a well-known result from the extreme values. Result from the extreme value series, which is called extremal type of series, first discovered by Fisher and Tipti almost 100 years ago. And this is sort of an extreme value analog to central limit series. And the idea is that for the extreme, we care about maybe the sample maxima rather than the sample mean. And we want to know whether know whether after we re-normalize this sample maximum, whether this one will converge to some distribution. And if that is the case, we can use that distribution as the statistical model to model the, for example, annual maxima. And it turns out that under suitable regularity condition, the sample maxima renormalized linear renormalized sample maxima would converge to a so-called generalized extreme value. So-called generalized extreme value distribution, GEV. So you have heard this term has been mentioned a couple of times in Francis' talk, which has three parameter. It has location and scale parameter. In addition, it has a shape parameter, and the shape parameter is very important in extreme value analysis because different shape parameters is corresponding to different kinds of a tail behavior. So one could have a heavy. So, one could have a heavy tail, or more like a power law tail behavior, or it could have a bonded tail, or it could have the exponential tail, depending on the shape parameter. I also provide an animation, but I'm not sure whether I will have time to go through this animation, but nonetheless, because I already provided slides in the repository. So, for those of you who want to actually play around with the extreme value series in this Extreme value series in this, like a little simulation example I provide, you can, yeah, yeah, you can definitely do that. So, let me go back to here. All right, so we only finished the first part, but still we need to deal with the second part, which is how to model the conditional distribution given that the conditional variable being large. So, specifically in this case, we are able to estimate the marginal distribution. The marginal distribution for the annual maxima, and then we can go ahead to estimate, let's say, the 50 years return, which is something like value at the risk in the financial application. All right. But we still need to be able to estimate this conditional distribution. So from this graph, you can think about depending on the x value here, we should have a distribution for the wind speed, and that condition. speed and that conditional distribution will be depend on the value right here as shown in the scatter plot because one can easily see the dependence between the wind speed and the annual maximum daily precipitation on the same day. So here I'm going to, before I introduce the method, I'm going to show you how I'm going to visualize the result. So one way to visualize the result to get some idea about the conditional distribution idea about the conditional distribution is by plotting several conditional quantile, which is what I did here. So most specifically here, I plot the five different quantiles levels. So I plot the conditional median, which is the 0.5 quantile, all the way to the conditional 0.9 quantile. And those are the estimated curve based on two different methods in which I'm going to describe. In which I'm going to describe. Okay, so next I'm going to describe those two methods we use. The first method is used a quantile regression because since we are going to sort of visualize or summarize the conditional distribution vis a collection of continuous conditional quantile. So it seems to nature to use a method from the quantile regression. So basically here we want to estimate several To estimate several quantile curves in order to give a discrete approximation of the conditional distribution. However, if we sort of do it naively, so if we estimate several different quantile levels separately, it's likely to lead to an issue so-called the quantile crossing, which means for a given conditioning value, we might end up with the situation that, let's say, conditional point. That let's say conditional point A quantile is actually greater than conditional 0.9 quantile, which is the problematic because it violates the very requirement for the quantile function. So therefore, we use the method, the monotone composite quantile regression neural network developed by Alex Kennel. We don't necessarily have to use this. don't necessarily have to use this particular method but really we are looking for is a method that we can fit the several quantiles together without having the quantile crossing issue another thing we want is that we want to estimate those quantile curve flexibly so therefore we want to be able to fit the non-linear quantile curve so that's why we use this one because it has a very nice our package go with it okay so this is the first approach Okay, so this is the first approach, and then the second approach is based on the conditional extreme value models proposed by Hafner and Tong in 2004. And the basic idea is that they make a sort of a parametric assumption on the location scale form for the conditional distribution after marginal transformation. So, let me just give a very high-level picture, but what you can think about. But one you can think about for those who are familiar with copular modeling, it sort of shared with some flavor of copular modeling in that, first of all, we are going to estimate each distribution separately, estimate their marginal distribution, and then transform them to a common margin. Unlike a typical Kaplan modeling here, people would need to transform to so-called the Laplace marginal, which is a distribution. Which is a distribution somewhat like exponential distribution, but for both positive and negative. So it's sort of like a double exponential that is symmetric at zero. Okay, so this is the first step to transform each marginal distribution to a common margin. And then the dependence modeling, which will determine the form of the joint distribution, will take this form. And just like a univary case, we have this. Like a univary case, we have this sort of normalization, although we are not necessarily going to do the linear normalization. But this class of model assumes that given on the conditional variable being large enough, this renormalized random variable will follow a certain distribution. And the dependence of this, the y tilde and the x tilde. Tilda and x tilde is only through this function, normalizing function, such as here. And in that paper, what they did is they look at examine the wide range of parametric COPO family, and they end up with the conclusion that this set of normalizing functions is flexible enough to be able to capture that conditional distribution, given that the conditional Given that the conditional variable being sufficiently large. So that description is still very abstract. So I decide to steal this illustration again by Haven, one of the authors for the conditional extreme value method to sort of further illustrate the idea for this class of model. So remember, here we have a function which takes this. function which take this linear form and we have a B function which takes this power form and so this is an example when the alpha is a positive number and the beta is an active number so why is that so imagine that this uh x direction although here it writes as y but let's pretend this is the x direction so it says that when the conditional variable increase you can see the load Increase, you can see the location for that distribution will increase. And know that we have a G distribution here. So this will be corresponding to the case that G is somewhat like a symmetric distribution, maybe a Gaussian distribution. But it does not have to be the case because we will estimate this base distribution non-parametrically, where the parametric part is those like a scale, a conditional dependent specification. So here, when the conditional variable increases, the location will increase linearly in that conditioning variable. And when the x increase here, the scale will decrease. So that will corresponding to the situation that beta is an active number. So therefore, the conditional distribution will become more and more concentrated. Okay. And so in practice, people would need to estimate alpha and beta parameter. Alpha and beta parameter under certain working assumption at the same time also estimate the g distribution and estimate them non-parametrically okay all right so those are the two methods that we consider and in terms of the data so thanks for uh francis talk i already covered most of it so we we are going to use the large initial conditional canadian Initial conditional Canadian regional climate model version 4. We have a certified ensemble members. So essentially, you can think about each ensemble member as a possible realization under certain climate condition. We only use the first 50 years of data so that we can make the problem a little bit simple: that we assume that within that period, the joint distribution of the wind speed and wind direction, they are affected. Direction they are approximately stationary, and we are going to focus on the location in which we'll receive some data from that location, which I call the Vancouver Gwiesel. Although I need to clarify that this resolution is about 50 kilometers, so it sort of represents that region, not necessarily has to do specifically with a point location. And so each Uh, each ensemble member can be treated as a statistically independent realization for the underlying climbing system, so which allows us to do a couple things. So, first of all, because now we have sort of a certified type larger data set, so we should be able to estimate the trend more accurately. So, that's one thing. Another thing is that we can actually treat those individual ensemble members as sort of a Monte Carlo. Sort of a Monte Carlo simulation, although we use the physical base, we are not using the Monte Carlo in which it requires us to assume the statistical spatial temporal statistical property, which is very, very challenging. Here, we just use the physical base to come up with something like multicolor simulation. So, therefore, we can use this large ensemble to assess how well the statistical procedure works. In particular, we can compare. We can compare between those two methods we just introduced. All right. And here's just a quick recap. So, here, in order to implement our conditional approach. So, first of all, we are going to estimate the marginal distribution for the annual maxima in which we fit the generalized extra value distribution. So, with the large ensemble, we can actually estimate because now we have much less sample. Because now we have much less sampling variability. So now we can actually estimate this distribution reasonably well. We can go ahead to estimate, let's say, 50 years return level and also come up with the estimation uncertainty as shown here. And next, we are going to apply both method, the first method, monotone composite quantile regression neural network, quantile regression-based method, and the conditional extreme value model. Model and then so for each method we are going to plot the uh their conditional quantile curve start from the conditional median to conditional 0.9 quantile curve. And at the same time, we also provide the unconditional quantile, which are those five horizontal lines. So here you can clearly see because the dependency, you can see those unconditional quantile curve, they are sustained. Conditional quantile curve, they are substantially larger than their conditional counterpart, which highlights the importance of dependence modeling. So, and also for those curves, perhaps not surprising over the curve showed increasing pattern because we see qualitatively the positive dependent structure. But those models allows us to do the quantitative estimate for each quantile curve and the And the secondable, another thing I want to make is that you can see the conditional curve and unconditional curve, they are substantially different. So, for example, if we focus on the situation when the precipitation being the value of its one in 50 years value, you can say there's a huge discrepancy between the conditional quantile for the wind speed compared to the unconditional quantile. So, that means maybe the implication is that the The implication is that the implied wind low will be substantially deepened, it will be much, much higher, which could be very important for the building design. Okay, so in extreme value analysis, having the point estimate is definitely not the end of story, particularly for extreme value analysis, because usually one will have a limited data set. So it is equally important to quantify the estimation uncertainty in addition. Certainty in addition to the point estimate. And so, here, because we are going to estimate the curve, so here is one example that how we can actually estimate the point-wise uncertainty for the 0.9 conditional quantile. So, in this case, the large ensemble also helps in a way that we can use what I call the ensemble bootstrap. And the idea is that we are going to do the bootstrap, but we Is that we are going to do the bootstrap, but we want to preserve the spatial and spatial temporal dependent structure as much as possible since we can reasonably treat each ensemble member as the independent realization. So we simply just resample those ensemble as a whole so that we can preserve all the spatial and temporal dependent structure. And doing that would be quite straightforward. So basically, we just do the bootstrap resample to come up with another bootstrap large ensemble, and then we kind of Trap large ensemble, and then we can apply the procedure again. And then to come up with the pointwise confident interval for the curve. Another point I want to make is that because the quantile regression method we use here, in a sense, have some non-parametric flavor compared with more of parametric or semi-parametric flavor of a conditional extreme value approach. So that you can see if you look. So that you can see if you look at the pointwise confident interval, especially when the conditional variable being large and large, we tend to see the estimation uncertainty will be larger for the non-parametric approach compared with the parametric or semi-parametric approach. Lastly, I want to show you a bit about the use of large ensemble to compare different statistical matters. Different statistical matter. And the idea is quite simple. So, here we treat the fitted conditional quantile. Here we look at the highest conditional quantile we consider using old ensemble member together as the truth. Although it's probably not exactly as the truth, but that's the best we can do because we have now the much, much larger data set. So we can estimate this one much, much better than we have a smaller sample size. And then we are going. And then we are going to come up with the truth, and then we are going to apply the method, each method to each individual ensemble. So that way, for each method, we have a certified estimate. And then we're going to compare those certified estimates with respect to the truth and use that to assess the statistical performance. So, in this case, I actually show the three different locations. So, NW is the location. So, NW is the location I showed you previously to sort of try to show a little bit of spatial generality. We also explore the spatial diversity by looking at several different locations. So the sea here and also different seasons. So sea, they know the continental interior. So somewhere in the middle of the contiguous United States and southeast, which is a location along the Floralida Coast. Along the Floralida coast. We have, for each location, we have a two-box plot. And then, so for each case, you can see it seems to suggest a conditional extreme value model, at least for those three locations we look at. And for the model, large initial conditional sample we look at, CEV seems to do a better job of estimating high-upper conditional quantile when the conditioning value. quantile when the conditioning variable being large because the box plot the center is closer to the truth and with the smaller variability and the right hand panel is just the normalized version to give you some idea about the sampling variability in terms of a percentage for example here it will be like within uh like 20 overestimate and underestimate and so on okay so Okay, so this is actually the logic ensemble can allow us to do many different things as you also see in the Francis talk. And this is one thing we can leverage the logic ensemble to say something more about the methodology. So it seems to suggest that at least in this case, it's probably better to use the parametric or semi-parametric approach rather than the entirely non-parametric approach. So let me try to wrap up. So, let me try to wrap up very quickly here. So, in this work, we explored a conditional approach to estimate the concurrent wind and precipitation extremes. So, in addition to say something about occurrent probability, we can actually estimate the distribution. And I also demonstrate that the logic initial condition climate model ensemble is very useful, not just to give Very useful, not just to give a better estimate, but it will also allow us to evaluate the statistical performer. Obviously, there's more important questions that I haven't addressed. So one thing which is not necessarily straightforward is how to do things in the non-stationary world. Because what happens is that you now need to model the non-stationarity, not just for each individual variable, a more difficult part. Variable, a more difficult part is how to estimate the potential tight dependence structure for those variables and under the concurrent extreme situation. Another thing is what we did here is we basically just fit the model location by location, which does not necessarily be the bad idea, but given that the physical process tend to be highly spatially correlated. Related. The spatial extension seems to be natural to borrow the information across space to improve the estimation, although it will heavily depend on how you actually borrow the strength so that you won't introduce additional bias. So the paper can be found in this link, and I also provide the code. So in case you are interested to explore the idea, the methodology, maybe to different contexts, I also put the example code to. Put the example code to my GitHub repository. I have one more slide because I feel like, although I'm not directly doing the financial risk, although one of my students recently explored that, I want to maybe just provide a one minute very quick throw some point, maybe try to help for the discussion. So, first of all, that's a very nice review paper by Natalie. Unfortunately, I cannot attend in person. Otherwise, I want to check with you. Otherwise, I want to check with you. But that's a very nice review paper here. A few things I'm thinking about is that in this conditional approach framework, that might be useful to look at a few aspects. So the couple thing I list here. So one thing is called the marginal expectation for and another is the conditional value at the risk. More detail can actually be found in this paper and maybe in Talit's talk. And also, there's something I also know relatively little, but I guess that. Relatively little, but I guess that some people in the audience would know much better. So that's something called the weather derivative. So there seems to be some topic that seems to have integration for both climate and the risk modeling. And the last point is very, very less clear to me because I'm not sure because in the climate system, we have, we are, because we have some knowledge about very, very complicated physical system. So we can come up. Physical system, so we can come up with the logic ensemble. I'm not sure whether this is something we can achieve, but in a sense, that in a financial modeling, a lot of people use the Gautch title modelings. I don't know whether people can come up with something like a Gauch-like stochastic differential equation or things like that. All right, so I will leave here, and I hope I must not go over time too much. Thank you very much.
