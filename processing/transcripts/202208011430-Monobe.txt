So let's start this afternoon session. Our first speaker is Professor Arunori Monovi from Osaka Metropolitan University. And he will talk about the singular limited problems of mathematical models related to invasive alien species. Thank you very much. So first of all I would like to thank the organizers. Like to thank the organizers for giving me an opportunity to have a talk in this next conference. So, I'm really happy to be here. So, this is the first time to visit Bank. So, I'm just joining. So, today we would like to talk about some mathematical models relating to invasive alien species. But the mathematical ideas we treat kind of the single individual. Kind of the single unit problem called pass over the two unit problem. So before doing before introduce my main results, so we would like to talk about the mathematical model. So this is a joint work with Professor Hiroshimi Zuhara and Chang. So in this talk, we would like to focus on the To focus on the invasive alien species, which is a kind of the plant and animals. And they are not native and come from the outside countries and possess a competitive advantage over the native and they often bring incredibly damaging concepts for the new environment. So the example. So the example is the Grayscale, Storm Morocco, and America Meek, and so on. But of course, it features depend on the situation. So their guy is a nice guy. But sometimes bad guys. So this problem is very serious in many countries. Many countries. For Canada is also this serious problem. So, to protect native species, each government or countries attempt to control invasive Indian species by using a local national budget. And of course, as you know, as like COVID-19, the border control is very important. But in general, we cannot avoid such a situation. Such a situation. So, in this talk, we would like the situation after invasive variant species and then how to control the spreading of invasive species. So, one of the measures to control is to set several traps in habitats or alarm of the invasive area species. For instance, Species, for instance, cage traps and food snares, and poison bites, and bent on and so on. But here in this talk, we call all of them together traps. And the purpose is to propose a very simple toy model and ready to control invasive area species and consider how to store. How to stop or slow the invading by invasive area species. So, this is our motivation. So, let's consider the mathematical model. So, assumption. So, in this model, we want to consider the spreading of the invasive radial species. But here, we also consider the effect of the nature. Consider the effect of the native species. So, native species is moreover, we assume that the native species compete the investigating species. This is a situation called this is one of the situations. So, this these aren't the this aunt from the outside country and this guy is uh This guy is a native species, and this honey is trust, so namely the poison. So, we want to consider this situation. And assumption two, traps are initially disturbed around the habitats of alien species. And assumption three, the location of a traps is initially. Of traps is initially fixed and do not add traps later. So, of course, we can consider this situation, but for simplicity, we assume that this situation. And assumption 4, the effect of traps is independent of the location and time. Of course, the honey is a kind of food, so the honey gets worse. Get worse, worse, worse as time passes, but here we do not see such a situation. So, the effect is independent of location time. And assumption five is when the invasive area species are caught in traps, then the traps are exhausted. So, namely, the both density of invasive area species and traps decrease and become zero. Decrease and become zero immediately. So, this point is important in this talk. So, immediately, these two components become zero. Under assumption six, the traps do not detroit unless the species caught. So, under this condition, we want to consider some mathematical model. So, in order to explain the mathematical model, so let's u be the population density over u. Be the population density of invasive species, and V is native species, W is the traps, the omega is vision. So this is our situation that we want to consider. Then, so let's consider the evolution equation of the W. So, according to the above assumption, The above assumption. So we assume that the trap satisfies the ordinary differential equations and G1 is the non-negative and G2 is also non-negative. And because we assume that we do not add traps later, and traps do not increase by themselves. So basically the traps increase as sorry traps achieve the initial situation or decrease. And moreover the function d1 needs to satisfy the following four conditions. So d1 is positive in this set. But f1 is as a region of the positive of u and w. So namely, so this condition means that Namely, so this condition means that if the invasive area species encounters the traps, then the traps must increase a decrease. So the disenlightened side must make up only this head satisfy this function. And G1, ah, okay, so G1 is equal to zero in this. zero or in this set means that the invasive alien species does not encounter the trap does not caught be caught in the trap so the trap does not decrease the keep the situation uh keep the maintain the situation so the right hand side without from this uh consideration uh we assume We assume that the trial satisfies this. So, what is a typical example of G1 and G2? For instance, we can take this one. So, you can easily check that if the U posing, a W posting, then G1 is positive. And U times W is 0, E1 is 1 is W. And so how about the operation equation of the function u and p. So here we employ the local particular equation and the competition. So these two species compete and we assume that these are A lot of the recommendation system. But in this talk, we have to use the effect of the trials. So we add this reaction time, T1, D2. The typical example of F1T is like this. So, combining these equations, we obtain the following partial differential equation. So, two partial differential equations, and one is Differential equations, and one is ordinary differential equations. And the next remark is important. So, as I said in the previous slide, we assume that when the invasive alien species are caught in traps, these traps are exhausted. So, immediate exhaust. So, this means that the effect of the But the effect of this last term are very strong. So if the U times W or B W is positive, then the effect of this reaction is very strong compared with diffusion term or another reaction term. So here, it is natural that we assume that K is very large. So from this situation, we a natural We naturally encounter the following question. If the k is equal to infinity, then how behave the solution of u v w of the problem p k? So for this question, we answer some question. We answer the yeah so okay so now from now we want to consider the singular limit problem program PK. Program PK. In order to emphasize the dependence of the parameter K, so we define UK VKWK by the solution of PK. And then, so we obtain the following existence of solutions. So PK uh sorry, the initial data satisfies this condition. So this condition is a little bit aristic, but uh At least tweak it. But yeah, this condition, so somebody feels that this condition is real, but that this condition is important. So this means that the support of the function u and w are segregated completely. And also that v, as a support of v and w are segregated. Then, so there is this uh solution, uh we can guarantee the existence of solution for problem PK. Of solution for urban PK. The topology is like this. And so, how about the limit cases? Then we obtain the following result. One is there exists a sub-sequence uvw and the limit function u star 3 star w star. This function satisfies these properties. Properties and limit the function satisfy these segregate conditions. This is uh similar to the initial conditions. And the third one is the limit function satisfies the integral equation. But so if but we cannot it's a little bit difficult to imagine that what how behavior the How behave the negative function u beta. So, because so this is the reason why because this is the weak form of the some tribal. So, the next slide we explained the strong form of this limit function. This is a strong form. Okay, so assume that the limit function that the limit function u star v star is smooth and moreover as a the support of u star and v star is smooth and omega 2 is a support of the w stream so so namely yes then so we assume that these two regions are smooth then the limit function Then the limit function W star. W star is a trap. A trap maintain the initial condition in omega 30. So this region of course depends on, I change the shape, depends on the time. And the limit function used at this omega 1. This is habitats of the investment species and native species. And these two three functions satisfy the four. Three functions satisfy the following three bucks. So yeah, so U and B satisfy its total quality equation in this region. So Q T1 is in this region. So omega 1 over T. So when I explained this problem, so some people told me that is this a two-phase one problem? JS is no problem. Is one problem, the other is two. So the difference point is that this problem is one phase, but these two components stay in the same phase. So this is a different point compared with two phases to one problem. And on the boundary, U V is zero and motion is controlled by this law. So this is called So, this is called the step one condition. So, the limit function satisfies this requirement for numerical result. So, here, okay, so upper row, sorry, this is a parameter setting, and then here is a k is very large. Large in this simulation, the 1500, and you 0 D0W0 like this. So, this red line stands for the inbase area species, and blue line stands for the native species, and the green line stands for tropes. Then, how behave this partial differential equation. So, here is a free. So the here is a free boundary. Then so in this uh parameter settings, so invasive alien species are stronger than native species, native species. So this situation occur. So interestingly, so the first at the first stage, these two functions, the monodong, but after time passes, the one species, the monodong, but the other species, monotone, but the other species no monotone. As far as check uh numerical simulation, so this situation occur. So if we change another situation, so this situation often occur. So this is an interesting point for this result. But we have no result for this equation. So maybe the solution composes to the Maybe the solution composes this type of tracking wave solution, but so far we cannot find existence tracking solution of this type. So finally, we want to consider the relay we want to talk about the relationship with other mathematical results. So one is a fast only action limit. Fast reaction limit. So our result is based on the fast reaction limit problem analysis, and the idea of the proof is derived from the heat force, eta, and omega and lambda. And okay, so what is the newest point? The existence result on the fossil reaction limit for so far are the So far, the free boundary problems are composed of one phase, one component, or M-phase, M-component. But our result can treat M-phase plus N component, V-bound problem. So this is, I think, this is the advantage of our search. And actually, so this problem is deeply related to the fish as the company. Deeply related to the Fischer-Seppan problem. So, Fisher-Sepan problem is originally studied by Dudu, Professor Du, and Lin in 2010, and also independently, so Professor Mimura and Yamada Yotstan in 1986. So, Fish has one problem is very uh related deeply related to the fashion reaction being called uh uh reaction diffusion system. Uh reaction diffusion system. So, how how what is the relationship uh with our problem? So, our limited problem pista is the same as a feature scrum proposed by Gu, Johnson Go, and Lu Michael. And if we drop a native species, P, or if you want to drop the invasive alien species, U is okay. Okay, so either one is okay. Fine, yeah, so as you like. So, anyway, so if we dropped one component, then our limit problem is that we can one-phase Fischer Sephardic problem. So, from this result, I think that our result mean that the Fischer-Sefant problem is able to explain as a mathematical ability. Mathematical, a very simple mathematical model of the controlling invasive variance basis. And also, okay, so finally, we want to answer the first question. So, how to stop or slow the spreading of invasive variant species in the limit problem in star? Start. So for simplicity, we here assume that let d is equal to 0 and 1d. Then the limit from P star becomes the following, the free boundary. So reaction term, sorry, so this is a concrete example, but yeah, reaction term like this. And this is a step one condition. And this is a second condition. So, how to stop or slow? So, by using the result of Professor Du and Lin, actually we can say the following thing. So, suppose that if the habitants of the initial the S0 okay so the initial region S0 is S0 is bigger than this body, but this is the diffusion rate and the reaction term. Then the C boundary goes to infinity and the function u converges to 1A over b. So this means that we have no chance to stop or slow the invasive area species. But if the lesion The region, initial region, is very small. So, namely, very small. Then, there exists a critical value in star. Such is that if the this value, so d over w 0 is smaller than this value, then so the uh function u converts into 0. Otherwise, uh s occur, the splitting occur. Occur, the spreading occur. So, from this, from the result of do and then we can say that also. So, this is a result of the 1D case, but for 2D or highly dimensional case, then please see the result of the DU, Professor Doo and Professor Motano, and 1, 2040. And for the P is not equal to 0, the increase. Is equal to zero, then please see the result of the professor and so and from this result we can say that if we can succeed early detection of the invasive alien species so this means that we can find the yeah yes so anyway so we can we can succeed architecture with this event we have a chance to control it We have a chance to control the base medium species by using our simple model. Thank you very much for listening. So you are limited for U star V star. Yes. So U star V star always have the same supporting set. Yes, yes. So because if yeah, because U sub V star satisfies a reaction diffusion system and the equation includes a diffusion term. So if the support is different, so after the passes, then the After the passes then uh the support become the same. Uh do you have an expression for view star? Sorry. Do you have an expression for the view star in the last the the critical a mu star? Yeah, do you have uh like astronomics for it or a formula for it or something? Formula. So you mean the exact part? No, that's exactly paying on the initial functions. Yeah. Initial functions. Yeah. Okay. One reason I ask is: you know, it might be interesting to see what happens when S0 versus young star dependent stuff. I also want that why this value factor is. So from this result, I can say that. That I can say that so if diffusion length is very small, it's okay, or the traps is very strong, then so we have a trap to control. But I don't know. Maybe open this open program. Sorry. Relate me to the evil question. You said that supposedly you start with the same. Start with the same. Yes. Sorry. If support used. Use the and visa is the same. Sorry. Support. Support of USA. Yes, used and visit. Even though the support of USA and Vista are the same, we cannot prove the visa. Oh, you see that? Okay. Yes. So differentiation is okay. After the so immediately the So, immediately become the same support. Can you prove me? At least our paper is, we assume that the support is the same. But different situations we do not treat our paper. But at least uh as far as I check numerical simulation, so immediately the support becomes the same. So, mathematically it's maybe okay and the same. So you've noticed things become I think we have uh thirty-five minutes perhaps tea break. Then we started with thirty five minutes. We started at 35.35. Then it is online workshop. Just for the online participant, if you could just turn your camera on when you're ready, we'll come into the online picture in like a second. Sure, second. Of course, you guys will have some coffee tonight and for some Spanish online participants only or I think we should finish with John, yeah.  Perfect when people are joining, we're just gonna give it a letter maybe another minute to see if anybody wants anybody else wants to join. Okay, it's not the same as the system. Already? I think that must be pretty much it. So once, I believe, should be okay. Everybody looks pretty great. You put in your room as well. So the first picture will be in The first picture will be in three cubes. One. I'll try. That stands bear with me for a sec. I'm going to take another one. In again. Three, two, one. Oh, sorry, we got a song drawing in the last minute. Perfect. Once more. In threes, the two and one. Beautiful. Thank you, Jandy. Okay. Thank you. Okay, thank you. I don't know if it's blocked.    Exactly.
