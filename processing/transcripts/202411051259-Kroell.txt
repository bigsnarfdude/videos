Pleasure to introduce our first speaker this afternoon, Marissa. Krog, wonderful. And she's going to talk about the idea in perception for people partial reduced cross products. All right, thanks, William, for the introduction, and thanks for the organizers for having me here and letting me speak. So that's joint work with Matt and Camilla. And so before we get into the details, let's just talk about the main philosophy. Let's just talk about the main philosophy. So, we have like a discrete group acting partially on a Uindo-C-star algebra, and what we want to do is we would like to identify dynamical properties that give desired C-star algebraic properties, and in particular regarding the ideal structure. And so the specific question that we want to answer is: if we have G acting partially on A, we have like canonical C-star inclusion of A sitting inside the partial reduced plus product, which Partial reduced cross product, which is just a larger C-star algebra encoding these partial dynamics. And so we want to find a dynamical property that characterizes the L-deer intersection property that David already mentioned yesterday. So for any non-zero ideal in the reduced cross product, we want that A sort of like sees this ideal and has also non-zero intersection properties. And so just to get everyone on the same page, well, what are partial actions? So So, well, let's start first with a little bit of a history of this problem. So, in the global action case, this was started in the 90s with Karamura and Toniyama. They gave a condition for the ideal intersection property to hold for computative C-style algebras. And there's a large gap in between, but I'm omitting some stuff. So, Kennedy and Schaufauser then in 2019 did like a sort of back-and-forth characterization of the ideal intersection property for reduced number. Property for reduced non-cumulative cross-products under some homological obstruction. And for partial actions, we have a lot of results going one way. So if we have a certain non-triviality condition, then we get the ideal intersection property. For example, Excel, Marcelo, and Quig, they show that a topological free partial action on commutative C-star algebras, those have the ideal intersection property. That this was generalized by Levedev to how commutative C-star algebras and also Star address and also Jordan and Zirokovsky, they give another condition that guarantees their dealing to sexual competition. And so, what we would like to do is we would like to find a non-triviality condition that sort of gives like a back and forth characterization under some like condition similar to like the Kennedy and Shaka's work. And to get a little up to speed, like what are partial actions, so I would identify myself as like groupoid adjacent, so this is sort of like a pipeline to group points. So, this is sort of like a pipeline to groups, but I'm not quite there yet. So, bear with me. So, if we have like a global action, so we have a discrete group acting on a compact house source space, we have like this homomorphism from G into the homeomorphisms. In principle, if you give me an invariant set, I could go ahead and restrict all of these homeomorphisms, and you still end up with a proof action. And so, a partial action happens if we want to restrict to something that's. Want to restrict to something that's not invariant. And so now, all these group elements they just move around parts of you. I guess you can use the laser point now. So they just move around parts of you, but they don't necessarily have the same domain encoding. And so we kind of need to be a little bit careful of when we can compose things. But in principle, we started with a group action. And so if it makes sense to apply G, and if we started in the correct spot, H and then G should be the same as H. And we can. And we can actually write this down as like axioms. And so now a partial action is given by a family of open sets and a family of star isomorphisms between, or homeomorphisms between these sets. And we have these three properties. So the first one is just the identity element does nothing. That one's fine. And the next two are just telling you that if composition makes sense, it does exactly what you want it to do. And this is just a complicated way to write that down. Is a complicated way to write that down. And you can actually show that a partial action on a topological space always arises from a global action as a restriction. So if we are in a topological space setting, we basically just get these restrictions. We are interested in partial actions on C-star algebras, and so we can just apply Graphon duality. And so what we see is like our open sets, they correspond to two-sided ideals, and then our homeomorphisms become just star isomorphisms between these ideals, so partial stars. Isomorphisms between these ideas, so partials to automorphisms. And the axioms are just the same as before. And the interesting thing is that now we don't have that, we just get restrictions. So in this case, not every partial pseudo-dynamical system arises as a restriction of a global action to a unitable ideal. That already goes wrong in the commutative setting because if you move to this globalization, you sort of lose house-dorfness. And that sort of breaks this. But we have a nice characterization. We have a nice characterization. So, if each of these ideas is unital, then we can construct globalization. It's actually if and only if. And so, the cross product is similar to just the group action case. So, we really just want a larger algebra that encodes the action in A itself. And what we can do is we can just look at the completion of the covariance algebra. So, we have these group elements that index the u, and then our a just needs to be in a corresponding code of. Just needs to be in a corresponding codomain of the component. Yes. It's like a stupid question. But if the ideal is unital, then it doesn't have to be a unit. No, it's just there is like a projection that implements it. But the projection is not necessarily. It's not a unit in the B algebra. Yes, thank you. Okay. Good question, though. So for this cross product, so we have like that this, these are not all in A, but we have These are not all in A, but we have like these partial isometries basically like influencing the action. And what do I mean by this? So, just in the group case, all of these US's would be unitaries, and the A's would live in all of A. And then our multiplication between the two elements is just we twist the second factor a little bit by S. We can't do that in the partial setting because we can't necessarily apply S to B. So we kind of need to push B into the corresponding ideal. B into the corresponding ideal, and then everything works out. So it just looks a little bit more complicated, but it's basically the same philosophy. And so, what we want to know is when does A detect ideals in this algebra? And now, as I said, it's like a pipeline to group points. So, we can define from a partial action like the transformation group point. And so, it's just a triple of like it's x, g, and y. y needs to be in the domain of g and then y needs D, and then y needs to be mapped to x. And I tell you this because people in this room already have like a characterization of the ideal intersection property group points. So Kennedy, Kim, Lee, Raum, and Gorso. And in particular, for this transformation group, this would be kind of covered by this in a certain setting if G is topologically transitive. I won't go into details of this. There's more. There's people in here that are experts on this. There's people in here that are experts on this that can answer questions about. All right. And so what would we like to do? So what we want to do is we want to kind of like use the same philosophy as Kennedy and Schafaza do and also Camilla talked about yesterday. We would like to use injective envelopes. So you have this nice inclusion of A sitting inside an injective envelope, sitting inside the G injective envelope. And these two are very nice and have nice structure. And so we want to work with these two. To work with these two. And so, what do I mean with nice structure? Well, they are ejective, so we can allow for extension of maps. So, for I of A, we can extend UCP maps, and for Ig of A, we also have equivalence, and then they're also monotone complete, so there's lots of projections. As Kimola said, they sort of behave like a phenomenal algebra, so we have lots of nice properties that we can work with. But they still remember the original algebra. And so, what we also have for global actions, what we can show is that we have that. What we can show is that we have that A sitting inside A cross G has the idea intersection property if the same thing holds for I of A sitting inside of I of A cross G and the same with Ig of A sitting inside Ig of A cross G. And so what we would like to do is we would like to do this for partial actions. The issue is we don't have Ig of A. So we don't necessarily know what this object should be. And so the first thing that we need to do is we need to construct a partial gene injective envelope. And so we need to figure out what the appropriate category is. We need to figure out what the appropriate category is. And so, one nice thing that we realize is that if we have a partial action, we can move to an induced partial action on the gene injective envelope, and this one will always be unital. So we get units, like central projections in the injective envelope, that implement our ideals. And we can also show that A sitting inside A cross G has the ideal intersection property if and only if the same. An intersection property if and only if the same thing was phi of a. And so the upshot of this is we can work with unit or partial actions, which makes things much easier. In particular, we can define our morphisms just as UCP maps that preserve the units and have like this intertwining condition of vector variance whenever it makes sense. And with this, what we can show is if we start with a unit of partial action, there exists a gene injective. There exists a gene injective envelope in the category of generalized partial actions. So we have to do a little bit more technical work. You don't need to worry about it because, in the end, what you end up with is, again, a partial action. So when we get this, we really get like bona fide ideas in IG of A, and they will also be unital. And in principle, we can define this for a non-unital partial action by just defining it as the G-injective envelope of like this injective unitization. What do you mean by generalized special action? So it's just instead of having ideals, you move around hereditary sub-algebras that are particularly nice. So it's not just any hereditary sub-algebra. Kind of like how if you want to deal with injective C-star algebras, you really want to work with a category of operator systems. You need to enlarge the category even though you're really interested in C-star algebra. Yeah, also in the C-star algebra case, in the end, you work with the category of operators. You work with the category of operator systems, but in the end, the injective operator system is isomorphic to the C-star algebra. So we're fine in the end. Alright, and so the only other thing that we need to sort of figure out, so we have a toolbox now, and so now what we need to figure out is, well, what is the non-triviality condition in graft? And so in the cumulative setting, what we basically want is we want there to be no fixed points in a way. And so now fixed points doesn't really make sense in a way. Fixed points doesn't really make sense in a non-community setting, so we want no inner part, since we also want, we don't want these trivial isomorphisms. And so, what we first need to define is what it means to be inner, and this is exactly the same as what you would expect just from an automorphism, except now we have like a partial isometry that implements this partial star automorphism. And if we pick the partial isometry in the injective envelope, then we will call this quadrane. We will call this quality in. And so the good news is: in the injective envelope, if you have a partial star automorphism, this splits into an inner part and into a non-inner part. And so on the injective envelope, what we can do is we can define what it means to have no inner part. And this is exactly the non-triviality condition that we're after. So we call a partial star automorphism properly outer. If, if you look at the corresponding extension to the injected envelope, that one has moved out. Envelope, that one has moving up. And then again, the whole partial pseudo-dynamical system will be properly outer if each of these alpha g's is properly outer, assuming g is not the identity. And so we get proper outerness sort of by default. If the two injective envelopes have trivial intersection, then this will be automatically properly outer. And you can also think of it as like if it is quasi-inner, then what this already forces you to. Then, what this already forces you to have is that the two injective envelopes are actually the same. So, proper outerness moves ideals far away, and innerness sort of gives you that the ideas have to be the same. That's how you can think of it. What do you mean by that inner section? That is true in principle. No, but we start with two ideas in I of A. So, this is realized in I of A. Is realized in I of A. So B and C are ideas in A, and so I of B and I of C both live in I of A. If you started with the action, say AG is contained in AH, so these are ideals and this can happen, I guess. But if the action is properly almost, then the I of A of G does never intersect the I of A of H. No, it's this is just like this just means that if you have this, you get proper outerness, but this is not the only case where you get proper outerness. So you can't have that they are sort of like ah, okay, yeah, sure. It's just like the easiest thing to check for proper outerness. And so the theorem that we end up getting is that if we start with a partial C-set dynamic of the system, then if the action on the G-Jackeref algal is properly outer, this will have the ideal. This will have the ideal intersection property. And additionally, if we have something called vanishing obstruction, then the converse is also true. So, if you start with the ideal intersection property, you will get a proper outer action on the gene-injective form world. Fortunately, we need this vanishing obstruction because, in principle, this is not true in general. And the proof of this relies on an equivariant version of pseudo-expectations that David also introduced last and so, what is this vanish in And so, what is this vanishing obstruction? Well, we have a, it looks a little bit daunting, but we have a finite-dimensional counterexample of a system that is not properly outer, but it does have the ideal intersection property. So this is just a direct product of Z3 with the Klein-4 group. And we act basically on the smallest C-star algebra where we have non-trivial ideals. So M2 plus M2. And then what we can do is we have like these three unitaries that implement. Three unitaries that implement the action corresponding to the zero element and then the kind 4 group. So we just adjugate by these unitaries. So in particular, all these partial star isomorphisms are inner. And then for the other elements, what we do is we kind of, we still adjugate by the corresponding unitary, but we only act on one of these summons. And so we also compose this with like a flip. So here we just adjugate, and here we adjugate and flip. Adjugate and here we adjugate influence. And so, in particular, these down here are properly outer, these are inner, so the whole system is not properly outer. But what we can compute is that this cross product is isomorphic to N8, and so in particular it's simple, and so it has the ideal intersection property, which is by definition, basically. But as I said, it's not properly. And so the issue is that we sort of have So, the issue is that we sort of have that the inner parts of these unitaries, they carry an additional twist. So, we have like a cohomological obstruction. There is a very nasty two-cycle lying around that obstruct the other directions. And so, if we have that this vanishes and this can't happen, then we can go the other way. Right. So, this vanishing obstruction is a little bit confusing, but we actually have something nice in the commutative setting, vanishing obstruction. In the commutative setting, vanishing obstruction always vanishes. So there we have a nice characterization, and so we can actually get that for there, the freeness condition proper outiness is just topological freeness. So these fixed point sets, they have empty interior. And then we have that the action for the commutative C-star algebra has the ideally dissection property if and only if the action on the spectrum of the G-injective envelope is topologically free. This topologically. And so, this, if you look at the transformation coupon, is also in the setting of like the previous paper by Sven, Matt, and Shin and others, but we do not require there to be like a transitive point. All right, and I'll end with one last example. So, if you have just, so you have two regular ideals in A, and you just have a star isomorphism between them, then you can define an Between them, then you can define an integer partial action just by basically applying this isomorphism over and over again. And so your sets are just given by what happens if you apply alpha over and over again, and what happens if you apply the inverse over and over again. So in this case, a1 would just be j, a minus 1, which is bi. And so then you sort of like push all your ideas out further. And so if you have that, this has And so if you have that this has in the in the limit trivial intersection, then this will be properly outer. And in particular this cross product will have the ideal intersection output. Right, so that was maybe a little bit lots, so let's just step back, summarize what we did. So what we can show is there is a gene injective envelope for partial actions, and we kind of like generalize a lot of the machinery of like gene injective envelopes for. Of, like, geneject of all the logos for global actions. In particular, we find a notion of proper outerness. We use this to show that a C-synamic consistent has the audio intersection property if it is properly outer. And we have identified an obstruction that also allows this to go the other way. And we have some nice examples where things are sort of a little bit more hands-on. Thanks so much. Any questions? So go back.
