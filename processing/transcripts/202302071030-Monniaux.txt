Thank you to the organizers. Very nice to be here again now in winter. Hope to find time to do skiing if there's still snow at the end of the weekend. Right, so my topic today is cannot say a navy storm system in non-smooth domains. So non-smooth domains, I think it won't surprise. I think it won't surprise anybody who heard me already. Davis talks either. But Thero Seger is something new for me. So what are the equations? I will start with equations. So the system looks like this. So there's a DT of view and a status of view. And then I write it. And then I write it as minus by multiple of u, like v. So there's a couple system. There's a u and a v. The u is a is the density of a cell population, and v is the concentration of a chemo attractant. So the So they interact like this, and they interact. There's a plus view here, and there's a U here. So that's the Kerr Sega system. Okay, the boundary conditions are so Norman boundary conditions. As I said, As I said, U is defined on a bounded lipstick domain omega two or three, sorry. Let's say and it's two or three. Uh and V as well, but what is Navier Stones doing now here? Well, all this population lives in a fluid, so there's equations. I write the velocity of the fluid. Write the velocity of the fluid like W. It's not the vorticity, it's velocity. So for nanistoks, it's only zero, but it interacts with these something like this. I have to determine later. Serving later, and of course, everything here is transported with the fluid. So, this is the class signal heat source system. And for W I take digital emissions to the incompressible divergence. Right, and I have initial conditions U0, V0, W0. All right, so I see. That is a function depending only on the space variable, it's independent of time. But we can go back to that later. So maybe first some remarks about the system. system u is a density so we expect it to be at least non-negative a problem here well the method that we use is is uh is maximal irregularity right but for maximal ore Right, but for maximal regularity, what we usually need is our operator to be invertible. But the Norman Laplacian is not invertible per se, right? You have to, you cannot work in LQ, but in LQ0 with zero mean. But if U is positive and has zero mean, then you don't have many choice, right? And if you look at this first equation, you can see also that the density, the mass of the interval of the density is preserved. Yes, that's a little bit of useful if you it's moving up, right, if you if you're right to integrate everything. Right to integrate LFD. So that's the third issue, right? You would like to work in LQ0, but you cannot because otherwise U is not much than zero. So that's one point. And another one is scaling. Scaling of this system, there is a scaling. If you, well, the Neumann boundary, the Neumann Laplace is not an issue here, because here you have identity minus the Laplace, which is in convertible in LP. Right? So that's here, that's not an issue for V, it's an issue for you. The scaling issue. The scaling if you if you just ignore this V, otherwise, there's no scaling. So ignoring P in the second equation well this system is invariant under this change. This change of CP can I ask you a question? Yes, so in the third equation, there is no pressure. Sorry, that's not a W sorry. Sorry. Sorry about that. I suppose we get two R3 R end and um. And yeah, the pressure is the fact that I will protect everything, so I forget about the pressure. This is the U lambda squared X the female. The feeling now thanks without anything in front. For W, it's the same scaling as for heavy stops lambda X and the pressure and The pressure, I'm not sure I remember. So, what happens for the pressure? One derivative shift here. Is that right? Pretty nothing. SW will give a lambda to the power three. Biggen of pi lambda will give a right. Yeah, if you cannot. If f you can also ignore that that thing, otherwise you will need to use that f of lambda x is m of x. Just to have an idea where to work. So, this suggests the space where we will work. So, we will work in the space X zero. So, you see U has There's a gap of two derivatives between u and v, and there's a gap of one derivative between w. So for I don't want to go too much in regular suboff spaces. Regular subl F species, if you are in a Lipschitz domain, the regularity won't propagate, you won't have regularizing effect with the Laplace, you know, the Stokes operator or everything. So you want to keep it around LQ, right? So for you, I will have a W minus one Q omega. Well, it's not quite, yeah, let's say for now, and maybe we change it later. Then we should we would want to work in W1Q for V and in LQ for W, right? U, V, W. But the problem here. But the problem here is you if you take the inverse of the Laplacian here, you won't gain almost anything, right? So this W1Q is maybe not the right space, but what you can say, what you can just write is that if Q is less than M, than n then this w1q embeds into lq star where this q star is the sub of f exponent so it's n q divided by n minus q so instead of this w1 q here i will just consider v in lq star so it's the same scaling properties but you don't have this But you don't have this double F regularity instead of this is my ground space. And now, if I take A minus one, and I will give you in a moment the definition of A, I will end up in X1. X1 is what you gain to apply the inverse of the Laplacian, right? So the inverse of the Laplacian. The inverse of the Laplacian for W1Q would be W1Q. Inverse of the Laplacian here, so this is the Neumann Laplacian in LQ star and the domain of Stokes operator in AQ. So in LQ. So what is A? What is A? A is the matrix operator here, the linear thing. So there is Neumann Laplace for U here. Then you have minus identity coming from that term for V and here you project everything with the Helmut's projection. Hermann's projection, right? So you have pf dot there's a minus 7 p f otherwise here you have zero and zero so that's the the linear part of the of the system right without the time derivative here you have minus the lambda plus plus equal to three and And zero, and here you have zero, and here the stokes operator. That's my operator A. So the abstract formulation. Just about it like this: dtu plus a u equals f of u and u at zero is zero. It's u zero, sorry. So this u is this u v w as I said a is here. So what is f? F is a quadratic non-linearity. So the first term here is the minus divergent u minus divergence unquote v second one I have only double write v and the last one is the projection you see here. Projection is in here. And that's it. Okay, so we have a very abstract form. The operator is like this. Nonlinearity is this. And we want to know whether there are a global solution if you start with small initial data. Small initial data. So that's something we can prove. I forgot to keep going. Sorry, this is a joint work with the TS signal from Douchat Islander. And that we talked about with Still in Mainz and we'll move to Karl Swar in tomorrow. Okay, so As I said, the problem is here we would like to apply maximum regularity. The only thing is this Laplacian in this space is not quite right. We would like to have W1 Q prime of omega and the dual of it. So it's something with a zero here, right? It's like a w minus one. W minus one q intersected with lq0 or something. I'm not so sure. No. Well, anyways, this cannot be applied directly. You cannot apply directly maximum regularity because one result is that A has maximum. Maximal regularity in LP in the space x0 cheese. So now I have to be so this is one q prime q prime. L q prime zero prime times l q star times l q sigma. So, what what does that mean? And has also weighted that means that If you look at a solution of so T mu plus A mu equals phi equals 0 equals u 0. So if this phi belongs to L P nu 0 infinity L using X 0 if this u 0 belongs to To the real interpolation space minus one over p. P real is between one over p and one p is bigger than one so this has a unique solution you belonging to every belonging to Lp mu sigma infinity X1 intersecting with H1 P mu and I will justify what are those so what is L P mu so if mu is equal to one that's a regular L P space right and this is the sub L F space so L P mu these are are the G's such that T T to our 1 minus V G of T it's just a weighted L P space in time and H one P mu these are the G's in L P mu such that such that this was the so what was proved by a person Zimonet a long time ago is that if you have maximum regularity in LDP then you have also weight Then you have also weighted LP maximum weight. And this gives us some space to have a better interpolation space here. If you have the optimal mu. You want to have the biggest initial value space to work with, right? So that's So that's the thing with the maximum regularity. But as I said, one issue is to work in this space here and not the one I more or less that one. And here, what is X1? X1 is it is W1Q times the domain of That is the domain of the non-linear passing in LQ star and the domain of Stokes operator in LQ. So there's, as I said, one issue about this mean value is non-zero. And another issue is that here we have to deal with these non-linearities here. And what we would like to say is that that one is something like W2Q star, right? But that's not true. That's not true if you are on a Lipschitz domain, you don't have these smoothing properties. The same thing is that this W1Q, this is true, this is the domain. True, this is the domain in W minus one Q for the Neumann Laplacian only if Q is in a certain interval around two. So this is true only if one over Q minus one over two is less than one over two n plus a certain epsilon. Okay. So if So if you are in three dimensions, it means that the Q should be between three halves and three, and you have some space around that as well. That's the same for the low-head projection. The low-head projection is not bounded on LP for every P, on LQ for every Q. If you are in a Lipschitz domain, it's only around some. Some around in an interval between well for Q satisfying this and the same for the stocks operator so the domain of the stocks operator is same you cannot say well this is not in W to Q right but what we would like to have But what we would like to have is something like maybe W1Q star. But for that to happen, that this the domain of books operator is also in W1Q star, is also Q star should also satisfy something like this. So you need to have one over Q star minus one half is less than one over two and that's epsilon. That's excellent. And this is these are results due to the breakthrough was done by Shen in 2011, something. And Patrick Tomzov also worked around that result. So these are our conditions for Q. It means that Q means that Q is we don't have much space for Q so Q should be between I don't think N plus one over two n over n plus one over n plus one so n is equal to three makes three halves right. It's the x three halves of that. It's epsilon. Well, maybe it's not the same epsilon, but more or less, right? And 2n plus 1 plus silicon. So that's our condition coming from these two restrictions here. And this epsilon depends on Depends on the domain omega. If the domain is C1, you can go, you can get all the cues you want, right? So there's a fine distinction between lips and C1. So that's one thing. That's one thing. And right. So that's the first issue. The second issue is, well, as I said, about this mean value not equal to zero. We looked for stationary solutions first of the system. Well, what we want to have is the u l sub x. This would be a constant. It's just the mean value of u zero the V S will be the same. Yeah, I just erased the system. Sorry about that question. Let's see. What else do I just let's feel sorry equals here and dtw equals w W Fec emergence of W C. So you see this U S satisfies the first one. If P S is like that, it satisfies the second one. And for W S, I would like to add is that I'm W S. I sws dot w s is equal to u zero f so w s equal to zero which is w s should be compared with the boundary condition changing boundary condition. And well, this is not difficult to solve, but there are other people who took care of it. There's a lemma saying that if this quantity u0, the mean value of u0 is small enough, then there is a solution satisfying also that this ws. That this WS in the domain of AQ is also small. Not precisely. So if I am in this range of Q, of course, right? So there exists L T That exists C positive, such that for all delta between zero and delta zero, for all f infinity of power n squared for three dimensions, what is This mean value of u0 maybe value of infinity less than delta there exists a unique WS in the domain for AQ a solution. The solution of this stationary navy stores. W the norm of WS in the domain of AQ. Domain of AQ is less than C. So it's done via fixed point arguments. Okay, and now what I will do is Subtract this stationary solution I write u hat as u minus U S and this U S is U S W S. So this U hat So this u hat, my thing is now u has mean value zero. I mean in the correct space, the whole point. And everything stays small, right? If you start with u0 small enough, then everything stays small. And F not too large, of course. Of course, if you need something like that. So, what does this u hat satisfy? We have dt u hat plus a hat plus a b and you hat plus a few hat and you had zero is zero minus you. Zero minus u s and what is this b eta? Eta is a small parameter. Parameter is value of u0. And what is this p eta? This is a matrix value operator. Well, it's easy to compute, right? But I don't want to. Right, but I don't want to do that. There's a US, sorry, WS. Here I have a magnus beta, Clappassium, and here it is zero zero w x dread and zero last line here. Last line, yes. And of course, here that's the it comes from the nonlinearity W minus Ws plus Ws, right? So that's the biggest. This is a projection of WS derived. That's the projection of the functions function of the function. Yes. But if eta is so if eta is not too big, so if your zero is small enough, then what we can say is that since A has maximal regularity, A plus B eta also has maximal regularity. Perturbation. What we can prove is that It's okay, Navala. What can be proved that it's that B eta U and X zero is less than a small epsilon and any U. If x0 assume zero if eta is smaller epsilon is or epsilon does exist in it Okay, so I think. I think that's it, more or less. But we have to take care of the nonlinearity. What happens to that? What we want to prove is that this nonlinearity has a Lipschitz behavior. So So, I won't write you hat, right? It will be you, but I'll just think of it as a you hat. What is f of u? F of u, as I said, is minus w.quadu with dive versions. Uh okay, so what we want to estimate is this f in x zero. So x zero is Is W1 Q prime intersected with L Q one zero prime times L q star times L q signal and so what is the the normal so What is the normal? So, as I said, f of u one minus f of u two. F is quadratic. So here. There are also models where you can have a power of u here, but then it breaks the quadratic character and it's more technical. Didn't want to go into that. So it's just quadratic. So it's something like So it's something like, okay, what do we have? We need to estimate the first thing. So there's a W1, I would write U1, yes, I will start with U2, right? U2 in W minus W plus, so it's less than one. The divergence of U1. The divergence of u one and right of u one minus the divergence of u two right v2 minus q plus w one divided v1 minus w one w two divided v two. I will uh but here it's not in it's in LQ star, right? And the last thing is, well, the projection is bounded on LQ, so I can forget about the projection. So it's W1 minus W1 minus W2 in LQ. Okay. So here another thing is that here this divergence, you can just erase it and You can just erase it and estimate the u graduate minus u2 at v2 in LQ. And here it's the same because the w's are divergence free. So I write this as divergence of u1 q1 minus divergence q2. So we have four terms. Estimate the hardest one is this one. And of course, so this is. And of course, so this is in zero. And what we will see at the end, so that's something we need to prove, have to prove, is that this is less than or equal to U one plus sorry, that's the beta u one minus u two. one minus u two in x beta prime and i i give you in a minute what i mean with that x beta prime u1 x beta so what is x beta and beta prime to say that's the complex interpolation between x0 and x1 so beta is between 0 and 1 One. And this is also since the operator has maximal regularity and bounded imaginary powers has bounded polymorphic functional calculus. So that's bounded imaginary power. So this is the same as the domain of the fractional power. Of the fractional power of a. That's the abstract theory that's giving us this. So that's something we want to prove, right? Maybe I show you how to do that for the second one. As I said, it's the oldest one. So the divergence, if you want me to go ahead and miss the diversions of you two. Divergence of Q2 by Q2 in W minus over Q. This is the same as U1 by the V1, and it's U2 P2 in LQ. And let's see. So, where is what I can say here? So, if you if you is in the domain of u to the power delta, then this first component. This first component, U is in the sub RF space W minus one for A beta prime. Sorry, minus one plus two beta prime Q omega. Okay. So beta and beta prime in our case are bigger than one half. case are bigger than one half so I will write them as one half plus gamma and beta one one half plus one so this is less than one bigger than one half um so this is uh a W2 gamma prime Q of omega that's what embeds That's what embeds into L R L S of omega where one over Q minus two gamma prime over n is one over S. And what about V? So now if you Now, if U is in the domain of H to the power beta, then V is in the domain of the Laplacian the power pitna and this one in L cube, sorry, one mana plus into the power. Y minus plus into the power beta LQ star. This has a W minus one Q based. You can hear it's LQ star based. And that one we can prove that it embeds into W1R where one of the rhythms is the one that Where one over q prime, q star, sorry, one over q star minus gamma for n is one over all. And so what I have is a u times a gradient of v. So So and that I want to estimate in LQ. So what I need is to have 1 over S plus 1 over Q is equal to 1 over Q. S one over R should be equal to 1 over Q. So that's our position. And now I think almost everything. And almost everything we need because now we have U1 right, U2, right blue, and IQ. So I can write it as U1, I will use U2, right? Thank you. So this gives the U one minus U two in L S and grad U one in L R plus U two in L S grad U one minus U two in L R So U in L S means that this capital U is in T A salt x beta prime. So this is less than u one minus u two in x beta prime. And the grade v1 in L R means that is capital U. Capital U is in x data and the same for another two terms. This is u2 prime and u1 minus u2 in x. So that's the hardest term to estimate and the others are more or less the same. Are more or less the same. Of course, you need good embedding properties of the domain of the stocks of parental into subbody species. Thank you. But that's what I told you. I think the domain of HQ embeds into W1 Q star if Q1 Q star are in the correct, or if Q is the correct. Well, if q is the correct interval, so that q star is still there something like this, which helps a lot. This is also something not easy to estimate because we have to estimate it in L Q star. Q star is big. In dimension 3 is like 3. So you have Right, so you have to have a good estimate of the gradient of V, but also on W. So if Q star is around 3, the domain of AQ is almost at infinity. So take Q bigger than 3 halves. Q star will be bigger than 3. So that, as I said, we are in a bounded domain. So it would be L infinity. So there is some space, not a lot. Space. Not a lot, but there is some. Okay, so once we have that, something like this, story is not quite finished, but here we apply the weight in maximal regularity and the mixed derivatives. So hope I can finish. Yes, yes, and those are interpolation spaces on the right-hand side, but then we haven't quite yet embedded something that is not a continuous point. This X naught, X naught is only depending on the space variable. Now we can have also the time variable. So if we work now in L P Mu on LipsNot, right? So L for U will be lipshits in here. So What we had is u hat is dt plus a plus eta inverse f of u hat, right? Something like this, plus something coming from the initial condition. That's linear. And this this inverse operator I am exploring. inverse operator by MX regularity. It maps Lp Nu X0 into L P mu M a sector with page one of mu zero right these are you and what we we prove now is that f We prove now is that F u one minus F U two in F p mu x zero is amplified u one into mu plus u two mu times u one minus u two. But for that, what we need is that that one embeds into H1 minus beta mu of S beta intersection with H one minus beta prime P. U x plus and we need embeddings of these weighted fractional subolef spaces, which is not an easy task. So here this is true only if q over p plus n over q is equal to 2 mu plus 1. So if mu is equal to one, we have that take in dimension three. This corresponds exactly at the science condition. It's equal to one, but it's not Q here, it's it's Q star. Okay, so long story short, I don't have time to explain how this space is embedded into LP-weighted spaces, and then we have also to see what happens if you multiply two LP-weighted spaces, what happens with the weight and everything. It can be done. Weight and everything, it can be done. There's a huge literature about that. Maybe a little too technical. So, once you have that, all the usual period price or fixed point everything work now in this space. If you take it for the Valythius domain and polygamy or public domain, and you got some kind of regularity like contradicted type spaces. So if you take a polygonal length, can you get some regularity, somewhat closeness, but also some regularity in the second? Are you larger than second drought spaces weight and solar spaces? So the weight here is in the time the time space. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So you have to have the space space. Well, I don't know. Yeah, well, maybe. One thing is not quite satisfactory here because if in dimension two, we still need In dimension two, we still need small initial data, which is not so natural. In dimension three, well, everybody expects with these methods to get a result with small initial data. Dimension two, I don't know. Or polygonal spaces, but the weight. Um wait in the seventh, so this function better of the of the chemotherapy. So what is this I don't know about sorry. Not how to matter, sorry. I don't know what it matters. It's U times something. Of course, you can have also an F depending on V. One thing we could prove as well is that if you is. proof as well is that if q is is regular enough uh if you start with a positive chill condition then you stay you stay positive something but i mean so for regular calercea not calercea naliso just keler seagull i mean you do have blue up you know if by concentration if the If by concentration, if the mass is large enough, right, right. So, there's a four pi, yeah. So, yeah, eight pi. Yeah, so maybe it's not to expect, you know, I mean, maybe there could be small different. Yeah, maybe it comes from Keller Siegel and not movies. That's right.
