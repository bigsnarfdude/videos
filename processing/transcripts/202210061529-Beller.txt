This workshop, thank you to the organizers for making it and for having me here. I'm going to talk mostly about the transition from smectogae to pneumatic phase, how far can we get with landalbogen and a little bit added to it in a couple of ways. So when I was a grad student with Randy, I worked on pneumatic problems and symectic problems, and I was struck by how different the sort of style of work was. Style of work was and is between these two, where pneumatics, yes, there are some things you can do analytically, but there's this Landau-Degen computational approach, among others, which is so fruitful, giving us at least qualitative insights into these very complicated defect structures with all these weird boundaries. For smectics, as Bruno reminded us this morning, there are analytic, wonderful analytic constructions describing the defects in them that have been known for now a century, and yet those very constructions are really hard. Those very constructions are really hard, and until recently, completely impossible to see at all in a simulation. The prototypical defect texture, which is the focal comic. So Danilo Liarchi has this nice method where he gets a smectic-like director field, and then the layers are put in later in the visualization. And we heard previously from Scott and Patrick about this method where a focal conic domain, if you put it in, is at least stable. Put it in is at least stable. It stays there. And so I'm going to talk about the semectic tinematic phase transition with a sort of LDD plus approach. And then at the end, if there's time, a similar approach to what Scott and Patrick have mentioned with some deformable boundaries. So, and of course, stop me along the way with questions. I'm going to begin with older work and then try and connect it with some very current work we're doing with Mohamed. Very current work we're doing with Mohamed in his lab. So we're looking at the smectic A2-pneumatic phase. As you know, you cool from pneumatic to get the smectic in a thermotropic. We're putting it in a hybrid anchoring thin-ish film. So it's not quasi-2D. There's structure along the Z direction, but it's really strong and confined. So there's a water substrate, and the anchoring there is degenerate planar. Anyway, degenerate planar down here, homeotropic at the top. Down here, homeotropic at the top. The experiments I'll show you are all done in Dong Ki-yoon's lab by him and R.O. Selmins and Dim. So, looking down on the pneumatic sample sitting on top of the water substrate with the air interface above, you see this texture under polarized optical microscopy. This is a square-ish array of Bujum defects, and I'll say what that means on the next slide. In the smectic phase, under the same conditions, you get this lovely packing of toric focal connections. Lovely packing of toric focal conic domains, which we understand a little better. And there's this question of memory of defects I'll describe, which Sean's talk has set up really nicely for us. It's memory in the same sense. When you cross the phase transition, are there structures from one phase that are encoded in the defects of the other phase such that when you go back, you recover the same state from many degenerate ground states. Round states, or near round states. Okay, the defects in the pneumatic phase are, because of the degenerate planar anchoring, they're Bujum defects, they're defects in the bottom substrate. And so Bujum defects can only have integer charge. So we have plus ones and minus ones as the elementary charges. And there are two different kinds of plus ones. So as viewed from above, I'm using this nail head notation. So the head of the nail. Notation. So the head of the nail is on the side facing the viewer above. We have the converging and the diverging type. And so in these checkerboards of square Bujum arrays, which was actually predicted basically by Vijayan a while ago, you get this alternation not only of plus one and minus one, but from row to row you have plus one converging or plus one diverging. And it's this fourfold symmetry of the minus one that basically gives you the screen. One that basically gives you the square nature of the array that emerges. I asked just a small question, so what controls the period of the sequence? There's a capillary length that figures into it. And so it matters that the water substrate is deformable. You don't get this on a solid substrate with the same kind of anchoring. And it's some combination. It's some combination of the thickness and the capillary length scale. I'm not remembering right now, but it's those two involved together. Thanks. Right, and this is an illustration. That was the only image I could find for a bujum in literature that this comes from, but it was rejected by Lewis Carroll as not being appropriate. So, what makes these bhujum defects? Well, so why does it make them? You might think that You might think that in the ground state they would all anneal away. What DeGen showed, he wasn't thinking about a fluid battery, he was thinking about a magnetic field. Sorry, I was asking a dumber question. Oh, why do we call them blue jones? Oh, oh. So David Merman is credited with. He brought the term from Lewis Carroll's story into physics when he was thinking about superfluid helium. And there, there are topological defects, the definition. A topological defect. The definition of it is a topological defect that's sitting on the boundary. So it's a point defect in a 3D system, but it's not a hedgehog, which lives in the bulk. It only lives in the boundary. So you can think of it like half of a hedgehog, usually, I think. But that's also why it is only integer charges, because you can never slice a hedgehog in half and see a half integer charge. Right, okay, so here's a phase transition. This is the image I mentioned I would show. This is from, again, Don Qui Yoon's lab. Melting from. Wait, sorry. Does that answer why it's called a Bujum? Well, that answers who called it a Bujum. What a Bujum. Sorry. The literary reason is, so a Bujum is the most dangerous kind of snark. A bujum is the most dangerous kind of snark. It vanishes without a trace. Softly and suddenly, vanishes. Softly, thank you for the quote. Softly and suddenly vanishes, vanishes away. Yeah, as Boojums did in the superfluid helium system. And what's even better about that, right, is Berman got it in the physical one. Yes. Yes. He did not succeed in establishing that the plural is bhuja. Establishing that the plural is Buja. They insisted that he called it Bujans. But anyway. So, okay, smectic to pneumatic phase transition. So melting it now. So we know that we start with the toric focal conic domain packing. We end up with actually a much sparser array of boujums. The thing I should have mentioned before is that the length scale is about an order of magnitude greater, the bougeom spacing versus the focal conic domain spacing. And so in between, so here's the phase. And so, in between, so here's the phase front you can see. And this may have been a temperature gradient across the experiment, as I think Mohammed mentioned, or it may be because it's very weakly first order. I'm not exactly sure. But you can see focal conic domains over here, and then bhujums over here, and then at some short time later, there are fewer bhujams, and then eventually there's this more or less equilibrium, much sparser array of bhujans. And what And what really weirded me out about this is that, okay, each torque focal conduct domain is clearly a plus one bhujan. If you just look at the structure of the director field, it's actually the plus one converging bhujan in particular. And so there must be an equal number of minus ones, but is it that half of the focal conic domains just flip to become minus ones, or are the minus ones coming from in between the focal conic domains when you melt? So you're creating new defects only to annihilate them away. New defects only to annihilate them away as we go. So the hypothesis we came up with was based on this nailhead notation. But if you're looking down on the toric focal conic domain structure, okay, here are the layers in the plane of the circular defect. Right above that, you have male heads with the head on the inside. So it's tilting up and inward, the director. The director. And then, if you just assume that the tilt of the director can be extrapolated into the interstitial regions between the focal conics, then you are led to a graph, a planar graph, where you have nodes at the focal conic domain centers, hedges connecting each pair, connecting the centers of adjacent domains, and then in each interstitial region between three or four of them, you have a face. A face, and each node is a plus one converging defect, each edge has a minus one defect, and each face has a plus one diverging defect. And so you have this nice mapping from vertices, edges, and faces to the three kinds of bougeons. And there's this counting for planar graphs where if you include the infinite outside face as a face, then your Euler characteristic B minus E plus F has to be 2. And so because we're adding in that outside face, And so, because we're adding in that outside face, that ends up being the total Bujum charge. So, once we've netted out the pluses and minuses, plus one. And so, that means any isolated group of toric focal conic domains ought to melt into a total plus one Boojan charge. Now, that turned out to be something that wasn't really measurable in the experiment just because this transition went by pretty fast. I didn't really have the data to examine what exactly. Examine what exactly was going on here. So, numerics were the best we could do. But as mentioned, we don't really, at least I don't really, know how to model the smectic exactly. And so what we ended up doing was land out a gen, which, as you know, is pneumatic free energy, but cheating a bit so that we can say we're modeling the pneumatic near the smectic A to pneumatic transition. A to mematic transition. So here's the energy which we've seen, basically seen this form a few times. There's a defect energy cost. There's an elastic energy of deformation, keeping all three terms so we can tell splay, twist, and bend apart. We have degenerate cleaner anchoring energy at the water. At the air, we assume homeotropic anchoring, infinitely strong. And then, inspired by Zuhail et al., this paper here, we choose Ben to be a fair bit. We choose bend to be a fair bit higher than splay elastic constant. So splay is penalized, but bend is penalized much more. And that is what happens in a pneumatic near the phase transition temperature to the symectic phase. And then the other thing we do to make it smectic-ish, if we're coming from the symectic phase, is we have a director field, an initial Q tensor, whose eigenvalue director, eigenvector, director field is the director field of local conduct domain pattern. So the semectic is there. So, the sort of semectic is there both in the elasticity and in the initial condition. We're going to use that as the initial condition. When you say near the transition, is it just picking the constants like you state there? Right, so that's it. Okay. Right, so those two things are the only departures from normal land out design that we're doing here. You don't change the temperature? Well, no, because this is for the. Well, no, because this is for the isotropic to pneumatic transition, right? So we don't have a comparable phase transition like you do. We're not modeling that in a Landau type theory here. So this was sort of state of the art at the time. And okay, so numerical results. Here's a square array of Bujums. You're going to see weird stuff happening at the boundaries when I started, just because, sorry, square array of focal con. Sorry, square we have photoconic domains will be the initial condition. Free conditions at the boundaries, what's called natural conditions before, so you'll see weird stuff happen there, but the main dynamics to watch will be what happens around these four. So you can't see that, huh? Oh, but you can't see that. Okay. So four focal comics. We have nine defects now. They're going to gradually find each other and then zoom. We're left with one, which is a plus one, if you can see the director field from there. And so what happened actually was exactly what the planar graph mapping would predict. Was exactly what the planar graph mapping would predict. You have the four vertices, four edges, and one interior face in this particular button. On the boundary, so you said you had natural boundary collusion right now. I can't see it from the, but is it winding around the boundary? Yes. I'll go back to the beginning, but I can't see the details. Details about it. Is it winding there? Well, right now it is, but varies. Oh, here we go. Here it was pointing directly upward at the boundaries. Up, up, up, like toward me? Yeah. This movie is a time-stepping. Right, right. So, what we're seeing here is. Right, right. So, what we're seeing here is the relaxation process, which you can either view as just numerical intermediates to equilibrium or something approximating the relaxation process physically, right? But without flow dynamics. Okay, and so I mean, the director field here is what we think the layers are doing in the Tor CrocoCloudic demand path. In the torque local clonic domain packet outside of the domains. In the interstices, they are planar horizontal, and so the direct is logical. You did a lot more than two of these in either direction. Would there be a. Do you have a sense of how the system will choose which four form a unit cell? Why would it the same happen between the two on the right with the two on the right that aren't there? Well, so I didn't do that. So, I didn't do that test because this was such an expensive test already. So, I can't answer you for sure. But the prediction from the planar graph theory is that it doesn't matter which one you are considering the unit cell. Any set of adjacent focal conic domains will create an edge, and any three or four of those will give you a vertex. So, it all kind of works out. And the counting always gives you a plus one if there's a nice defect-free boundary around them. So back to the question. Okay, let me try and play this again. I hope I oh, there it worked. Okay, whatever. All right, so that's all sort of prelude because it's older work, but it feeds directly into the stuff we're working on now with Mohamed's lab, which I'm very excited about. And everything in this section is the work of my graduate student, Jane Garcia, as well. As well as experimental stuff from Mohammed. And so, what we're doing is a similar setup, still hybrid anchoring, still smectic, tubingatic, and back. But now, instead of an air interface with the homeotropic anchoring, there's an egg crate solid interface with homeotropic anchoring. Okay, so it's structured, it has this double undulation, and this is the schematic, but we're going from pneumatic to schnectic to pneumatic. So, in the pneumatics, you're going to see disclination lines, which are Disclination lines, which you can already see here. And when we go back to pneumatic, you will also see disclination lines. And the spectic, you're going to see focal conics, but in a much more complicated way than before. So let me play you the video. You might have seen this on Monday already. So here, Mohammed and his lab are cooling. Okay, this is a whole bunch of focal comic domains. But where it's brightest is where are the depressions. Depressions in the egg crate, and then you come back to pneumatic. And so, if we compare the initial and final pneumatic states, they're not identical, but they're very clearly correlated. So, this is another case of geometrical memory, right? If you go to the isotropic state instead of the pneumatic, and then you come back isotropic to pneumatic, you'll have a completely uncorrelated bunch of defects in your metastate. In your metastable state, they're sort of wrapped around these undulations, and that's why they don't all annihilate. But there's clearly a lot of structure that is remembered by the smectric phase, even though the smectric phase has a whole lot more structure. Part of what makes this problem so much harder than the other one is that the focal conics here are not torque, they are elliptic hyperbolic. There you go, so they're like that. And so what And so, what Jane does here is to take as our initial condition the director field from elliptic hyperbolic focal kind of domains, which is also known analytically. But then outside of the domains, before we got away with just taking a vertical director field to patch everything together, now what we do instead is hold the focal conic domains fixed and do a pre-minimization over all the other regions. So, that's what. So that's what we are seeing here. So we again have k3 greater than k1. We're going to hold the focal conic domains fixed. And so I believe it's a little hard to see here, but the green is where is inside a focal conduct domain. Blue is outside. Right. And okay, there's some animation where things sort themselves out and relax a bit. And then once that has reached some equilibrium, then we Then we let go of the constraint on the focal conics and minimize the entire domain, again, keeping k3 greater than k1. So now everything is blue, it's minimizable. You get some other demective field. And then finally, to symbolize being deep in the pneumatic phase, then you set K3 equals K1 and minimize one more time. So in principle, you could do a whole sequence of minimizations with different K3s, but this seems to be good enough. And what you're left with, Be good enough, and what you're left with at the end are a bunch of line defects and point-like defects in the pneumatic. So, this is the relaxation animated. So, the colors are the height undulations, defect lines, and these little lines are basically points, but you can see they combine with the lines. And we think these types of final states are essentially what Muhammad and Essentially, what Mohamed and his lab see, where you have disclination lines winding around these undulations, as well as some isolated point defects, which are these little short lines here. But of course, this is not a unique state, right? This is very highly degenerate. And so different runs with different initial conditions for the parts outside the focal conics will give you these very different looking structures. For a given one of those, though, the plus or minus, right, so each of those disclination lines ends on the planar anchoring surface, which is the flat one here. And so what to say about those? How do they relate to the curved surface, if at all? So we're going to take away the lines and just look at the points where they intersect that surface. Lines go away. Here's the points in their director field. And there's this saddle splay energy density, which is sometimes called the topological charge density for 2D. And again, we're just looking at that planar boundary. And so it's this derivative in terms of Q, which in the uniaxial limit becomes this total divergence term called saddle splay. And so if we were at a homeotropic boundary, then the saddle splay in the director field would equal the Gaussian curvature of the bond. Would equal the Gaussian curvature of the boundary surface. There's this nice property there, which is true in smectics also, that saddle splay is Gaussian curvature. Here, though, we're looking at the planar boundary. And even so, if you look at, okay, where is the saddle splay positive, which indicates a negative defect, or where is the saddle splay negative, which indicates a positive defect, there's this very clean division in these two clusters of data according to the Gaussian curvature. Of data according to the Gaussian curvature of the opposite surface, the surface where these defect points are. So at a distance, Gaussian curvature will determine very nicely the sign of the defect endpoint. And so we thought that was neat. And this is related to the saddle space screening concept, which there's this paper of Randy's from 2014 that looked at this with spontaneous chirality, and then Lisa's paper. Spontaneous chirality, and then Lisa's paper looking at this in holy surfaces. And okay, I'm a little short on time, so I'm going to say very briefly, Jane went to ILCC, was really inspired by talks from Imani Wells group on nanoparticle assembly in synaptic defects. So she devises an experiment where she takes the Q-tensor field and throws in particles one by one and sees where they are, where they can go that will. Where they are, where they can go that will best help the energy. And so, what you're seeing here for a toric focal conic, let me start that again, is they fill the defect lines first and later will start filling in the bulk. But they stay away from the homeotropic boundary for some reason. Whereas planar anchoring particles, they'll fill in the circle first, and then the homeotropic boundary, and then the straight line defect. And we don't know why. And we don't know why. And then they fill in the bulk. So, this is all holding the Q-tensor field fixed. We can do the same thing again. So, we're trying to understand where the nanoparticles go in Mohamed's experiments. Here they've gone to the defects, but we're kind of zoomed out. So, in this elliptic hyperbolic domain system, they also go to the defects first, if they're homeotropic nanoparticles, and then they fill in the And then they fill in the undulated surface. If they're planar anchoring particles, they fill in the top surface before filling in the hyperbola. So there's some difference there in which defects they would be attracted to and help to stabilize depending on their anchoring. Then, of course, you could reminimize the Q-tensor field with those particles in there. And this is very early, at a very early stage, but if you fill 20% of the volume with these nanoparticles, Fill 20% of the volume with these nanoparticles and then minimize again, you completely change the Q-types of field inside because we've changed effectively the anchoring conditions. This is something that Mohammed and others have seen very starkly in experiments, so something we want to explore further. I know I'm talking fast because there's another part I want to get to, and I don't have much time. Are there any questions on this section? I don't understand. Oh, sorry. This won't get it done. Okay. The selection criteria. The selection criteria: how do the nanoparticles know preferentially where they need to be? Could you explain that a little bit? Sure, sure. So, what Jane does is with the Q-tensor field fixed, she puts in a nanoparticle at every single center, at the center of the nanoparticle, visits every single point in the simulation, just one nanoparticle. So then you pick the best point, put a nanoparticle there. Now, you pick the second best point that doesn't overlap that first nanoparticle, put the second one there, et cetera. And then you repeat until it's what makes it the best point. But what makes it the best point if you don't recalculate Q? Well, so this is the energy if you just punched a hole in the pneumatic at that spot. So it would be better to recalculate Q, but that would be a calculation at each and every one of these. And so, yeah, it would be much nicer if we had a method to take 100 or 1,000 nanoparticles and minimize their positions as well as a liquid simultaneously, but we can't do that. Okay, so we know. And did you try to change the size of the nanoparticle with respect to the defect core? Or is it in the problem or the size of the defect core? Well, I think the answer is yes, but it's not a satisfying answer because of the simulation dimensions making the thickness, the minimum thickness with the undulated surface rather thin, when Jane makes the nanoparticle a little bit bigger, it reaches that minimum thickness and it can't fit. That minimum thickness, and it can't fit in one of these best spots anymore. So, we need to go to larger system sizes to properly answer that question. Basically, you're just visualizing the energy density when you define these particles. Yes, with a little bit of excluded volume caveat, but yes, that's right. Well, and with the anchoring on the particle apparently making a difference, even though it's so small. In fact, it would be also interesting, my guest, to study the situation where the ongoing induced by the nanoparticle is tilted. Yes, it happens to be in the experiment that we did recently without defect. It happens to be tilted. Okay. And it turned a And the turn between 17 to we don't know between 17 and 13, but you see it's not negligible. So, and this makes different things because at the surface, as a result, it's not so happy because the tilt degree is better. Okay, okay. Well, we'll see if that best matches the experiment. We'll see if that best matches the experiments, I guess. Thank you. So I did want to share, this is extremely preliminary work, but because it relates so much to the amazing stuff that we've been hearing about from Patrick and Scott and Tim, I wanted to mention it. So this is the Pegney-Selinger-Sluken theory as utilized and extended recently in this nice work. And so what I'm going to try and do here. And so, what I'm going to try and do here is do something like that, but with the possibility of deformable boundaries. Okay, so including the water substrate that Dong Ki-yoon had. So, what am I doing here? There's a, this is regular Landau de Gen, except instead of an A term, I have minus rho. So, rho is an immiscible fluid type term, Ton Hilliard, if you know the term. So, we have rho equals one in the liquid crystal part, rho equals mega. Crystal part, rho equals negative one in these units in this other fluid, let's say water, and the volume of liquid crystal is conserved. So there's only pneumatic order where there is rho equals one, or positive. Then we have regular old pneumatic elasticity. I don't deal with K24 yet, but in principle it's there. Because that would get to events with the layer mean and Gaussian curvatures. There's this There's this expansion in terms of u, which is going to be our semectic density wave. And again, instead of this quadratic term, we have minus rho. So by the semectic order only where there's rho, positive. There's this cheating version of the coupling between u and q, where we want the spectric wave vector to be along the director. And I'm leaving out this minus i over 3. Leaving out this minus I over 3, which we saw earlier in the week, which I have no justification for other than it seems to work out in this simulation. But also, I don't like putting S itself in the free energy, just on sort of aesthetic grounds. And so, oh, and then there's some preferred value of rho where it's not zero. So, that'll set the rho value. That'll set the rho value in the yellow part. There's a surface tension, and there's an anisotropic surface tension where Q couples into this gradient squared of ρ, which is, of course, the anchoring. And so that gives us, yeah, preferred density anchoring. The dynamics are just relaxation for Q, relaxation for U, and conserved relaxation for the row fleet. And so, depending on exactly how much total row you put in, Exactly how much total rho do you put in. And here there's a colloidal particle kept fixed where rho is required to be zero there. But outside, it could be anything. And from a uniform initial condition outside the particle, you get this nice colloidal onion texture of where the red and the blue here are the peaks and the valleys of the smectic density wave. So this is more or less what we hope to get. And with various And with various boundary conditions and various amounts of liquid crystal filling, you can get these sort of colloidal onion dimers, you can get coexistence of these little floating domains. This is not an equilibrium, but with an onion in formation, this is where liquid crystal fills the whole recipe domain. And then this is all finite differences. This is dumb numerics. But it turns out not to be that bad in 2D for going to larger systems. So here's two. So here's 256 by 1,000 and something. So this is a sort of kinetically trapped texture. The blue here are the pneumatic, or the disclinations. The white, where layers disappear, are dislocations. And so for this particular choice of parameters, it very quickly got stuck in a situation that might actually be kind of realistic. And then I tweaked the parameters a bit to make the dislocations more mobile and got whatever this is. Right? So we have a sort of march of dislocations as the system tries to equilibrate. Yeah, oh, and if you might have seen there are two disclinations annihilated, and there was a sort of burst of dislocations from it when you rewind to that. I'm not going to play this whole thing, don't worry. Okay, watch these two disclonations. Okay. So I think this is fun. Whether it's right, I'm not sure yet, but I think it's promising. So, right, we've supplemented Landau de Jen with smectic initial conditions and smectic-ish elasticity, and that at least gives us some new insights into what's going on at the phase transition with this geometric memory. And then at the end, I showed this fluid phase separation model. This fluid phase separation model on top of the Hevny Selinger-Slukin model, which seems like it might be useful in getting deformable boundaries into the system. And then the question I wanted to raise for discussion amongst us all is, in addition to computational methods like deflation, can we exploit analytically known structures like focal conic domains in a more systematic way? In a more systematic way to help convergence of truly spectral simulations, as we've done here for mnematic kind of spectral simulations. Because there are very not just within each focal conduct domain, but there's the law of corresponding cones, which tells you how different focal contact domains are supposed to match up to each other. And there's a lot going on analytically that should, in principle, help us get to realistic converged structures. So I'll end it there. Thank you very much. Oh, I did there. Thank you very much. Excellent. Are there any questions? Is the surface tension term that you're including in this sort of phase separation, is it anisotropic? Can you say a bit more? Oh, sure. So, yes and no. So, this is the isotropic surface tension, and this is the anisotropic surface tension. And this is the antisotropic surface tension. And one thing I didn't say is that I changed in the movie about this movie on the next slide, this one, I changed the sign of it at the top versus the bottom to make hybrid anchoring. So, but yeah, those are two separate terms, the isotropic part of gradver squared and the part that is sort of along the Q direction, if you will. Right. Because, I mean, here you're doing it for the complicated symectic-ish elastic. The complicated smectic-ish elasticity, but have you ever tried doing it just with the pneumatic and then tuning the surface tension? Do you see tactoids forming? Like things like this? Oh, yes. I don't have the pictures to show you, but this kind of thing without the spectacle gives you tactoids. I guess. Cool. And others have published peer-reviewed works using that kind of thing with just a pneumatic face. Just a pneumatic phase. The bio, the actin tactoids people have done a lot with us recently. Show us the last frame of the movie that you're not going to play through to the end? Yeah, so sure, and I should in full disclosure because it actually fails to do what I wanted it to do after a very long time. The anchoring at the bottom is violated, and this is what happens. Is violated, and this is what happens. And well, I mean, this wasn't equilibration. This is when I stopped it and said, okay, this is not what I want it to happen. Trouble is, if you make the anchoring stronger than the isotropic part of the surface tension, then it goes unstable. So you have to make that surface tension stronger, but then the surface isn't like to deform it. And so there are bits of it that are not really fully worked out yet. If you have ideas like that, that's great. If people here have ideas about how to help. People here have ideas about how to help its stability with a stronger anchoring strength at both boundaries. That would be helpful, I think. Yes, because in this case, the oncoming data oncoming is not so strong. Is that true? Numerically, they have equal strength. It's not that I set this one to be weaker than this one. And there are other bad simulations I can show you where this one gets violated. Okay. And will you be able to vary the sequence? To vary the sickness? Yes, so it's just a matter of how much time you're willing to wait. Do you mean the free interface? Not yet. I see. It's not yet the free interface, if I see. Right. So, for instance, if you had a situation where it was violated on the top, you could fix it by having a free interface. You have the interface following. Well, that was the intention here. The fact that this is so straight is because the Is because the elasticity was not enough to overcome the surface tension. The intention with the setup is that both interfaces, you can see it a little bit here, both interfaces will deform, as in Donkey Young's experiment with the air and the water. So once we get the parameters more sorted out, that will hopefully work it out here. And can I ask you what's going on with that shell over there, like the semantic around the colour? How does it work? So it seems like the anchoring changes at some point. The anchoring, are you saying because the layers spiral? Yeah. I think that's dislocations that haven't sorted themselves out yet. If you look at the director field itself, it is mainly radial. And the coupling between the layer normal and the director field is finite. So where there's this tight confinement, where they only have two and a half layers to get things right, they will deviate somewhat. Will deviate somewhat. And this is another numerical stability thing where we'd like to lock those in as much as possible, but there's only so much we can do and still run the simulation. One thing you might be able to do, we do this quite often more though, is to crank up different parameters. Start with relatively gentle anchoring and then sort of slowly wind it up. And that seems to be quite a good strategy. So you're saying from the minimized state of the kind of do like a State of the continuation in like kernels and stuff. Yeah, okay, we should try that. Thank you. By adding the scale, did that determine the energy functional? So what density determines? In your energy functional, your free energy functional, where you match up the Hessian of the density proof equation against the Q tensor. Did you try adding the scale density onto the Q tensor to get N out of N? Oh, to add the identity over 3 of the 0. But to add the identity over three, no, I don't think I've tried that. Because as Randy was talking earlier, this is sort of recognising the SCOTHIS to be traceless. Yes, but you could fix this by making that Hessian operator, removing the trace of the Hessian operator. Trace that to DIDJ minus delta ij. Oh, okay. So then you're just looking at the traceless part of the. Was part of that? Thank you. That is great. And then you add internet separately, the wash and new square. Yeah, if you want. You don't have to. Right, okay. Take care, everybody.
