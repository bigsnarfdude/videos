Uh realize this propical intersection numbers and this is joint work with Spencer Bergman who is in the audience. So my starting point will be the first talk that of Lucia today which was about the CSNK cycles of a Metroid. Metroid. So I will start with taking a metroid of rank e plus 1 over set of n plus 1 elements. And I will take this to be the elements from 0 to n and I will take the metric to be a blue plus n. And how Chris, Lucia and Chris, Lucia, and Felipe defined the CSMK cycles of metroid to be the balance weight over the K skeleton of the bergenthon of the metroid that we're taking along with some weights such that the weights over the K skeleton are defined as follows that given As follows, that given a cone of in here sigma f which is indexed by flag of flats of the matroid. So let me take this to be this. Then the weights are just the product of the beta ingredient. Of the beta ingredient of minors of each inclusion in here up to a sign. So that's the definition of the CSM case cycle. This is remarkable because it's a combinatorial weight that is also balanced geometrically over the case character of the workman strength. And they also showed that the degree of the CSMP. Of the CSM case cycles of the matroid are the coefficients of the shifted reduced characteristic polynomial, which are the same as certain dead coefficients, a plus sign. So, these are t minus k t k plus 1 0 where t i j denotes the i jth coefficient of the third polynomial x to the i y to the j. X to the eye, y to the chin. So, what we did is to, so the proof that they had to show that the degree is the coefficients of the shifted reduced characteristic polynomial is an inductive proof that involves the deletion-contraction recursion. That both of them satisfy the deletion-contraction recursion and they agree on the basis. So, what we need is to show. So, what we did is to show an induction-free proof of this using the stable intersection numbers, computing explicitly that what do we get by stably intersecting this KCSM cycle with the complementary dimensional Bergman fan and adding up the multiplicities of the intersection. Okay. So the thing we showed was that if you take the CSN. If you take the CSM case cycles with, so I take the complementary Bergen fan of so I'll just take sigma, I mean when I say sigma zhu n minus k and zero to n. So this is taking the Berman uh fan with the weights one. With the weights 1, that balance. And now these intersections will have some multiplicities in there. And then I add these multiplicity, and that is precisely computing the degree of this. So what we get is that this is equals to the summation. I didn't get that. Sorry about that. I don't know how this works. So this summation minus K. And product of the meter ingredient m i. So m f i f i minus 1 i goes from 0 to k plus 1 and this sum is not over all a flag of flats, but certain choice of those flags. The flats we are going to the flag of flats that we are going to take Lago flats that we are going to take satisfy the property. So, again, they are going to be from a mitty set to the whole set and that the minimum of each inclusion is increasing. By that, I mean the minimum of f1 is less than minimum of f2 minus f1 and so. And so on or Fk. So I'm already calling it Fk plus 1. So these are the choice of flats we get once we stably intersect our ACSM cycle with the complementary dimensional Bergman fan, the uniform Bergman fan. The Judy Former pan. And this, by the work of Guillaume and Last Workness, is precisely this: the one, the thing that we wanted it to be. And as the result of you and Jensen says that it doesn't matter where you how you perturb your given fan, that the stable intersection numbers do not depend upon the direction of your perturbation. Of your perturbation. That is geometrically represented here by saying that the third coefficients does not depend upon the order of the underlying set if you are using the activity definition of the third polymorph. Okay. So, but we started this project in an effort. In an effort to get all the Dirt coefficients as the stable intersection numbers. And that we were not able to, but I'm going to write down the beta expansion of the whole tuck polynomial due to last Vergness and beyond. That might allude to such a formula or such a representation of these coefficients and maybe. Of these coefficients, and maybe one of you would be able to figure out how we can get those coefficients if possible. Okay? So, I think maybe I'll do this here. I think I need a more room, so I'll reach this here. Okay. So, where we need for this this With me for this generalization of this expansion that we had up there. So, to get the coefficient of x to the k, y to the j in the third polynomial, they were able to give a representation of this as the sum of the beta invariant f i F i minus f i minus 1 product eta star g i minus 1 g i go from minus minus minus minus minus gi I goes from one to L where I start. Where I start, so the so these are: this is the beta invariant of C minor, and this is the beta invariant of the dual of whatever is inside. And most of the, I mean, they are the same, but except for when we evaluate them on loop or column. So, this flag of flags is now replaced by flag of sets. Sets. So I'm going to take these sets starting from empty set calling it G L G L minus 1 so I think I should be consistent here and then go to G 0 which is E. Which is equals to F z F one F K and F K plus one equals to the constant. Take the G is F K is So, where the GI's are the cyclic sets. So, these are cyclic sets of my metroid, where by cyclic sets I mean those sets of my ground set that are union of circles. And these are flats. These are flats, and again the incremental condition is there, which is saying that minimum of G L minus 1 minus G L should be less than minimum of G L minus 2 minus G L minus 1 and so on. And the same condition for F i, so F 1 minus F i. Fi, so F1 minus F3 is less than minimum of F2 minus F1. So minimum condition should hold up to here and then up to here. Notice that these F0 and G0 are equal and so this means this set here should also be a cyclic set and a flat, which implies that this is a cyclic flat. And many of you might already know that this is kind of an iterated version of the convolution formula for triple loans, right? They used to go till the cyclic flat and then the yeah, so how okay. One more thing, yeah, so one more comment I should make here is that we can we can take this. That we can further reduce this chain of flats by only restricting to those flats that are connected. So, they're such that this metroid here is connected because beta invariant would automatically be zero for those guys that are not connected or a loop. So, we should also ignore those ones that are loops. And here the Here we can do the same, that we would only demand these restrictions and these minors to be the one where the metroid is connected and not a loop. But for V star, we would demand that this should not be a co-loop because it's a dual for V d and A. Okay. So yes, so yes, so that's the we were not able to get. We were not able to get these numbers as the stable intersection numbers for K like some cycles on a Bergman fan corresponding to a Metroid and intersecting that with another cycles. But hopefully, maybe someone in future will be able to get that if possible, right? We don't also know a priority whether that is possible or not. So I'll stop here. If that question, I will be happy to answer. I would be happy to answer to the co-normal fan? So, yes, so I the this is as given is not related to the conormal fan. I hope there is some relation, but I don't know. Because there they have two flag of sets going one way and the other way, and for each pair of Gi's and Fi's, they have a condition on the union and the intersection. There is no such condition here, and I don't know how to translate one to the other. Yes? Can you give like a sort of famous place for the electropical intersection theory proof of this computation? Proof of this computation that has the same answer in Cardell on the co-normal fan? Not on the other hand. I haven't thought about this, that how to get this, so some weights on the co-normal fan and then intersecting it with if the delta that they have taken and I can translate into some weights, that can be possible. Yes, of course. Verify question. So th this this formula is a formula that does burn itself? Yes, yes. So it's the activity decomposition papers. These are series of paper and this is I think the second last paper in that series. I also felt that this likely has some relationship with environmental candidate that I really understand what the relationship is. I mean it's a product, right? So it's so I did so all the these questions did pop into my head because I mean I was trying to get these These guys rather than getting on the Bergman plan on the co-normal plan. I have thought about this, I have run out of ideas. So, if there are some other ideas, I'm welcome to try or happy to try. Oh, is there another question? Oh, just a comment. What I've been playing with recently is. Recently, is that condition you have for the minimum increasing condition? It's very closely related to some localization computation for your sum-over permutations. So there is like running it through the best paper arguments. So if you use localization using like the using like the top chat or top churn class of the quotient, like there's things that look very similar to it. Seen something very similar to happen. I can show you. I just looked it up, so it's not in any sort of form. I'm happy to look into, like, because I mean, there, right now, there already is a formula where you get these coefficients of the third polynomial as a degree evaluation of certain monomials, right? That paper you mentioned. So, I would like to see how whether this can translate with this or not.
