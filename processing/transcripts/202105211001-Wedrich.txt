All right. Well, now the website says it's recording. So we'll see what happens. So the first talk of our final day of this conference, thanks everybody for sticking with us all the way through, will be given by Paul Vedrich from Bonn, two places in Bonn. And it'll be about invariance of four manifolds. All right, so please take it away. All right, so please take it away. Thanks a lot, Ben. Thanks to the organizers for the invitation and for letting me speak here. It's a pleasure to be back in Banff, if only virtually. To compensate for that, I've included a picture from a conference seven years ago, and maybe some members of the audience will recognize where this was taken. So I'm going to talk about joint work with Scott Morrison and Kevin Walker. Scott Morrison and Kevin Walker. Kevin is here in the audience, I think. And it is about joint work that resulted in a paper that went on the archive in 2019. It's a result of some work that I did as a postdoc at ANU. And I should say that Scott and Kevin have been thinking about these things much longer than I have, at least 10 years, probably more. Okay, so let me get started. So the motivation. So, the motivating question is, of course, how does havano homology extend to other ambient manifolds? So, this invariant starts out as an invariant of links in R3, maybe the three-sphere. And it's a problem that motivated a lot of research to extend this to other ambient manifolds. And the title of this workshop or conference is called Perspectives on Otomology. And there are different perspectives. There are different perspectives, and the perspective that I want to take for this talk follows the following hints. So, the first hint is that in such an extension, the fact that these link homology theories are functorial under link cobordisms and four-dimensional space is probably quite important. So, quantum homology and its relatives not only produce invariants of links, but they also produce invariants. but they also produce invariants and they produce maps between the link invariants whenever you have a link coordination connecting these links. That's the first hint. The second hint is that there already are some extensions of homology to other ambient manifolds and I want to pick out two particular ones, namely Levrozansky's invariant for links in S1 times S2 and Michaelis' extension to links in connect sums of S1. To links in connect sums of S1 times S2s. And an interesting feature of these invariants is that they require or work best in the case where the link is null-homologous, at least with not two coefficients. And the third hint that I want to follow comes from the work of Jake Rasmussen that shows us that the Covano homology package, and to that I also count lean homology and the spectral sequence relating And the spectral sequence relating covano homology and Lie homology is sensitive to smooth surfaces in the four-ball. So it tells us about existence or genus of certain smooth surfaces in the four-ball with boundary the link or the knot. Okay, with those hints put out there, the proposal is that we should maybe think about Havana homology as not just an invariant of links, but an invariant of But an invariant of the link in the boundary of the fobal. This is also the perspective that Melissa introduced in her talk. And then the dream would be to complete the following picture. The picture says that maybe there should be a kind of extended topological field theory that sends four manifolds, possibly with boundary, possibly with a link in the boundary, to chain common. With the link in the boundary to chain complexes, and then it extends downwards from there. So it would assign something like dg categories to three manifolds, and then as you descend the ladder on the left, so you go down in topological dimension, you assign algebraic structures that are higher and higher dimensional until you hit the point which gets assigned some kind of a four-dimensional category. Everything comes. Everything compatible with gluing. So, in a sense, if such a thing works, you could think about this as a five-dimensional TFT that is fully local, so determined by what it assigns to the point, and that is only partially defined. It might not extend to all types of forms, all types of five manifolds, but it would start at level four and then go down. And the number five is just motivated from the fact that we typically Motivated from the fact that we typically want a TFT to assign something like numbers to top-dimensional manifolds. But here, if I start at dimension four, it would already associate gene complexes to four manifolds. So there should be some decimal and extra-dimensional there. So this should be thought of as a five-dimensional perspective on not homology, and that also rhymes with other stories that we've heard this week. So the purpose of the talk is to illustrate. To illustrate a few steps in the direction of realizing this dream, I want to start. Okay, so I should say I will focus on the four-dimensional part. And I want to motivate what happens in the four-dimensional part by first discussing what happens in the decategorified setting one-dimension down in dimension three. And here I want to consider three different Consider three different mathematical structures that are closely connected to each other: link invariance, higher categories, and manifold invariance. And the starting point will be link invariance, specifically the GLN link polynomial, which is an invariant of framed-oriented links valued in LaRont polynomials in this variable Q. And it is determined by local, so you can define it on a link diagram. It on a link diagram. So you can compute it from a link diagram, and it is actually determined by certain local relations on link diagrams. These types of skin relations that I've drawn here. We've probably all seen these relations before. I should note that it's important to take gln here, not sln, because I want to have integral powers of q in this relation. And if I were to work with sln, I would have to take rational powers of q. To take rational powers of q. So, this is somehow a gl story. Okay, whenever you have a link invariant that is determined by local relations, you can ask whether it extends to a tangle invariant. And of course, it does in this case. And the conceptual home for these tangle invariants is the ribbon category of finite-dimensional representations of the quantum group associated to GLN. The invariant Invariant somehow takes the form of the Reshitik interior functor, which maps tangles whose components are labeled by objects of this category to intertwiners in this category. This is probably also a familiar picture to many people in this audience, and it's not totally essential for the talk, so I will not say much more about it. Yeah, so in a sense, this category. In a sense, this category captures the local behavior of this GLN link polynomial and its colored relatives. And whenever you have such a ribbon category, you can start building manifold invariants in a very naive way. These are called skein modules, and they exist also in several different variations. And I want to give us an example, one definition of such a skin model. One definition of such a skin module. So let's take a compact-oriented three-manifold M and let's take a set of points and the boundary that come with co-orientation. So every point is either directed out or in, and it also should be equipped with a framing. And then to this pair of three manifold and set of boundary points, we associate a module of the ring of Laurent polynomials. ring of LaRa polynomials spanned by framed oriented tangles embedded in the three manifolds with boundary in the prescribed set P. This is a huge space and then we mod out by the relations that isotopic tangles are considered equal and we mod out by local relations. So zooming into any three-dimensional ball in the three manifold we identify certain linear combinations of tangles namely according to this type Namely, according to these types of relations that I had up here. Okay, so that defines a manifold invariant. By construction, this has an action of the mapping class group. Yes, and in a sense, these three things, these link invariants, these higher categories, and these manifold invariants, are extremely closely related. In some sense, you can obtain each one from any other one. Any other one. You can describe this ribbon category at least certain pieces of it if you understand all the relations that this polynomial satisfies locally. From that, you can build a scan module, but conversely, you could also recover a link polynomial from the scan module by somehow understanding what the scan module of the three-sphere is, and so on. So, I want to somehow blur the distinctions between these three things. Okay, and these scan modules have received quite a lot of attention over the last few years because also because Few years because also because somehow there are some new techniques of computing them using factorization homology and related things. And there are some indications that in certain settings they are the three-dimensional layer of a four-dimensional TFT that actually extends up to dimension four. The way I presented this here, you could see that this is somehow part of a TFT in dimension 0, 1, 2, 3, epsilon. three epsilon so it assigns something to zero manifolds up and and up to three manifolds and then you have an action of diffeomorphisms or at least the mapping class group of the three manifold on this top dimensional piece okay so that's the the three dimensional uh thing and now i want to move up one dimension so here we again have link invariance higher categories and manifold invariance and again i want to start at the level of link invariance I want to start at the level of link invariance. The analog of the link polynomial PN are just the Havanov-Rosansky GLN link homologies, which were originally defined in 2004 by Havanov and Rosansky. And the version that we actually use in this paper somehow is based on the foam technology of Robert and Wagner that we heard about yesterday, which came as a Which came as a wonderful surprise in 2017 because Michel Erich, Daniel Tubenhau, and I were working on proving the functorality of these link homologies and somehow it fit perfectly with this construction. And somehow this enabled us to show that this construction is properly functorial, including compatibility with signs and everything. Okay, so what are the source and the target of these functors? The source. Of these functors. The source category consists of objects links and isomorphisms, link cobordisms up to isotopy rel boundary. And the target is the bounded homotopy category of complexes of graded vector spaces or graded abelian groups. And yeah, link or borders are sent to chain maps while defined up to homotopy. And the construction is such that if you compute the invariant for invariant for a link. So that's a chain complex of graded vector spaces. And you take its graded Euler characteristic, you recover the polynomial Pn. So that's a categorification of the GLN link polynomial. Well that's that's on the link side and now I want to do the analogous thing that I somehow did on the previous slide. I want to somehow upgrade this to first some kind of higher category and then build manifold invariance out of this. And in a similar way, In a similar way, as the polynomial Pn is controlled by the ribbon category REBUQGLN, these Kavanaugh-Rosansky homologies are controlled by a kind of ribbon two category or in a different axiomatization, a disk-like four category that categorifies this representation category for UQGLN. So I'm going to describe this in the middle of the talk. Here it's just somehow. Here's just somehow advertisement. And once we have this, we can start building a skain module. So, for a compact-oriented four-manifold W and a link in the boundary, we can produce a bi or even triply graded abelian group or vector space, depending on how you work with this, from Havana-Frasansky homology. And you can recover the link in the usual link in variant by evaluating this scan module SN. This scan module SN on the four ball with the link in the boundary. And then somehow it feels very natural to expect that this fits into a TFT framework as the four-dimensional part and extends down. So that's the idea. Are there any questions? What happens if there isn't a link in the back? What happens if there isn't a link in the boundary of the four manifold? Perfectly fine. Then the empty link is in the boundary. So that's an allowed case. Yeah. But I think Tudor missed this picture. I wanted to show Tudor this picture. All right. Welcome. Good. Okay. So before leaving this introductory section of the talk, I Introductory section of the talk, I wanted to somehow acknowledge that there are many different other approaches to getting at something like Hobano homology for links in other three manifolds. So there's the idea that one should categorify within Rashidik and derive invariance. So those are quantum invariants of three manifolds that require specializing to root of unity in general. So one has to study categorification and root of unity. Categorification and rule of unity even has to study categorification of tensor product representations. There's extremely interesting mathematics in there, but will not be part of this talk. There's another approach that somehow starts at the three-dimensional scheme modules, these somehow modules over ring of Laurent polynomials or similar rings, and then tries to categorify them to categories. And there are different approaches to how one could be able to do this. For example, one could present the three-manifold. One could present the three-manifold via surgery or via Hagart splitting. And somehow, depending on how you somehow encode the three-manifold, there are different possible approaches for how to categorify this. And if you go via Hagat splitting, then it seems as a very natural question is how to categorize skin algebras. That's also something that I've thought about in the past and still like, but it's not going to be part of this talk. Then Edward Whitten showed us a model for quantum homology for links in R3. For links in R3, and it's somehow tempting to ask whether this generalizes to other three manifolds or maybe even other four manifolds with such a boundary. And as I said, these approaches a priori seem pretty different to what I'm going to talk about here, which is somehow to build these higher scale modules by taking the functorial tangle invariant, extending it to a full category, and building a scale module out of it. And in this sense, this talk is And in this sense, this talk is not about categorification. I'm not claiming to categorify anything here. Just taking a categorified invariant and build something out of it. Okay, so that was the introduction. Now I want to basically run you through this construction. I'm going to say something about the link invariant part. I'm going to say something about the higher categories part, and then I'll sketch you the construction of this full manifold invariant, unless there are questions at this point. At this point, okay, it doesn't seem to be the case, so let me proceed. Okay, so here a bit more detailed look at these Havana-Frasansky functors. So we're in the setting of the bike-graded Javana-Fosansky homology for GLN. This is a categorification of this polynomial Pn. I said there they send links to chain complexes and link cobordisms to chain maps. Well, it's actually not quite true. It's actually not quite true. What you use to model this category of links and cobordisms up to isotopy is actually a category of link diagrams. And the morphisms are given by movies of diagrams, which are then considered up to certain moves, which encode the isotopy of link coordinates. So that's some kind of a combinatorial model for this topological category. And on those, Ravana-Rosansky homology is defined, has this target that I've already mentioned, and the commutative. That I've already mentioned, and the commutativity of the square involving the graded Euler characteristic and the polynomial Pn encodes that this is a categorification of Pn. And let's recall what is actually required to define such a functor based on this category of diagrams and movies of diagrams. Well, there are three steps involved. In the first step, you're supposed to provide a chain complex for every link diagram. Chain complex for every link diagram. So, this was for this construction was already done in the paper by Huanov and Rosansky in 2004. And then, using different technology based on this OBR-Wagner forms, we can give a slightly more combinatorial looking definition of such a chain complex. That's the step, first step. Then one dimension up, we have to associate a chain map to every elementary movie between link diagram. movie between link diagrams. The elementary movies consist of radomeister moves. So we have to provide chain maps of radomeister moves. And we have to provide chain maps for cups, caps and saddles. These are the Morse moves. And then if you have a more complicated link coborism, you can chop it up into pieces. Every piece will look like a randomized move or one of these Morse moves, and you can compose the corresponding chain maps to build a Chain maps to build a composite chain map for the composite cobordism. And then at the third stage, you have to check that this assignment respects isotopy of link cobordisms. So you have to check certain relations. This card aside to movie moves. And I'll show you one example here. So here we see a movie of tangle diagrams. We see four strands that cross. See four strands that cross each other in the shape of a half twist. There should be nine pictures with eight moves between them, and the picture on the left should be equal to the picture on the right. So as you go from the left to the right or from the right to the left, you see a sequence of eight Raidermeister III moves. And these composition of eight Raidermeister III moves illustrates or models a link cobordism which is actually. A link cobordism, which is actually isotopic to the identity. In some sense, this is just somehow wiggling these four strands around and then coming back to the original position. And this movie move somehow expresses that this composition should be considered as isotopic to the identity. And so in the movie move check, we have to show that the composite of these eight driver-meister three chain maps is actually homotopic to the identity map. Well, that's the flavor of the check that has to be performed here. That has to be performed here. And once you've done this, you know that this is a functor that fits into this commutative square at the top. And as a byproduct, this Kovano-Rozansky homology can now be considered as diagram independent in a way, because somehow for every possible diagram of the link, you have some representation, and then you have a coherent system of isomorphisms between them corresponding to moves between different diagrams for the same link. And we've made this a bit more precise and a bit more formal. Precise and a bit more formal in this paper as well. Okay, so why am I going through this again? It's because when we want to extend this to a full manifold invariant, we encounter a subtlety. So recall that the goal was that we should be able to recover the link homology by evaluating on the floor ball with the link in the boundary. Well, that only makes sense if the thing on the right-hand side. If the thing on the right-hand side is actually well defined as a link invariant for links in the three sphere. But the previous functionality result was for links in the three ball or in R3. Now that seems like a minor difference, but it's actually quite important. And to see where this comes in, we have to go through these three steps of constructing the link homology. So chain complexes, chain maps, and movie move checks. So I think of the three sphere as the three ball with the point. The three-sphere as the three ball with the point at infinity added, and if we consider links in the three-sphere, generically they will be disjoint from this point at infinity. So let's restrict to this generic case, and then we can just assign the same chain complex that we would assign to the link in B3. So that level is completely fine. A link cobordism in three-sphere times interval is a two-dimensional submanifold. Two-dimensional submanifold and generically it avoids this one-dimensional fiber over the point at infinity. So the two dimensions of link cobordisms, you want to intersect this with one-dimensional fiber over the point infinity, where we are in a four-manifold. So generically, this linkobordism will avoid this. Let's restrict to that case and assign the same chain map that we would do in the three-ball. But now we look at But now we look at, we reach the third stage where we have to check moving moves. And there we consider isotopies of link cobordisms. So those are three-dimensional objects that live on a five manifold as three times interval squared. And now they might actually, so in a generic situation, they will actually intersect this fiber over the point of infinity, which is now two-dimensional. And whenever. And whenever an isotopy of a link cobordism somehow has such an intersection, it somehow points to the issue that this isotopy might actually not exist in the three-ball. So you might get new isotopes for the three-sphere that you don't see in the three-ball. And that means that you have some new movie moves to check if you want to extend this invariant to the three-sphere. You want to extend this invariant to the three-sphere. And the problem, or somehow the challenge, here, is that this new movie move is non-local when viewed from the three-ball or from the perspective of link diagrams. But we can argue that these new movie moves that we have to check somehow are all of the following type. So here's a movie that involves a one-one-tangle T that can be arbitrarily complex. And then you have Complex. And then you have an arc that goes out very far and somehow gets close to this point at infinity. And then this tangle starts a jump rope exercise. And somehow it swings this closure arc a few minutes degrees around. So that you can think of somehow circling around the point at infinity. It's a tiny circle around the point at infinity. And if you are in the three-sphere, then you can isotope this thing through the point at infinity. Infinity and this entire cobordism of 360-degree rotation is isotopic to the identity. So, in a sense, somehow the jumping rope thing is not very athletic in the three-sphere. But that means that somehow for every instance of this move, so for every tangle, we have to check that this composition of lots and lots of randomized moves gives a chain map that is homotopic to the identity. So, this was the So this was one reason why it took much longer than maybe initially expected to define this invariance, this kind of additional momentum move that has to be checked. But that's something we do in this 2019 paper. So prove that Kovan-Frasansky homology is invariant under the sweep around move. That's the name that we have for this kind of thing. And thus is a functorial invariant in the three-sphere. In the three-sphere. So, I want to say a little bit about how this is proved in the paper. There are several steps. So, the first step is that, I mean, we have to prove this for every 1,1 tangle. But the first step says we can reduce to the case where the 1-1 tangle has the following presentation. It's a braid. And then not everything is closed, but somehow only all but one strands in the braid are closed. And then there's one strand left open. And then there's one strand left open, and that's the thing that does the jumping rope thing. Okay. And somehow this reduction step uses the functionality of the tangle invariant for Kohn-Marsh-Sansky homology, which is also established in this paper with Vigal and Daniel. The next reduction step is that instead of showing that the 360 degree rotation is trivial, we show that rotating 180 degrees in front is the same thing as rotating 180 degrees. thing as rotating 180 degrees around the back of the tangle and then we have to compare um these somehow we have to compare two chain maps and both and they have very similar descriptions so it's illustrated as a movie here we start with this almost break closure closed again we perform a little rademeister one move here that creates some horizontal strand like this and now this horizontal strand moves down and first Moves down. And first it passes these caps. And so we have to do some randomized two moves. Then we move this horizontal strand further down and it passes in front or in the back of this braid. So this is a lot of Radermeister III moves. And then at the end, we have to perform some Radomaster II moves. And at the end, we have to undo a Radomaster I move. And here I haven't drawn any crossings because I really want to consider both options. I really want to consider both options: the one where the horizontal strand passes in front of the rest, and the version where the horizontal strand passes around the back of the rest. And so we want to prove that these maps are homotopic. And then what we do is we notice that there is an additional filtration on all of these complexes, which is somehow given by the homological degree of the resolution that are coming from the extra crossings. Coming from the extra crossings that are created in this process. Some of the crossings that are not part of the braid already. And with respect to that filtration, we can look at the Riedermeister 3 chain maps and we filter the Reidemeister 3 chain maps using this additional filtration. And we note that somehow in the associated gradient, the maps look exactly the same. At least somehow this middle portion looks exactly the same if we do it in the front or in the back. Then we argue that if such a map is flanked by Reidemeister 2, Is flanked by Rademeister II and Rademeister I maps, then only the associated graded of the Radomeister III chain maps actually play a role in whatever this thing is. And as a consequence, those chain maps are actually equal. They're not just homotopic, they're actually equal on the nose, which was a surprise. So in the case of almost break closures, the sweep around move holds on the nose. Okay, so that's enough about link invariants. Are there any questions or should I go on? Paul, yeah, can you say again what is an almost pre-closure? Yeah, so braid, and then all except one strand are closed. So for example, so that in this picture, you have, here's the braid, and then, I mean, here you see all strands are closed, but they're different, they're closed in different ways. But they're different, they're closed in different ways. So, the almost braid closure would be the braid together with these round closed strands. And then somehow we have two: we have one additional strand coming out of the top, one additional strand coming into the bottom, and that produces a one-one tangle. That's what I meant by almost braid closure. So braid closure on almost all strands, except one. Make sense? Makes sense. Yeah, thanks. All right. Other questions? So, all these homologies are colored or uncolored? Uncolored. Uncolored. It's interesting to consider the colored version, but we didn't. But your result with Michael and Daniel is for colored. Like one of the colored. But this thing is only established for uncolored. This is only established for the uncolored. This is only established for the uncolored case. Yeah, exactly. And is this SLN homology? This is SLN homology. And I was asked whether this also works for the triple-grade homology. But I still don't know. But it's an interesting question. I mean, and you see, I mean, these illustrations here, they use circle calculus. So somehow everything that happens in the middle here probably works for the triplicate homology, but I haven't thought. Triple-graded homology, but I haven't thought carefully what happens with the randomized one moves. So, yeah, it's possible that it also works as a trip-graded thing. Okay, I am going to continue to higher categories. So, here we use that the construction of Wano-Forsansky homology using foams is local. So, you can actually So, you can actually define an invariant for tangled diagrams and then also cobordisms of tangles or movies of tangled diagrams. And the notation that I'm going to use is this Kovano-Wozansky bracket. And now we take values not in chain complexes or vector spaces, but rather chain complexes over some additive category, namely the additive category of GLN phones, so some open version of the GLN. Version of the GLN form category that we saw yesterday. And so this again this combinatorial category of tangle diagrams and movies of diagrams of two movie moves that models the category of tangles embedded in the three ball and comportism in three ball times interval up to isotopy rel boundary. And the diagram is commutative if you put here the Rashidikin-Derive tangle invariant. And here And here on the right, we take the representation category of the quantum group somehow in its incarnation as waves. So, following Kaudis Kamlitz and Morrison and the usual web story. Okay, and what we do in this paper then is to somehow notice that whenever you have such a functorial tangle invariant, you can build a rated monoidal. A graded monoidal two category with duals which has objects given by tangle boundary sequences. Then one morphisms are tangled diagrams, so they map from one boundary sequence maybe here at the bottom to boundary sequence at the top. And spaces of two morphisms from a tangle T1 to a tangle T2 are basically given by the space of morphisms. Space of morphisms between the Holano-Rosansky bracket invariance of these two tangles. And here they're computed in the cohomology category, the category of chain complexes over this form category. Here I should say that the notion of braided monoidal two categories has a long and complicated history that maybe starts with the work of Kapranov Wojotsky, has then changed slightly by Changed slightly by Baes and Neuge, and then further elaborated on by Day and Street. Day and Street found that somehow between break monoidal two categories and symmetric monoidal two categories, there's an intermediate layer called syllabic monoidal two categories. It's all very interesting. And then somehow this definition got changed once more by Krantz. So, and that's what we use here. And there's actually a bit more to say about this braided monoidal. To say about this braided monoidal 2 category coming from this tangle invariant, namely, it has duals. And again, there are various different notions of duals on braided monoidal 2 categories. And the thing that we found models what we have here best follows a paper by Barrett, Moisburger, and Schauman. And actually, the thing that we get satisfies a bit more. It satisfies somehow an analogue of the free. An analog of the frame dynamized the one move and it satisfies the sweep around move. So you could call this a ribbon two category, but that's not established terminology. So it's just what it is. It's what you get from this tangled invariant. Is there any way to make sense of this without taking the cogamology the last step? That would be lovely. That's something that will appear on the next slide. That would be fantastic. That would be fantastic. On the left-hand side, you would like to get rid of this isotopy assumption. You would just somehow not mould out by these isotopes, you would just somehow appreciate that they're there and you would consider them up to higher isotopes and so on, ad infinitum. And then it would be nice to get rid of the cohomology here. And then it would be nice to somehow replace this linear here by PG. Yeah, that would be great. That would be great. I've started thinking in this direction, but nothing to report yet. Okay, so let me actually see a bit more in this direction. So now you could ask the question whether this spreaded monodel 2 category or something similar, something closely related or some modification of this, is a 4 dualizable and SO4 fixed object in a suitably defined five-dimensional category. Find five-dimensional category of braided monado two categories. The relevance of this question is that this is somehow what the cobordism hypothesis would predict would be the ingredient for on a point for an extended, partially defined five-dimensional field theory, like I had it on the first slide. Yeah, I don't know if that's true. That's true. Probably it requires some modifications. I don't know what the exact role of the sweeparound move is in terms of SO4 homotopy fixed point data. I would love to know. And as Lava mentions, there's this very interesting question of whether this can be made homotopy coherent. So somehow working on a level of chain complexes rather than homology. That would be really interesting. Okay, so if this is true, then you could give a somehow bottom-up. A somehow bottom-up construction of this extended TFT starting from the point. What we do in the paper is somehow going the opposite direction. We look at the four-dimensional part and then somehow think about going down from the four-dimensional part later. And I should also mention, related to Slava's question, that this works on the level of homology. So in this category, we've already taken homology of these chain complexes, or we've taken, we've Or we've proceeded to the bounded homotropy category here. And that's an important caveat. Okay, our result is that Hovano-Rosansky homology controls a disclaimer for category. That's an alternative axiomatization to the spreaded monodel 2 category thing that I had on the previous slide. And this is well adapted to construct four-manifold invariants using the blob complex that Kevin and Scott. That Kevin and Scott introduced in around 2010. And this produces triply graded abelian groups that we denote SN for a pair of four manifolds and link in the boundary, which may be empty. And the nice thing about this blob complex is that it has some additional grading, this blob grading. And for the rest of the talk, I want to focus on the degree zero part of the blob homology. Um, of this of the blob homology, because this thing really has an interpretation as a scan module. Okay, so let's somehow work our way towards the scan module for four manifolds. And I want to use again the analogy with the three-dimensional situation. There we had a three-manifold with a set of points in the boundary, and we formed the skin module from framed-oriented tangles here. Intertangles here moduled over this ring of Laurent polynomials, and then we model it out by certain local relations. And now I want to use a slightly more conceptual interpretation of these local relations, namely by being given by the kernel of the Rashid-Tikin-Turayev tangle functor. So I'm basically asking what sort of linear combinations of tangles get sent to zero under the Rashid-Tikin-Turayev functor. And Rashid-Tikin-Turi functor associates to such tangles. Tangles, certain intertwiners of representations, they live in a vector space. So I can ask which linear combinations are zero. And those are the skin relations. Those are the things that I want to impose as local relations here. Now we want to do something similar in four dimensions based on one Rusansky homology. So as a first thing, we could consider an abelian group. An abelian group freely generated by framed-oriented surface in the four-manifold with boundary L, and then model out by some relations. And the relations we want to consider are somehow in the kernel of the Hovan-Brushansky bracket. So certain linear combinations of pieces of surface that would be sent to zero under. Would be sent to zero under the Kovanov-Rosansky cobolism maps. That's not sent to linear combination of Kovanov-Rosansky coborism maps, which are zero. So that's the idea. The problem is that this will not satisfy the thing that we set out to do, namely to be able to recover Javana-Rosansky homology by evaluating on the full ball with L in the boundary. And the reason is that this would require the Javana-Rozansky homology. The Javana-Rosansky homology of any link to be spanned by the images of cobordism maps, and that's just not true. So, surfaces are not enough. We need to consider certain decorated surfaces in the four-manifold as our skeins in the skein module. So, how does the scale module then actually look like? What are the skeins? The skeins are called lasagna fillings of the four-manifold. The terminology somehow comes Terminology somehow comes from the subfactor and planar algebra school, who like to think of the planar diagrams as spaghetti and meatball diagrams. So here we're a few dimensions up, and our pasta is two-dimensional, so we call them Lasagna fillings. And they consist of the, so we have to, we start with a four-manifold and the link in the boundary. And Lasagna filling in this setting consists of the following data. Consists of the following data. So, first of all, we cut out a finite number of disjoint four balls from the interior of the four manifold. So I've cut them out here. Sorry, this picture is three-dimensional or it tries to be three-dimensional, but you should think of it as four-dimensional. So we cut these balls out. That creates some new three-sphere boundary components. In those components, you're allowed to put links li. You're allowed to put links li, and each link li comes equipped with a label by a homology class in the invariant of that link li. Okay, so this li lives in a three-sphere, so there's one of a sky homology of that link, and we're supposed to give one homology class for each of these inputs. And the final missing ingredient is the pasta, is the lasagna sheet, framed-oriented surface sigma that lives in That lives in the four manifold minus the four balls that I've cut out and intersects the boundary transversely exactly in the links and inducing the correct orientation and framing on the links. So that's somehow our model for skeins. So you should think those are surfaces in the four manifold with boundary L, but they carry sort of local decoration. So some pieces of the surface have been cut out. cut out and wherever you've created such a cut you should decorate it with a homology class of the of the knot that you've created. That's kind of the idea. So those are skeins. Now I have to say what the skein relation is that we put on these things or on linear combinations of such things and that uses the notion of a lasagna algebra. A lasagna algebra A lasagna algebra is an algebra for the lasagna operate. And okay, so here we claim that Kovana-Rosansky homology is such a Lasagna algebra. Samia algebra consists of the following things. So for every link in the three-sphere, we have to associate an abelian group or a vector space. And for us, this will just be the link homology. And then. And then we also have to specify, so Lasagna algebra also specifies operations that somehow take several inputs and produce one output and are compatible under somehow contractions of these operations. And the operations that we consider are indexed by so-called Lasagna diagrams. So they look very much like the Lasagna fillings that I have on the previous slide, with two differences. With two differences. First of all, every Lasagna diagram somehow looks like a Lasagna filling for the four-ball, not for a general four-manifold. And the second difference is that the input links now don't have to be decorated by homology classes. Okay, so the Lasagna diagram consists of a four-ball with some smaller four-balls that are rolled out. There's a link on the outside boundary, there's links on the inside boundaries, and then there's a surface that connects them. To such a gadget, a Lasagna algebra assigns a map from the tensor product of the input vector spaces or abelian groups to the output vector space or abelian group. And it's parameterized by this diagram D. And then we, whenever you have two such pictures and they're suitably compatible, you can shrink one and feed it into the input of another one, of the other one. And then the corresponding maps between these tensor products have to compose in the corresponding. Products have to compose in the corresponding way. So, in that sense, this is an algebra for a colored operator. Okay, and to, I should say why Kovano-Frasansky homology is a Lasagna algebra. So this is actually a bit tricky again. If you only have the single input sphere, so if this is a unary operation, then this is easy because then the four-ball minus the smaller four-ball is diffeomorphic. Minus the smaller four ball is diffeomorphic to the three-sphere times an interval. And we just use the functorality of Homer-Posanski homology in the three-sphere to create this cobordism map. If we have several different, several such input spheres, we're up at first, we first have to do something. And what we do is we just pick some tree, some one-dimensional C-W complex in the four-manifold minus the point. In the four-manifold minus the points, and then we use this to tube the spheres together. Okay, so we drill out a neighborhood of this tree to tube the spheres together. That will somehow transform this small spheres, the links, into a big sphere where these input links appear as a split disjoint union. And then we use the monodality of Kovano-Fosanski homology if we work over a field or if we work over a Over a field, or if we work over the integers, we have to use the Laxmo modality of Lana-Rosansky homology to create a single link from that. And then we're in the situation of one input sphero, and we use the normal functorality. But now we run into a problem, right? Because we chose this tree. And if you move the tree, you might get a different map. So we have to study what happens if you move the tree. And as you move the tree, it somehow sweeps out. move the tree, it somehow sweeps out a two-dimensional surface in this four-manifold and it can intersect the surface sigma. So we have to study what happens at an intersection of moving the tree and hitting the surface. And it turns out that the local situation there is exactly modeled by the sweep around move again. So it makes another appearance. And because it holds for one of Rosansky homology, we don't get a problem here. So somehow this is another interesting occurrence of this move. Okay, so that's Okay, so that's by the way, if you have a link homology theory that's not Havana-Fosansky homology, but it happens to be lax monoidal and functorial for links in the three-sphere, you can run the same construction. So that's very similar. Okay, so recall this is very similar to a lasagna filling, except that the lasagna filling also had some input that had the link. Some input, I had the input links decorated by homology classes, by such a tuple of homology classes. And now, suppose I have a Lasagna filling for the four-ball, then I have such a Lasagna diagram plus this tuple. The Lasagna diagram gives me this map, and I can now apply the map to the tensor product of these vectors, and I will get a single Kovano-Rosansky homology class for the output link by construction. Construction. That's what we're using the skin relation. So we define the skin module as the span, the set span of all the signal fillings of the four manifold. Modulo the relation that if I take such a filling and then I cut out, say I find this a sphere that I find a four ball that contains some of these inputs for. That contains some of these inputs for balls and is somehow in generic enough position so that when I cut it out, I see another Lasagna filling with a larger input ball with a new input link here. Then I'm allowed to identify these Lasagna fillings if I decorate the result with the homology class V that arises by evaluating this Lasagna algebra, sorry, the Lasagna algebra map corresponding to this. Algebra map corresponding to this interior of this thing D, all the input vectors Vi, Vj, and so on. So that somehow models the kernel of the Kovano-Rosansky functor. But those two things you want to consider as equal because they are related by these Kovano-Rosansky-Coborrising marks. So that's the equivalence relation. Okay, so what is this thing? So it's a graded abelian group, and it's graded by And it's graded by, well, there's a Q grading, the standard Q grading in link homology. There's a homological grading, again, the standard homological grading in link homology. And then we have an additional grading by the relative second homology of the four-manifold Reldis link, because every Lasagna filling represents one of these relative homology classes. So here we have second homology, relative second homology with integer coefficients. Might be able to do something similar. You might be able to do something similar with SL2 homologies, ordinary Kirbano homology, but then you would have to take set mod2 coefficients. And maybe you can also do something like this for an SLN homology rather than GLN, but then you would maybe have to work with set mod and set homology. So this is also why the GLN setting is convenient here. We can work with integral homology. Okay, so I'll come to an end very soon. On the slide, I should give you some examples because some of Give you some examples because somehow, when you only see this definition, it looks quite unwieldy. Maybe the first example that we already had in the paper was that if you evaluate this on the four ball with a link in the boundary, you now do indeed get back the link homology, which is good. The next example that we considered is the three ball times S1. And if you set n equal to 2, then we would expect that we can. We would expect that we get something that is closely related to Rosansky's link homology theory for links in S2 times S1. It's not going to be exactly the same thing. There might be a spectral sequence relating to two. And this is related to the fact that somehow here we take homology twice. We take homology on this morphism level and then we take blob homology again. And then Rosansky's theory is somehow identifying these two homological gradings. And so maybe that's. Ratings. And so maybe that's a spectral sequence. Yeah. And now, I mean, if such a relationship exists, it's somehow also very, it somehow makes plausible why this invariant works best for null homologous links. Well, because they have to bound lasagna fillings. Okay, and the coolest result, the coolest computational result about these skin modules is due to Manolesko and Aethelv. To Manolesko and Eifelev from last year. And I can't resist mentioning this here. So if you have, if W is a two-handle body, so built from a four-ball, a single four-ball, by attaching two handles along a framed link L. Then they show that you can compute the scheme module of this four-manifold with empty link in the boundary as the Covan. As the Kovana, as what they call the cable Kovano-Fusansky homology of the attaching link L. And that boils down to understanding... So the fantastic thing about this result is that it somehow computes, it reduces the computation of this manifold invariant to the computation of some link invariance in the three-sphere. And concretely, it boils down to understanding. To understanding somehow colored version, somehow colored Kuvano-Frasansky homologies of certain cables of the attaching link together with certain cobordisms between them. So whenever you have different cables of this link and some of the strands run in opposite directions, you can have annuli mapping between them. And these cabled cobanes, for example, And these cabled Kovan-Wosansky homologies are constructed from the homologies of the cables glued along certain annular covarisant numbers. And this theorem allows them to compute some of these invariants. For example, for S2 times D2, note that this is a four-manifold that also has boundary S2 times S1. They compute what. The computer, what the space is, and the dimension is given by this generating function. And this is, you might recognize this as the generating function counting young diagrams with at most n minus one rows. So this somehow cries for representation theoretic interpretation. And they also compute or partially compute invariance for CP2 and CP2 bar. So that involves. So that involves computations of one of homology of torus links with more and more strands. So this is something that lots of people in this audience will like. And then also maps between them and glue them together. And they conclude that the invariants for CP2 and CP2 bar are different. So, in some sense, this invariant at least somehow is able to distinguish orientations on four manifolds. It's open. It's open whether this invariant detects some other useful data. It's open whether it detects most structures. There are lots of interesting questions, and I think I'll stop here. Thanks. All right. Thank you. Let's thank Paul. So I see some people have their hands up. Slava specifically told me he was having technical trouble. Specifically, he told me he was having technical trouble raising his hand, but he wanted to make sure he was able to ask a question. Sorry, just having a question. Sorry. Paul, you made this comment that you could apply this to any functorial theory. And for not floor homology, there are all the stin C structures and so on. But what happens when you apply there? Can you recover the HF plus of the format info or something like that? I don't know. I honestly don't know. But I'd love to know. I haven't thought about it. Know, but I'd love to know. I haven't thought about it. Great, thanks. All right, Calvin? Is there like a, sorry this isn't your result, but is there like a short version of why you need to look at the cables of L instead of just L for this last result? I mean, so I should say somehow this result and things related to it is probably deserves its own talk. Deserves its own talk, but I can say a little bit. Yeah, so you could have, so say you have a two-handle attached to the four ball. Now you could have somehow pieces of lasagna moving over that handle. And the idea is if you so you can you can remove the two handle by cutting it at its co-core. And somehow, if there's some lasagna, somehow if there's some lasagna that intersects the co-core you will create some boundary link but now the lasagna can isotope over somehow over the co-core and so you can see different numbers of intersections there and so you would also see somehow different numbers of cablings but they have to be related because you have this isotopy across the co-core so it's like when you when you cut through the lasagna you produce more noodles and you have to keep track of these and we're boundary noodles yes exactly yeah thanks Yeah, thanks. Okay, Eugene. So I have kind of a technical question. So if you do all this lasagna construction with webs and phones instead of links and smooth surfaces, like would this work or there are some issues? Because like, yeah. I think that the construction should extend to a functor. To a functorial, so a functorial invariant of tangled webs and tangled foams between them in 4D. I would expect an upgrade of this functorality of the tangled invariant to such an invariant of tangled webs and then framed forms between them. But it's not been done yet. So, once this is done, once we have such a well-defined invariant, yeah, sure, you can try to run this construction. Structure? No, I think I'm asking about like simplification. So instead of working with links, you kind of work with diagrams and you work with flat webs and kind of converted forms. So like I want to avoid working with complexes and work with kind of just forms and webs directly, but I'm not sure if I'm phrasing the equation correctly. Yeah, I think in that case, I'm not sure if you have to, but it would be very convenient to get rid of this construction because then you could somehow work in a then you could you could somehow work in a in a tg world from the start and there you would be able to resolve all the complexes in terms of planar things yeah right but like i mean if i just want to work with planar things then i don't need complexes and you don't need complexes but i think you won't get the same thing in this setup i think you you need to modify it i see because you can't like say what is a web draw what is a form drawn for manifold that's the issue basically that like for a standard form picture For a standard form picture, like where everything is flat and embedded, you need just the standard four space. So, I think the issue is that somehow, once we go to this Lasagna operad, it's an operat valued in vector spaces. And there you cannot resolve complexes by planning things anymore. You would have to somehow upgrade this to the GG setting throughout, and then you could resolve. That's what I don't think it's a problem with tang or with phones. With tango or with phones or webs. I think it's more like the different enrichment that you need. So basically, nothing is planar in this picture, and you can't make it planar. That's the issue. Exactly, yeah. Serge? Thanks for a very nice talk, Paul. I have a quick question regarding S1 process 2, which you mentioned at various points. At various points, so it's natural to ask whether luck twist is detected or expected to be detected. Might be the wrong person to ask. Yeah, I see. Yeah, I don't know. I would have to think about this. I would have to think about this. I would have to first think about what the question means, and then I would have to somehow think about it. But I mean, this is a question of what you associate to S1 cross S2, and then since you mentioned mapping class group action several times, it's obviously an element. So the question is how this particular element acts on what you associate to S1 crosses. Okay, very good. So somehow I was focusing on the four-dimensional part. So I don't know. So here I was not proposing to associate. So, here I was not proposing to associate anything to S2 times S1. But if you believe that something like this works, or where was it to here, like this letter works, then you would associate some kind of DG category to S2 times S1. But we're not there yet. And some are there, you could ask these questions. I think Manrisco has a result about. I think Manuresko has some result about luck twist, and the result is we do not detect that this lasig. So at least his version of invariant doesn't detect. Yeah, yeah. So I should mention this. So this is work of Manuel Lesku, Maren Gong, Sharker and Willis, I think. And they construct a version of the S invariant for certain formats, for links in the. Four manifolds for links in the value of certain four manifolds. And I expect this to be related to this construction, but I don't know exactly how. Yeah, I was just going to ask, I don't know if it's directly related, maybe to print and comment on it. That would be helpful. Okay. Hi. Well, okay. So for the Rasmussen invariant, you need Lee homology, right? So you need some extension of this to Lee homology. And I thought about this. And I thought about this a little bit. Like, I mean, you can define everything you said with Li instead of Hovanov, but then it's not clear that there's a spectral sequence from the Hovanov scale Lasagna algebra to the Li scale Lasagna algebra. At least not in this version. Exactly. Yeah. So, well, I'm not sure, but let me just mention one thing. Our proof is just about the S invalid. Is just about the S invariant from SL2. So I don't know if it's, I mean, it would be interesting to generalize it to SLN or GLN. Yeah, so sorry, that's all I have to say. No great, thanks. Okay. Doesn't that use the version of Rosansky-Willis chromology for S1 versus two? Is that do you think that how is that related to this Key Lazania story? For this even bosagna story, question for me, Archiban. I mean, I mean, our version, yes, our S invariant in S1 times S2 exactly uses Rosansky-Willis homology. But yeah, I think it's slightly different from the Lasani algebra. I mean, as Paul said, so maybe he can say more about that. Could I? Could I just comment on Erasmus and type invariance in this setting? I would predict that there is one and that hopefully a paper by me and Paul will appear in a few months. It's mostly a technical issue. If for some reason we could work with just SL2 cavanohomology in sort of an old-fashioned way, and we can't do that because we haven't proved the sweeparound move in that context. But if we could, That context. But if we could, then there's a way of approaching Rasmus very which generalizes very easily to four manifolds. And Paul mentioned this grading according to the second homology of the four-manifold. And one would be able to get genus bounds in each homology class of a minimal or maximal Euler characteristic, minimal genus representative of each homology class. So I think the challenges. I think the challenges for extending that to this Kavanaugh-Roman Rosansky case, maybe just for GL2, are fairly technical. And so I'm optimistic that that can be done. Alexei. Yeah, thanks for a beautiful talk. It's really exciting. I have a question about like you had the slides. I have a question about like you had the slides with slide with the uh braided monoidal two category. So that that slide, um, yeah, that one. So, um, basically, if you do instead of a salon homology, just usual the Havana-Frasansky homology, the Zurgle stuff, which many people like, so uh, clearly you wouldn't have anything with duals. You know, you would be the problem would be getting duals, right? So that would be the biggest. And the other structure would be there, so or. The structure would be there? So, or so, what I think so. You can run the same thing with tangles. So, I think you just get again a braided monodel 2 category in the same way. You would have some dualizability somehow. Okay, I could wave my hand now in some direction, but as you mentioned, what you don't have is somehow the braids always point up. You cannot bend back down. You don't have any cups and caps in your tank. Have any cups and caps in your tangle diagrams, and your braid diagrams. So, yeah, that restriction exists. Yeah, so I would expect somehow, I think one can use this to build certain flavors of TFTs, but you're probably going to hit some wall at extending. Some wall at extending it, and I don't know, depending on which dimension you start in, because you're missing some realizability, at least if you follow a similar strategy as here. But for example, sorry, for example, what you could do, whenever you have a braided monomedal two category, you can use factorization homologies and have the standard version of factorization homology to integrate that over two manifolds. So you can get two kinds. You can get two category-valued invariants of surfaces. And you could, I don't know, speculate that if you start with circle by modules, somehow finite circle, somehow for the finite symmetric group, and you start integrating this using factorization homology of an annulus to get something like extended affine circle by modules that I couldn't imagine. That I can imagine. I see. I'm not sure whether it's relevant or not, but somehow if you do something like take a braid group and kill the full twist, then you get this dualizable. It's like, you know, braid, it's a braid group on sphere, on two spheres. Then things come back to being dualizable. Is there any use of this, or it's probably kind of too much, too brutal? So that would sound like somehow integrated. That would sound like somehow integrating over the two-sphere. I don't know what I don't know. I mean, this is probably a relevant computation for establishing some sort of dualizability, but I don't know much about this. Okay. Well, thanks. Yeah, great. Thanks for the talk. All right. I think we can declare that the end of the official question period and thank Paul again. And I'm just posting the link for the gather.
