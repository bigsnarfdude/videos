For fifteen minutes. I will give you a two-minute warning. How's that? And then after that, it has to cease when it's fifteen minutes. I wish I had an annoying sound to play when it's actually 15 minutes. Here to support the. Oh, sure, just jump in on that reason. Okay, there we go. We'll be on this side. I'll be on this side. We'll just be.  Okay, game. Right, so we are group one, mathematical reasoning in everyday life. I've been nominated to describe our work for the week. Our group includes Taras, who had to leave this morning early. That includes. Early. That includes Asia, Kelly, Yana, and Yaroslav. So, as I talk, folks, just chime in as we go. All right. So, start for the big question. How do you design a carbon-neutral energy system to power your house neighborhood or town? So, I'll give you a minute to think about it. You have 15 minutes, right? This is one of them. Yes. Well, I would start with a list of questions. How much power do I need to generate? How much will I consume? How much power do you need? How much will you consume? What kind of sources can we plug in? There's a million questions that come up before we even start trying to solve the problem. And even the problem doesn't quite make sense. What do we mean by carbon neutral? Are we going to choose house neighborhood or town? What does it mean design? What does it mean design? So, our approach, so our answer is 20. 20. That is the answer to our big question. So, I mean, in more detail, the question is too hard. Let's brainstorm. What are we actually talking about? Let's simplify, make assumptions, identify constraints. So, let's state the problem a little more clearly based on some constraints. So, how many solar powders do we actually need to power our house? How much power does the solar power generate? How much energy does the house used? To generate, how much energy do people have to use? All these kinds of things in an organized, systematic way, bouncing back and forth between problem statements, making assumptions constraint, identifying what we know and don't know, building solutions, communicating results. If we don't like what we get, we go back again and we reiterate through all those points. And then we generate a list of questions of analyzing our model. You know, we didn't consider space, we didn't consider budgets, we didn't consider all these other things, and then we communicated our result. So that's the idea of what we're after. That's the idea of what we're after. So, our guiding questions for the week is: what is mathematical reasoning in everyday life? We couldn't define it. So, if we can't define it, then can we identify its characteristics? Can we know it when we see it? Is mathematical reasoning in everyday life just mathematical modeling? Is it the same as numeracy? Is it a combination of the two? Is it an intersection? I guess it doesn't really matter what it is. We just identify what we want to do. What do we want students to learn? What explicit skills do we want them to learn? Learn what explicit skills do we want them to gain. Our guiding principles for the week, after lots of discussion about learning objectives, to be research, exploration, play, and practice, but grounded in a systematic approach so that we always have something to hold on to so that we don't float away untethered. There's no unique solution in numeracy or mathematical modeling, and numeracy modeling, and what we're trying to do is not about the calculation, but in the interpretation of the results. So, these were our guiding principles, sources of inspiration. When we started talking about this, Sources of inspiration. When we started talking about this, I just recently designed a new course on mathematical modeling, and there's a SIAM mathematical modeling handbook that took some diagrams from. And then just principles of active learning with learning and teaching. So just kind of marrying these things together. After a lot of discussion about mathematical reasoning is, what numeracy is, what are we trying to accomplish, skills, learning goals, we have to focus. So our idea was to try and design a new course, this fictitious, numerous things. New course, this fictitious, numerous thing society, clues to some learning goals, explicit skills for students to learn, and design some active learning guides for instructors. Like, you want to get in the classroom, what do you actually do? So, this is our idea for course design. It's just a lot of bullet points. Yeah. So, our learning goals are describe the steps in the mathematical modeling process, construct a mathematical model, and we were using mathematical representation throughout the week until we changed the word representation to model. The word representation to model. Mathematical model of an observation, evaluate the validity, quality, and complexity of a mathematical model, generate insights, document, communicate. Can I? I think for us, the most important detail was that the goal was not, we did not have a preconceived set of mathematical, and by that we mean like technical mathematical concepts. Mathematical concepts, mathematical techniques, that's not predetermined. That is certainly not in our list of things that we're trying to get to. Instead, the goal was what do you do when you see a big question? And to guide people through things that can take you on the path towards finding some sort of solution, which we went through a lot about. We went through a lot about is not always quantitative. Though we love quantitative stuff, so we want to guide that, and maybe a quantitative answer might be more specific, might be more appropriate in certain situations. And so just navigating that whole space was part of what's important. And a lot of the constructing of the mathematical model is, yes, there's quantity. Model is yes, there's quantity involved, but there's a lot of defining, clearly stating, and justifying, proving, deciding. Right, and then the mathematics, the mathematical structures appear out of that, right? They aren't things that we're aiming towards. They're things that emerge organically as we're working on the big problems. So you could use the same problem with a different group of students in and come up with some different methods to learn. So we weren't aiming for linear models. Weren't aiming for linear models. You're aiming for solutions to these problems. Great. So, if you're not familiar with the mathematical modeling process, as in the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics Mathematic Guidebook, it's clearly stated the problem. Identify variables, parameters, but we don't need those words. We can just call them knowns and unknowns and make assumptions, constraints, build solutions, valuing, justifying k. So, this is from the SIM Mathematical Handbook, and it's a non-linear process. Process. It's cyclical, it's a connected graph of components where you can explore and play, start with something, see if it works, if it doesn't, figure out why, define a new way, new perspective, introduce new variables, take things out, find a solution, communicate your results, and it might be something completely different than what somebody else did, the exact same big question. The mathematical skills were after, I mean, we just took Bloom's taxonomy and just took every single word from it. Sort of word from it. Explore, formulate, define, identify, identify, simplify, visualize. But maybe I'll slow down a bit. We had a lot of discussion about what we want students to learn, and we had a lot of scale is not just one slide worth, but two. And, you know, if you're going to take a course like this, maybe you can simplify. I mean, we're all very, have our own ideas about what this would be. And so this is, I mean, one of our active learning activities for this course was a brain explosion. It's our mathematical. Our mathematical skills was our own kind of brain explosion as we were doing brainstorming activity. But you know, explore many possibilities, formulate clear and precise questions based on observations, define the objects in a mathematical model precisely. Identify what you know and don't know. Identify essential qualities that we'll talk about the, I won't get into that in a second. Okay, then simplify and visualize and apply a cycle. And Taras was big on the word jiggle. You said it, I'll tell him. Yeah, I've pretty much. You said it. I'll tell him. Yeah, I'll put it in. Yeah, jiggle between thinking spaces such as concrete and abstract, specific, and general. And I guess maybe jiggle between the steps of the mathematical modeling process. It's a non-linear thing. You're constantly making decisions about what you're about to do next, and you're using different parts of your brain. And you might be familiar with what is called mathematical habits of mine. Does this ring a bell? Yeah, no. So this is like from the 1990s, it was actually alcohol to other people, it's pretty. Alcohol to other people, it's pretty famous stuff. So the words were not just stolen from whom, but from Texas. Yeah, okay. We stole it from many places. Many places. Yeah. And then we want to identify math attitudes and perceptions and qualities that we want our students to gain in. So perseverance, play, confidence, and reflection. So we tried to come up with some design of what this course might look like. We structured it around big questions. So reinforcing the things that we observe in real life. That is the point. In real life, those that is the point. That is the thing we're holding on to. We're not starting off with this is a vector, this is a matrix, this is a differential equation. Now, let's go out and find something that fits in that box. It's the other way around. And then we want to reinforce a systematic approach because how many times have you had your students say, I have no idea where to start with? Well, let's start with step one. And then two, and then three to go back to two again. Adjust a little scaffolding, according to student prime knowledge and concern. Design learning activities based on active learning. And then there's an explicit human design that we try to identify. At human design that we tried to identify, maybe Lisa, you want to talk more quote because these are mostly your photo points. So, we had like a few things that we thought might be essential to have in this course as a way to guide instructors also. Like, here's, you know, a whole bunch of big questions, take your pick. And then, here are some things that we have figured out or have decided that are must be there. And one of them was like keeping a list. Keeping a list of ways, things that people said, Yeah, but what about this? Yeah, but you're not even considering this, yeah, right? All of those ideas that are going to come up. We just, they become part of the group of things and they get written down so they're validated. We might not look at them right now, but they are there as contributions. And so that was really. And so that was, we explored that a little bit more, and then we were, and then we, you know, we came to this. It's like important to recognize that we're all human beings in a room together, and we all have feelings, and we all have thoughts, and all of these things mixed together, and some people might be feeling annoyed, or defeated already with nothing, you know, I don't know what to do, and I don't want to be here, right? Or they might feel excited, or they want. Feel excited, or they want to share, or their brain is pinging, and they have all these ideas, right? And so, that was one of the things that we decided was important to have in this course was a recognition that we're all here with thoughts and feelings, and those are valid. Yeah, we wanted to make it into our instructional design. Right. These are explicit learning goals, so valid and to be explicitly recognized. To be explicitly recognized. And I would just think that that's like that's not independent to this course, right? That's a free course. We're all humans, and we have at least that feelings. But there's something about the big problems that makes that amplify, right? You don't get to not be a human if you're asking a problem about the world that you live in. It's really hard to abstract into that, okay, let's just work with vectors. It's like, okay, we're talking about a carbon neutral system and it has implications on my life. So that's, I think, yeah, important that that's not. That's not new either, but it is, I think, highlighted in this context. And so, some ideas of big questions that you would start off a learning activity with, like, should a city choose a car, congestion tax cards, should I invest in Bitcoin, is it profitable to buy lottery tickets? I mean, we took us like five minutes to come up with 10 or 20. You could just come up with many. And the point is, they're not well formed, they're not word problems, they're not leading, they're not. Word problems, they're not leading, they're not saying that this is probability. Make sure you remember your distributions, we're going to apply this later. It's very much just a very open question that they actually then have to do, step one, is actually define the problems. These are not problems, these are not specific, well-defined, precise statements. It's up to students to formulate those. They can go into the problem. And the word the, define the problem, it's really like there are 70,000 problems you could define from this. Pick one, but that pick one. Pick one, but that pick one part is so difficult for many students, right, to make a decision on their own without someone being told to make a decision. Absolutely. This decision. Yeah, so then we just borrowed lots of, you know, from our experiences in active learning, you know, deep brainstorming, compare share, gallery walk of problem statements, you know, big question, everybody writes a problem statement, everyone writes them on the board around, everyone takes a walk to see what everybody else has written, maybe form groups of people who have formed. Maybe form groups of people who have formed similar precise problem statements, brain explosion with refinement. You know, it's a brainstorming activity, but then you can filter down to what's most important based on agreed upon or not agreed upon values in the classroom. Solutions of varying complexity, novel forms of communication, get students to communicate the results of their models by TikTok or physicalization. Physicalization, different from a visualization, use a 3D printer. You know, use a 3D printer, mobile sculpture, some form, like a novel form of communication. All models are wrong. Let's take a look at a model, let's analyze it, evaluate it, find why it doesn't work. And then if we do this, how do we evaluate it? We want to measure math attitudes and perceptions before and after. Students create models before and after the semester and see how their models and their process change. Change over the course and then reviews students' metacognitive journals, really getting them to reflect on all these learning activities, doing the what, the so-what, and the now what. I don't have a question, I guess. One quick question. So, at the very beginning in your solution, there was the word typical, which involves statistics, measures of central tendency, how do you pick, etc. Can you say a word about that? Yeah, typical was the internet says. We just shortened that to typical. So, yeah, we just Googled it. Like, so it's such a, it's such a Such an immediate first answer. We ask some specific questions, the data that we need. We looked it up, we found some numbers that came from some website, we put it in. And then when we come to the analysis part, it's like, well, what does typical mean? Are we talking about, yeah, neighborhood, a house, like, and then all these questions come in afterwards. But if you start with all those questions first, you get nowhere. And so we oversimplify. You get nowhere, but you have a l nowhere a lot of other things to explore. lot of other things to explore. Yeah, for sure. So that's part of, yeah, exactly, but that's part of the process that would be. Thank you. Andy and I Rostav have worked out a course on numeracy. What you're proposing is quite different, and I think the targeted audience is also different. Who would enter a course like yours? Well, make a little mirror slav asked. Like, how would this be different from what you're thinking? See, Ivan, actually, it doesn't have to be that much different. What we described here is what you would do if you have 10, 15, 20 students marks. Okay, so the enrollment is very limited. So in a course where people can interact with each other, but on the other hand, it is a course that any university. That any university or college level student could take. And one thing I want to say about the other time: we do not have to be sad that actually the level of mathematics is very low. If you look at these questions, so the first example we did was actually just one division of two numbers, nothing else. So it's not, but all the other things complement mathematical thinking. So this is why it's a good linguistic course. To answer To answer your question, it could be for anybody. In HR courses are not that different. It's just that, okay, and they teach a smaller class, I teach a very large class, so I cannot ask 400 students to walk around the room and do whatever would be impossible. Thank you so much, everyone. Maybe we can squeeze our four presentations together. We made four presentations around them. Let me take corners and talk like this. It's working fantastic. So we're working group number three. Our topic was mathematical reasoning and undergraduate education. So our group, a couple people had to leave early and we also had some people online. Anna was online and she's not able to She's not able to long before. So Anna and Vanessa were online. Dagan and Michelle, I'm sorry. And Dagan had to leave early, but folk, Kieran, Chris, Richie, Tammy, Maria. So I'm just going to quickly outline what it is that we did. We used a framework that Kieran's going to present in a moment to analyze three tasks. One of the tasks was Christians. Christians a task of generating an image for 3D glasses. One of them was Chris's task from an old algebra textbook for exploring the parameters of quadratic equations, quadratic function. But the task that we're going to focus on is one that Maria is going to held on after Karen reintroduces us to the framework. So we ended up using the genome framework. This was from one of the readings. So there were nine different aspects. So, there are nine different aspects of mathematical reasoning that they define. They introduced it for more for school-aged children, but we find that these concepts can still be applied in the university course, which is where we're focusing. So, they grouped them into three main categories. So, one of them is similarities and differences. So, when you first see a problem, you want to say, okay, what can you say about the problem, maybe, at the general level? And identify, so these things include three processes, such as generalizing, identifying the pattern, classifying. Identifying the pattern, classifying, conjecturing, comparing. Then we also have kind of a more formal aspect of mathematical dispatch, which includes things like justifying, proving, and then formally proving what the paper refines formally proving. And then lastly, there's this notion of exemplifying. So exemplifying is essentially students focusing on coming up with examples to support these other processes. So how can you go on the path of starting to justify something? How can you go on the path of starting to generalize something, identify a pattern? When they dedify a pattern, you come up with examples. So these three things together are kind of the framework that we're working in when we're looking at students' mathematical reasons over the course of this project. So we proposed our different tasks that we've used in the classroom or that we think might be good, and we wanted to use this framework to kind of test them to see what types of mathematical thinking they supported. And this was one that I used with my first years, and just before Christmas, they were. And just before Christmas, they were just new in the door, a lot of them wouldn't have known each other. It was a calculus class, it was over 150 in the class. He was taught in a lecture, but then we had weekly workshops in lovely active learning rooms in about groups of 40, round tables, whiteboards all around the room. And in those workshops, they're supported by my TA, who's my PhD student, who doesn't allow me to attend any of these because she says I ruin the vibe. Some undergraduate learning assistance as well. So, we were at that point in the course, everybody's been here. You've done, you know, first derivative, sine, first derivative, increasing, decreasing, sine of second derivative, concave up, down, maxes, mins, inflection points, asymptotes, and so on. And I wanted to put one of these on the quiz the following week. It's all very procedural, put it on the quiz the following week, just to test that they've mastered these skills. But in the workshop the week before that, Up the week before that, what I decided to do was get them to propose the function that I would put on the quiz. So I gave them the skeleton problem of what it might look like. I said I might not ask all of A to F, but I will ask a selection of A to F. And the key thing was, because somebody said to me yesterday, but they're not just all say f of x equals 2. It had to have the Goldilocks property. So not too long, not too short, not too trivial, not too difficult. Not too trivial, not too difficult, and not too many tedious calculations. And one of the aims, there were a number of aims for this, but one of the aims was that they would kind of get to see as well, they were very coming from a system with a high-stakes terminal exam, they were obsessed about the exam. And I wanted them to see, look, I'm not going to give you surprises. This is what we've done. You could nearly guess what's on the exam. The other key thing that I wanted for this task was to create community. So that was kind of Was to create community. So that was kind of a focus for me last semester. And getting the students a sense of belonging and talking to each other. I think collaboration amongst undergraduates is so important. So to get those first introductions and I thought this was a very non-scary task. Nobody's lack of mathematical knowledge was going to be exposed here. So it was a very good task. And I explicitly said in the instructions, because Irish people are all a bit odd, you know, they're going to go report, but they had to go to a white. But they had to go to a whiteboard with their group, write it up, and do out the solutions. They also had to provide them with the solution. I guess it's a plain old exemplification task. Give me an example of dot dot dot dot. Now I don't expect you to see what's up here, but my TA told me there was two general approaches that students took. And this was by Whitold and Hugo. They were two police students, really good mathematical students. They took two approaches. And they took two approaches, and it exemplifies the two approaches that were taken. On the right-hand side, approach number one was throw down a function, maybe stick it into GeoGebra to see what it looked like, and then try and put the calculations in. And my intention was if they were doing that, they'd start to go, oh, this is getting really messy. Let's go back and tweak the function. So they were kind of becoming more aware of features of the function and the properties. So they have actually down the natural log of the absolute value of secant x plus. Absolute value of seeking to XPS talents. And then on the left-hand side, you see there was a prize as well. So the prize was: I would use your quiz, your function on the quiz, but then there would be a prize. And the prize was mugs with your function drawn on the book. So on the left end, the other approach was they back-engineered it. They said we'd like to give an example of a polynomial. So they started with the second derivative as 36x squared minus 16, first derivative, and so on. So they back-engineered it. And so on, so they back engineered it that way. And then I should have said, thanks to the last group for mentioning the gallery walk. I'd only heard about gallery walks last summer. So I decided then in the last 10 minutes there would be a gallery walk around the room. Again, I don't expect you to see what's on these, but every room had to present their function and explain why they chose it. And so what we realized because Lamaria's task was Because Maria's task was mostly exemplifying. But we realized when the students just pass and they check all the whiteboard, they start comparing, classifying, and identifying the pattern. Because first they look at all the functions and they can say these are called numbers here, rational, logarithm, logarithm, second, second, and chukanam HB. And then they classify because there's Classify because there's different types of functions, and they realize the pattern is the same for the polynomials, for the rational. And so, I think you didn't realize that until yesterday. So, that's very funny because that's your activity, and we realize we have three more processes from Janet that came from this activity. That was a kind of a side thing I threw in, because I thought it sounded neat, but I realized actually I should give it proper consideration. Should give a proper consideration in future because if I really want to bring out these extra steps. So, there's definitely benefits and limitations in using this framework. The obvious benefits is a shared vocabulary and a set of prompts to remind us as to what different forms of reasoning we might be interested in. And certainly, I think, as a group, that was immediately quite helpful. We all found Quite helpful. We all found the framework. I hope I can speak on his behalf and saying, we all found the framework really had its definite uses. And it's sort of tempting to develop your own framework, but there's also, you know, you don't have a shared vocabulary, don't you? You can just do your own thing. On the other hand, there were some clear limitations. If you can go back to the prompts, please. There's a feeling that this framework is probably derived from and suitable for pure mathematics. For pure mathematics, particularly in seven and eight, proven formally proved. But there are other sub-disciplines, notably statistics and applied mathematics, where formal proving doesn't play a role. And certainly in statistics, there may be other forms of mathematical reasoning that are just not captured here. Now, I'm no statistician, so I can't speak on behalf of the statistical community. There are likely to be those forms of reasoning, and in those situations, there'll be other things that people need very much. Other things that people need very much need to acknowledge and include. So, I think, in conclusion, we found that for two of our tasks, having the framework was clearly beneficial. It made things that previously seemed unimportant or being a side project far more important and far more valuable and freighted with a lot of MR processes. We saw some limitations as well. We saw clearly that the framework was not comprehensive. But I think in the end, and here I'm going to try and paraphrase Dagan, who's going to present this very beautifully, but indelibly. I think in the end, maybe one of the most valuable things we felt the framework and the process offered was simply a pause to think about these issues when we're designing our tasks. Our tasks an opportunity to be intentional about what it is that we want students to do and what we want them to think about. Any questions for this group? Thank you very much for being so confident that they have my folks for all this.  Oh, this is not the presentation. I thought I should begin by building the slides from source just to make Andy nervous. Make sure it works. Make sure it works. And then use the latest. Oh, good. We're okay. Good. Okay. Or sorry for interrupting. Should we have just like all six at once and then we've done? Let's do it. I mean, I'm sure that it's checked out at 11. But it's like checkout, so it has to be before 11. But if you're lucky to try it, just keep going. If we keep having, I think we can do it. If we keep having I think we can do ethical punishment. Because we'll be done at 10.30. Let's do two now. Let's do it. Yeah, and then everyone gets to see everyone. Yes. See what we can do. All right. So we are group four, also known as the cool group. I should, so there are, I guess, disclaimers at the beginning. One, we did manage to work on many different tasks. Different tasks. Doing more than one thing means we approached it like many of our students do, in that we took our large group and smaller groups who didn't necessarily come back together at the end to make sure that we had consistency of presentation across all contributions. I was left in charge of the slides, and then Andy said we should go for a walk, and then the walk ended at a brewery. Anyway, I got. Anyway, I got these slides done at like midnight last night, so we'll see what they look like. All right, so I'm going to run through some background, some of the assumptions we made, and then we're going to look at three different tasks. And when I get through those, I'll ask my group members to chime in. So let me go reasonably fast through this. First of all, here's the group. Also, here's the group. Um okay, we are all here, right? Um great, nobody had to leave yet. Um, I'll just move. Let's go, let's keep going. Okay, so some of the kind of I don't know, assumptions we made. One of our assumptions that we kind of decided in the first day is you can't do mathematical reasoning in one course, needs to be developed over many courses, and we also thought, well, that needs to be. And we also thought, well, that needs to begin in the first year. So our focus was Calc1, linear algebra, these introductory courses. How can you develop mathematical reasoning in those courses? All right. And then we talked about, well, what kind of features a course with mathematical reasoning should have. We thought there should be risk-rich tasks. There should be some active learning. That active learning should probably happen in groups, so there's discussion. Groups, so there's discussion, and we thought it's the process is more important than the content. I think that was another thing we all more or less agreed on. Then we talked about all the things you should think about when you want to design a task that has mathematical reasoning. You should think about is this going to be a one-class thing? Is it a week? Is it a month? How long are they going to work on it? What are the pathways? What are the pathways you expect the students to be taking? Think about that ahead of time so you know when you see them going down the dark alleyway that you need to steer them in direction. Think about the audience, their strengths, their weaknesses, what do they know coming into solving the problem. Think about how you're going to present the task, whether you need like a mini lecture to set things up or are they ready to go. Um and uh we also wanted to focus on: okay, if you're designing a task that is supposed to be mathematical reasoning, you should be able to identify what elements of mathematical reasoning are actually being enhanced through the completion of this task. Okay, so it just fits on the screen. Great. Here are the tasks we looked at. Now, we didn't get to analyzing all of these. We were spitballing a lot of tasks at the beginning. At the beginning. One was coming up with the condition that guarantees that your integer matrix has an integer inverse. There was this greatest common denominator problem that Asmire came up with. Fractal dimension, that was one of the ones that some of you guys had fun with, I think. Looked like lots of fun. Yeah. We also thought we should include Chantel's core problem because Chantel's chord problem because we were thinking about understanding what things look like at infinity, division by zero, maybe a little projective geometry coming sneaking in there somehow. An exercise that I've seen even in calculus classes before, putting functions in order according to which one will win if you take the ratio and look at the limit as x goes to infinity. And Terry has. And Terry had the idea that actually from there you can come up with a rigorous definition of infinitesimals by looking at ratios of polynomials, which is having fun. This recursion problem that we stole from the Schoenfeld chapter, and then arriving at a definition of a random orthogonal matrix, I don't know, somebody threw that one out there, we wrote it down, and that's as far as we got. Okay, and then the elements of mathematical reasoning, it's Of mathematical reasoning, it's not aligned nice, but we wouldn't think vertically. So we've got about here: specialize, validate, convince, generalize. These are in no particular order, by the way. Conjecture, abstract, communicate, prove slash justify, be creative, persevere, be inquisitive, collaborate, explore what is known, think computationally, simplify, and visualize. So we looked at each task and tried to figure out which of these 16. And try to figure out which of these 16 properties showed up in each one. Okay. By the way, interrupt me if I'm live. Okay. All right. So, I don't know if this fits. Almost. Almost. Shrink a little. A little more. There. Okay. I put down only the four that we analyzed. The other four we didn't get. So we went through and we thought about some of the tasks and which of these. The tasks and which of these properties or skills were enhanced by each task. So the matrix inverse problem, the fractal problem. Bernardo insisted on this. He didn't want students to know anything going into the fractal problem. The question marks indicate something that could be an element of that problem if you chose to design it that way. For example, you know, if you're having students play around with matrix. You're having students play around with matrix inverses. Maybe you want them to use the computer to handle some of the computations so you can look at many examples. I just want them to do a couple of examples by hand. Notice that Chantel's question gets many check marks. We started with that. Okay, but some of the other ones do okay as well. And that brings us to the tasks. Asnita, do you, since I've been talking, do you want to tell us about the matrix one? Do you want to tell us about the matrix one? I can talk about the matrix one. So, Sean and I were looking at the matrix inverse question, which was posed by Terry. So, our setting, we imagine this being in a first-year linear algebra class, where maybe they've just learned about kind of the product property of determinants. And so, if we create a scaffolded question that we could give to, we think, any kind of linear algebraic class, but if it was a more advanced class, we could do it without the scaffolding and just kind of get them exploring the main question. Of get them exploring the main question. But we had, oh, okay, I don't have the actual question. Is it later on? Yeah, so these scaffolds come next. I followed how it was in the next one. Cool. Okay, yeah. Sean didn't share these slides with us beforehand, so this is my first time seeing them and how it's organized. So I'm just blowing off the thing. So we were looking at the skills that this involves, and so we had to explore what is known. This question is really like reiterating definitions and making sure that we understand. Definitions and making sure that we understand the definitions of what is a determinant, how are inverses involved, looking at all of these linear algebra definitions that students used to sometimes struggle with. We also had conjecture, you'll see in the questions that we're getting them to explore the relationship between determinant of A and A inverse, and from that figure out what has to be the case for an integer matrix to be invertible over the integers, and then doing some little proofs to so here's the action. So here's the actual activity with kind of some points. So we were starting them off with finding the inverse indeterminants of just a few matrices that had similar entries so that they discovered that some of these do have integer inverses and some of them don't. And then thinking about going back to that derivative property, saying what happens if we have a squared being the identity matrix, there's a name for that. It don't have to be equal. Matrix, there's a name for that. I don't have the name for that. Idemphone. Thank you. I don't know. And I was like, that's there. I haven't told them now for a couple of years. And then think about what are the possible values for the determinant of A. Just at the beginning, getting them to that determinant idea. And then the second one is kind of getting them to realize that, well, A times A inverse is also I and getting that relationship too. So for the first four questions, an invertible 2x2 matrix with real entries, what can you say about determining A? What keeps saying budgetary and pay. The first four are just over the real numbers, so where they're used to working. And then the next two are let's look just at the integers. So which matrices from part A have inverses with integer entries? Only two of them do, one doesn't. And then trying to think about what is the way that we can generalize this so that if I have a matrix that has integer entries, my inverse also has integer entries. Okay, I think I have the fractal problem next. And guys, I just wrote down what you put in the doc. So. Doc. So I think you have to elaborate. Question one is: they didn't all fit on a slide. So, question one is here, and then I will move to the other questions. Sure. So, the idea is to get students to develop the fractal dimension. That was, I think, that's the first part here, just by evaluating lines, squares, cubes, and seeing how when you subdivide, you get small segments, small squares. We get small segments, small squares, cubes, you need more of them. And then noticing that these numbers here, this is like two squared, three squared, this is two cubed, three cubed, and so that's the dimension is the exponent. And so get the exponent somehow, getting something like this. And that was the first thing. Then, let's see what's wrong here. Oh, they're out of order. It should be two, three, four, yeah, sort of. I think it's kind of a different. kind of a different version. Okay, so yeah, so then, yeah, this is 2-3. So then explain like a regular function like the sine of x. Just see what's the fractal dimension of it. And so it should still be 1 because it's still a nice smooth line, smooth curve. But when you're doing these results, when you have segments, they won't fit perfectly. So it's not like on a regular fractal that's so similar that you always get the perfect light. similar that you always get the perfect like divide the segments in three well three times smaller they get like four like on the on the snowflake here you'll get something approaching some kind of number like three four but it's going to change when you change the scaling so we'll need into that to introduce something like a limit what happens as as the segments get smaller and smaller and we get like a limit and that's what we have when we get the dimension. We get the dimension. Then we have a discussion on: well, maybe usually we talk about meters, meters squared, meters cubed for our units. Maybe we should talk about some other kind of units, like what does meters to the 1.5 mean? And get things to kind of to kind of, I think there was, yeah, so the questions two and three here, three and four, for them to see if we have a coastline. What kind of, well, first notice that tensions won't work, we have to. First, notice that tangents won't work. We have to zoom in. What would be the correct units to use? Then, what would like, if we want a curve with some kind of dimension, like log 3 over log 3, log 4 over log 3, that's the snowflake dimension. Let students just build it and see what happens, because you can get lots of different curves in the same dimension. So, see all the ones that they get, just to get some intuition about what the dimension means. And then the final part where A final part where if we give three different coastlines, like the Netherlands, that's human-made, Australia, Shorts, approximate to dimension, like go to Google Maps, approximate with segments, zoom in, approximate with small segments, zoom in as much as you can, and approximate the fractal dimension. And hopefully, they'll see that something like the Netherlands will have a smaller fractal dimension than, because it's man-made, more straight lines, than something like Shjord-like. Something like your life. And then we, the idea was to, I think it's kind of at the end somewhere, that fractal dimension should be useful to categorize coastlines and what's a man-made structure versus a natural-made structure. So human-made. Yes. I used it before. Okay. Great. And one last activity. Who wants to take that? Go ahead, Lou. I was just going to say, I think that one thing to mention is that a huge idea that came up in our group was. A huge idea that came up in our group was: We are all convinced that mathematical reasoning can be incorporated into our classrooms, and we have all these amazing ideas for tasks. And so, maybe one thing that we could do is put together a resource where we can not only provide people with tasks, other instructors, but also an explanation around them. What are the key skills that you might be able to develop or get students to encounter with this task, and also how might they actually? And also, how might they actually be able to develop it in using this task? So, in addition to coming up with all of these amazing mathematical tasks, we had these discussions of, you know, what could you imagine a student actually doing when going through this task, and how might you adapt the task to encounter some other type of medical retaining. And if I can just add something else real quick, is that we were also thinking about the different levels of tasks, whether it was something we wanted to do in a class or a project, over a couple of weeks. Class for a project over several weeks or something like that. I think the activity Sean and I were looking at was maybe an assignment question or one class, whereas this fractal dimension of the sequence one is overwhelming. So speaking of this, we have two minutes to get to it. Oh, sorry. Sorry, yeah. So we expected that in this task, specifically, students could develop specialization, generalization, conjecturing, and justifying. And then we noticed while we imagined what a student could do, that visualization was also a key element. We started to talk about what would it be. We started to talk about what would it mean if a student actually engages in this? What would it look like? So we started to imagine writing for each of these skills. What would that look like? And then we actually gave a specific pathway. Is that in there too? Sure. Yeah, so then we imagine what a student might do. So they might start, it's a rich task for specialization because A0 and A1 are not given. So we imagine that they would start by saying, what if I take specific values for A0 and A1? Specific values for A0 and A1. And maybe I'll start with something really simple: like let them both be 0, and that's really, it leads to just 0. And what if I let it be 1? Oh, that leads to just 1. And oh, but what happens if I take E0 equal to A1? Oh, it's just a constant sequence. So they might then generalize and then think, okay, now we should maybe consider specific values where A0 and A1 are not equal. So they might try very naturally A0 equals to 0, A1 equal to 1. They might calculate some values by hand. They might calculate some values by hand, realize I don't want to continue doing this by hand, and maybe start recognizing that another representation might be easier because the formula is just a midpoint formula. So they might draw a number line and be able to recognize these in a different way. Maybe they'll go to computers. Maybe then a teacher will come in and say, oh, what if you try flipping instead of 0110 and proceed from there? So just an example of one possible pathway. Pathway. A couple notes at the end. I don't know where you have time, but. Oh, this is just the idea that we can adapt the task and the implementation to get at different skills. Thanks, everybody. What are you wanna do? Do you want to go next? Huh? No break. So I will just make it. Did you practice this last night? So all right, folks, we were working group five. We were focusing mathematical reasoning for both the pre-undergrad and e-commerce teachers. The group was us five, so it was me and Kitty and Brody and Kate and Rebecca and also Dan and Kitty, who had to leave early so they weren't able to be with us today. But they were excellent. The meeting. To me. Alright. So just like everybody else, we really focused on coming up with some way of taking tasks and pulling mathematical reasoning out of it. And our idea is we want to make it very practical and usable for teachers in the classroom. So our idea was we want to make activities and we want to design them so that the teachers know where all of the mathematical reasoning takes place and how they can adapt the activities. Place and how they can adapt the activities to bring out various facets of mathematical reasoning, and also where student mistakes can likely happen so that they can be more likely to use it themselves, so they can feel comfortable to be able to manage the activity in their classroom. So, what we did is we analyzed mathematical reasoning skills addressed, including the Garris, and kind of like did the last group we talked. Group, we talked about having word closets word fitness problems. Kind of like the FIMSIC profiles, where we could fill up a bunch of keywords in there, and then teachers could search for whatever they wanted in the lesson, and then we could put it up. And the big thing is that we want to make sure that we get as much content, curriculum content, in these activities as possible, because we know practically teachers need to cover pop content in the Pop content in their classroom. So, just quickly, our version of mathematical reasoning, like yours, is not perfect, but you know, it includes such things, which you will see here. I'm not going to spend too long talking about them. You can read them here, but the idea is even if you have a different view of what you consider mathematical organs, you can do the same analysis on these problems and decide where in the activities you would put those concepts of mathematical use. Concepts about how to be seen in there as well. So, the rest of the talk will talk about our activities and a little bit on the concepts there and a little bit on assessment of the activities as well. Yeah, so in terms of task design, we decided to design a sequence of tasks on geometric construction while having this list in mind. So we want to share or showcase three tasks today using the three edge and calculus to construct a number line that's for elementary students, construct triangles, maybe middle school students, and to represent the sum of two irrational students. And these tasks address These tasks address a number of MR skills on our list, such as process thinking, precision, metric and numeric reasoning, and communication. So what we want to say about these tasks is they cover a wide range of mathematical content required in the school critical. Required in a school critical. How do we know that? So here are our concept maps that the groups presented previously. You can't really see the concept really well here, but so two things about this about the map. About the map, there are two of them. This one is on the method of content. So, at its core, your metric construction is a process of constructing new points that have nice properties. And those points came into being when there is an intersection is formed. So, we want to highlight the concept of intersection. Concept of intersection. And there are lots of exploration and discussions that can be had. The other thing we want to mention is the concept of zero or origin. Because we have numbers and we have a location or an address for that number. And this task would help students have a connection. Of course, we have this concept map for pedagogical considerations and strategies. Pedagogical considerations and strategies for teachers to attend to. And that's not finishing it. It's almost there. So we have these two prepared for both students or teachers, depending on which. And then we'll speak a little bit more about each task for the rest of the task. Okay, task number one. This is constructing a number line using encompassing straight edge. So this is chosen for us on purpose. It's very low entry. GG, put a button on that. Yeah, you'll have 10 more minutes from the 10 more minutes. Okay, so this is a very low entry, high exit point. So what you see here, this is the typical visual. What you usually do is you start with two points. You connect these points using array, and then you get into the thing. Array and then you get into the thick of things. Where right here you see that we're using 2 in this example as the center of a circle and right here is where I want you to focus. That's the intersection point. And now we're bringing in some concepts. So we have geometric reasoning, we're using points, lines, circles. And then there's number reasoning here, where then we can bring the concept of number. And also, generalization. Generalization, we pick two. What happens if we go balance? What happened if we used one as the center? We would have introduced zero, the constant of zero that Kitty was just mentioning. And for abstraction, what does that mean? That arrow. This is one of the first earlier cases that students are introduced to infinity, the concept of infinity as well. So a few more. There's motor skills. I think we're the first group to really talk about getting our hands dirty. Really, I talked about getting our hands dirty with an example. There's a very big difference to doing something with your hands. Sorry, engineers, but there are engineers out there that, when they never get their hands dirty, they don't know the reality of what they're constructing. And then the last thing is precision. So there can be visual and measurement. We can just look at it. We have a natural instinct to see if we construct a number line precisely. And then we can get out a rule. We want a Hoyer rule or something like this, but we can use it. Okay, so our second example, we're going to be constructing triangles. So it's slightly kind of a step up in sophistication. But what we liked about it is that we've scaffolded it so that there's a series of triangles that we want them to construct. The first one being really, really easy. And so part of why we like that is because it breaks that barrier of getting pencil to paper. Sometimes, you know, you can, students can feel You know, you can, students can feel a little nervous about kind of making that first line or the fear of making a mistake. So, just wanting them to get hands-on really, really early. We feel that also all of these, they do cover a lot of our characteristics of mathematical reasoning, but with the scaffolding, the level of expectation on some of those is increasing. So, one that we really want to point out is between three and four. So, going from Between three and four, so going from obtuse and acute triangles to this isosceles one, there's an extra level of precision there. They can't just kind of look at it and be like, okay, yes, this is bigger than 90 or less. But all of a sudden, they're having to really make sure that they're getting exact lengths. And then also from four to five, the level of exploration is also going to increase. So their strategy is less intuitive or obvious, which is a horrible word, but obvious. So they're going to have to spend some time. Have to spend some time trying different things and seeing how it works, and reflecting, which brings us also to when we're thinking about assessment. What are we looking for? And that reflection piece was really important. We felt reflection was really important to help develop some of those reasoning skills. Some of it being that they can really quickly identify when maybe a construction didn't work, but then also use it to build their next steps. And so it's also changing their relationships with wrong answers or. Wrong answers or a misstep, which we felt was important in these characteristics. And for the last problem for more advanced students, aka grade 8 and higher, we decided to add a little bit more expectations to the math material that they have. So in this case, while we have this whole problem going from something very easy, easily accessible, low entry, constructing unit segments, and then any integer length segments, we do expect them to get to the point when they're. Expect them to get to the point where they're working with square roots, which really represents this nature that math builds on the previous knowledge. Now, the way we constructed the question, this separation into different steps, going from unit to five to root two, root three, going through like construction from square root of n to square root of root n plus one, really shows that we need to work through the steps one by one. It also allows teachers. One by one, it also allows teachers to split up the problems into multiple sub-problems, allows them to give students partial marks and provides a little bit more accurate assessment. Now, depending on the classroom that they're working with, they can also choose not a whole problem. So if you're working with like grade nine, you probably wouldn't go to like the last part of the problem. So you can kind of adjust to whatever your classroom needs. And another thing we really like about this is that it. Another thing we really like about this is that that opens up like a million and five questions. That starts up a discussion. What kind of segments can we build? What can we not build? What's going to happen if we take away the ruler? What if we take away the compass? What if we add something else? We really think that in a pre-university education, we need to focus on the starting the discussion, encouraging the conversation, and making the students see the open-mindedness in math and how we should look for more ways to do things. Look for more ways to do things. Some part of the problems also include multiple ways to solve it. For example, there are two different ways to construct the square root of a as we have here. So it's either this one or this one. Or even going back and constructing just integer length, there are also multiple ways to do it. It's more of a question, what's going to get us to the end point of the question? What's just kind of fun to know and useful to know and maybe more realistic. In the end of the day, we want to foster this environment. This environment of exploration in a classroom, which is very important in the free university setting. And if we're working with pre-service teachers, we want them to at least be know, like know about this, be exposed to it. And so then if students ask questions about this, they're ready for it. And they know how to elaborate and answer questions. And again, foster an open-minded conversation. And that's going to be it for us. Any questions? So we need to start a new recording because that's quite a fun point. That's one of the discussions.
