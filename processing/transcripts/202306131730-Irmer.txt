Okay. Great. Okay. So Thurston wrote, well, he gave a talk and he wrote up some notes from that about deformation retraction of Titanullah space. Space. And these notes were never really intended to be distributed to the mathematical community. I don't know why. I mean, maybe he intended to develop the ideas further or whatever. But so he gave some people a copy of these notes. And that's how the story stayed for a long time. Stayed for a long time until many, well, a few decades later, Li Jian Ji wrote a paper saying, well, I don't understand this construction of Thurston's. So this construction has never really been universally understood in the mathematical community. And I think largely that's because the notes that Thurston wrote weren't widely available. weren't widely available on the internet or anywhere else. So I'm going to focus on talking about this construction today. It gives a mapping class equivariant deformation retraction of Teichmüller space without any marked points or additional structure. So this construction uses curve lengths to parametrizes. To parametrize Teischmüller space. And one needs to study at each point what the set of shortest curves are. If there's time, I'll talk about a further deformation retraction of the image of Thurston's deformation retraction. It does retract further sometimes. So the So, the basic idea behind this is that there are a number of cell decompositions known for Teichmüller space as long as you've got some kind of distinguished point. So, this is often a puncture, but as long as you have marked points. But as long as you have marked points, then you can, relative to these marked points, you can construct a cell decomposition of Teichmüller space. And how this works is that you take your points and given the metric corresponding to a particular point of Teichmüller space, you can construct a Voronoi decomposition of that. Of that. So, in this surface, this genus 2 surface, I've shown some marked points. And you take your Voronoi decomposition. So around each point, you have the set of points that are closer to that than to any other. And you, well, this actually isn't, it's not so easy to. Actually, isn't it's not so easy to draw, but you construct a graph like this somehow. And so the cell decomposition, how that works is that as you deform the metric, You eventually reach a point at which this Voronoi graph changes. And that happens when you pass into the next cell of the cell decomposition. So each cell is labeled by a graph corresponding to this Voroni decomposition of the surface. So, what Thurston did was to remove the necessity. Remove the necessity for some kind of marked point or puncture by using curve lengths to parametrize. And a similar, very related construction, in a sense, what Schmutz was thinking about was a dual to what Thurston was doing. So he discussed cell decompositions of Teichmüller space that are parameterized by length functions. So Schmutz has a very So, Schmutz has a very beautiful construction of this, but the downside of his construction is that if you don't have marked points, he couldn't actually show that such a cell decomposition actually exists. He just assumed, yeah, it probably does. So, these cell decompositions are very closely related to the problem of finding mapping class group. Finding mapping class group equivariant deformation retractions of Teichmüller space. So it's known that there are such deformation retractions. These can be thought of as giving deformation retractions of moduli space. That's why we want them to be mapping class group equivariant. So it's known that this space does. So it's known that this space does deformation retract onto something much smaller. And for in the well, in the case in which you have a marked point or puncture, then these deformation retractions can be very easily described by simply deleting vertices at infinity. So I'm not going to talk about constructing. About constructing cell decompositions today, but I will talk about the very closely related problem of finding mapping class group equivariant deformation retractions. So we need some definitions. I take a surface of genus G that I'm calling curly S G and And tau g is always its Teichmüller space. And once you choose a point in Teichmüller space, I'm calling Sg the corresponding hyperbolic surface. And gamma G is the mapping class group of the surface. So what I'll be talking about a lot is systals. So a systole on the surface is On the surface is a GED sick with length that is as short as possible on that surface. So it has length less than or equal to any other GED sick on the surface. So these are, of course, closed curves, not homotopically trivial curves. So surprisingly, these systoles can actually intersect. Can actually intersect. I mean, we know that when the, well, when the injectivity radius is very small, then a systole has a really long collar. So in the thin part of Teichmuller space, the systoles are disjoint. But when the systoles are not so short, it is possible that they intersect. But any But any pair of systoles can intersect in at most one point. And you can just show that by trying to find a systole that intersects in two points. And then you can do a surgery, you know, cut an arc off one and join the end points using an arc of the other. And you find that you get a shorter curve than that. So the original GD6 could not have been. Original GD6 could not have been systoles. Another concept that's going to be important is when the systols fill the surface. So when we say they fill the surface, if their complement is a set of polygons. And this is actually possible for the systoles to fill. So I've drawn an example. Drawn an example. These curves here fill the surface. And in fact, there is a hyperbolic surface on which this set of curves is the systoles. So this happens when the GD6 shown intersect at right angles. So then the surface is decomposed into right-angled hexagons. Into right-angled hexagons, into four right-angled hexagons. And there's a particular point at which this happens, and that is a critical point of what I'm going to call the Systohl function. So the Systohl function is a map from Teichmüller space, and at every point it's And at every point, its value is equal to the length of the system at that point. And so that's a piecewise smooth function. It's smooth everywhere, except where the set of curves that represent the systals changes. And then you have two-sided limits that typically don't meet, that typically don't match. But it is continuous. Match, but it is continuous, but not smooth, piecewise smooth. And in fact, this piecewise smooth structure is very important. So I'm going to denote by cis C. C, big C is usually a set of curves. The subset of Taichimu space on which C is the set. On which C is the set of systoles. And little C usually denotes a curve on the surface. So in this work, a length function is a positive linear combination of lengths of curves. And the really important property of these length functions is that they're analytic functions and they satisfy a whole lot of convexity properties. So they're not just any function on Titanullah space. They're very convex functions. And when the curves in your set C fill the surface, That means that the set cis C, where the systoles are the set C of curves, is actually a connected open subset of an embedded manifold of Teichmüller space with compact closure. So this is why I'm calling it a stratum. You're taking embedded sub-manifold where all the curves in C. Where all the curves in C have the same length. And then where these curves are systoles is the intersection of an open set with this embedded submanifold. And this open set is where the curves in C are shorter than all other curves on the surface. So the Thurston spine of Teichmüller space has a really beautiful Has a really beautiful geometric description. It's the set of all points at which the systoles fill. So this is known to be a CW complex. And each cell of this CW complex is of the form, well, it's a stratum, cis C, where C is some set of filling curves. So, this thirst and spine is actually very closely related to the systol function. So a guy called Aku, well, together really with Schmurz, showed that the sister function is what we call a topological Morse function. So a So, a topological Morse function is similar to a regular smooth Morse function, of course, but it's not necessarily smooth. So you can do a lot of things with a topological Morse function that you can do with a regular Morse function. But any sort of questions about deforming the Morse function, which one often does in Morse theory. Often does in Morse theory. You can't do that. In particular, for a smooth Morse function, you have this notion of a Morse-smale complex. So you have the critical points and you have the set of flow lines between those critical points. So a Morse male complex is not defined for Not defined for a topological Morse function because you don't really have a well-defined set of flow lines. Except that in this instance, well, you can sort of define a more small function, a more small complex, because the flow lines. The flow lines, you can define them in such a way that they stay tangent to the strata in directions that the systole function is smooth. So in this sense, we'll see that the Thurston spine behaves like a Morse snail complex for the systole function. And in this sense, it is the image of the death. Sense, it is the image of the deformation of a mapping class group equivariant deformation retraction. So the key idea behind the construction of this deformation retraction is this lemma. So this lemma says that if you have any collection of curves on a surface that don't fill, then at any point of Then, at any point of Taichimullah space, there's a whole cone of directions corresponding to directions in which all of these GD6s are increasing in length. So let me see. I should actually give an example here. How do I add it? I think I can add a I think I can add a page, yes. Just scribble something. So how does this work? You have your set of curves and take a different colour. So, this set of curves don't fill the surface because we've got this red curve that's disjoint from all of them. So, if we want to find a direction in which the lengths of all these blue curves are increasing, then a direction that will always work is if you Will always work is if you increase the length of this red curve in the Weyl-Peterson metric. So the gradient of the length of this red curve in the Weyl-Peterson metric gives a direction in which the lengths of all these blue curves are simultaneously increasing. So where was I? Okay, so this is the important point in the construction of thirst. Thurston's deformation retraction. Away from a point on the Thurston spine, you can always find a direction in which the set of shortest curves are simultaneously increasing. So you construct a flow away from the spine, you're always increasing the systole function. And then eventually, And then eventually you get closer and closer to the set of points on which the systoles fill. And then that's where the flow stops. So once you get sufficiently close to the Thurston spine, well, you use this flow to flow all of titanullar space into a regular neighborhood of the third. A regular neighborhood of the Thurston spine, then you use the structure of the regular neighborhood to deformation retract the rest of the way onto the Thurston spine. So the reason for the second step is that you want to be sure that you construct a deformation retraction rather than just a retraction. If you simply use the flow, the first flow, to deform everything onto the thirst and spine. Form everything onto the Thurston spine, you need to show that this happens within a finite time. And that it is actually the case, but it's not so easy to show. So that's why you flow until you get very close to the thirst and spine, and then you use the regular neighbourhood to retract the rest of the way. So, as a general outline, I've said a way. outline. I've said away from at a point x, away from the spine, you define c of x to be a set of shortest geod6 at the point. So this set is going to depend on a parameter epsilon, which defines what we mean by shortest. So when the curves in this set C of x don't fill, then we use this lemma to construct a vector. This lemma to construct a vector field with the property that the length of every curve in C is increasing in the direction of this vector field. And we do this in such a way that the vector field is mapping class group equivariant and it's smooth away from where the set of curves changes. So we'll arbitrarily define the vector field to be zero. zero, have length zero if the set of curves fills. So if we have a very small parameter epsilon, this vector field will be zero in a small neighborhood of the first in spine. And for our construction, it doesn't actually matter what the vector field is on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the spine. So if we define the vector field to be zero there, don't Zero there. Don't worry about that. It's not actually important. So then we use a mapping class group equivariant partition of unity to obtain a smooth vector field on Titanullah space, which I'm calling x epsilon. So it depends on the parameter epsilon. So an important point is that the smoothing process can be done without creating zeros. Creating zeros. So we know that the vector field is zero if you go very close to the spine. But anywhere else, in your set of shortest curves, you always have at least one shortest curve in any of your choices of sets. So when you take a linear combination of vector fields using this partition of unity, then you don't create Then you don't create zeros because the linear combination at any point has to be increasing the length at least of the shortest GED sig. Okay, so then we have this flow obtained by taking the flow of the smooth vector field that we created. So it's important to note that this is a mapping class group equivariant. Mapping class group equivariant flow. And so the Teichmüller space modulo the action of the mapping class group. If you cut off the thin part, then that's compact. So suppose we're looking at the thick part of Teichmüller space, then this is compact modulo the action of the mapping class group. And as a consequence, the The vector field that we created is what we call complete. So, this is a standard sort of a textbook result. And what that means is that the flow is defined for all time. So, we take this flow and we want to say that for any compact set K, well, for any K, well, for any set that's compact modulo, the action of the mapping class group, and that contains the Thurston spine, then after a finite time, if we take the image of this compact set under the flow, then it will be contained, it gets stuck in a small regular neighborhood. Regular neighborhood of the Thurston spine. So, what we do, well, I'm going to take the compact set to be the thick part of Teichmüller space. So, I write that as tau g epsilon m. So, epsilon m is the Margulis constant. And you define an isotopy essentially by allowing the points to Allowing the points to flow for a time t. So, this isotopy takes the boundary of the thick part onto the boundary of a subset I'm calling IT. And what I want to say is that you see. You see that when you take the boundary of the thick part of Titanullah space, the vector field defining the flow is everywhere pointing inwards because we're increasing the systole function. So that means that you're contracting your space. So you start off with the thick part, you flow for a bit, and you've contracted the space. Attracted the space. And because the vector field is always pointing inwards, you enter smaller and smaller neighborhoods of the thirst and spine. And the key point is there's no way that this flow can escape these neighborhoods because the flow is invariant, because any alpha thick part of Teichmüller space is invariant under the flow. It's the vector. It's the vector fields always pointing inwards. So, this property of being that each alpha thick part is invariant under the flow is really key to say you've got a contraction happening. And in fact, this is the part that people have said that they haven't understood. People are worried that when you construct this flow, When you construct this flow, you might get near the spine and then somehow flow away again. But the reason that doesn't happen is because let's have a look at this figure. So here you've got the Thurston spine and the blue thing I'm drawing is a particular neighborhood. So let's define this neighborhood P. So let's define this neighborhood, Pg epsilon, as being the subset of Teichmüller space for which the set of GD6 whose length are within epsilon of the systoles fill. So this is a and well for small enough epsilon, it's a regular neighborhood of the Thurston spine. Because if it had any other kind of If it had out here, say another connected component, that would mean that here you have to have a local maximum of the systol function. And we know that any local maxima or any critical points at all, they have to be on the Thurston spine. That's because of the lemma we had before that says if you're not on the spine, there's always a direction in which the shortest curves are simultaneously increasing. Curves are simultaneously increasing. So, this is a neighborhood of the Thurston spine. And I'm saying that after finite time, our compact set, which we're taking to be the thick part of Teichmüller space, will flow into this neighborhood of the spine and it'll stay there as you keep flowing. It can't flow out of that neighborhood. So, if we choose an epsilon, If we choose an epsilon in the definition of our vector field such that the zeros of epsilon are all contained within this Pg, and I'm denoting by Tg alpha the alpha thick part of Teichmüller space. Then as alpha increases, the alpha thick part shrinks onto the local maxima of the systol function. So when alpha is small, So, when alpha is small, then the alpha thick part contains the thirst and spine. And as you increase alpha, then the alpha thick part shrinks until eventually it just shrinks onto the local maxima of the systole function. So in this first diagram, we've got alpha, alpha one is comparatively small. So we flow until we reach time t1. Reach time T1. And I've drawn, well, this is okay. So after time T1, the image of our alpha thick, well, of our thick part, that's this green pink line here. Once it's contained in the alpha thick part, it can't escape unless you're Unless you're in a very small neighborhood of the spine where the vector field has length zero. So once alpha is so large that the alpha thick part no longer contains all of the spine, then our compact set K, if it reaches a point If it reaches a point very close to the spine, then the vector field is either zero or has very small length. So the flow isn't doing very much at those points. The points are almost just staying still. And then inside the alpha thick part, it's still contracting further onto the spine. So that's what I've tried to draw here at time t1. And then I've And then, as alpha gets smaller and we flow for further time, then we get: well, this green line is this pink green one from before. And that gets closer and closer to the spine because any points that are not within the very small neighborhood of the spine have to be contained within the alpha thick part where alpha is. Part where alpha is increasing. So they're pulled within this pg epsilon and they have to stay there. And the reason they have to stay inside that neighborhood is because the alpha thick part is invariant under the flow. So that's really the part of the construction that people have said they haven't understood. And it is really perfectly simple. Perfectly simple. The point to keep in mind is that the alpha thick part is invariant under the flow. So once you've flown into the alpha thick part, there's no flowing out of it. So the second step is you float once you're inside this neighborhood, PG Epsilon. I don't know why I keep. I don't know why I keep changing colors. Okay, n is a normal neighborhood of the spine, and so we can put the coordinates on this normal neighborhood. And one of the coordinates is this parameter r that measures the distance from the spine. So the image of our thick part, that's what I'm calling phi T, tau G epsilon. Tau g epsilon has to be connected because it's an isotopy of a connected space. Teichmüller space is connected. And that the boundary of the image separates the boundary of the normal neighborhood from the spine. And it's also smooth. So we need to deform the normal coordinates in such a way that we don't get these kinds of Kinds of so that we can use the normal coordinate to do the rest of the deformation retraction. And this is done by doing small deformation retractions that sort of cancel out these parts that behave like critical points. So you've got when you take this R coordinate and restrict it to the boundary of the image of this deformed of the image of the thick part C. Then you can assume without loss of generality that any Um, I'm not, I don't want to say has points with non-degenerate Hessian. I want to say any place where this this is non-regular, that the Hessian is non-degenerate. So, without loss of generality, we can assume that because there's a theorem from Morse theory that says any. Morse theory that says any such smooth function is arbitrarily close to such a function. So then the restriction of the normal coordinate on the image of this deformation retraction behaves like a Morse function. And what we can do is to cancel out the do small deformation retractions that, in a sense, cancel out the That, in a sense, cancel out these critical points. I've sort of illustrated the process here. These yellow lines represent flow lines of the normal coordinate, and you take little deformation retractions that cancel out these critical points, as shown. And then eventually, once you've cancelled out enough of these critical points, then you just take a deformation retraction by Deformation retraction by flowing along the, well, flowing in the direction of decreasing normal coordinate until you reach the spine. So Thurston didn't describe the details of this second step because he thought, okay, that's a standard construction. That's boring. So, there's another construction I wanted to mention. Let CG be Harvey's complex of curves. So I'm assuming most of you have heard of the complex of curves. So this is a complex, the vertices correspond to isotopic classes of curves on Of curves on the surface, and there's an edge between two vertices if the curves are disjoint. And a simplex has vertices that are disjoint. So, this curve complex is known to be homotopy equivalent to a wedge of spheres or spheres of dimension 2g minus 2. Dimension 2g minus 2. So it's, of course, an infinite wedge because you have an action of the mapping class group. And so if you have a sphere, then you have a whole orbit of spheres. So this must be infinitely generated. And in fact, it's known that you can, in a sense, see See how these complex curves in the boundary of the thick part of Teichmüller space. The way this works is that on the boundary of the thick part of Teichmüller space, the systoles are all disjoint. And so at any point, you look at what the systoles are, and that gives you a map into a simplex. A simplex of Harvey's complex of curves. And so any of the topology of the complex of curves, so any of these spheres, you can see them in the boundary of the thick part, and these spheres feel what you call it. The spheres feel, I want to. So, the spheres feel, I want to say a disk. What's the higher-dimensional analogue of a disk? So, they in the thick part of the titanullar space, these spheres are contractible into the thick part. And so we have an action of the Mackenclass group on the complex of curves. And this is how we define this Steinberg module. This Steinberg module, which is the homology of the complex of curves with integer coefficients. Okay, so this is relevant to finding a further mapping class group, equivariant deformation retraction of the spine. So in small genus, the Thurston spine has dimension equal to the virtual spine Equal to the virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group. So this virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group gives you a lower bound of the dimension of the image of a mapping class group equivariant deformation retraction. So it's a topological obstruction. A topological obstruction to finding a smaller dimensional deformation retraction. So, how we define the virtual cohomological dimension is you take it, well, for any group, you've got the cohomological dimension, which is the supremum of the dimension in which you have non-trivial cohomology for some module M. For some module n in which you have your coefficients. Now, the mapping class group has finite index, but it has torsion. So the cohomological dimension is not so interesting, but the virtual cohomological dimension is. So you remove the torsion and then you calculate the cohomological dimension, and according to SARE, According to Sayer, this, well, any finite index torsion-free subgroup of the mathematic of a group has the same cohomological dimension. So in the case of punctured surfaces, Harrow has a very explicit deformation retraction that achieves this lower bound. And it turns And it turns out that you can do the same for non-punctured surfaces. So something that really surprised me is that the Thurston spine for large genus has dimension larger than the virtual cohomological dimension. So, what you can do is Is to take a further deformation retraction is that you have to look for unmatched phases in the Thurston spine. So the Thurston spine is a CW complex and if you can take a deformation retraction of it at all, then you need to start with unmatched faces. So an unmatched face is, well, you take a So you can make it.   L cis C of the spine. So, and also we have this ball intersecting the boundary of the thick part transversely in a connected set. So, we get this sphere in the intersection of the In the intersection of the ball with the boundary of the thick part, and that has dimension equal to one less than the codimension of the top-dimensional cell of the Thurston spine. Now, the top-dimensional cell of the Thurston spine can't have dimension less than the virtual cohomological dimension because that's the lower bound. So, suppose So suppose the top dimensional cell of the first and spine has dimension larger than 4g minus 5, then the dimension of this sphere that we've constructed in the boundary of the thick part has to have dimension less than 2g minus 2. So that means that it's contractible. This sphere is contractible in the boundary of the thick part because we saw that The boundary of the thick part has topology by Ivanov up here. It has topology, it's homotopy equivalent to an infinite wedge of spheres of dimension 2g minus 2. So if this sphere in the boundary of the thick part has dimension less than 2g minus 2, then it's a boundary. It's a boundary. And that means that D of Q can be homotoped relative to its boundary into the boundary of the thick part in Teichmuller space. So, this homotopy moves the unique point of intersection of this ball off the thurst and spine, which means that the first and Which means that the thirst and spine has to have an unmatched face. And so if your cell cis-C only has one unmatched face in this orbit, then what you do is you just collapse in that unmatched face, like so. And that gives you a mapping. A mapping class group equivariant deformation retraction. Now, if you have more than one representative of the orbit on the boundary of the top-dimensional cell, then what you need to do is to construct a fundamental domain of the action of the mapping class group on the cell. Now, this isn't so difficult.      Ah, stock share. Ah, stop share. Now I can see you again. Okay, so does anyone have any questions? Anybody out there? Oh, hello, so I didn't catch that. There was an echo. Sorry. Are we connected to the internet at all? Yes, yes, we hear you. We hear you. Okay. Good. So any questions? I can see you talking into the microphone, but I can't hear anything being said. What about now? Yes, I can hear you talking. Okay. All right. So I think the last five minutes of your talk, your audio was cutting in and out a little bit. So maybe we had problems understanding. We had problems understanding. So I don't know if you want to summarize or something, maybe. The last part. So, what do you mean by last? Maybe, yeah, the last two minutes of your talk. Any summary you want to make? Well, the important construction is, of course, Dustin's construction. And then you can in And in high genus, Thurston's spine has dimension larger than the lower bound given by the virtual cohomological dimension of the mapping class group. So what you do is when you know the structure of the cells of Thurston spine, then you can construct a further mapping class group equivariant deformation retraction using a kind of a dual to the third. A dual to Thurston's spine, a dual to the top-dimensional cells. To show that, you have to have an unmatched face of the Thurston spine when the Thurston spine has larger dimension than the optimal. And then you use this unmatched face to find a further deformation retraction. Was all I wanted to say. All right, thanks. Bye. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Any other questions? Oh, Max has a question. Sorry, just a simple question. So when you have these cystals that fill the surface, can their lengths change a lot? The total length? Well, within on. Within each cell of the thurst and spine, that has compact closure. So, on a given cell, the length of the systoles, I don't know, they don't change by so much, I suppose. They're bounded from above by Bear's constant and bounded if they're in the first and spine, then there's also a lower bound. There's also a lower bound. So on the spine, they don't vary too much. And of course, they go to zero out. The length goes to zero out towards infinity. Thanks. Any other questions, maybe from the Zoom participants? Okay, so if not, maybe let's thanks. Thank the speakers again. Speaker. Thank you.
