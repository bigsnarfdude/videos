Recent, um oh, what's what's the okay? I just lost the the uh acronym, the report, the IPCC. IPCC report. I kept wanting to say CNIP there. Um, the recent IPCC report, uh, where you were one of the leads on the science chapter, right? So, I, you know, I'm looking forward to hearing what you have to tell us about turbulence and how that relates to plastics. So, whenever you're ready, feel free to take it away. Sure, thanks. Sure, thanks. Thanks very much. It's nice to be at least remotely thinking about what it's like in Banff, even though it would be nice to be in Banff. But anyway, thanks, everybody. Let me share and not forget to click the video clip button, but not the sound button. Okay. So there is a so I guess I would say there's an interesting relationship. I would say there's an interesting related story on the front of how upper ocean turbulence relates to climate change, which I won't talk about today, but that's my other sort of go-to presentation to give these days. So if folks want to ask questions about that at the end, that would be fun. We can talk about how that works out. And it's sort of similar in scope. I guess, how did I get involved in the plastic? How did I get involved in the plastic stuff? And I'm really looking forward to the discussion this afternoon because we're trying to do better modeling of plastics and pollutants in general in Narraganset Bay. So I'm eager to talk to other folks about challenges they've been having in regional and coastal environmental modeling. We have some pieces of this story that we're working on that relate directly to this work, which I can talk about when I highlight that, but we don't have those parts of the code running. Parts of the code running operationally yet for complicated technical reasons, as usual. But I got interested in this product problem because we were interested after the Deepwater Horizon spill in oil dispersion. And so you can see this picture behind the words there that shows an airplane down here in the lower right. And so, for scale, and so that's oil. That's the color that oil turns after it's been in the sun for a while. And you can see that it's not. And you can see that it's not a big blob of oil. It's very streaky. And the streaks are perpendicular to the wave crests, which you can see in the sunglen. And so those are characteristics of Langmuir windrows. And so that's one scale of turbulence. And why is that important for plastics and for oil? It's because you're going to see patchy distributions. And so if you're out measuring plastics, you should not expect. Measuring plastics, you should not expect them to all be uniformly distributed. You should, in fact, expect them to be clumping into these convergence zones. And we're going to see why convergence is important. And that's true on this scale, the Langmuir scale, but it's actually also true on the larger sub-mesoscale scale. So the hundreds of meters to 10 kilometer scale, we've also started to recognize that convergences, at least not three-dimensional convergences. Not three-dimensional convergences, not compressibility of the ocean, but surface convergences with downward velocities and potentially leaving buoyant particles behind in those features is an important aspect of the submesoscale. So that's where we're going. And please feel free to interrupt or I don't have the chat window open, but I will try and open it right now so that if somebody types something in because I've disappeared or I'll keep an eye on it, Van. I'll keep an eye on it, Baylor. Okay, good. All right. So, basic GFD. If we take a tank, then these are from the John Marshall's Fluid Dynamics Lab a few years back. But if you take a tank and you just, and it's not rotating and you squirt dye in, it looks like this. It makes little blobs of three-dimensional dye. And you can see the mirror on the side, it's kind of, it's isotropic roughly. So it's blobbing in all three directions. So, it's blobbing in all three directions in about the same amount. This die is neutrally buoyant, so there's no reason why it should do anything other than that, but that's what it looks like in a non-rotating setting. But in a rapidly rotating setting, so small Rossby number, the dye spreads very differently. And I want to highlight the way in which it spreads. So, it spreads in these kind of sheets or columns, Taylor columns. I mean, everybody should remember this. I mean, everybody should remember this from TFD, but anyway, we'll say it again. But this is relatively two-dimensional motion or quasi-to-dimensional motion. And if the motion really was two-dimensional, like assuming that the height here doesn't go up and down a lot, we couldn't converge or diverge. And in fact, if you notice, these streaks don't run into each other. They get close and kind of strain against each other, but they don't mix. Other, but they don't mix. See how they're like side by side, but not colliding? And so, for the longest time in oceanography, large-scale oceanography, thinking about search and rescue and that kind of thing, folks had assumed that using two-dimensional fluid dynamics would be pretty good for the representation of the surface. And the reason why that's interesting observationally, of course, is you can find out the pressure gradients from an altimeter of a two-dimensional flow. Two-dimensional flow, and then, or you could, you know, watch the temperature get strained out like this. And you could then recreate what kinds of structures are there and think about whether plastics or oil would be aligning itself with these streaky features. If you do a different problem, which is like this is the toilet flushing problem, and I won't subject you to the 10-minute long video from The Simpsons about the toilet flushing in the southern hemisphere and whether it goes the other way, which is hilarious. I recommend you go. Hilarious. I recommend you Google it after the talk. This is a rotating tank, this is a weekly rotating tank, and it has a drain hole in the middle. And so the fluid is coming in from the sides, and you can see that the little pellets or the little floats are going pretty much down the drain hole with a little bit of rotation. But if you speed up the rotation, they don't go down the hole. They don't converge very quickly. Instead, they go around and around and around. And that's, you know, another way of measuring the Rossby number is to say that the geostrophic. Number is to say that the geostrophic velocity greatly exceeds the ageostrophic velocity. So the velocity that's going round and round is bigger than the one that's going down the hole in conversion. And so if we think about this from an equation side, the geostrophic valence is inside of the larger horizontal momentum equation. And we know that that's when you expect the Rossby numbers, both the temporal and the advective Rossby number to be small and the Ekman number to be small. That's what you get. Number to be small, that's what you get is this geostrophic balance. And if we do a little more calculus on the geostrophic balance, well, first, some rearrangement of the vectors to write it this way. The geostrophic velocity is perpendicular to the pressure gradient, and you can take the divergence of that, and you get zero. It doesn't diverge or converge up to the point where F changes with latitude or these higher order corrections like Ross, higher order Ross. Directions like higher order Rossby number or higher order Ekman. And if you take the curl of this equation, of course, that gives you a vorticity equation, which goes into quasi-geostrophe and all of that, which is the way we tend to solve large-scale motion. And so the motions in the mesoscale, which obey these scale relationships here with small Rossby number, small Ekman number, small, you know, for the mesoscale, the length scales are small enough that you don't feel the curvature of the Earth that much. It means that basically the flow is not divergent. Basically, the flow is not divergent. And so the surface is not divergent. And so, those kind of clusters, those windrows that we saw in the Langmuir turbulence at the beginning, you would not expect those to occur at the mesoscale. Instead, you would expect these long streaky patterns. And so the plastics might still clump, but they would clump with a streaky kind of pattern. So that's the traditional view of how you would do search and rescue or whatever on the large-scale ocean motions. On the large-scale ocean motions. But in recent years, and particularly in this Carthy project that was funded after the oil spill by BP, we're starting to refine that. And I want to introduce you to some of the pieces of that. And potentially, there's opportunities for cleanup of plastics or collection of plastics, or at least implications for the sampling of plastics that relate to that. Relate to that. And so, this is, you know, ocean convergence and the dispersion of flotsum. So, this is a paper that Eric wrote, and there are actually a series of review papers at the end of this project. This is one of the nice ones that talks about this. But I want to show you the video that was made by this group. So, the basic idea was we went out to more or less where the oil spill was and released a lot of GPS tracked drifters. And the GPS tracked drifters drifted around on the surface, and they were buoyant, so they didn't go. Surface and they were buoyant, so they didn't go down, they just stayed on the surface. What did they do? Well, here's a nice little movie. And so, this were originally put out in a clover leaf pattern that was about 10 kilometers in size, 10 by 10. And if you notice, the pink ones are doing something very funny. This is not running backwards in time. This is running forwards in time. The pink drifters, all of them, ended up within 100 meters of each other, even though they had originally. Meters of each other, even though they had originally started out 10 kilometers apart. And it's because they, those pink drifters in particular, maybe I can restart the video. Oops. Now I gotta go backwards. Those pink drifters in particular happen to be on trajectories that end up in one of these features. It's like the plug hole in the bottom of a tank, but really it's the meeting of two frontal features. And at a front, there's light water meeting. And at a front, there's light water meeting heavy water. And then the heavy water slides underneath the light water in a complicated process that sharpens the front. But as it does that, anything buoyant that was getting invected along in the heavy water ends up sitting right at that frontal nose and stays put there. This kind of strong frontogenesis, though it was originally the dynamics of this. It was originally the dynamics of this were originally discovered in the quasi-gystrophic equations, or at least the you know, a weak Rossby number limit, like the equations that I was wandering through a couple slides ago, gets much more intense as you go into the sub-mesoscale range of scales. And so I want to follow through some of the consequences of that and see some other observations we've seen and some other consequences of that that are worth thinking about in the context of how plastics would disperse. Context of how plastics would disperse in the open ocean. Sea ice is a nice tracer that's maybe a little less environmentally worrisome, or maybe more environmentally worrisome, depending on your perspective, than plastics of the sea surface. But sea ice also nicely highlights these frontal features and convergence zones. That's where the sea ice ends up. So you can, the reason why these look like eddies is because those features of surface convergence and also Features of surface convergence and also the straining pattern are aligning themselves together with the eddy structures underneath in the ocean. So, when we go into a coastal setting, we might expect to see something like this. And this leads to the problem that we're going to talk about this afternoon. This is a simulation of, we're actually trying to simulate oyster larva here in Narragansett Bay. And we're releasing different colors of tracers and roughly the oyster pattern throughout the tidal cycle. Um, throughout the tidal cycle, and we were interested in whether the dispersion was the same throughout the tides, and it's definitely not. It demands whether you're releasing during high tide, low tide, ebb tide, or flood tide as to where you spread out and how fast. And it definitely matters whether you're in a feature with a mean flow that's outward or a part of the domain where there's not necessarily a mean flow. But you can see that this doesn't have that streaky pattern that we saw before, nor does it have windows. Saw before, nor does it have windows in it. And that's because of the challenges of representing the sort of fluid dynamics on the scale of a small basin. This is only about 10 kilometers wide, Narragansett Bay. And so fitting all of the fluid dynamics in is a challenge for the way we normally do coastal modeling. But if you go out there in a boat, you definitely can see small structures, you can see small streaks, and you can see when. Streaks, and you can see windrows and other convergence features in foam and in flopsum on the surface of the bay. So, we know that that's part of the way that pollutants would get distributed in the bay, but it's something we presently don't model very well. So what kind of a model could we use? We could use a much higher resolution model, which simultaneously measures the resolves the turbulence and the largest scale features in the flow. Features in the flow. For technical reasons, as I said, this is much easier to do in a rectangular domain where we can use Fourier transforms instead of having to use the crenulated coastline of Rhode Island. We're working very hard to try and do this in the Bay of Rhode Island, but it is technically complex. Anyway, but let me show you a few of the results here in this simulation, which is simpler. So this is just doubly periodic, and there are winds and waves being put on in the direction that's indicated there. Direction that's indicated there. And this is a fully three-dimensional non-hydrostatic simulation. So we're getting those surface convergences as we get them. And if we zoom in, this is the whole domain, 20 kilometers by 20 kilometers, but if we zoom in on a one by one box, and these are colors here is indicating temperature in all of the figures, but in these outer boxes, what's colored, it's only the locations of large vertical velocities. Of large vertical velocities. And so those are the places where the surface is converging and going downward. And so if you had buoyant particles, you would expect them to be clumping along with this pattern of where this is being colored. But it's also being colored with temperature. So some of those convergence zones, you can see this one very nicely, are associated with the frontal feature, and others are not. Like, so here, there's no temperature gradients out here, but there's still Langmuir windrows. So in this simulation, we're So, in this simulation, we're simulating both the convergence zones from the boundary layer turbulence together with the convergences of those sub-mesoscale features that have to do with the temperature and the thermal wind gradients that are putting up geostrophic and higher order corrections to that. And so, sometimes you might have a strong frontal convergence. And this paper, not this paper, but a paper I'll talk about in a second, we talked about why that tends to occur when the front is flowing in the down wave direction, which is. Down wave direction, which is a higher order correction to do with the Stokes submesoscale interaction. And if you have the frontal feature going perpendicular to the wave direction, sorry, the wave direction here is from the upper left to the lower right, you don't tend to get as strong of a convergence feature associated with the geostrophic flow, though you still get wind-driven convergences or language-driven convergences, wind rows. Windrows. So, what does this one of these fronts look like? This is one of the strong ones that's in the same wind and wave direction. This little box is where we decided to do some averaging and some other pieces. This is the paper that describes how the surface wave effects affects this frontigenesis. And if we look at the vertical velocity, you see that the vertical velocity is highly aligned with that front, but also with windows kind of everywhere. But the biggest vertical velocity velocity velocity Of everywhere, but the biggest vertical velocity feature, the biggest convergence zone is right on top of the front. So, if we release surface drifters in this flow, yes, some of them pile up in the windrows, but a big fraction of them are very dark white here. So there are about 85,000 surface drifters in this little eviction calculation, align themselves very nicely with that front where the convergence zone was. If we look at the front from the side, we can see why that is. The side, we can see why that is. Here's the light, warm water and the cold water side by side, and we would expect to see a convergence where the cold water is going and sinking down underneath this front. And if you look at the overturning stream function, which is shown below, that's exactly what we see. We see this warm water, it's going this way. And then there's the nose of the front where it goes quickly downward, quickly downward. That is a combined effect of the frontogenesis forcing and the Stokes wave forcing to make. Wave forcing to make that quick downward part, and then the water, the cold water goes underneath. So, if you release the drifters, they come this way and they pile up there because they can't sink, and they also come this way and pile up there because they can't sink, and you would get a big cluster of buoyant particles here, which is what we see in the simulation. So, this is just the same picture we saw again after 40 minutes, and then after 80 minutes, just the strongest features have kind of gobbled up all of the neighboring parts. Doubled up all of the neighboring parts. But we tried to do the same thing in the real world. And so we had an aerostat, which is like a balloon that had a camera on it. We hooked that to a boat. And then we went out in a different boat, a little zodiac, and threw bamboo dinner plates out of the back of the boat. And they were painted by middle school students. So they were all individually identifiable and afterwards for particle tracking purposes. For particle tracking purposes. And you can see what happens is originally, you know, they just kind of unstructured. And then after about 10 minutes, you start to see Langmuir windrows aligned with the wind and wave direction, which is where this arrow is indicating. And then after about 20 minutes, the big ones have gobbled up the neighbors. And so we didn't actually have additional temperature measurements to go along with this. But you might have guessed that this big one that gobbles. Guess that this big one that gobbled up the neighbors may have had a frontal structure as well as a Langmuir Windrow character. So, why are we interested in fronts? Well, fronts are consistently present. They're all over the world. They're pretty much everywhere you have temperature gradients. They can result from eddies stirring up the temperature field and creating more fronts. They can also be the result of vertical mixing. So, every time you get wind outbreak or changes in the winds, you get differential mixing. They're sharpened by this frontigenesis. They're sharpened by this frontigenesis process. And then again, frontigenesis is arrested, or not again for the first time. The fronts don't sharpen infinitely sharp. They go down to a certain scale and then stay put when the turbulence is mixing and the phrengogenesis is squeezing. And so that gives you an angle into predicting how big they are, maybe where they would be and where they would be intense. So these characteristics are essentially highlighting the when. Highlighting the when qualitatively you would expect fronts, and those fronts would tend to offer convergences. But my former student, Abigail, actually went another step, which I want to talk about, which is to do some of the theory of this. So the classic frontigenesis theory, so on the left are velocities, and on the right are, and it's buoyancy shown in these black lines. So the velocity, sorry, the velocities are the colors here. The velocities are the colors here. And then the overturning stream function is the colors on the lower, and with little angles to help you read the overturning stream function. So the front is going into the page and out of the page. And there's an overturning, a secondary overturning like this associated with that. And over time, this overturning pinches together those buoyancy surfaces. So they get like this, much more concentrated. And the front gets narrower and sharper. And it's this overturning that's actually causing that surface condition. Actually, causing that surface convergence, bringing stuff together into the front. So, this is a kind of classic theory. And what Abigail did was extend that theory to include the effects of turbulence at the same time and try and think about how that front might get arrested. And so if the front is, you know, if there's a frontal tendency, which means, you know, positive here is the front is getting stronger, negative here is the front is getting weaker, for a critical amount of turbulence, which here. Critical amount of turbulence, which here is just parametrized with like an eddy viscosity or an eddy diffusivity, depending on which of these four panels you're looking at, for just the right amount, you can stay at zero for a long time, which means that the front doesn't get stronger and it doesn't get weaker. And so the red marker is saying where when you have horizontal viscosity or vertical viscosity or horizontal diffusivity or vertical diffusivity, would you be able to stay that way for a while? Be able to stay that way for a while. So, this is a little artificial in that the amount of viscosity or diffusivity we are controlling. But it turns out that if in that simulation I just showed and in others like it, the turbulence gets stronger when the front gets stronger. And so those two balance each other out repeatedly in a natural kind of process. So the turbulence gets stronger both from the frontal shears that are set up by the front itself, and the turbulence gets stronger if you. And the turbulence gets stronger if you put surface forcing on it and drive more boundary layer mixing. You put those together and you get an arrest point where those two come into balance. And this theory helps Abigail guide herself toward putting all of that together into a scaling law for the frontal width in the presence of the so-called turbulent thermal wind balance. So here's the thermal wind. So here's the thermal wind, which is just geostrophe plus hydrostasy. That's this part of the equation. And then we said before the equino number is small, and so you don't worry about boundary layer mixing in the classic case. But in the submesoscale case, where all these features are in the boundary layer, you actually do have an equid number order one. So all three of these terms should be of the same size. So if you demand that all three of those terms are of the same size, That all three of those terms are of the same size, and you demand that this turbulence is forced by surface forcing, wind stress, so U-star forcing, and surface convection, W star forcing, and the way that we would normally take a Monon-Obikov theory to drive turbulent mixing of the boundary layer, you get a prediction for the frontal width that looks like this. And that may just be a whole bunch of signals, but basically it says the frontal width should get larger. It says the frontal width should get larger when you have more wind-driven mixing or more nightly cooling. The frontal width should get smaller when you are less stratified. The frontal width should get smaller when you are closer to the pole. The frontal width should scale inversely with the boundary layer depth, which is a very strange piece of business, but that's the way that. Business, but that's the way that this works out. Why is it so? The interesting thing now is figuring out what the consequences of this are. So, this tells you the potential, though, when might you see these sharp features where you could go collect plastics all at once or you could go sample them? Well, if the winds were low, if the boundary layer depth was deep and the amount of cooling at the surface was low, you would expect to see very narrow fronts. And so you would expect. Very narrow fronts. And so you would expect this clumping of stuff together. This is a big evolution over our previous theory for the frontal width, which basically said it looks like a deformation radius, which is definitely not right for all conditions, even though these two together, when you evolve them together, we think that actually the deformation radius converges to this frontal width over time. That the turbulence is essentially halting all the fronts, and then that feeds back on the stratification to make these two the same. To make these two the same. Yes. Okay. So does this work? Well, yeah, here versus those kinds of LESs, a whole series of different LES, which it is fun to pod up as only one grid point because each of these is a couple million CPU hours, but they just get one dot here on the figure. That scales pretty well with that predicted scaling versus the diagnosed width of the fronts across a different bunch of different LES, including ones that have Stokes drift. Including ones that have Stokes drift in them, which is interesting. So, this includes the Langmuir sharpening effects. And then the left-hand side is a collection of observations from the Bay of Bengal just to see what the PDF looks like of frontal widths. And so the most likely value is somewhere in the kind of 300, 400 meter range. But there are some that are out in the multi-kilometer range. And so you would expect to see clumpiness like this when you go out in. When you go out in the plastics distributions. So, if you did a mock nest tow to catch your plastics, you would not want to do a 50-meter-long tow because you might miss or hit a front if they're 500 meters in scale. But then again, there's probably not much reason in going more than three kilometers or so because you're going to have cut across about 10 of them, missing them on and off, on and off, on and off. So, this kind of frontal with helps you kind of think about the sampling structure. Sampling structure. And it's not just the sampling structure that you might be not surprised. Let me see how I'm doing for time. This affects the statistics of the turbulence across all the scales from the smallest kind of order one meter scale all the way up to the 100 kilometer mesoscales. This is reconstructing from observation. Reconstructing from observations on the left, simulated drifters in a Neil Land grid, and then more observations on the right. I'll come to the ones on the right, but just pay attention to these two on the left. So this is the second order longitudinal structure function, which is a fancy way of saying this is something that's equivalent information to a power spectrum. It has a particular slope that depends on separation distance. And this is a second order quantity. This is a second-order quantity. So it's a measurement of velocity at one point versus the velocity at a different point. If they come together, that makes big second-order structure function. If they go apart, that makes big second-order, if they rotate around each other, that doesn't count because this is the only paying attention to velocities in that direction. And so over those Langmuir clusters, this scales at a pretty low power of the separation distance, r to the one-third. And then when we get into the sema as a scale, it scales. Get into the submesoscale, it scales like r to the two-thirds. And then when we get up into the mesoscale, it scales like something steeper, maybe r to the one or even r to the two. When we get to the mesoscale, so that's saying that there is a scale-dependent effect. So these kind of things, the kind of clumping that's happening in the Langmuir scale is statistically different from the kind of clumping that's happening in the sub-mesoscale, which is statistically different from the kind of clumping that's happening in the mesoscale. And I've already explained enough for you to understand. And I've already explained enough for you to understand the difference between the mesoscale and the sub-mesoscale, because I said the mesoscale doesn't converge because it's basically quasi-gystrophic dynamics and convergence is not allowed. When we get down into sub-mesoscale at large Rossby number, order one Rossby number, we can converge at those fronts. And so you'd expect these to have different statistics. And now let me explain the next piece of this wrinkle. I should say this is all from Jenna Pearson, my former PhD. Jenna Pearson, my former PhD student's thesis. The blue lines here are the statistics of Eulerian velocity correlations. So two locations fixed in space. Are they moving, is the velocity pointed toward each other or not? That's what the blue lines show. And the green lines are Lagrangian at the same separation distance. So following the motion of parcels. And you can see that in the mesoscale, those two are not that different. They're actually Two are not that different. They're actually so, where the convergences are not strong, there's really no difference in this statistic between the Eulerian and the Lagrangian structure functions. But when we get down into the submesoscale, there is a difference, and that's because these structure functions are actually clustering together into fronts. And so you're not sampling the field uniformly anymore. You're preferentially sampling the front. You're preferentially sampling the frontal structure, the frontal convergences, only in the Lagrangian statistics. We don't know that to be true over here with the observed bamboo plates, but we get the same power law here that we get here. So we think that the bamboo plates are also clustering for the same reason that the simulated drifters were clustering. They're giving us the same power law across scale. And then the Langmuir, they're also clustering, like we showed that they were. Clustering like we showed that they were, they're clustering even more sharply in an even flatter spectral slope. Okay, so we think that the convergence here is a big effect in the submesa scales and a big effect in the Langmuir scales, and so it should be something that you could detect. It should be part of your sampling strategy. So let me jump over here to the right-hand side and tell you this little piece of the story, which is even crazier, maybe. Okay, so this is showing the second-order structure function in colors. In colors, as a function of separation distance along the x-axis, but as a function of the divergence at that location in the field. So point by point, calculate the divergence and calculate the separation distance between two points. Put yourself here. That gives you a color. So these strong convergences, the big negative divergences here at very short distances are giving you a big signal in second order. Signal in second-order longitudinal structure function. How do we get divergences like that are that big? This is actually a high-frequency radar product where we're measuring the surface flows from a boat and measuring an Eulerian map of the surface flows all around the boat. That's where the colors are coming from. And then the contours here is the probability density function for. Density function for where we found the drifters in that same flow. So the drifters are actually a little skewed on this towards these other convergent features just by this kind of evolution. And that little bit of skewing off of center. Oh, am I explaining this wrong? No, I am explaining this wrong. That's the Eulerian PDF, where we think that should be. So this is not drifter-based. This is just. Drifter-based, this is just what are the divergences at every grid point in the flow without worrying about where drifters would go. And but we know the drifters are going to be drawn into these features with large convergences. And so the fact that the structure function here is steep along, it goes from blue, low values to yellow, high values, where the Eulerian velocities are, but the convergences are shallow. Are shallow is what we think is going on here with this shallow slope. So let me say that again. If I took the Eulerian probability density function, I don't see a preference for convergences. But if I take the Lagrangian one, I do see a preference for convergences. And the preference for convergences tends to flatten this structure function slope. It makes the small separation distances have big values. Have big values. It makes it shallower. So we think from an observational and a modeling perspective, we've got a pretty clean read on how these different flows work together to give us different statistics across the submesoscale where these convergences are affecting what we see. And Jacques is asking me to re-explain the Lagrangian structure functions. So, Jacques, the Lagrangian structure function is basically you take drifters and you release them in the flow, and then you Release them in the flow, and then you look at their velocity statistics, which the only difference between those and the Eulerian structure functions is that after a while, the Lagrangian's ones have clustered into the places where the drifters are going to tend to accumulate. So it's a biased sampling of the velocity field. Okay, so it's a weighted average, which is the density of drifters, which is it's weighted on the present location of the drifters. Present location of the drifters. So the formula holds true, but it's the average which is different in the two cases somehow. Exactly. It's the same. This formula down here is exactly the same between the two, but which positions do you choose? You choose the positions on a uniform Eulerian grid, or you choose the positions following the Lagrangian parcels. That's the difference. Okay, thanks. And that's what I'm trying to pull apart here with this right-hand side where we're actually mapping the Eulerian statistics, but then noting. Statistics, but then noting that if we happen to sample down here where the colors are yellow, we would be shallowing our statistics. Okay, so you can say, oh my God, does this look like Richardson? Does this look like Kolmakorov? Does this look like Craifman? Does this look like Charney, etc. The simple story here is that all of these theories are based on more uniform sampling. Even though the Even though the slope that we saw here for the structure function was an r to the two-thirds, so a Richardson or Kolmogorov power law. We don't think that's the reason why we saw the two-thirds. We think that the two-thirds is to do with the sampling bias. So now, whether you think that's deep, that the fronts are more Kolmogorov than the rest of the flow, while the rest of the flow is more Charni's, that's a philosophical. That's a philosophical discussion. The point here is that if we uniformly sample this flow, we don't get the Kolmogorov scaling law. We get something that looks more like a QG scaling. But if we sample only at the drifters, we see something that looks more like the Kolmogorov power law. But that's not the right interpretation. It just happens to be those are the same slopes that come out. So there was a big dispute after we released these drifts. Big dispute after we released these drifters because everybody said, Oh my god, it looks like 3D turbulence, 3D turbulence all the way up at the one-kilometer horizontal. And I was like, There's no way that there are any three-dimensional one-kilometer structures in the Gulf of Mexico. The boundary layer is only 10 meters deep. That's not possible. What's going on? And what's going on is that those drifters are clustering in such a way as to skew their statistics towards a different power law. And that power law happens to resemble the 3D one. Happens to resemble the 3D one. Okay. So that's all assuming that we don't have other things to worry about. There's a lot of work on using things like finite time or finite size Lyapunov exponents to try and detect these structures. And like we were saying, in the geostrophic velocity field, those kind of structures. Those kinds of structures frequently align themselves with things like eddies and fronts. This is a recent paper led by Vero Morales-Marquez that I helped Phil out a little bit with. And basically, the left side tells you the most part of the story. So this is an observational product based on altimetry to get at the geostrophic velocities, and then including an Equin estimation from the wind speed and a Stokes estimation from the wave. Stokes estimation from the wave observations. And here, this region was chosen because the geostrophic velocity has a nice coherent structure. So it's filled with the blue stuff. You fill it up and then let it get advected by the geostrophic velocity and it basically stays coherent for about a month, you know, January 26th down to February 20th. But if you include the Ekman transport and the Stokes effects, In the Stokes effects, you get the pink dots. So the pink dots were released at the same location as the blue dots, but the full or well, a more complete estimate of the velocity field was included in the invection. So in the blue, it looks like there's a coherent structure there. In the pink, it's just not the same coherent structure. It's a totally different thing. There is actually what looks like maybe a temporarily coherent structure over here. Temporarily coherent structure over here in the pink, but it's not on the same manifold, the trajectories are totally different. So, even though these are relatively small corrections at this relatively large scale of hundreds of kilometers to have an Ekman transport and a Stokes transport included in the transport velocity, they are enough to really change the structure of the coherent structure field. And on the right-hand side, it's just a seasonal estimate of. Seasonal estimate of basically where you see coherent structures as detected by finite size of the Apodov exponents and how much change they are in a percentage on the right-hand side. So something about 25% of the magnitude in those coherent structure detection algorithms is sensitive to including the non-agiostrophic velocities in the assessment. Okay, well, what if these things aren't totally buoyant? Okay, well, what if these things are totally buoyant? What if they don't stay at the surface? Maybe they just get sucked down the hole. And this is a simulation very similar to the one they showed that John Taylor did, which shows partially buoyant parcels being released into this kind of a sub-mesoscale active field. And as it's developing, you can start to see this one doesn't have Stokes drift, so it doesn't have windrows, but it does have these kind of streaky patterns, which are associated with the wind stress that's in. Associated with the wind stress that's imposed. But you'll start to see that a mesoscale, a sub-mesoscale feature with some fronts starts forming right around here, and it starts gobbling up all of those particles, the ones at the surface, but it's also gobbling them up from the side, and they're feeling down and being entrained into the core of that convergence zone. So they're coming into the convergence zone and then going downward, but preferably. And then going downward, but preferentially downward where those vertical velocities are large and negative, which makes sense. So here's a big, now here the idea has really gotten going. And you can see that even though, and so the idea here is that if the, you know, the rise velocity, I can't remember what rise velocity this is, but the rise velocity is somewhere between the minimum and the maximum vertical velocity that you're seeing in these structures. And so really, only the really strong convergences are capturing these. Are capturing these parcels, whereas the others are popping back out and rearranging themselves. And the last point I wanted to leave you with was just what this looks like in a realistic domain like the Pacific. And a nice way to think about this is in the frequency wave number perspective. So this is a set of nested models using ROM. So the whole Pacific and then a zoom in and then a zoom in, then the inner zoom in is sub-mesascale permitting. And you can see there are lots of big, this is where the curve. You can see there are lots of big this is where the curatio extension is. So, there's you know big old curacio with lots of mesoscale meanders. And if you zoomed in more, you'd see sub-mesoscale wiggles, which are a few of them are visible. So what does that look like if we take some of the standard metrics of things like kinetic energy? So we could observe kinetic energy from the satellite, which was dominantly geostrophic, or at least close to it, even pretty much throughout this whole range of scales. And you see that, you know, here the big. And you see that, you know, here are the big eddies. There's the curcio and the teddies. And that's dominating the kinetic energy. And so you might say, oh, well, that's, you know, these are the eddies that I'm worrying about doing my transport. Yes, these are the eddies that are probably doing the lateral transport, but they're not the eddies that are doing the convergence. If we calculate the power spectrum of vorticity scaled by F, now we see both the mesoscale eddies. Both the mesoscale eddies and the submesoscale eddies at a higher frequency and a smaller length scale. And if we take the power spectrum of divergence, we see the submesoscale eddies are dominant. So if you are talking about convergence and divergence into these small structures, the action is going on in the submesoscale eddies, even though the submesos. Submesoscale eddies, even though the sub-mesoscale eddies are much, much weaker than these large-scale features that are being shed off of the curio. If you go down a little bit in depth, the mesoscale eddies, so this is a 200 meters depth, the mesoscale eddies actually extend deeper in the water column, so they dominate the deep vorticity. But the sub-mesoscale divergences are still pretty active, even Are still pretty active, even down deeper. So, some of these filaments and some of these frontal structures are actually reaching down deep enough to affect things even below the mixed layer base in this estimate. And you also now see the signature of the dispersion relation of internal gravity waves leading to divergences and convergences along the kind of along the expected bands that you get from their dispersion relation. So, let me go back. So, near the surface, we expect all the divergence. Surface, we expect all the divergence and convergence to be in these kind of frontal structures. That's a big part of the, at least on these scales. When you get down to smaller scales, we'd start to see other kinds of things like Langmuir and Windrows, those pieces. And when we get deeper, then the convergences and divergences of the gravity wave spectrum is sort of in competition with the sub-mesoscale features down below the Mixlayer basin, the stratification. So that's it. That's what I wanted to say. So the traditional understanding of So, the traditional understanding of mesoscale transport is divergenceless, quasi-two-dimensional, quasi-dystrophic flow with coherent structures. But when we get to the sub-mesoscale, that starts to change as we get these large Rossby, large Ekman flows in the boundary layer, the convergences at the fronts, or potentially local collection points for plastics as well as oil or whatever else, biology. There's a dispersion overall. Interestingly, if you run those second-order and third-order structure functions. Third-order structure function statistics, partials are still tending to spread out, even in the sub-mesascale, but intermittently they're collecting. So that's a funny kind of flow where the general behavior is dispersion, but point-wise, there are these strong convergence points. And there are very different statistics for the Lagrangian statistics and the Eulerian statistics. And that's true in both measurements and in simulations. So we're pretty clear on how that sorts itself out. How that sorts itself out, and it's just to do with that sampling bias that I was talking about in answer to Jock's question: is once you get on the Lagrangian trajectories, they tend to cluster in a different way than the Eulerian, you know, uniform sampling does. And there are very different coherent structures when you include the Stokes and Ekman effects, because really the velocity fields are quite different than they are if you go back and use an altimeter to calculate the QG divergence-less flow. Convergence-less flow, or even just the non-Ekman flow or the non-Stokes drift flows. What sets the frontal scale? Well, it's this balance between the frontogenesis and turbulence. And as I showed, my student Abigail has a theory for how you can use surface forcing to make that balance work and give us a prediction of frontal width, which we're starting to understand its consequences. And for all of these reasons above, some mesoscales tend to dominate the statistics. Above, submesoscales tend to dominate the statistics of convergence and divergence, particularly so in that frequency wave number diagram. It really clarifies there's just a bullseye on the submesoscale phenomenon. And at even smaller scales, Langler cells feature strong convergences in windows as well. Thank you very much. Thanks, Baylor. That was really great. It was a lot, but like a really thorough view of sort of ocean turbulence and how it. View of sort of ocean turbulence and how it could play into these problems. Thanks. Yeah, I really enjoyed that. So we've got some time for questions. So if you have a question, please use the hand raise feature in Zoom. It looks like Jacques got his hand up. Yes, I just want to ask you about the divergence associated with the QG motion, I mean the meso scale. So I mean just at the very end, So I mean just at the very end you showed some results suggesting that it's completely negligible, but isn't that sort of biased by the fact that you looked at a very active region? I mean if you go somewhere in the middle of the Pacific or something? I just I mean I realize fronts are probably much more convergent but on the other hand fronts are sort of rare absolutely I guess the point is you know it's quite easy to cook up an idealized circumstance where a mesos Idealized circumstance where a mesoscale feature would dominate over a sub-mesoscale feature, or vice versa. So, we're trying to get some sense of the natural statistics. And so, the Pacific is, and the Curacio is just an example location. Were we to have done the same in the Gulf of Mexico, those statistics are sort of consistent in that there are these convergences that tend to be dominating in the sub-mesoscale, and that's why. In the sub-mesoscale, and that's why the Lagrangian and Eulerian statistics pull apart. So while it is too soon to say that there is a clear scale separation, and this is the way that you think about it, and this is the expected power law that you see in the Lagrangian statistics, and this is what you see in the Eulerian statistics, and we don't know what controls the breakpoint between those two, aside from vague notions about where the Rossby number reaches one in that separation distance. In that separation distance space. The idea here is just that when you go out into the world and start looking, the convergences tend to be flatter spectrum, so more sensitive to the small scale than the overlying power spectrum of the kinetic energy, which tends to be very large scale. So somewhere in the middle there, the breakpoint, you're crossing Rossby number equals one. And then when you get to smaller scales, you're able to And then, when you get to smaller scales, you're able to converge more effectively because you don't have the resistance of the kind of spiraling down the plughole resistance. You start to get them more strongly at smaller scales. I suspect there's a lot more to think about there and a lot more to be more precise than what we're doing. And at the moment, we're kind of collecting case studies in different locations as opposed to a more systematic treatment. So, I agree. So I agree. Pacific is a random choice, but it's a choice that is interesting because the power spectrum is of kinetic energy, so dominated by the large scale. Okay, thanks. Okay, I think Glenn was next with his hand up. Hi, Baylor. Thank you for the talk. I think it's a little similar to the last question, and that is, of course, you know, quasi-geostrophy has order-Rossby number divergence. And so as you transition. And so, as you transition to sub-mesoscale, you're just making it stronger and stronger. But I think the kind of question is: we want to think about convergence on a multiple of scales, all the way up to the gyre scale. And there, maybe mesoscale or even ecton pumping, even though they are very small, end up dominating. Absolutely. I mean, so, you know. I mean, so, you know, you couldn't predict the location of the garbage patches on the basis of QG, but they certainly tend to pile up where the Ekman convergence is. So on that very large scale, sure, that seems to be an organizing principle. I guess what this discussion is, is in that set of ranges where you're sub-mesoscale and turbulence, can we understand where the convergences are coming from? And I guess that part of the story is starting. Coming from. And I guess that part of the story is starting to come together a little more clearly around these frontal structures and windrow structures on the Langmuir scale. But yeah, even in the large scale, the small second order effects, the kind of order beta effects are starting to contribute when you think about them on the gyre scale. Sure. I mean, it's a different story at different scales. That's part of the structure, the longitudinal structure functions so clearly show that they're different. Functions so clearly show that they're different genes. That's the part that I think is really kind of interesting about this. And that seems to be consistent between at least the observations we have and the simulations we have, which aren't QG simulations. They're full, you know, boost nascent simulations. Yeah, but you kind of think about saying, okay, we've got a lot of small clumps, and now we want to worry about how those small clumps turn into bigger patches at some point. At some point. Absolutely. Yeah. And I mean, it's, you know, from a practical perspective, I think this is really just sort of, we're not really going to go out and collect along the small clumps. And we certainly can't, I should have said, resolving any of those small clumps, whether they're at the submesa scale or the Langmuir scale, is far beyond our data assimilating model capacity right now. We could not predict where they will be in order to go find them. In order to go find them. So we thought about that from the oil collection perspective: like, could you make a forecast? You can make a qualitative forecast, like this is where we expect a lot of the fronts to be, but the action, you couldn't, you know, program your GPS to go drive along one of them and collect oil or collect plastic. That's beyond the capabilities of what we can do with a data simulating model now. So at the moment, the only Only prediction of where these things are is on the much larger scale. And then the fact that they'll be clumpy within is kind of inevitable. Maybe they're more clumpy in some locations than other locations. I hope that's part of where Abby's theory for the frontal width ends up is, you know, predicting regions where the clumpiness is expected as opposed to places where those fronts might be very wide. Nice thing about clumpiness is you might be able to see it. Yes, sometimes you can see it. I don't know if you can see it with microplastic. I don't know if you can see what you know, micro plastics from a distance is sort of, yeah, but anyway, macro you can there's probably some critters and other things, and there tends to be a lot of foam and other stuff. Like when you see them around here, it's obvious for there's all kinds of things floating, not just plastic. Thank you. I think Eric's got his hand up. Yeah, thanks, Baylor, for a really cool and super enlightening talk, as always, of course. Course. So I had a question about these Lagrangian structure functions that you showed. So do I understand correct that at least as you measure them that there's suddenly also a time scale involved? Because of course, if you start your particle is uniform, then it takes time for them to converse to the front. But at the point that they are at the front, then they can't actually get closer to each other anymore. So does it mean that you get a time scope? And if that's true, is it only a measure? Scale, and if that's true, is it only a measuring time scale, or is it also kind of like an inherent time scale now then to the problem? Yeah, we looked into the early time evolution to the best in the observations. That was not, we couldn't do it. Basically, you can't deploy them fast enough to get the array out before they're clustered. So, by the time you're done deploying, they've already fallen where they're going to fall. But in the simulations, we looked at that a little bit. And it's similar to like one Eddie turnover time scale on that length scale. Time scale on that length scale. So that is about how long it takes for them to fall into a feature. So it's relatively short, and it gets shorter the smaller you get. So, you know, those Langmuir cells appear in one Langmuir turnover time, so 10 minutes, but the bigger frontal structures gobble up the Langmuir cells on the kind of hour time scale as you get toward an overturning of the secondary circulation of the frontal structure. So it's It's a scale-dependent time scale, but it's something like a turnover time scale for that scale. Okay, so that's a bit like what you would have expected anyway beforehand. Yeah, yeah. And no surprising physics there. That's, I guess, what I'm saying. I don't think there's a surprising physics there, but it is, it's definitely the only thing is just how fast those are in the observational campaign. We were unable to. Observational campaign, we were unable to detect anything like the Eulerian statistics at any time because we just can't put the drifters out that fast. Okay, thanks. Maybe from an aircraft, you might have been able to do it, but not from a boat. Yeah. Okay, Jacques, I think you have your hand up again. Yeah, so it's just a comment following Eric's question, which is theoretically you expect that the drifters are going to accumulate on a fractal setting, the long time limit, right? In the long time limit, right? So, somehow, is this Lagrangian structure function saying something about the distribution along the fractal set? Yeah, I mean, it's sort of a very cloudy view of that. It's something like, well, what if you took the Fourier transform of the strange attractor, which is a weird thing to do, but that's kind of what a structure function gives you information about that. It would be much more interesting to be to do a more complete analysis of. Complete analysis of different orders of structure function, which we looked into a little. The third order structure function has a relationship to the energy cascade. It's more difficult from a sampling perspective to detect the third order because it's even more intermittent. But there are signs that the energy budget is strongly affected by this as well, which basically says that the transfer of energy. Which basically says that the transfer of energy across scales tends to occur at the energetic features, which is, you know, maybe that's not a surprise, but it's nice to have a statistical representation of that. So, but there's a lot of money. I guess my concern is that when you do like racial statistics after a long time in a compressible flu, then you're doing statistics about a set of zero area, right? You're sampling a set of zero area. Yeah. Wherever you are. Yeah. Well, if you were staying, well, let's be fair though. If you were staying on a particular set of attractors, but the other thing, the thing that we hinted at in that, the paper from Vero is that all it takes is a little kick to get you off of the Lagrangian attractor and onto a different set of attractors. So there's additional noise from the small-scale turbulence bumping you from one attractor to another. So I am very cautious. I'm very cautious of the thinking about the two-dimensional attractor at all as being a good guide for very long because you tend to get bumped off by some other phenomenology on a different scale, whether it's a 3D phenomena or a burst of wind that kicks you off. All those things are part of the story as well. I think it's becoming increasingly clear that those kind of effects are really important in the real world. So, you know, that's a mixed bag. That's a mixed bag for the kind of traditional geodesic approach for two-dimensional structures at the surface. For the full 3D attractor, I have no idea. I mean, that's the kind of, that's a fractal dimension on a level that's hard to wrap your head around. How you would even detect it with this kind of, you know, we just look at the surface, basically. So we don't know what to do to try and detect the intricacies of the 3D structure. But yeah, I mean, you're always falling into this. Yeah, I mean, you're always falling into this kind of a flow field. You're getting strained out by it, but you're never quite getting there. And there's lots of randomness superimposed. So it's like the fuzzy, you know, like the fuzzy Lorentz model rather than the Lorentz model itself, where you have a stochastic forcing superimposed on some either stationary or long time scale behavior. Okay, thanks. Okay. Okay, thanks. Okay. Well, on that note, I think
