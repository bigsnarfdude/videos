Explain that argument today, and I will also explain how the way in which the argument is wrong in the non-planar case is actually interesting. And so the non-planar case of the conjecture, if it is true, will require, I think, new ideas to prove. So that's the plan. So let me just remind you. Let me just remind you of what the conjecture says. So I'm going to write conf k of x for the ordered configuration space of k points in x. So that's just k tuples of pairwise distinct points. And So, the unordered case is also interesting, and we heard something about that in the previous talk, but I'm not going to say anything about that. And maybe I'll draw a picture of a point in this space. There's point one, point two, and point three, and this is a point in comp3 of the torus. Okay, and um. And, well, probably something I don't need to saddle anyone here on is that one way of thinking about motion planning is through the topological complexity of the background space in which the motion occurs. And well, the way to think about configuration spaces in this setting is. Spaces in this setting is if we have a number of different movers in the background space that we would like not to run into each other, then to think about lesion-free motion planning in that background space of K state robots that's somehow being talked about by the topological complexity of the configuration space. Complexity of the configuration space. And my convention is that the topological complexity of a point is zero, not one. Okay. So in many real world situations, like an automated factory or something like that, the background space could be approximated by a graph. Could be approximated by a graph. And so that's the setting of Harbour's conjecture. And as a matter of notation, I'm going to write M of gamma. Gamma is a graph. A graph is just at most one-dimensional finite CW complex. And M of gamma, we already saw M in the previous talk. It's the number. In the previous talk, it's the number of essential vertices in the graph. Where essential means valence at least three. So, those are the vertices that make a graph a graph. If you don't have any essential vertices, then you're a manifold masquerading as a graph. And so, what What Barbara says is that, well, maybe we don't have an easy way to understand the topological complexity in general, or maybe we do, but that's not what the conjecture is about. But stably we do. So if we restrict We'll restrict our attention to connected graphs with at least two essential vertices. Handling disconnected graphs is something that one can do, and handling graphs with fewer essential vertices is something that one can do. So these aren't like essential restrictions. They're just to make a clean state. To make a clean statement. And it says that as long as your number of points is large, so at least twice the number of essential vertices, then the topological complexity doesn't depend on k. So the topological complexity. The topological complexity of the configuration space of k points in gamma for all such k is equal to this number twice the number of essential vertices. Okay, that's Barber's conjecture from 2005. Barber didn't conjecture the version for higher topological complexity because higher topological complexity wasn't a thing yet. Complexity wasn't a thing yet. But it's reasonable to think that he would have conjectured that if you put R here, then you put R there. Okay. And maybe before I move on, I'll point out that it's also very interesting to wonder what the topological complexity is for small values of k. And some things are known, but maybe not all that much. But maybe not all that much is now. Okay. So let me just tell you about the progress that has been made on this conjecture. So in 2005, when he made this conjecture, Barber also proved the conjecture for trees. And then, as far as I am aware, there wasn't a lot of progress made for another almost 15 years until 2019 when Daniel Ludgateman and David Racio Mitter extended the class of examples for which the conjecture was known to what they call. To what they call fully articulated graphs and banana graphs and also in 2019. The version of the conjecture for higher TC was proven for trees. So trees, higher TC. And that's due to a list of names, which is five names long, but only three people long. So that's due to Usma. Guessman and Gonzales and Oxford Medina, excuse me. And then in 2021 I prove the conjecture for planar graphs. And the argument also works for higher TC. I'm sorry. Planar. And that, as far as I know, is the state of the art today. So there are these bullet points, but in a sense, there's only one bullet point because there's only one idea, more or less. I mean, I don't want to undersell the work of these other folks, including myself, but really there's only one idea, which is Farber's argument in 2005. And what each of us did in turn was say, oh, actually. Each of us did in turn was say, Oh, actually, Barbara's argument works in this other setting if you just fiddle with some things. Okay, so that's a if you take if you take away only one thing from this talk, well, if you take away only two things from this talk, they should be the following two things. So, this is what I have to tell you. So, this is what I have to tell you today. So, first, Barber's argument, as he made it in 2005, works for planar graphs, if you arrange things correctly. And the other thing I have to tell you today is that it doesn't work for any non-planar graph. I mean, not from a graph that should be on data. If you take two things that are non-planar and then you join one thing, that would be non-planar and fully articulated, but the argument works in there. So in order to make this construction, I'm not saying that I know that this construction doesn't work, you would have already had to have two non-planar graphs that were fully articulated. So So, maybe you know of such graphs. I'm not aware of any. But maybe we can come back to that. Of course, this is not a precise statement. So let me, in addition to the answer I just gave, let me sidestep your comment by saying, I will give you a precise statement that is what I mean by this. And then there can be no disagreement about what it means. So, what I hope to convince you of is that To convince you of is that, in some sense, like this is the end of the story of this idea. And to go farther, we will need new ideas. We will not be able to rely on Farber's idea, or at least not that idea of Farber. Maybe he will save the day again. Okay, other questions before I go on? When does my talk end? When does my talk end? Okay, so in order to try to get at these two points, let me ask why we should believe the conjecture at all. So why Where does it come from? Well, I can't tell you where it comes from because I'm not Farber, but I can tell you where I would imagine it comes from. And he can tell you whether I'm right. So a theorem that has been proven by a number of folks. So at least Yakovsky and Yakovsky and Abrams says that this configuration space deformation retracts onto a cubicle complex different cubicle complexes, but okay and um And the dimension of that cubicle complex is at most the number of essential vertices. So there's this crazy thing where there is a uniform bound independent of k, which is realized eventually for the dimension of the configuration spaces. Pretty striking. And so what Farber's conjecture is saying is that generically, Conjecture is saying is that generically Tc is as high as possible. Okay, um, now, okay, that doesn't answer the question why you should believe that. That's just saying what the question, it's making the question precise. So let me try to explain why you should believe it. And And for that, let me put an example on the board. So, this is an example of two points on that graph. And something you can do if you are two points on this graph, maybe they're those two points. Those two points is you can move one of them onto the unoccupied leg, moving through the central vertex, and then do the same thing with the other one. And that will end you up in a place. Of course, these are labeled configurations. Let me just not label them. You can keep track. That ends you up with a picture like this. With a picture like this, and then you can do the same thing, and then you can do it one more time. So that would have left you with a picture looking like this. And then you can continue directing traffic through this central vertex and end up where you started. So that concatenation of paths is a loop in the configuration space if I concatenate them. Space: If I concatenate them and look at the class of that loop, I get an embedding of the circle into my configuration space, which it turns out is a homotopy equivalence. We actually saw this example on the board in the previous talk. So, the class of this loop is all the information that there is in the configuration space of two points on that graph. Okay. On that graph. Okay. And so this example, was there a question? No. Okay. This example prompts an idea that is very simple, but very fruitful in this business, which is that if you have an essential vertex in a graph, well, it has a graph. Well, it has valence at least three. And so I can produce an embedding by making some choices of that graph into my big graph that hits that essential vertex. And so then I can push a circle into my configuration space and I can get a homology class, right? So that essential vertex produces for me an embedded circle, or lots of them, but at least one. At least one in the configuration space of any number of points, at least two. Okay, well, maybe there are lots of essential vertices, and that's fine because they're far away from each other. So I can do this dance at a bunch of different vertices at the same time, right? So if I have our essential vertices, Then, again, making some choices, I get an embedded R torus in a configuration space of any number of points that's at least two times R because I need two R many points to do that dance at R different vertices. These are greater than or equal to, excuse me. Okay. So the upshot of this discussion is that the dimension of the configuration space, as long as I see. I thought it was farber calling with another idea. So the upshot is that the dimension of the configuration space of at least two m gamma points. M gamma points is detected in homology by a torus. Okay, there's a map from a torus of that dimension into the configuration space, and pushing forward the fundamental cost of that torus tells me the dimension. Okay? And so this is This is why I think you should believe the conjecture. You should believe the conjecture because, well, we all know what the cohomology of a torus looks like. That top class is decomposable, right? And so if that torus in the homology of the configuration space was decomposable the way that a torus is decomposable, then we would win because we could build up long, long products of zero divisors from colomology classes. From colomology classes that detect circle factors of the torus. And then we went. Okay. So the idea, which is Barber's idea, is that you should, as long as, well, okay, let me back up. So I'm going to say something that isn't precise. Something that isn't precise, but I think we all can understand what it means. So, if Harper's conjecture is true, if this torus is phonologically decomposable, which is not Which is not something I'm going to try to define, but you can imagine, all of you, what that means. And why is it true? And build long cut products from holomology classes that detect circle factors. Of the torus, and then you can invoke the inequality that the zero divisor coupled is a lower bound for Tc and twice the dimension is an upper bound for Tc. Those two will agree and then you will be done. Okay, is the idea clear? Clear anything that comes after this is much less important than the idea. I will take your silence for an assertion of perfect understanding. So, the problem with this approach. The problem with this approach, which is where the specifics of the various papers that I mentioned on the board come in, getting over this technical problem. The problem is that we don't know anything about the cohomology of these spaces. So that's an exaggeration, but it's not much of an exaggeration. I will put five question marks. I will put five question marks to indicate how little we know about the cohomology of the general configuration space of a general graph. Like nothing. So these two fine people have done some like really hard work, or at least it seems hard to me, just to understand trivalent trees. Am I correct? So what's going on in general? We don't know. So, what's going on in general? We don't know. We just don't, like, not even a little bit. Okay. The depth of our ignorance cannot be overemphasized. So, that's a problem. So, instead of like doing this, let's give up and think about something else. So, let's instead of doing that, try to show something easy and To show something easy and boring. So instead of showing this difficult thing about mysterious collomology, we will instead show that the topological complexity of the configuration space of an even number of points in the plane is Is at least 2D. This is a bad band. This is like roughly half of what the truth is. So much harder work by Friarburn Uzvenski and Farber and Grant, I believe, calculates the TCU configuration spaces of Euclidean space for general dimension. For general dimension. So we're just going to content ourselves with this much easier bound. Why are we going to content ourselves with that? We're easy to please. So we only need to know one thing really about these spaces to get this back. And what we need to know is that. To know is that the configuration space of two points in R2 is a circle, and it's a circle for two specific reasons. So it's a circle because there's a Gauss map that maps it to a circle by measuring the direction between two points. And that's a homotopy equivalence. And it's also a circle because there's an embedded circle, which consists of the configurations of points. Of points centered at the origin that are unit distance from the origin. They orbit each other. That's a circle. Do you want D only instead of 2D? Because if T is one, for instance, if D is one, you would have Tc of S one being one. If this one, yeah, you notice the way is to get a circle, Tc of the circle is. I see what you're saying, yes. So we're only going to be needing this for large numbers of points. So let's say for D sufficiently. Oh, okay. Yeah. So D is large. Yeah, thank you for that. Other questions? Other questions? So here's a picture. Here are my two points. Here is the direction between them, and they are allowed to orbit each other. Okay, this is the only information in the configuration space of two points in the plane. Okay, so 10 or 15 after, you said. Speaker's choice. Oh, wow. Four o'clock? So, okay. Well, what can we do with this knowledge? We can take two D points and we can remember only two of them. And we can recognize that as a circle and look at collomology and take the generator in H1 and pull it back. So that's called alpha ij, where this is projection onto coordinate i and coordinate j. Okay. Okay. So, well, you can cook up more of these. So, if you have a collection lambda of subsets of one up to two D of cardinality D. So I'm just breaking up two. So, I'm just breaking up 2D up into, well, yeah. I don't need them to be disjoint, but they will be disjoint. Then I get a colonology class, which I'll call alpha lambda, which is just the product of these. Okay, so take the product of all the alpha ijs. Sorry, cardinality two. Thank you. So I have a collection of subsets of one up to two D of cardinality two. For each of each subset of cardinality two, I get an alpha ij, and I can just take the product of all of those. Every damn board? Now, one more piece of notation. Now, one more piece of notation. We're interested in TC, right? So we should have a zero divisor. And so that zero divisor is going to be called theta lambda, depends on lambda, and it's the product over all pairs in lambda. Pairs in lambda of this sort of easy zero divisor. And I should have said, I guess, that I'm working mod two this whole time. And this lives in the colonology of the configuration space of 2D points in R2 spread. And R2 squared. Okay. So here's the only thing you need to know about these classes for the bound to pop out, really. It's that if the numbers of lambda one, which is one collection of Lambda one, which is one collection of subsets of cardinality two, and Lambda two, which is a different subset or airwise distinct excuse me or sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. Or sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. I'm trying to say two things at the same time. So separately, each lambda one for each lambda, each of these subsets of cardinality two should be disjoint. So like I don't have one, two, and two, three both in lambda. Each of the subsets of cardinality two disjoint. So that's like. That's a condition for Lambda one and separately for Lambda two. And now I'm going to demand a condition about their interaction, which is that no subset appears both in Lambda one and lambda two. Intersection of Lambda one and lambda two is empty, then the product of the two zero divisors, zeta lambda one and zeta lambda two is non-zero. Non-zero. And this is why we need D large, by which I mean D at least two, because there is no such Lambda one and Lambda two if you only have two points. But there is as soon as you have four points. Okay. Great. Great. So basically, this is the calculation that gives it to you. Here is a product of that many zero divisors, and here's a product of twice as many zero divisors. And it's not zero as soon as you can find a Lambda one and a Lambda two that satisfy these conditions. And you can do that as long as D is at least two. And the proof of the lemma is very simple. Is very simple. I will give it to you in a picture. So we want to know that that class is not zero. And the reason it's not zero is completely geometric. There is a torus inside of the configuration space that it evaluates non-trivially on. That it evaluates non-trivially on. Okay, so this class is detected by the simplest possible torus you could think of, which is just here stepping on some cables, maybe hopefully not ruining everything. So here's point i and j. ij is an element of say lambda one orbiting each other. And I just line up these circles where these pairs of points are orbiting each other at unit distance. Okay? Okay, that's a torus of the appropriate dimension, and it detects this zero device. Okay, and this is very easy to show using classical facts about configuration spaces of the plane. Okay, questions so far? That was a little bit of notation getting thrown at you, but nothing actually happened. I just reminded you of something. You have something very dumb that you can prove about the TC of the braid group, pure braid group. Okay. Oh, thank you. I appreciate that. So, um, so why do we bring up this bad bound? Bad bound. Well, the bad bound is already enough to prove Ferber's conjecture for planar graphs. So the observation is that inside of the plane, this picture, where I have two points orbiting each other by taking turns passing through the central vertex, is Through the central vertex is homotopic to this picture. Inside of the plane, there's no difference. And so what that means, so proof of interface. Interface is that that zero divisor, which was non-zero in the colomology of the plane, once I choose a planar embedding of the graph, restricts to a non-zero zero divisor in the colomology of the configuration spaces of the graph. So if we choose. choose an embedding of gamma in R2 then theta lambda one theta lambda two restricted to the configuration space of 2D points in the graph is also not zero because it is the It is detected by that torus that we described earlier in the talk, the one that detects the dimension of the configuration space. So let me maybe draw a picture. So here's part of the graph, and like point I and point J are Are orbiting each other around that essential vertex. And there's more graph over here. And there's more graph over here. And two more points are orbiting each other around that essential vertex. And two more points are orbiting each other around. Around that essential vertex. And up to homotopy in the plane, that picture and that picture are not distinguishable. Okay, so the torus that detects the zero divisor in the plane actually comes from the graph. So that's saying that the coal knowledge of the zero divisor restricts non-zero to the graph. And that's it. That's the proof. Okay. Okay, questions before I tell you why this doesn't work for a non-planar graph? Yeah. Yes, thank you for that. I meant to say that earlier, but maybe didn't. Exactly, this argument works. If the things that I've said combined with the kind of combinatorics that are laid out in your paper for higher TC for trees works exactly. Works exactly in the same way for higher TC. So the higher TC version of Farber's conjecture is true for planar graphs. Other questions? So now I would like to convince you that nothing like this can possibly succeed for a non-planar graph. Seed for a non-planar graph. And the reason is that while that same torus does exist, it is not decomposable in the same way. So this torus, in homology, it's obviously decomposable because it's like a product. But well, anyway, I'll just write, I'll just write the result. I'm running out of time. So So, the following conditions are equivalent for a graph. First condition is that it is non-planar. The second condition is that there's some embedding of this graph into your graph. And remember, this graph, the configuration space of two points there, is a circle. And it's those circles that build up the torus that detects the dimension, which we hope is homologically decomposable. There is some essential vertex and an embedding of a star graph at that essential vertex that induces zero in H1. Or let me say this. Some embedding induces zero on H1 of the configuration space of two points. Okay. So while the torus does exist, once I, this is the paradox. The paradox is that if I put stars at That if I put stars at all of the vertices and push the class from the torus forward, that's non-zero, even for a non-planar graph. But if I just put one star at one vertex and push the circle forward, that's zero. So that big torus doesn't decompose in homology or colonology. Okay? This is the sense in which it does not decompose into. There is no colonology class that detects that circle factor because that circle factor is zero. Okay. And another way to say it is that for every subgraph, gamma zero and planar embedding of gamma zero. So you could try to reduce to the non-planar to the planar case. Use to the non-plane, to the planar case, right? You could choose a spanning tree which is planar, embed it into the plane, get your collomology classes, and hope that they lift to the non-planar graph. And being non-planar is exactly saying that you can't do that. So yeah, thank you. So for every subgraph with a planar embedding, the restriction of alpha ij to the To the configuration spaces of the subgraph does not lift to the colonology of the configuration spaces of the big graph. Does not lift to H1 of conf2 of gamma. So none of the cohomology that you need to make this argument work is there as soon as you are non-planar. That's equivalent to being non-planar. Planar, that's equivalent to being non-planar. Okay, uh, so I will end with the same question I asked earlier. And I don't have an answer to this question. Maybe one of you does. The question is: why believe the conjecture? That's all. Thanks. That's all. Thanks. Are there any occasional questions? No further ideas of what are the alternatives to okay. Okay, so the obvious thing that you would want to try is you would want to embed your graph into some surface and then maybe hope to adapt arguments given by Cohen and Farber calculating the topological complexity of pure service-brade groups. Maybe there are some legs there, I don't know. I should have said arguments given by Conan Farber and corrected by yourself. But do you know a method that works for one non-planar graph? Like you know, this planar graph, non-planar graph for this one, you know that the connection is true. You know that the condition is true? I don't know anything like that. No, you don't know of any non-panagrapher which you do know it's true. No, this could be my ignorance, but probably it is humanity's ignorance. Like, what you would need, like a minimal thing that you would need is like something about the colonology of the configuration space of 10 points in K5. Yes. And that's like. Yes. And that's like way beyond anything that we know computationally, like way, way out there. So, yeah, I don't even know of a method that would get you any non-planar graph at all. But again, yeah, like tell me about like zero divisor or tell me about cut products in 10 points in the complete. In the complete graph on fiber disks. No, that's too way too long, but uh, keep just like a commercial. The medium is uh working, but instead of 10, 2. Great. That's the problem. And indeed, if you start moving for two points, it's a surface. No, it's only when five. Yeah, yeah, yeah. This is for any number. Ah, great. Ooh, cool. Uh oh, great. Ooh, cool. I want to hear about that. Additional questions? I have not thought in any depth about that, but I think no, probably not. But I think not. Probably not. Like the configuration spaces of the two-sphere are not so different from the configuration spaces of the plane. They sort of differ by a sphere factor and a shifted index. So probably there's nothing there that isn't already in the plane. It's always worth 10 and 5? Oh, I mean, this is so m of k 5 is 5. So this is this is 2m k5. So this is the k5 is the non-planar graph with the fewest vertices. You don't have to know the answer. So this is like you could think about k33 if you want. Yeah, yeah, but that has more vertices. So this is the Actually, we have right this minimizes the indices of any example. So, this would be the first interesting case. What to solve? Not because it plays a role. No, no, no. I mean, potentially it plays a role. Like, like maybe you can reduce together. And I guess the answer maybe is no, I don't have any example or any idea. I don't even. Or any idea. I don't even know. I mean, so maybe this is like, I've already gone way over my time. But maybe someone here can tell me like any technique for showing that TC is too low. I would love to hear about that. Yeah, lower than the dimension. Like better upper bounds than the dimension. I would love to know about that. But yeah. Build an explicit motion planner. Build an explicit motion planner. No, thanks. Right, right. Easier. Yeah, I mean, we know so little about this colonology. Maybe it is actually easier to build an explicit motion planner on this graph. Maybe there's some example of one of these configuration spaces that decomposes as a product. Yeah, my knowledge of this is zero. Yeah, I mean, my knowledge is epsilon. Anyway, thank you. Any more questions, comments, counter-examples? All right. Thanks again. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Emmanuele DeLucci, perhaps I missed it, but is it possible to have an idea why non-planarity kills the embedded tripod? Oh, yeah. Thank you for that question. So hopefully this, oh yeah, great. You're doing awesome back there. So here's the deal. There's a relation in H1. Okay. So there's a relation in H1 of configuration. H1 of configuration space of two points on this graph, the theta graph. And what it says is if I have two particles that are doing the dance through this vertex, that's the same in homology as two particles doing the dance through that vertex. Okay, so just believe this. This is true. It's a relation in homology. And so what happens when you apply this to K5? So here's K5. So you can start with two particles doing the dance through like this edge and maybe it doesn't matter, it doesn't matter. Through the say those three edges. And using that relation, you can Relation, you can say that that's equal because you can find an embedded subdivision of this, lots of them inside of this graph. You can say that that class is equal not to this class, but to the one going the opposite orientation. That's where non-planarity comes in, because you switch the cyclic orientation when you move to the next vertex of K5. And so then if you do that five times. Five times, you end up with the same class times minus one to the fifth. So it has order at most two. But then there's a theorem of Cohen Park that says that H1 of two points in a graph ordered is torsion free. So it's zero. In the unordered case, this exact same argument creates the only known two torsion in homology of configuration spaces of graphs anywhere. So another Anywhere. So another important problem is: is there any odd torsion? But anyway, that's the argument. Manuel says thank you. You are welcome. You are welcome.
