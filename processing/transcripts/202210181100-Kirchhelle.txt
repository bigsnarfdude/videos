For the second session. So it's a great pleasure to invite Carlotte Kirkele to the screen here to talk about her work. We will wait until the end of the talk to make the questions. And yeah, looking forward. Great, thank you. So I called my talk Concept for Edge-Based Growth Control Advance because I thought Based growth control implants, because I thought that sounded better than a tentative idea for edge-based growth control implants. But this talk is very much in the spirit of sharing some preliminary and unfinished work. And I think you are the perfect audience to give me some feedback on it. So for a bit of background first, I'm interested, like so many people here. Sorry, I just need to work out my logistics. Great. In growth control and plants. And in particular, I'm interested in understanding how the cell wall. In understanding how the cell wall that we've heard a lot about now is actually assembled in the first place. Because the different cell wall components and they're associated by synthetic machinery that construct the cell wall actually reach the cell surface through distinct trafficking routes. And all of these different trafficking routes need to be coordinated with each other and also dynamically regulated in space and time. And plants are very good at this. Astonishingly, to me, when you look at a growing plant root, for example, the cell walls stay. Root, for example, the cell walls stay a constant thickness despite very big differences in growth rates on individual cell phases. So, trying to understand how all of these different trafficking pathways are regulated is something that's close to my heart. And the approach that we like to take is to look at RAP GTBACs. And these are key regulators of intracellular trafficking, and they can recruit other proteins that are involved in vesical docking, transport, and fusion. So, they're a really good market for understanding different traffic. Good market to understanding different trafficking pathways. And a number of years ago, when I started my PhD, I got particularly excited about one of these RAP GTBAs called RevA5C. And you can see it in green on this slide. And if you look at the top left panel here, you can see maybe why I got excited about it. It has a really unique localization pattern. So it localizes to these endomembrane compartments that line up in the periphery of cells. And actually, just at the geometric edge, where two faces meet. Edge where two phases meet, these compartments sit under the plasma membrane like pearls on a string. And we find this trafficking pathway active precisely in growing cells. So we see it's strongly expressed here in the meristem of a developing lateral root, and then it fades away as cells reach their full size. And we could show a number of years ago that if we inhibit the function of this REP GTPAs, cells lose their ability for directional growth at the cell and organ scale. So we ended up with these blobby. Scale. So we ended up with these blobby cells. And also, we ended up with organs that were a little bit wonky. So this raised the question for us: how cell edges can actually control growth. And we already heard about one concept yesterday from Rico that can explain how maybe polar domains within cells, including cell edges, can be involved in growth control. And that is through selective stabilization or nucleation of microtubules in the specific domain. And in detail, In the specific domain, and indeed, cell edges have been identified as such a domain first conceptually by Brian Gunning in the 1970s, and more recently, Chris Ambrose and Jeff Wastenes actually identified molecular components that are involved in microtubule nucleation and stabilization. So our first thought was, yeah, surely our edge-directed transport pathway controls anisotropy somehow through organizing microtubules at cell edges, through participating in this process. But to our surprise, But to our surprise, when we actually looked at the effect that inhibiting Reb A5C had on the microtubule network, we found that in these REB A5C plants, we actually had more organized microtubules than in the wild type, both at the level of the individual individual cells, microtubules were more aligned. And also when you look at the supracellular level, all of these microtubules were aligned in transverse direction to the longitudinal root axis. Them a longitudinal root axis. So, for all intents and purposes, these roots should grow. These cells should grow more directionally. They don't, but we had the idea that perhaps this hyperalignment was a compensation for the loss of another independent edge growth control mechanism. And when we did an experiment where we independently disrupted microtubules and edge trafficking, as you can see here, we found that the two of Here we found that the two of them each affect directional growth in the root, and if we combine them, we get a really severe synergistic phenotype, suggesting that these pathways independently participate in growth control. Now, that doesn't give us a great answer in terms of what edge trafficking does to control growth. So, Sinyu Zhang in my lab tried to work out what other mechanisms could be there to control edge-based trafficking. And basically, the approach she took was a little bit similar to what I've shown you before. Little bit similar to what I've shown you before for the rhizolin experiment where we perturbed microtubal organization. What she did is she perturbed different cell wall components and asked whether she could identify any phenotypic interaction with RevA5C. And in this first experiment, I am showing you the procrused mutant, which is deficient in cellulose deposition. And what you can see is that this mutant, the procrused mutant, similar to RevA5C, causes some degree of root swelling. So a degree of loss of growth and isotropy. A degree of loss of growth and isotropy, and you can see that quantified here. But then, if we combined the two mutants, we saw that the combined effect actually was very similar to the effect of each individual mutant. So, in both cases, when we expressed Reb A5C in the wild type or in this mutant, we got a similar degree of swelling, suggesting that this is a simple additive phenotype consistent with those two being in different pathways. And people sometimes ask me, why do you always look at the lateral root? Just to let you know, didn't we also look at the hypocotyl length as another? look at the hypocortal length as another measure for growth and isotropy and we saw a similar additive phenotype. So this pathway is not just something that happens in later roots. Okay, next component we looked at was xyloblucan. And in this case, we looked at the XXT1-XXT2 double mutant, which is deficient in xyloblucan, which is the main hemicellulose in aerodopsis roots. And what we found here was something a little bit more exciting. We found that in the double mutant, actually we had Actually, we had either less or a similar degree of loss of directional growth. So, you actually have epistasis of even a partial suppression of the phenotype that we can cause with Rev85C in this mutant. So, this was exciting to us because it suggested that this XXTX, this xyloglucan, might be in the same pathway. So it might have something to do with edge-phase growth control. So, what does xyloglucan actually do in the cell wall? Thank you very much, Dan, for the great introduction. Very much, Dan, for the great introduction. I don't have a lot of things to say now, but basically, in the last decade or so, the Cosgrove Lab has done an amazing body of work characterizing the function of xyloglucan, and they have brought forward this idea that xyloglucan mediates cellulose interactions in load-bearing mechanical hotspots that are discretely distributed within the cell wall. And the work also suggested that when xyloblucan is absent, pectins make a larger load-bearing contribution, and this explains why an And this explains why an XXT1, XXT mutant actually has a relatively mild phenotype. So then we thought we can easily test this. We just need to modify pectins within our REBA5-CNI background, and Rab-A5-CNI should be hypersensitive to that. We did that next. We used an overexpressor of pectin-methyl esterase inhibitor, which blocks pectin-D-methyl esterification within the cell wall. And we found that indeed roots were hypersensitive. Indeed, roots were hypersensitive, and we had a synergistic interaction between the loss of edge trafficking and this pectin modification, both in the root and in the hypofutor. So that made us think Xylogluken really is a good candidate for explaining edge-based growth control. So next we wanted to see it. And Sinu spent a lot of time developing a whole-mount immunolocalization protocol to visualize the distribution of xyloglucan within the cell wall. This is a very difficult thing to do. Cell wall. This is a very difficult thing to do. So, the data I'm showing you here are still preliminary, and we're working on this. But, what is reproducible from these experiments is that we see an enrichment of an antibody called LM15, which binds to the XXXG motif in xyloblucan at the longitudinal edges of meristematic cells in the root. And then later on, we see it at the faces as well. Now, when we inhibit edge trafficking, we can see the vector edge. Edge trafficking, we completely lose the xyloblucan signature from these cells in the meristem. It doesn't mean that the protocol doesn't work anymore because when we look at the tips of root hairs, we still see this localization pattern. So we think this is really something that has to do specifically with what's happening at cell edges. But what we haven't worked out yet, which is still a work in progress, is to understand whether this has something to do with the distribution of the xyloglucan or with the Of the xyloglucan or with the accessibility of the xyloglucan within the cell wall, because it has been shown in the past that pectin residues, for example, can mask epitopes within the cell wall. So this is something that we're addressing actively at the moment. However, it doesn't affect much the formulation of our working hypothesis, which is that through some means, edge trafficking can set up rate-limiting mechanical hotspots at cell edges that are accessible to To two things within the cell wall, two proteins within the cell wall. And one way, maybe the obvious way, would be that this would be through targeted secretion of xyloglucins. So this is obviously just a representation. It's not the appropriate scale, but the idea here would be that through specific setting up these hotspots, you would have the edges as the major bearer of these load-bearing hotspots. So there's a mesoscale domain here emerging at the cell edges that is relevant. Emerging at the cell edges that is relevant for growth control. So, what's the advantage? Why have hotspots at edges? What's the point of this? Well, going back to then cost growth's work, and we also heard about this earlier today, actually these mechanical hotspots are believed to be the targets of expensive-mediated growth. And when you look at the distribution of expenses within the cell wall, you see that those are enriched at cell edges as well. Now, when my colleague Marketa Zamalova, who I know Marquette Zamalova, who I know back from Oxford, showed me this data for the first time. I told her, Don't get too excited about it. Everything is enriched at cell edges within the apoplast inner root. We see this all the time. We even see this when we just put a free SEC RFP within the cell. If we have a turgite cell, it's really enriched at the cell edges. And if we plasmolize the cell, it just floods the intracellular space. So this enrichment at the cell edges is nothing that is specific to expenses at all. And actually, there's a meta. At all. And actually, there's a neat hypothesis, I think, that has been put forward of why you see this enrichment of proteins at cell edges, which was put forward by the Wostene's lab again, which suggests that the interplay between the turgo within a cell and the geometry of a particular cell may drive sorting of proteins to this edge domain through geometric sorting principle. Now, it may not be specific, but I still think that the sorting principle could actually be really meaningful. Principle could actually be really meaningful in the context of growth control. So, the idea here is that if you have a system that sorts everything to the cell edges, regardless of where you secrete it, you actually solve a big problem, in my view, that the plant cell has. If you have discretely organized hotspots that control growth, you need to somehow get your proteins that affect those hotspots in the correct ratios to the correct spot. So, then you need to somehow know where the spot is. Well, if you set up your hotspot, Well, if you set up your hotspots at the geometric edges of cells and expand sense reach that domain for geometric reasons, you're simplifying the problem of spatial targeting to a secretion rate problem. So now you can just secrete the appropriate quantity of expansion and the sorting would happen passively. Now, this also means that the edges are the sites of growth control and not the faces, which I think is intriguing because it would allow more precise coordination between neighbors. More precise coordination between neighboring cells, especially at the organ surface, where this pathway, this edge-directed trafficking pathway, is particularly active. So, I think there are some conceptual advantages for a cell of setting up growth control in this way. And what we're currently trying to do is trying to understand whether this is really the case or whether it's just an attractive idea. But at this stage, I would really like to hear what you think about it and whether you have some ideas of how to test this. We have a whole battery of experiments set up. Have a whole battery of experiments set up, but I'm sure you have some good ideas as well. And maybe you can tell me also why this idea doesn't work at all. So, with that, I'd like to thank you and everybody in the team who did the work, especially Xin Yu Zhang, who is going to finish in my lab in December and who will be looking for another postdoc. So, if any of you are interested in recruiting somebody really motivated, shoot me a message. Thank you. Very nice. Very nice. We have time for questions. I have in the Zuma here. Miltos? Hi, Charlotte. Thank you. That looks really interesting. Can you hear me? Yes, I can. I had a question on the detail of the genetics a bit. So when you cross the cellulose-related mutants to yours, and then you interpret the interaction as additive, I mean, that cellulose mutant you have. That cell of mutant you have is particularly, it is presumably a mutant that partially describes, you know, one specific component. So we did this experiment in three different ways. You're absolutely right. These mutants always have a problem, right? So we used three different approaches. We used the procrused mutant, we used, which is a mutant in a cellular synthase complex, we used isoxabin, which is a cellulosynthase inhibitor. Which is a cellulose synthase inhibitor, which has the advantage that you can do a treatment in exactly the sibling plants. And we also use radius welling mutant, which is another CESA mutant, which is temperature sensitive. And I only showed you one set of experiments because it's represented. Repeat this. We get the same result from all of these different approaches, the drugs. So what happens if you cross the two cellulose-related mutants together? Does the phenotype look very different? Does the phenotype look very different to the WU group? We have not done that. We haven't done that. That's a good question. I mean, you can titrate the severity of the phenotype. So, you know, that's for us the advantage of working with the drug treatment, that you can sort of titrate it and you can get a more severe or less severe phenotype. And for the concentrations that we have tried, what we saw is that if we go to What we saw is that if we go to a very high level of cellulose inhibition, so if we do a very high drug treatment, cells die because they burst at an early point, and then you don't see this synergistic effect. So this additive basically because at some point all the cells are dead. So you need to know where the cells don't burst. But if you do, then it's this additive level. To be confident that it's a different path, it would be nice to know that the phenotype. To know that the phenotype you get is not one you get when you cross two different cellular-related mutants. That's a good point, Bishop. Or do the treatment with a drug in a cellulose mutant background? Right, yeah, yeah. Thank you. Enrico? So, Charlotte, thanks for that very nice talk. You mentioned that. You mentioned that the microtubules are not reoriented in the way you expected in your mutant, but that was on the outer face. Did you check the anticlinal walls? And because obviously they're going to be very important for the growth as well, to check whether the microtubules, what's happening on those walls? We didn't check the anticlinal walls, although we could. We checked the inner periclinal interface. So yeah. So, yeah, we have a higher degree of organization in the wild type already, but it still gets enhanced the anisotropy. So, we haven't checked it for the anticlinal walls, but I expect it may be a similar effect. We can easily do that because what we did was we did a 3D segmentation of cells and we projected microtubules all around. So, I think that would be really good to do that because I think that's going to. Because I think that's gonna affect a lot. The radial expansion of your route is gonna depend on the anticlinal walls. And I think if you can quantify that, that would be great. That's a good point. Although I should say that when we look at cross-sections, the majority of the problem seems to come from bulging of the outer face. So it's a bit difficult to quantify it because there's also burst at some point and so on. But what we see is a real bulging of the outer face. Of the outer phase, a massive increase of the anticlinal wall in the mutant. Yeah, good point. Thank you. More questions? So that was actually perfect timing. So thank you again for the lovely talk. So the next speaker, Angela, hey, if you could. Okay, sorry, I was thinking it was Annalise, but this. Thinking it was Annalise, but that's fine. Oh, it is Annalise. Sorry, sorry, I'm so sorry. It is Annalise. Sorry, sorry, sorry to both of you. Okay, sorry. So, Annalise, yeah, you could share your screen and we can. So I just
