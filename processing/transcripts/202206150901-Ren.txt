I didn't see many familiar faces on the video. So, my warmest greeting to all of you. And now, please let me share my screen which use another user. So, yes. All right. So, my talk is on the median grounds of group theory, which is the main topic of this conference. Of course, the arithmetic aspects and the Diophantine approximation, Diophantine geometry, and also some algebraic geometry. So, please feel free to stop me if you have any questions. All right, so the group theory. So, the group theory main subject today I'm going to talk about is so-called bounded generation. So, let's go to the definition directly. So, we say that an abstract algebraic abstract group gamma has the property of bounded generation. So, we use a BG for short. For short, if there exists fixed finite many elements, gamma one to gamma d which are not necessarily distinct, such that this gamma can be written down as the product of the cyclic subgroups generated by these elements. And this definition, obviously, has its profinite counterpart, so, which means So, which means if you introduce a topology on these groups, you can do the following thing. Say delta is a profinite group. We say that it has a profinite boundary generation. We use a VG pro to denote that if there exists the same condition, the gamma one to gamma d in delta, not necessarily distinct, such that this delta can be written down. That this delta can be written down as the product of the closure of the cyclic subgroups generated by these elements. And we can see that both BG and BGPRO, they are combinatorial definitions, but I want to emphasize that they have many applications in various aspects in group theory. So let me enumerate. So, let me enumerate some of them to motivate this definition. So, here is the list. So, the boundary generation, well, of course, also bounded pro. So, this relates to the sex congruence subgroup problem. So, the contributors include Platunov, Rapinchuk, and Luboski. Bound generation can also help. Bound generation can also be helpful to compute some Kashdang constants, which you can find in the work of Yahoda Shalong. They can verify certain cases of the Margulis Zimmer conjecture, which is done by Shalong and Willis. This also relates to some rigidity property, which is done by Rocking Chook. And before we go on, let's also mention that. Before we go on, let's also mention that this is a profining version for the propy groups, which is exactly equivalent to the fact that this topological group is a pi-adic analytic. So let's mention two of them. As example, we take the rigidity and also the congruence sub-group problem. So the rigidity So the rigidity we were doing is related to the complex representations called semi-simple rigidity. We say an abstract group gamma is called semi-simple rigid. If for every dimension n, we have only up to equivalence class, we have only finite many completely reducible representations. And an alternative description is that. Description is that you can define the so-called character variety, chi n of gamma, and finitely many equivalence class means this dimension of this character variety is zero. And of course, typical examples of such semi-simple rigid groups are higher rank lattices of Lie groups and relate to the Margulis rigidity. Rigidity. So, this interesting rigidity phenomena, in fact, can be checked via bounded generation. In work of Robin Chuk in 1990, so he showed that suppose this group has bounded generation. So, let's recall that this is the product of finite many secret subgroups. And it satisfies the following condition. Let's call this FF, which is the finite abelianization, which means that for any which means that for any finite index group gamma one of this gamma its abidinization is a finite group so if bg and f both holds then this gamma has this semi-simple rigidity property so let me give two remarks first uh obviously this f app is a necessary condition for widget because uh in this Because if this F F fails, then that means for some subgroup gamma one, this abelianization is infinite. Then you can map this thing to Z, so which is not rigid. So the ambient group is not rigid either. So this is necessary. Another remark is that we can replace this one by the weaker, which means if you take it. you take the pro so so that means uh if the profinite closure uh profinite uh completion of this uh gamma has vg pro and they satisfy fm then this gamma is also rigid so that's rigidity another one is the celebrity the congruence subgroup problem so let's recall that in the case of sl2 this question can be a data This question can be a date back to the late 19th century, and the question has been considered by Felix Klein, etc. So we consider the following distinguished class of subgroups in SL2Z, which is congruent to the identity matrix module M, where M is a natural number. Such group is called a principal congruence subgroup, and any subgroup contains Group contains a certain principal congruence subgroup is called a congruence subgroup. And obviously, such congruent subgroups are a finite index. The congruence subgroup problem considers whether the converse is true. That means if you take a finite index subgroup of this guy and you wonder if this one is a congruence subgroup, that means whether this contains some principle. Some principal congruence subgroups for a certain level. And Klein himself already finds that the answer is no. And in fact, it turns out that there are so many counterexamples. One simple example is you can take, there exists a finite, let's say, there exists a surjective group homomorphism from SL to Z to A6, which is the alternating groups of six. Groups of six items. Then for a certain such phi, the kernel of this gamma prime is a finite index subgroup of SL2Z, which is not a congruent subgroup. Well, let me mention that SL2Z is sort of special because if you consider the integral point of the special linear groups of N, which is at least 3, then the answer is always yes. Yes, so which is done by Das MÃ¼ller Ser. Okay, but anyway, of course, we can formulate abstract general case, which can be first finded in the paper of Seth. So the setting is the following. We take a linear algebraic group G embed in some GLN, which is defined over a number field K, and we take S. And we take S to be a finite set of primes which contain all the Archimedean ones. And the arithmetic groups we are containing, so which is the intersection of the rational points and intersect with the OS point in the ambient GLN. So to define a principal congruence some group, you take any non-zero interval idea. Non-zero integral ideal of this ring of S integers. And then this principal congruence subgroups is indeed the one if you take the reduction module A, which is congruent to the identity matrix. Well, of course, similar question is, if you have a finite index subgroup of the ambience arithmetic group, then is it always Arithmetic group, then is it always true that it contains some principal congruence of rules? And of course, we know that in the case of SL2Z, the answer is no. For SLNZ and at least the three, the answer is yes. But in general, this question seems too coarse because sometimes we want to see when the answer is no, what's the deviation from yes. What's the deviation from yes? So we define something which measures how much this property fails. So we should start by sell, which is defined as follows. We consider two types of completions of this arithmetic group gamma. The first completion is the usual completion, to find a completion. You take the projective limits for the quotients over all the normal subgroups. Normal subgroups of finite index. We take this one as a gamma hat. Another completion is called the congruence completion. We don't take so many n, we only take the principal congruence subgroups. And then there is a natural group homomorphism from the first one to the second. And the kernel depends on the ambience linear. On the ambient linear algebra group and the choice of places is called the Congress kernel. And eventually, our goal is to study, you know, is to study this Congress kernel. Of course, we want to see if this question has a positive answer. That means whether this group is trivial. And then we also want to see if this is not far from trivial. That means if this group is finite. Is finite. In the 1980s, Lubovsky and independently Platono of Ravinchuk has given the following very interesting description. So we take the ambient linear algebraic group to be almost simple and simply connected. And there is one condition. Suppose S does not contain any finite planes, such as G as Kb and its tropic. And there is a technical condition which G over is a technical condition which g over k satisfies the markuri's platoon of conjecture which is uh verified in most cases and then the uh the uh the assertion is that uh in effect this uh finiteness of congruence kernel is equivalent uh to the fact that this gamma hat this uh this gamma hat it has a bg probe and in particular if gamma has the discrete boundary generation Is crease bounded generation, then we have this congruence kernel is finite. So I must remark that this theorem has been a long time to give people a motivation to use the bounded generation to establish certain cases of the finiteness of the Congress kernel, in particular the anisotropic case. So, which is also one of the motivations of our work. Of our work, okay. So, of course, the cluster constants and also Mark Group's Zimmer conjecture are also very interesting due to the time. So let's skip this. Now, we are already convinced that it's worth studying this bounded generation. So, now let's give an overview about which groups have bound generation. About which groups have bound generation. So, here is some rather simple observations. First, boundary generation, let's recall that this is a fact that this guy equals to the finite product of cyclic subgroups, fixed cyclic subgroups. So that means the boundary generation is finitely generated, but the converse is wrong. Of course, there is one condition to make the converse correct. Correct is abelian. That means the final groups finally generated plus abelian obviously implies bounded generation. And what's next? We then started from abelian to those groups which are in some sense not far from being abelian. So we can see, let's recall the following inclusion relation. Abelian is a subset, a subclass of new potent groups. Subclass of neopotent groups, and it's a subclass of polycyclic groups, and also a subclass of solvable groups. That's because you take the finite many derived groups, and you get trivial groups. But abedian means that you take the derived group once, you get the trivial groups. So that means abelian, you know, it's a special case of solvo. And you can verify that finally generated plus new potent implies bound generation. Potent implies bound generation, finite generation plus polycyclic implies boundary generation. But let's emphasize that the final generation plus the solvable does not imply spound generation. Here is an example. You take the reign of the Law Home polynomials over integers, and you consider x is indeterminate. And this group, you can verify that this is a solvable and finally generated, but this gamma has no bounded generation. But this gamma has no bound generation. And this relates to some properties of the lamp lighter groups. But there is one distinguished case, which is if something is inside G L and Z, then by a result of MASCEF, such solvable groups must be polycyclic. So that means if everything is inside GL and Z, then final generation plus solvable is. Sawable is bound generated. So, this page are some simple observations, and now let's observe something which is beyond so and beyond the trivial. So, in this case, the arithmetic groups come to our attention. All right, so more examples. Of course, we want to see. more examples of course we want to see uh what's the case of slnz and slnos where os is a certain ring of uh s integers so let's mention that uh the counterpart uh of uh you know of the manipulation for over a field is uh is an interesting exercise in linear algebra related to the Gaussian elimination. Gaussian elimination. So, by the first year linear algebra, we know that any for any field, a matrix in SLNF can be written down as a product of finite many things like this, where each one is either a permutation matrix like this, or the row multiply. So, we want to keep the determinant equal to. We want to keep the determinant equal to one, so let's multiply the lambda inverse as well. And the third one I denote by Eij alpha, which means you add the alpha multiplicity of the jth row to the ith row. And you can observe that if you want to get this identity matrix, this one appears at most n minus one times. The second type also appears at most n minus one times. Most n minus one times, the third one up here at most n times n minus one times. But my claim is that the first one and the second one can be reduced to the third one. So it's a simple exercise in linear algebra. It's just the matrix operation. That's the second type. It's the product of a six matrix of the third type. And the second type, which is the product of the three matrix of the third type. And as a consequence, every matrix in the matrix. Every matrix in S sorry, S L N F is a product of at most N squared plus 8N Eij alpha. Eij alpha is something like this. So of course we wonder, so over a number ring, whether the condition is true as well. In this case, we don't have the very convenient Gaussian elimination. Still, Carter and Keller, in 1983, they have given a positive answer. The positive answer if n is at least the three. So, if you consider the ring of integers O of k, then we know that every matrix can be written down as this number of elementary matrix E R E I J R from. So, where this delta is the number of prime divisors of the discriminant of this number field, which is an integer. Well, so surprisingly, the counterpart of this question. The counterpart of this question where n is equal to 2 has been only solved recently. So, okay, but anyway, so let's mention that in Carter-Keller's theorem, the consequence is that SLMOKN, at least three, has bound the generation, and all the matrix up here are unipotent. That's important. So now the result by Morgan, Roping, Truk, and Suri deals with. So, suppose you take a number ring, such as it has infinite units. So, that means the only exception is a Q and the field of imaginary quadratics. So, except for this, by the decay flex unit theorem, this is always infinite. Then, our claim is that everything here is a product of at most nine elementaries. The nine elementaries. And as a consequence, SL2O in this situation has bound the generation. And you can show that in this case, unipotent elements definitely appear. Let me mention that unipotent appear is also a main motivation of our work. I want to introduce. Okay, so let me mention that. So this one is indeed everything because if this one is Because if this one is finite, then it doesn't have boundar generation. Why is that? For example, if this is the, if we consider S L to Z, then we have a free subgroup of two generators, which is generated by these two things and has indexed 12 in the ambient group. Since this finite index of group has no boundary generation, of course, free group doesn't have boundary generation. Of course, the free group doesn't have bound generation, so neither does the ambient group. If you take the ring of integers of the quadratic imaginary number field, then by result of Brunwald and Schmirmer, so which shows that it virtually has a non-abelian free portion. So again, this one has no boundary generation. Well, so how about other classical groups? Tefgan, general. Tefgan generalized the work of Carter and Keller has established the Chevalier groups, has bound the generation if the rank is at least two, and he also established bounded generation for many positive straight groups. Well, in particular, the Chevalier groups case confirmed that the symplectic groups over a number ring always have boundary generation. And for some orthogonal groups, this has. Groups. This has been established by Erovanko and Rapinchuk, and also some unitary groups by Harold. Okay, so now let's raise our main question. So all the examples we found, so you know, there are something we can summarize. So the thing is that any topic seems always absent, and we want to see what's happening, you know, if we can. See what's happening, you know, if we consider the arithmetic groups of anisotropic groups. So here's the question. So, our question is: for an infinite S arithmetic groups of anisotropic algebraic group over a number field, can bound the generation possibly true? Let's recall that in this case, an algebraic group is called anisotropic if it doesn't contain non-trivial split. A non-trivial split powers. So, why we consider the question? The first one is all the non-trivial examples we know are, you know, involved are isotropic algebraic groups. Second, so as we have already mentioned, that value generation has very useful applications in congruence subgroup problems and also rigidity, but in both Rigidity, but in both cases, the unipotent elements are usually very helpful. Of course, we want to see what happens if we don't have unipotent. The third one is the most intuitive one. And in fact, let me emphasize, although very simple and intuitive, this is extremely helpful for our further work. Say, you consider this a very simple, important matrix. This guy has a linear growth. And if you take the Growth. And if you take the semi-simple matrix, and this guy has exponential growth, of course, exponential growth is much faster than linear. And the intuition is that the semi-simple elements are rather sparse and which are unlikely to generate the ambient group. So here comes our main results. So, which is joint work with Pietro Krovaya, Andre Rapinchuk, and Umberto Zanier. Here. So, our result is more general because via specialization arguments, you can take some linear groups over any field of characteristic zero, but the main difficulty is over a number field. So, we say that for a gamma, so which is a linear group, suppose this one has bound generation by semi-simple elements. That means all the Elements that means all the participating matrix are semi-simple, then this gamma is virtually solvable, which means gamma contains a finite index subgroup, which is solvable. All right, so further, so if we assume that this gamma already contains only semi-simple elements, then we have an even stronger condition, which is equivalent. Condition, which is equivalence relation, which says gamma has boundary generation if and only if it is finitely generated and virtually abelian means contains a finite index subgroup, which is abelian. And as the application of arithmetic groups, we get the following useful collar rate, which means, which tests the answer of this question in the previous page. Question in the previous page is negative. Let's repeat. If you consider a simple anisotropic linear algebraic group over a number field, and you consider the S-arith medicine group, which is infinite, then this group definitely has no bounded generation. So this one, the significance of this one is that you can never expect bounded generation to produce. To produce rigidity or the congruence or subgroup problem cases, so we have to find other ways, which I will mention in the end of the talk. Let me mention that this one is not the optimal. So this one can be even strengthened. So recently, in joint work with the same authors plus DeMail, we show that the quantitative results. So if you consider the boundaries. Result. So, if you consider the boundary generation over a number field, and if you consider a boundary generation set where all the matrices are semi-simple, and so which has heights at most t, then the growth is some log growth. And by this one, and also intuitively, we know that the unipotent elements has polynomial growth. So, we obtain that, well, we should. So we obtain that, well, which is not trivial, but roughly speaking, it's this spirit. We get that boundary generation by semi-simples implies that this gamma contains only semi-simple elements. So that we can combine these two, this main theorem and a collaborate, which says that our theorem this year is bound generation by semi-simples is exactly the same as finite generation. As finite generation, and the neutral component of the zero-closure is torus, in particular, which means the final generation plus a virtually obedient. But today, I will focus mainly on this one, which means bound generation by semi-simple implies virtually solvable. All right. So now I will explain the idea behind this. I will basically enumerate all. I will basically enumerate all the geophantine ingredients so that you are convinced that this one is true. So basically, we want to show that suppose there is some such found generation and we consider, we compare the eigenvalues and use the due and this eigenvalues give us some dual function equations. And this one we contradict with something which relates to the theory of generic elements. Let's see how. Generic elements. Let's see how. Okay, so this page is definitely the easiest page in this talk. So the key observation, of course, it's so simple, which says that for any two matrices, if they are equal, then they must have the same set of eigenvalues. Of course, you might wonder: hey, is that something too trivial? My answer is, of course, it's very trivial. Answer is: of course, it's very trivial, but this is already sufficient for our applications. So, in practice, this M1 and M2, we want to see whether they are equal or not. They are given by very different expressions. So, now we want to see whether M1 and M2 are equal. Then, we want to compare the eigenvalues of M1 and M2, which gives us some Gio-Fantine equations. All right. All right, so here is the main thing. So we want we can get the contradiction. So it's one in one. Okay, so for let's recall the multiplicatively independent, which means that, you know, so basically, which is the exponential analog of the linear intended. Analog of the linear independence. But let's say we consider the inhomogeneous one. So we consider some abelian group, which eventually is the unit groups of some number field. And we say that this one is multi-predictive independent from this given element. If we have this multi-predictive dependence relation, then it must be trivial. Trivial. And now, so suppose we have such bounded generation by semi-simple elements. Then first ingredient is that by using the Diofantine geometry, so you can establish, so which is the, I'm going to quote the subspace theorem, which will give us some multi-pollutive dependence of some I. Dependence of some eigenvalue relation. On the other hand, by the theory of generic elements, which is developed by a series paper of Gaupo-Prassat and Henri Arbinchuk, and also similar things by other mathematicians, which gets the opposite, which says you can always find such eigenvalues which doesn't satisfy this multi-predictive dependence relation. So we get a contradiction. So for general elements, this one. So, for general elements, this one is not a difficult part. The non-trivial part is the dual function geometry part. Let's see how to get this multiplicative dependence relation here. So, okay. Okay, so now we are going to mention the Diophantine geometry or the Diophantine approximation we are going to use. So, the Qi theorem is the Lohans result. But before I introduce But before I introduce this result, let me mention the spirit or the motivation of this result. So, oh, so it's been several thousand years. So, people are interested in the question is give an equation from our daily life, then we want to find the solutions. But, of course, you can sort of converse this process. So, which is the new aspect, which means The new aspects, which means if you know some properties of the solutions, can we determine some properties of the equations? So, this is exactly this theorem of Lohan. So, let's carefully state this theorem. And in the next page, I'm going to give some examples. So, this theorem says that if you consider a sub-variety in the GMN, so which is the n copy of the GM. So, which is the n-copy of the Q-bar plus. And suppose this V has a Zariski dense set of special points. So here, special point means that all the components is S unit. So that means we have the defining equations has many solutions which are very special, which is the we want to determine this equation. Determine this equation. Then our claim is that these equations are all, you know, some monomials equals to some constant. So which eta is some s unit? Well, as a more geometric language, we know that if this v contains a Zariski dense set of a special point like this, then this V must be a translate of an algebraic group by a point. By a point such as all the components are S unit. So let me give you maybe 10 seconds to look at this theorem again. All right, so the proof is very complicated, but I can tell you that it uses the subspace theorem by Shrikaway. subspace theorem by Shrickoway and Schmidt, which is a far-reaching generalization of the fuse metal work of Rolf in 1958, which considers the approximation of irrational numbers by rational numbers. Okay, so this one looks very abstract, right? But we do have some elementary examples. So let's give the following particular case of the A particular case of the Lohans theorem. So these numbers are chosen very carefully. So I'm from IAS, which is founded in 1930. My advisor, Professor Robin Chuk, was from University of Virginia, which was founded in 1819 by Jefferson. And our institute, BIRS, was founded in 2003. So we consider this. Consider this exponential equation, and we want to find the integer solutions of this one. And my claim is that this guy has only finitely many solutions. Why is that? So, well, well, I mean, of course, you want to consider this S, that means you want to choose a number field and a set of the primes localize this. So we consider Q. So we consider Q and 1930 is 2 times 5 times 193. 1819 is 17 times 107. And 2003 is a prime number. So you only need to localize these things. So we know that the ring, so the group of S units is just the plus, minus, and some powers of these primes we localized. And now you just divide 2003 to the k. The 2003 to the k on both sides of this equation, and you get this one. So, this one becomes as s unit, and this one becomes s unit, and the right-hand side equals to one. So, now you consider the sub-variety, which is the zero locus of x1 plus x2 equals to one. And it's easy to show that this one is not a coset. So, if this one is not a coset, then it doesn't have a Zariski dense. Then it doesn't have a Zariski dense, but in the case of a curve, which is finitely many such special points, so we get this result, which is lovely. And for the sub-space theorem, the main tool to prove Lohan's theorem, which is very technical, but please allow me give a special case of the sub-space theorem. Again, we take these lovely three numbers, 1930, 1819, and 2003. So we claim that. So, we claim that if you consider the simultaneous Diofungi approximation by a common denominator and with a good, you know, with very small error terms, then it turns out that there are only finite many such solutions. Okay, that's all. So, now we are in a good position to prove our main theorem. So, let's recall that again, our main theorem is bounded. Is bounded generation by semi-simple elements implies virtually solvable. So, again, let's recall that semi-simple means that it is diagonalizable over some finite field extension. So, now let's see. So, basically, if you have such relation, we just diagonal and suppose this gap. And suppose this gamma has bound the generation by semi-simples, and you take some other semi-simple elements as well, and you diagonalize every gamma i and also diagonalize this gamma. And we know that this ambient group has this relation. So that means the gamma to the m you know is inside this product of cyclic groups. So that means that we have this relation of matrices. But we have already done. But we have already diagonalized everything, right? We have already diagonalized everything. So that means you can just substitute everything to get this relation. And we call the first eigenvalue of this gamma to be lambda. So now we just trace. And now let's just go back to our simple observation, which means the same matrix equals to, means they have the same set of eigenvalues. Have the same set of eigenvalues. Okay. So then we just trace this lambda to the m. Of course, this can be written as some manipulations of the powers of the eigenvalues of this gamma i. So we just obtained that lambda to the i m is some polynomials of the powers of this guy. Of this guy. And the next page is technical, but sort of a routine. But I want to emphasize that eventually we can show that by the Lohan's theorem. So we call that Lawhorn's theorem is something which is equation is given by a monomial. So eventually we can show that this P is in fact a monomial. So that means the lambda and these eigenvalues are multi-predictively. Values are multi-predictively dependent. So we just get this relation. So lambda is dependent. But on the other hand, so by the theory of a generic element, you can always find such gamma such as it has an eigenvalue, which is multiple independent of the given elements. So we get the contradiction, which proves our main result. So, which proves our main result. Okay, so let's recall that our result is a negative result. Negative means that we just close an option to prove the semi-simple rigidity and the congruence of group properties. But this is not the end of our story because for bounded. Story because for boundary generation, of course, it doesn't work, but we can replace boundary generation by some other conditions which can be also used. So next. So let's recall that the C as the congruence kernel. And you can show that this rigidity and also the fineness of the congruence kernel follows from the following weaker condition. So let's recall that. So let's recall that, let's recall that this gamma is the S arithmetic group. And you let the gamma to the n denote the normal subgroup generated by the n powers of this ambient groups. And this PG is the polynomial index growth condition, which says that this index is finite and the index is bounded above by some power of the n. Or you don't need to consider all the n. Or you don't need to consider all the n, but just some fixed m times some power of a prime and with the same inequality. And this also implies the congruence of subgroup properties. So for instance, for S, L, and Z, and at least the three, this one, this PG prime can be verified by purely algebraic computations without refer to any tools of number theory. So we expect that. Expect that from if this LGB group is anisotropic, sort of we can establish this weaker condition so that we can get some examples of a convergence of subgroup property. Another aspect is, okay, so okay, so let's formulate this question because eventually, okay, so. Okay, so basically for this S, suppose this S rank, which is the sum of all the Kv ranks, V in S, suppose this one is at least two, then we hope to verify that this gamma has the weaker polynomial index growth condition. Okay, that's the first. Okay, second, second, so So we consider the related question of the unautomated product. So because this one has infinite unit groups, we know that this guy has done the generation. And it's an easy exercise to show that this one is an amalgamated product of two copies of SL2Z amalgamated as the congruence of some group gamma zero. The congruence of group gamma 0p. But if you consider the anisotropic analog, so this R is a Z localized at two primes, and this H is the usual Hamilton quaternary algebra. Then this corresponding arithmetic groups has no boundary generation. This one is a very interesting phenomenon because these two groups they share many Group theoretic properties. So, for example, they both have very similar representations of another meter products, which are both virtually free groups. And also both have a non-central normal subgroups of infinite index. And also, they are both rigid. So, in the previous sense, but one has done the generation, another one has not. Has bound the generation, another one has not. We want to find a deep reason behind this phenomena. So, we formulate this question: we want to give a verifiable condition when amalgamated products have bound generation or the weaker polynomial index group. So, finally, let me give a more general question. So, basically, all the examples we have find groups, abstract groups based on the generation, are more or less. Bounded generation are more or less in this way or another involves the S arithmetic groups. So, we want to know that bounded generation is it always true that S arithmetic groups appear in an essential way? So this is all of my talk. So last, I want to share my, give my deepest appreciation to my advisor, Andre. So it's my great, it's so fortunate for me to work. It's so fortunate for me to work with him. And happy birthday to Enri, and my best wishes to you. Thank you very much for your attention. My thoughts to the speaker from the audience, from virtual audience, comments. Well, if this is not the case, let's thank the speaker again. Thank you. My pleasure, thank you. And we have a break of break. So open breaks start technically and the next talk will start at half past ten.
