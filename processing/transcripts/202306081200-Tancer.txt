So next talk here is Martin Dansen to talk about with saturation of multiple hyperbrams. Thank you. So first of all, I would like to thank the organizers for organizing this very nice event and also for inviting me. And the topic that I am going to talk about is going to be like mostly combinatorial topic, but I will also try to provide some links to topology and geometry, like that it will be at some point there. And so what I am going to talk about is the weak saturation. So I should perhaps explain first what is this weak saturation. First, what is this weak saturation? So, let me put it as a definition. And we have some FgH, which are graphs, or they are possibly also some uniform hypergraphs and Mostly I will try to explain the everything for graphs, but the results they also hold for hypergraphs. So that's like my strategy. And we say that G is weakly H saturated. In F, if the edges, if okay, so what we need is like that the G is a subgraph of F and the edges of the difference, so of F minus G, can be ordered. Say, say E1 up to some EK so that like if we look at the graph G union E1 up to some EI, then it contains copy of G. Copy of G sorry of H copy of H which contains EI. So this definition definitely deserves an example. So let me and I hope that that example will make everything clear. So if I take So if I take h equal to the graph K3 and F will be the graph Kn. So then, for example, I can take G to be a star, like me, like if I have here, but this is one, two, three, and so. Two, three, and so on up to n. So I'm claiming that this G is now weakly edge saturated. And here, actually, like I can take arbitrary sequence of the edges, I can really take them in arbitrary order. Say this is E1, and at every moment, the point is that I am creating a new tribe. That I am creating a new triangle, which is like the new copy of this edge. So, if I go for the next one, next edge in again, like E2, then again, I am creating a new triangle using this edge and so on. Like another example of what could be weakly saturated is a path. Here, the order matters because not at if I if I were adding this edge, then I would not create a triangle. But for example, if I go in this direction and then I continue with other vertices, then like this is if this is one, two, three, and so on, then I will be also creating a new triangle at every step. So, this is, I hope, an example that makes it clear, and what we will be interested in is like the minimal number of edges of G we can get. So at this moment, we would have n minus one edges. So, let me say it in generally, like weak saturation number. So number of H in F is the minimal number of edges of G and which is weakly saturated weekly. Saturated weakly saturated in H. So let us a little bit continue with this example. So let us let us determine this weak saturation number. And if I need, I will denote it like this V sat of This VSAT of F and H. So I would be interested in these weak saturation of K3 in Kn so here I provide you examples that it's possible to and I claim that this is going to be n minus one. So here I provide you an example or two examples how Or two examples how I can reach this n minus one and let me also show you that that this is like like uh I can I can do with with less edges and I think that that if you think about it it's it's actually quite trivial like like if I have less than uh less than n minus one edges then my my g is definitely My G is definitely disconnected. And like for the first moment, when I would be adding an edge in two different components, this can't be in a triangle. So this is a simple proof. Let me give more complicated proof, but which will be actually later on important for generalizations. generalizations and this will be the last troupe of this talk and then then then everything else like will be some some some some some more background and and maybe some sketches so uh so so so different proof is is the following uh so let me assume that i have this sequence uh which provides the weak saturation Provides the weak saturations also. So, like, I have E1 up to Ek, which is sometimes called saturating sequence. And let me also set up GI to be simply G union E1 up to EI. And also, like, like with convention that G0 is simply G. G0 is simply G. And what do I do? It's like that: that I will look at the dimension of the cycle space of Gi, say, plus one. And what I claim is that this is strictly greater than the dimension of the cycle space of Gi. And the reason is that exactly like That exactly like that because I have a triangle using the new edge. And let me also like I can also phrase it in a way that here the reason for this inequality is like that this H belongs to the, like, or this new copy of H belongs to the kernel of the boundary operator. And this will. And this will become important at some point. And so here, now the point is like that: I can compute the dimension of the final step, Z1 of GK. This can be computed as n minus 1 choose 2. I will not be giving here some like. Be giving here some like exactly how to compute, but it's not very difficult. And like because of this inequality, I am always increasing the dimension at least by one. So I deduce that actually k is less or equal than this n minus one choose two. And this means that the number of edges of g of the original graph is. Original graph is at least like the total number of edges and choose two minus this k, which is n minus one, choose two, which is n minus one. So this is this is more complicated proof, but what I want to like like keep here is like that's what I was using that the H is in the kernel of the. H is in the kernel of the boundary operator that I will return to this later on. So I think I need to make more space and now I am. And now I am going to talk about multipartite setting. And so at this moment, we will be interested, say, in weak circulation of complete multipartite. Graphs one in each other. So, so let me let me write here, like like, like, say, say, I have saturation of with some parts of size, this R1 up to Rd, and I am saturating it in a larger multipartite graph. And I can also like add here Q, which will mean that the result will be for uniform hypergraphs, but but. uniform hypergraphs, but but this is not like like like like I will be giving examples with graphs, as I said. And we have two possible settings here one of them is so-called undirected. And this corresponds that copy of KQ R1 R D may appear anywhere anywhere and And there is one more setting which is called direct. And here, if I am taking like this copy, like that then adding a new edge, then I require that this respects the parts. So, so I will again. So, so I will again try to make an example. So, maybe let me make it here. So, if I am, for example, interested in weak saturation of K322 in some Kn1, N2, N3. Those two I don't want to specify. Then, ah, sorry, let me let me. Sorry, let me make it easier for this case and just go for bipartite graphs. So if I am thinking here of here having this K1, like here, this is N1, this is N2. So when I have when I am adding a new edge, so in the directed setting, I am. directed setting I am only allowed to use a hypergraph that that or graph that that has three points in the left part and two points in the right part this this this this would be directed in the undirected setting I would be also allowed to to have my witness of this form Uh of this form it's also so so uh also this is also allowed or undirect those two settings actually agree if all parts have the same size but I will from now on I will be mostly focusing on this on this direction. Focusing on this directed setting. So now I want to mention some results and I think I should have So let me also mention something about the previous work. So if I go back to setting of the complete or the example that Of the complete or the example that I was giving with the complete graph, then Callai and Franco around 82, they proved that the weak saturation of a complete Q-uniform hypergraph in a larger complete uniform hypergraph. This is R, this is N, then. is n then this is this is equal n choose q minus n minus r plus q choose q it's very easy to to construct a lower bound example but uh sorry the upper bound example but getting the lower bound is actually difficult and it was a conjecture for a while but but But this is something that has been obtained like a long time ago. And also there is a result of alonely, I think that now I think that it's around 85 in this in the directed setting. He he determined this and just to just to distinguish it, like in this directed setting, I will write a w of something instead of this visa. So, so, so, so, so. So, he determined it in the case that I have. I have n1 up to Nd, but this I have the uniform hypergraph. So these two numbers are the same. Like so, so this is the restriction. So R1 to R D and what is what is our desk What is our uniformity of the hypergraph and the number of parts? So, for example, for graphs, this gives a result for bipartite graphs, but not for multipartite graphs. I will state it immediately, a little bit more generally. So let me so what's what's our contribution is to to to uh to get this this directed set multipartite setting directed one like like completely to solve. And we know that this this W of K U Uh u and uh okay now n one up to n d uh you r one up to r d you is and now now the number is like like a little bit crazy, but but let me write it down. This is some overall sub q subsets of the product of Product of n times i, i is in i minus sum over all. And now I am taking subsets of size at most q and I have again a product, and now I have m. So, so, so, so, so, this number is not very nice, but this is. This number is not very nice, but this is what turns out to be the result. But it actually very naturally comes from an upper bound example. So this is n minus r. Yeah, I am and this is this is n. I mean the the I mean, the point was like to show that there is some formula. It's not important what is the formula. So here I would get product of all, right? And now I would be subtracting something. Something and uh I okay, I think that I can fit here. I can just very briefly sketch like like this this upper bound construction. Like for example, if I was interested in K322 in K N1, N2N3. Two and three, then what I can do is like that. I take this this multi-partite hypergraph or sorry, graph. At this moment, I'm talking about graphs, like with parts n1, n2, n3. And like, I would, I would definitely I would definitely put all the edges in like making this multipartite hypergraph here, except of one edge. So this one will not be there, like what I draw in yellow, then it will not be there. I will have no edges here. And among the edges, Among the edges, like coming diagonally, like for example, if I look at the edge connecting this point and one of those points, then like from this point, I would have three edges to three points here, like to three points here, but one of the edges would be missing. And like once one analyzes this example, like that draw the case between two to this picture, you always say that the end which is at the top, and this picture is going to be missing. Yeah, yeah, one it's actually it might be arbitrary edge. I decide that one of the edges of k322 is missing and then And then I'm missing like these are somehow special vertices. All the edges that do not use special vertices are missing. And those that use some special vertex, so here I am using the rule that again, one of the if I take this vertex, then three of the vertices I have an edge, but one is missing. Have nh, but one is missing. Arbitrary one. But you could just choose, say, that ta one, it would be one, right? Yeah, yeah, I can choose. Are you claiming that these examples are unique? Because you're sure. No, no, no, no, no. It's definitely not unique. What I am claiming is like that, that if you take this graph, then you can find a saturating sequence of the edges, and this one will be the first in the sequence. Then this. Then these edges will be like second in arbitrary order, and these edges will be third in arbitrary order. And it's very easy to analyze the example that this is really a saturating sequence. But I am more interested to say something about the lower bound, like when some topological ideas will come in.  So, what will be our target? Our target will be to define some boundary operator that satisfies basically this relation and the dimension code that I provided you in that very simple case will also work in this setting. But this will not be the But this will not be the standard boundary operator, like we will need something a little bit different. And for this, let me follow the approach or the ideas of Kalai from 80s. And they use exterior algebra and And let me just very briefly explain what this exterior algebra is doing. So we will have V some some vector space over the reals with the basis say E V where V corresponds to the okay, let me let me. Okay, let me write it this way, but let me think of this n as vertices of the graph that we are interested in, of the graph F. And to such a vector space, we can define exterior algebra, which will be Here, the basis will be like some say some sets of the form E E S where S is a subset of the first and integers. So, like instead of taking only the vertices, we are taking the vertices we are we are taking arbitrary collections of of the vertices and uh like like uh it's it's given by some some some relations that that is supposed to satisfy like and and it contains also some some um bilinear operator which is uh uh okay like like like which I will denote by which and here are some some relations which are supposed to be satisfied Which are supposed to be satisfied, like that, this the empty set is actually the neutral element. The second one is like that, that actually this ES can be decomposed into individual vertices. It's ES1, ES2, and so on up to ESK if I can write my S as S1 less than S2 and so on up to less than S. And so on up to less than sk, and the third uh relation is certain anti-commutativity. Like if I look only at the vertex, say, okay, let me write it in this way. This is for me the same thing as really like the one with the subset. So EV and EW is the same thing as minus EW. thing as minus ew batch ev so this also so here are some properties this uh this exterior algebra uh behaves nicely with respect to the change of basis if i have uh uh like some some f1 up to f n different basis other basis uh Then I can define again Fs via F S1 up to which of the F S F S K. Again, if I have S of this form, and then this F will also satisfy these properties. And I promised you a boundary operator. So let's try to explain this. Let's try to explain this boundary operator. And this is, there is again some mysterious bilinear operator, which is called left interior product. And uh like like it's uh Like like it's uh it's something like like uh if I take if I take G and F in in my algebra, then I am getting this left interior product denoted this way again in my algebra. And this is defined by relation H of Okay, let me write down, and I think I will not even try to explain. But this is some axiomatic definition that this is operator that is supposed to satisfy this relation for every age. Okay, one, of course, has to show that this exists, but it indeed exists and it satisfies some nice properties. And I want to mention only one of these properties. And only one of these properties that I want to use at some point. If I take left interior product of H, G, and F, like in this form, then this is the same thing as taking H of H G and taking the left interior product on F. So this thing I will use at some point. And now what's my boundary operator? my boundary operator if i uh if i uh identify like uh like like uh my basis uh vector es with the simplex on the on the vertex set s then uh my my my boundary operator of on this simplex or say say Or say, say, on this S, this will, or let me, let me write it, it will correspond to taking left interior product F1 on ES, when F1 is like element of another basis, somehow generic with respect to position 2E. I will comment on this a little bit later. And now. Now, I want to do some examples. I am not proving anything, but but I'm I want to s stay like like like how say like like like how this exterior product behaves like if you take f1 e s then this really behaves as a standard boundary operator if i have my simplex here s like like say say a triangle then then like like like like this this boundary or or or or this exterior product it in in some sense it will assign it really the boundary of the triangle. assign it really the boundary of the triangle. Like the true is like that I need to express this in E of sets of one last element and here I will have non-zero coefficients. What's more interesting is like if you combine two of them with from with taking those from a basis like like like in some In some like more general position. So then one is what one is getting is actually a skeleton of two dimensionless. And this is general. If I take several of them, like if I had here a tetrahedron, then taking two of them, I would again get a skeleton. Again, get a skeleton taking three of them, I would get individual points and so on. And now, this is like, if you, if this is like a sufficient tools for color saturation. Because, how do you find that something is like H is in a is like like H is in a kernel. So of our say boundary operator like like you can this is definitely implied by the fact that that H is boundary of something bigger. And if you uh uh like like and by by these things uh you can actually get those skeleta which are which are essentially like the complete multipartheid graphs as as as boundaries of some things also. So they they are also in some sense cycles, like like or they are in the kernel of the boundary operator. And if if one makes some dimensional count every One makes some dimension count, everything works well and it provides tight result. So, in last three minutes, I will try to sketch what is our contribution. And also, if you try to mimic this result, it's not Alans approach, but you could also get like Alans result with these two. like like like with this with these tools and what's what's our contribution is like that uh what's important in kalaised approach is like that these f's are really like taken in from some general position basis and uh we we somehow change the the this this rule that that our uh basis is not a general position but it uh it's it's a block diagonal general position like like if i if i if i write say say matrix for for f's in in in terms of e's so so i have here zeros and uh uh and these these these smaller matrices are are again in general position and this this uh and this like like this this this decomposition this this respects uh this respects the parts so so so here i always have like like Here, I always have like vertices from one part, from second part, and so on. And if I make this change and say, say, plus mod of computation, then express like my K to you. I kq R1 up to Rd in the kernel, like again, this will be in the kernel of some boundary operator, and again, the dimension count will work. And very last remark that I want to mention is like that this decomposition is coming from our earlier work Bulafk. Bulafka Gudarzi and myself, when we were working on optimal bounds for fractional colorful Halli FRM so So with some bit of exaggeration, like we would not manage to improve this saturation result without working on geometric topic. That's is there any obvious page that has to be broken uh That's the problem about Clifford's algebra. I don't know Clifford's algebra. So so so so then I am sorry just a couple of preparations in the cliff algebra. This technique is for the directed things, right? Or It's for the directed case because here really if I make this decomposition, I am saying which vertex has to go into which part. And for undirected case, we do not know the answer except of the case when they are the same, when all these R's are the same. It's time for us to get a little bit of a message.
