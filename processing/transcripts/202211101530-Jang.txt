When Morris is ready, we'll start the final talk of the conference. So I'm very happy to introduce Jin Wujang, but I'm very sad that this is the last talk of our meeting. It's been so nice, like I said on the first day. I really, really appreciate how much energy and effort it costs to get here. Don't comment on climate change. Well, he put you here too. No, it really means a lot. I mean, it takes a lot to get here. And we're also happy that you were willing to take the time to come out here. And I feel like I personally have had so many nice interactions with the people here. And I hope you have nice interactions with yourselves. And maybe you met a new person in an area that you both enjoy working on. On and so I'm just really happy that you joined us. And so, thank you very much, participants, because of course you can't have a conference without participants. You just sit around with the four of us and talk about how great we organize. But it's the participants interacting with everyone that makes the meeting. So that's all you guys, and I'm so appreciative. It makes me happy. So, on that note, let's enjoy one more talk by Jing Wu Zhang on the temperature distribution. Zhang on the temperature distribution of a body heated by radiation. Thank you very much. Thank you for your introduction and very nice closing comments. It's a pity that the conference is going towards the end. This week has gone by so quickly. I'd like to thank you, the organizers, again, once again, who let this workshop very well. Very well. I hope you had nice interactions between each other and will have interactions between each other. So my name is Jin Lujang. I recently settled down in a nice city in Korea. And this work is joint work with Professor Juan, the last prince, at University Stephen Point. University. Yeah, today I'd like to talk about the genetic equation, kinetic equation, but not for the gases, but actually for the photons. So we sometimes call it a radiative transfer equation. So we have a body of gas and we apply some radiations with some different frequencies. Then what will happen? Then what will happen? So I will have some little bit of introductions to the radiative transfer equation and I would like to introduce some passage from the coupled Boltzmann equation coupled with the radiative transfer equation. And then the third part, uh I would like to say something about the recent result on the solutions to the stationary relative transfer action. Stationary relative transfer equation. And the last thing, very interesting, radiative entropy production, I will talk about it. So, yeah. So, radiation is, I think, everywhere you equal in the environment. So, in the Earth atmosphere, you can see the sunlight comes down and they excite those gas particles. And those excited gas particles. And those excited gas particles become to the ground state and then they emit some radiation again, photons. And you can also observe that in the astrophysical cloud, of course. So I think this is one of the basic transactions between the photons and the gases. So like as about 100 years ago, companies About 100 years ago, Compton did some experiment, like shooting some photons towards the electrons. And he had that frequency, the photon's frequency that I put it as a new here, frequency lows down. And that means the photons actually exchange some energy with the electrons and they excited some electrons. So this kind of scattering, you can also understand. This kind of scattering, you can also understand this as like elastic or inelastic collision with the photon and the gases. And so if the photon has an initial direction before the collision, and if they have different directions and prime after the collision, we call it scattering. And if the frequency is the same, the pre-frequency, the pre-after collisional frequency is the same. After collisional frequency is the same, then we call it elastic scattering, which we also call it Thompson scattering. But other than this, we can also imagine that, as I said, the photons can excite gas particles. You can say the gas particles have some different energy state, like a different quantum, like discrete state or continuous state. Or continuous state, doesn't matter, but if they have different energy state, and then if they can absorb some photon energy, then after the gas absorb the photon, they can also emit and come down to the ground state. These kind of interactions will be happening if we apply some radiations to the body of the gases. Gases. So I think this is one of the generic forms of the kinetic equation for photons. So this I is some distribution function which I call intensity, but you can also put there as the number density of photons. Probabilistic distribution for the density for photons. Because I and Because I and the photon density is proportional. Like if you put the Q as a photon number density, then I is proportional to each photon has an energy ship of H nu, the frequency nu, so the intensity is proportional to H nu times the numbers the photons. times the numbers, the buttons. And this left-hand side is quite usual. Like if you imagine some Boltzmann equations or other types of kinetic equations, if you multiply the speed of light, disease speed of light everywhere, then you see that the left-hand side is just a transport equation. But here the velocity part is Cn. Cn. And N design And N designs on S2 in 3. So that means photon has a directions only, because the size of the photon, the size of the photon's velocity is actually the speed of light. So you can see that the left-hand side is just a transport equation. The right-hand side, you can imagine some like the absorption, emission, and scatter effects. So So if this kind of scattering occurs, then you lose some kind of distribution, density, density distribution by this scattering and obtain some kind of M prime direction. That is gain part and loss part by the scattering. Similarly, you can also have the gain part from the emission and the loss part by The loss part by the entrogy. And usually we consider the Planck distribution for the emission rate. The Planck emission for the platform. That depends on the frequency, but also the local temperature and the Boltzmann constant also. Yeah. So usually in a boundary value problem, we also couple some equations for this temperature T. Usually in the stationary case we assume that the photons flux, total flux of the radiation energy is divergence free. That can be found in, for example, Frankfurt Gors' paper in 1987 who discussed about the 1D stationary model with this coupling of this equation. This coupling of this equation. And another one, the time-dependent model, you have this kind of term which corresponds to the divergence-free flux, but also some continuity time equation. But in the stationary case, we assume that this conservation law is true. Actually, this radiative transfer equation has a long history. Long history about 100 years. After the Compton's experiment or simulations, the Milnet also publishes a paper on this kind of sub-experiment. So they consider some mixtures of gas and radiation in some slate geometry and put some radiation, monochromatic radiation, in one side. And once the system reaches to the equilibrium, then they switch off the radiation. Then, what will happen to the excited particles density? So, N2 here is an excited particle, and N1 is a ground state particle. Then, in order to solve this kind of relative transfer equation, they take some approximations also to change this to a PDE system, and they also take some. System and they also take some mean-free path zero limit to have some diffusion equation as well. This was a typical trial that has been done in the first 20 or 30 years with the radiative translation problem. But after that, this is, I think, a short list of SP questions on the radiative translation. So those are the trials. So those early trials were on the Millet problem. And Gorse also tried the Miller problem with more generality on the frequency dependence on the coefficient. And yeah, later they also studied some time-dependent problem and spatial net problem as well with some restrictions on coefficients. Efficient and I also introduce some Hibard expansion from the radiation Borgman system to the Euler radiation system that I will introduce a little bit here. So this is a typical Volts manipulation, the prototype of the Volts manipulation, 80 or 72 single species when we distribute spectacles. But now we apply the presence of the ready. Occupied the presence of the radiation, then the simplest model that we can assume is like the gas has two energies: ground state and the excited state. The excited state I express as an A bond, the excited state. And that means the photon is being absorbed to be an excited state, and they also emit the photon to be a ground state. And also, they can. And also they can emit two photons by the stimulated emission, the collisions between the excited particle against the photons. So those five are some interactions between those three species particles in the middle. So one is ground state and excited state, gas particle, and then the water. And then the bottom. So you can have some elastic collisions between the usual elastic collisions between brown state and also you have elastic collisions between the exciting and brown state and vice versa. These five options. So if you express F1 as the particular velocity distribution for the ground state and F2 as excited state and I is And I is intensity, then those gain terms by the emission include some stimulated emission and spontaneous emission, whereas the loss term includes the absorption term. And that depends on the amount of the ground state. There are also Boltzmann equations for the ground state and the exciting. Brown state and the excited state. I just put more and more terms in order to include all those interactions between three species. In this case, yeah, the collisions between the one ground state and the extra state can be inelastic. The effect state can be inelastic, right? Or one ground state and the other ground state can speed down one particle and become the excited state. So there can be some loss in the energy. So we should include some inelastic Boltzmann operator also. Inelastic operators can be derived using the weak formulation of the Boltzmann data. And before we take the Hilbert expansion, there are two regimes for those two species of the gas particle. Like LTE and non-LTE. LTE is a local thermodynamic equilibrium, and non-LTE is a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium. So if those ground state and the excitement state, they follow They follow the Maxwellian distribution and the Boltzmann ratio between each other and the Saha distribution between each other. Then we call it LTE. And if anyone is not true, then we call it non-LTE. And this was introduced in the physics textbook. So for LTE case, of course, this is also possible for non-LTE. Of course, this is also possible for non-LTE, but we just have four different equations. You can take Hilbert expansion, Juzer-Hilbert expansion. But the good thing for LTE is that the ground state and the excess state shares the same flow velocity and also the temperature. And their density row also depends on the difference in. On the difference in the energy. So, following the usual Hilbert expansion, like Taylor expansion, and just take the first order term, you can get the system of Euler compressible Euler temperature radiation equations. And in the stationary case, with the other assumption that the full With the other assumption that the fully is in the rest. In other words, u equals 0, then you can get the couplication that I put in the beginning of this talk. So this is one kind of justification in some special cases of gas radiation system. Yes. So the previous slide, what is G? G is a rescue version of things. Is a rescaled version of the intensity PI. Sorry about that. So for, in order to take the Hilbert expansion, I rescale a lot. Boltzmann kernel, NLA Boltzmann kernel, and also. And here I rescale intensity. Another question. So for the stationary solution, one possible two possible simplification is of course considering the scattering only case, such that the gas never absorb or emit any photon. And there is only the scattering, of course, in the system. In other words, we consider some situations of the Lorentz gases. In this case, the education, stationary education of the The equation, stationary equation of the radiator transfer becomes like this. And if you, if we assume some physical assumptions on this kernel like this, then this automatically implies that the conservation law, the temperature equation that I call it. So in this case, the temperature doesn't really matter. So we can we can discuss this uh relative temperature equation uh under the given uh assumption of the temperature. Assumption of temperature, for example. And the other simplification is like, of course, without scattering place. This is the generalization of the original minness problem, stem from a 1926 formulation. Although they there they just considered the sl one D select geometry, but you can actually consider a um three D version in a any bounded domain. In any any boundary point of cases. So yeah. So I will first discuss this one and this one and then later I'll also introduce some full generality that we have both scattering and absorption emission as well. So for the global existence and uniqueness for the upper caves, where there is no absorption or emission, No atrocial emission. This is a theorem that we assume that the local temperature is C1 is given and the coefficient, the absorption coefficient, no, scattering coefficient is in L infinity and we assume some influx boundary condition, influx boundary given function for the influx. function for the influx direction, inflow direction. And we assume that this G is L1, L1 minus 2, the velocity variable, and L infinity at the boundary. Then this system has a solution, unique solution. And this is done by just Banach fixed point theorem. So we can show that If we can change this to a MID formula, if this PDE can be, I mean, this X, if this is 1D, then this is more like ODE. So you can make it integral equation, like mild form if the trajectory is well defined. And you can try to show You can try to show that the map is contraction. We also do the similar thing in this 3D case. But one clever thing that we one idea is that we define this kind of a path trajectory, which we call an optical trajectory. So at each x with the direction n, we trace back. With the direction n, we trace back and define the boundary point y and we define some characteristic trajectory. But this should involve some information about the equation. And here I put alpha nu alpha nu t and in order to make the trajectory well defined, we need t is in c o, which is okay because t is given. which is okay because t is given. And also the the scattering coefficient is also L infinity and well defined. So that we assume everything so that the catch's trajectory is well defined. And then we can see that the derivative of I in terms of this optical path parameter can give you And give you something like this kind of values so that our radiative transfer equation becomes this kind of integral equation. Then you define this as a map of I and then we show that the map is contraction of the proof. And concludes with the mono-fixed point theorem. Um harder theorem. G of XG of your domain? X G of your domain? Yes, yes. Yes. Our domain must be convex. Otherwise, the inflow boundary condition, if the boundary is not convex, then yeah still we can assume some artificial artificial input conditions. Are info conditions of the radiation. But I think we have to trace, in the reality, we have to trace the outpoint intensity that can also re-enter into this boundary. So this is our problem. So one idea is to consider the context all right. Yeah, and the harder case is with absorption and emission, which is the original middleness problem coupled with the conservation, the divergence-free non-local temperature equation. And if this coefficient is still constant, then we can still continue with the one-fixed point element. But with the different characteristic trajectory, that now we don't have this kind of characteristic trajectory, but we define the characteristic trajectory is just equal to n, the derivative of f is equal to n, and n is 0. And using 2 armer, we can write the i as like a dismap. In the constant In the constant case, constant coefficient case, we can still do the fixed point argument. And the regularity on t is not a problem here because we can make some good changes of variables here. So that we can express this as this kind of a convolution type operator. So the regular So the regularity on T is okay. And yeah, so part of this point something like So we still assume the incoming boundary condition with the conservation law and we obtain some and we obtain some L4 unique solution. This is L4 because we show that T to the 4 is in L1. And yeah, if so this is the case when the coefficient is constant, but the for generality general case is like this coefficient is. Cases like this coefficient is depending both on the frequency and the local temperature. We don't know how to do with the local temperature, but I refer to Frankfurse's 1986 paper, CMP paper, where he solves the problem with the temperature dependence also using the Hile Yoshida field, non-linear. Theorem, non-linear Hilarishta theory shows the global eyefulness, but also the regularity, the output regularity that you can need it for the Hillaryostat theory. For the Hillary Stature, you need some regularity and also some you change the problem to a stationary problem, a stationary problem, and you need some regularity. And you need some regularity for the estimate, for the station problem. So that you can say some existence of the semiconductor that corresponds to your election field. Yeah. But without doing that, we don't know how to. So I just consider this constant case and frequency depending case. Also, the full generality, but it's not actually full because we assume that the constant, the coefficient doesn't depend on the temperature. Those can still depend on the frequency, but we don't know how to do the temperature dependencies. And in this case, under the assumption that this kind of operator is increasing. Which is I think okay assumption because this B is a Planck distribution and this alpha we can assume so yeah so we assume the F is increasing in the temperature and this F but we don't know about the increases and this existence still And this existence theory is by the Schauder type fixed point item. So for the Schauder type, the idea behind the existence theory is the formulation of some green type function that corresponds to this equation. So if we go back to the equation, the equation looks like this scattering term both in scattering. Both in scattering and the emission absorption. But for the emission part, we change this to a delta function and see if there is some corresponding green function for i. Yeah, so we consider this high notification. And we define some green type flux, something like this, so that we can retrieve our original solutions and the flux by this. But it's the equation, we just change this to a delta function, so we multiply this and integrate. So now the problem changes to the green type function. And in order to say something about the shadow fixed point, we a priori need to have this kind of a bound for the curve. A bound for the curve G. In that case, this map becomes something less than one coefficient times the L infinity norm of W. So we can say that the solution resides in some L infinity subspace of some L infinity space. So we show that this space is non-empty, convex, and bounded. Also, we show that the equicontinuity of that map so that we can use the Azerlascal equivalent to have some compactness. And we realize that the equicontinuity of this map corresponds to the uniform continuity of another colour. So we iterate this integral representation again and again. Representation again and again, and create some Tuhame series representation. The former Tuhame series representation. And for each Tuhame sequence, we prove this kind of amount. And this is sum of it. Sum over. And we obtain something like uh this bound for the kernel, which corresponds to the the a priori estimate that we needed for the child re estimate. Estimate that we needed for the child estimate. And also for the uniform continuity, this was harder, but by taking some careful decompositions about the domain, we could still have this kind of a rough bound, but this rough bound is some of it. So, yeah. But this was about the existence theory. And somebody can ask, like, whether we can define some entropy of the radiation. And the answer is yes. So we just consider the Millet-type equation, the emission attribution only equation with the Planck distribution, the user one. Then the local entropy density from the physics book is defined as this. Is defined as this. It's like a log F log F type, but slightly different. Yeah. It's like 1 plus F log 1 plus F minus F log. And we can show that the entropy is actually being produced. Not even for the time dependent case, as in the user entropy production in time. Entropy production in time, but also in the stationary case. Stationary case, like entropy is being produced in the body, so the incoming radiation has a less entropy than the outgoing entropy. So the equation for the entropy seems to be like this. That can be derived like this. And we can provide some propositions on the entropy production in the stationary case. That the divergence, the integration of the divergence of the entropy flow is always positive, non-negative. And by the divergence theorem, we can see that the outgoing entropy is always greater than or equal to the incoming entropy. Always greater than or equal to the incoming entropy. Yeah, the proof is like using this kind of a divergence-free argument. And you add or subtract some terms like this, which becomes zero by the divergence theorem. And using the symmetry, you can show that the integral is always non-negative. So there is some. So, there is some entropy being produced in the stationary case within the gas of the body of the gases. So, this is on the entropy production. And one interesting thing is that the local temperature becomes constant everywhere if the equality holds. If and only if the equality holds. That means if the incoming entropy If the incoming entropy and the outgoing entropy is the same, then the temperature is constant. You can also prove that. And we can say something about the uniqueness of a solution, a constant solution, under the assumption that the incoming boundary has a constant temperature using the variation principle. You can define some Lagrangian on the outgoing entropy with the restriction of. Entropy with the restriction on the outgoing radiation intensity, then this outgoing entropy becomes maximum if and only if the temperature is constant. Similarly, you can also show for the incoming entropy. So the incoming entropy becomes maximum if the local temperature is constant. So if we assume the incoming radiation is at the constant temperature in the If at the constant temperature in the in the incoming body uh condition, then the temperature of the body becomes constant. There's a unique constant solution. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? So I think I misunderstood something here. In section 3, there was a slide where you proved the existence of the shadow sticks point here, and like the slide later, it seemed like you had a serious expansion for the serious expansion. Okay, but it should seem like you had a radius of convergence for that one, for the yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So each term we uh yes, that's right. That's the formal argument. Formal to Hammer series. Former two hammer, yes. But if you can show that it converges, can you not to get the steady state immediately from that expansion? Yes, yes, that's right. Yeah. So what we show is that each term has this kind of a bound, and this bound is some other for any for any, for example, for any f. Yeah. The second question was. The second question was, is there any relation between being a steady state and production? Maybe you said it, but I mean it. Yes, yes. So usually when we say about the entropy production, we consider the time dependent with some good boundary conditions like on torus or the whole space with the zero boundary at the infinity. The entropy is being produced within this system. But in the steady state, we can also say something similar. State, we can also say something similar. So imagine something like the boundary condition is the physical boundary is more like a boundary of the time, time, like the initial condition in terms of time. Then we can also obtain some entropications like this. And if you integrate this with respect to all variables, and the divergence theorem gives you, if you show this kind of right-hand side, the intersection. This kind of right-hand side, the integral of the right-hand side is non-negative, then the flow, the entropy flow at the boundary, the boundary contribution of the entropy flow is non-negative. And this consists of the outgoing boundary and the income boundary. This value is an outgoing boundary minus income boundary relation flux. So that means even at the steady state case, Steady state case, the outgoing entropy is always greater than or equal to the incoming rate. Incoming rate is an entropy. That sounds an entropy. But you cannot characterize the steady state as a, I don't know, maximizer or? Uh yeah, the steady state becomes a maximizer if it has a temperature, constant temperature. Any other questions, Virginia? I had a question. What does H new mean from the normal power series? Like, what does that correspond to? Hu. The H, this H? This H. Yes, this corresponds to G. And G corresponds to G, I didn't put the deck in here. I didn't put the technique. No. If you write down the problem, this problem in a mild this problem in a mild formulation, then this divergence free corresponds to this kind of equation. And if you write down this operator, well, then that consists of some part and some part of this. And some part of that is. And that corner, we'll assume everything in the corner as G nu. I don't know the physical meaning. But then H nu is defined such that the integration of G nu respect to X0 is equal to the integration of H nu respect to Dn. They are related like this. Any other questions? All right, let's go ahead and thank Junu again. And let's thank all of the speakers and all of the participants. Yeah, it's perfectly awesome.
