In the snowy mountains here in Florida, it's neither snowy nor mountainous. So I'm sad for that, but you know, hope to see you all there again sometime in the future. So yeah, this is really, I think, going to follow on pretty naturally to what Michael was just talking about. This is joint work with Michael and with Carson Fritsch. The goal for this talk here is to try to describe what I'm calling the quasi-fibrid boundary. Calling the quasi-fibrid boundary structure of this compactification of the monopole moduli spaces. So, well, yeah, I guess I don't have to write that. I'll just say that. So, you know, quite a bit of the talk, I'm just going to sort of lead up to what does this mean, quasi-fiber boundary metric. So what is QFB here? So, first of all, just to kind of situate this in the landscape of various acronyms for various Various acronyms for various types of asymptotic geometries. We have maybe down here at the lower left corner here. We can talk about, you know, ALE metrics, asymptotically locally Euclidean metrics, or maybe even asymptotically Euclidean metrics, which are generalized by asymptotically conic metrics, which I'll review here in a minute. Those themselves are further generalized by what I'll be calling fibrid boundary metrics. And then in another direction, And then in another direction, you know, I think this Q originated with Dominic Joyce, who defined a class of metrics, QALE metrics, which generalize in a different way, asymptotically locally Euclidean metrics. And now I can continue this up to the left. There's quasi QAC, quasi-asymptotically conic metrics. And then these are all kind of contained in this big upper left corner, quasi-quasi-fiber boundary metrics. So I will explain. I will explain a few of these objects along the way, and then I will sort of culminate with the description of the compactification of the monopole moduli spaces as Michael started in his last talk. So our goal for the first part is just to understand sort of what is QFB and how does it relate to these other things. So first I'm just going to review asymptotically conic geometries. So AC. So AC, we probably all know what this is. So here's a picture, asymptotically conic manifold is maybe looks like this in a picture. So I've got my manifold, and maybe outside some compact set, it looks like, let's say, a hypersurface. So maybe I'm able to find a hypersurface in this manifold and cut away a compact set. And let me, let's make this one. So outside a compact set, it's diffeomorphic to some hypersurface times a half infinite interval. And then we would say that a metric is asymptotically conic if on this region it looks something like, and so I'll use r here as my coordinate, looks something like dr squared plus r squared times a metric on the hypersurface. Metric on the hypersurface. And maybe that metric is allowed to depend on H in some uniform way, depending on R. And then, you know, maybe lower order terms here. But maybe I won't have to write the lower order terms here since that's what I mean by the squiggle. So to leading order, it has this behavior as R goes to infinity, right? That's the kind of usual picture of an asymptotically conic metric. For my purposes, rather than sort of standing in Rather than sort of standing in the middle of the manifold and looking outward toward infinity, it's more convenient to give ourselves an infinity at which to stand and look inward. So a profitable way, I think, to look at these things is to say that we can compactify this space by adding on a copy of the hypersurface at infinity. So equivalently, we can So equivalently, we can situate M inside a manifold with boundary, where here the boundary is like this hypersurface H and then with respect to that boundary if I define x to be 1 over r, this is a boundary defining function, as Michael mentioned. Which I will just abbreviate to BDF for short. Just meaning that it's a non-negative function that vanishes precisely at the boundary and is differential is non-degenerate along the boundary. Then just looking at this coordinate change, then with respect to this function x, I can say that the metric is asymptotic to has. metric is asymptotic to has the form dx squared over x to the fourth plus some metric on h divided by x squared and again you know up to leading order in x so of course this is not a Riemannian metric on the manifold with boundary because it becomes singular at the boundary so it's still a complete Riemannian metric on the interior of the manifold with boundary but the purpose of doing this is to give us a compact space on which to work and sort of with respect to which With respect to which, at the boundary, we have a precise understanding of the asymptotic behavior of the metric. Now, it's going to be convenient. Well, actually, yeah, so first let me just write down some obvious examples. The most obvious example of an asymptotically conic metric is, you know, Euclidean space, you know, as a conic metric over the sphere. Over the sphere, right? So the compactification here would just be, sorry, n will be, I guess, three at some point. But if we take the radial compactification of the Euclidean space compactify to a ball by adding the n minus one sphere on at infinity, then we have precisely this metric where x is one over r and g h is just the standard metric on the sphere. And so this would apply, of course, to manifolds with Euclidean ends. Manifolds with Euclidean ends or ALE manifolds where instead of Sn minus 1, maybe we have Sn minus 1 modulo, some discrete group that acts on it. And of course, it's not important that the hypersurface itself be a sphere. It could be any compact manifold. So any manifold with boundary, we could, in principle, equip it with a complete asymptotically conic manifold on the interior that has this asymptotic behavior. Now it's going to be equivalent later when I start generalizing, or going to be convenient later when I start generalizing this to have a different characterization of the metric in terms of tangent vectors. So another way to say this asymptotic behavior is to say that g is uniformly bounded. With respect to vector fields, let's take C on the compactification, which have the following two properties. So they vanish at the boundary and they also sort of annihilate the boundary defining function. Annihilate the boundary defining function, at least to second order. All right, so if you look at it, you know, a metric with this, with these asymptotics up here has that form. This sort of second condition is what gives us the radial scaling in the radial direction. And this first condition says essentially that the transversal component of the metric as we go out toward the boundary has to be also if the vector fields are vanishing and it's uniform. The vector fields are vanishing and it's uniformly bounded with respect to that, then they're sort of the metric itself is singular of order, kind of one over x squared as we go out to the boundary. Right, so that's asymptotically conic metrics. We're hopefully all familiar with that. Then I'll generalize this a little bit further by talking about fibrid boundary metrics. So, you know, analysis on fiber boundary metrics, the pseudo-differential operator, calculus on fiber boundary metrics goes back to Maseo and Melrose. They come up naturally in a lot of different contexts. The way that we can describe them here in relation to what I just said is we're now, again, going to have a manifold with boundaries. We're now again going to have a manifold with boundary, except now the boundary will be equipped with a fibration. And I'm going to try to use a consistent color scheme here. So throughout this talk, things that are fibered will have fibers denoted in blue and base denoted in red. So we now have equipped our manifold with boundary with a fibration of its boundary hyperspace. The vibration of its boundary hypersurface. Hope Nervan is colorblind. Yeah, sorry. It's going to be green and red, but that's probably also bad. Right, and so a fiber boundary metric, say a metric. Again, a complete Riemannian metric on the interior will be said to be a fibrid boundary metric. Will be said to be a fibrid boundary metric on this compactification as a manifold with boundary. If roughly it looks like this, it's asymptotic again to dx squared over x to the fourth has this kind of radial scaling in the normal direction as we approach the boundary. A metric, sorry, this should be a metric on the base that's scaling in the In the asymptotically conic fashion, as before, but then a sort of uniformly bounded metric on the fibers. And so, again, you know, has this asymptotic form as x goes to zero, which is the boundary. Right, so for example, of course, sort of trivial examples, we can take an asymptotically conic manifold, maybe just times a compact manifold. If we just whack on, take the Riemannian product with a compact manifold. On, take the Riemannian product with a compact manifold, like Rn times a compact manifold would be an example. The sum of those two metrics, you know, we've got just a bounded metric in the factor that we added on. Sorry, is there a chat question? Okay. But that's not a very interesting example. So other interesting examples are, of course, you know, like ALF type hypercaler spaces. Type hypercaler spaces such as tab nut or in the to make contact with manifold monopoles the two monopole centered moduli space. Well let me I guess I'll try to use the same notation as Michael so let's say x2 would be the strongly centered two monopole moduli space. This is the Attiya-Hitchin manifold. All right, so both of these are four-dimensional All right, so both of these are four-dimensional hyperkalar manifolds on their compactification. Yeah, so here the boundary in both of these cases, I'll write the boundary is a three-sphere fibering over the two-sphere with the hop fibration. And so we have essentially like a Euclidean three. Like a Euclidean three-dimensional volume growth with respect to the base. And then there's some compact bounded circle fibers. Right. Sorry, Chris. Yes. It becomes important what depends on what. Before on the previous slide, you were writing G dependent on X. Do I understand correctly that here GB depends on X and G F depends on X and coordinates on the base? Yeah, so all of these can depend on X. And yeah, here, F, this can depend on X. Here, f this can depend on x, and then also, yes, let's say like y in the base, right? So, really, I just mean I have a you know a two-form that restricted to the fibers is non-degenerate and bounded, and then it has a term that looks like the pullback, let's say, of a degenerate, a non-degenerate metric from the base multiplied by x1 over x squared. You know, that would be the model form for a fibrous boundary metric. And again, there's sort of metric and again gf can be completely general right gf can be completely general that can depend on the variables in f as well yeah yeah g is pulled back yeah i mean when i yeah by writing gf i mean that right restricted to f it's a it's a metric already on f yeah so it doesn't have to be yeah constant or anything um right and so yeah a slightly more general uh way to write this metric is again in terms of vector fields So, this is maybe like a special form of a fiber boundary metric, the kind of model form for a fiber boundary metric. More generally, we can say G is fibered boundary if and only if G is uniformly bounded with respect to vector fields satisfying a similar property to the before, where now the vector fields restricted to the boundary are tangent. Tangent to the fibers. So that's a well-defined condition on the vector fields. And then again, you know, annihilate a boundary defining function to second order. All right, so yeah, if you like, the geometry here is equivalently encoded by this class of vector. This class of vector fields, this in fact, which forms a sub-Lie algebra of the Lie algebra of all vector fields on the manifold with boundary. So you can sort of pass back and forth between the metric picture or the vector field picture. And when I get to quasi-fiber boundary, it's going to be more convenient to state it like that. But so lots of examples of fiber boundary metrics in nature, including, as I say, the two-monopole moduli space, lots of other interesting hyperkaler four-manifolds. So So, right, any questions about that so far before I jump to quasi-fiber boundary? So, QFB. So, the here's the TLDR version here is that Here is that Q is for corners. I mean, that's probably not, Joyce would not agree with that, maybe. But in this picture, Q is going to be encoded by corners. I mean, it's really, if you like, it's kind of a stratified version of these things. But I'll just sort of jump straight to the most convenient definition here. I think we owe this definition to Conlon. Definition to Conlon, Dejaratu, and Roshon. And it generalizes a class of quasi-asymptotically conic metrics that were introduced by Dejiratu and Medzeo. And I'll mention those in a second. So here, I'm going to drop the overline on M for now. So just now M itself is just going to be a compact manifold with corners. With corners. Hypersurfaces, boundary hypersurfaces. I could potentially enumerate them. I'll just call them H1 up to Hn, say. Each of which is equipped with a fibration. I'll try to use the color scheme again here. All right, so a manifold with corners, each of its boundary hypersurfaces is equipped with a vibration, and then they're required to sort of speak to each other whenever the two hypersurfaces meet. So there's a compatibility condition such that whenever two hypersurfaces meet, Surfaces meet, we can compare these fibrations. And roughly speaking, well, not roughly speaking, really precisely speaking, one of the fibrations is meant to be strictly finer than the other. So one of them sort of wins. And this intersection of hypersurfaces looks from the point of view of, let's say, the Hj vibration, it looks like the restriction of that vibration onto a boundary face of the base. I should have said this, actually. Face of the base. I should have said this actually before, but the boundary hypersurfaces of a manifold with corners are, of course, themselves manifolds with corners. And these fibration structures here, both the base and the fiber are going to be manifolds with corners. So from the point of view of one of the hypersurfaces, it looks like I've restricted over a boundary hypersurface of the base itself. And then that is required to be equipped with. Is required to be equipped with a fibration over the base of the ith hypersurface in such a way that this diagram commutes. All right, so this is a commutative, basically the vibration becomes an iterated fibration, and the fibers of, I guess, HJ are then strictly finer than the fibers of Hi. So let me actually draw a picture here that I think is clarify this somewhat. What is the fiber of this interception? Somewhat. What is the fiber of this intersection? Right, so here the fiber with respect to phij, this just looks like the full fiber. We have the full fiber of Fj restricted over the base. Sorry, nope, nope, I missed up my indices here. All right, so with respect to phi j, this is a boundary face of the bjth. is a boundary face of the Bjth the base Bj. So we have the full fiber in that vibration. Whereas the other vibration, the phi I vibration, it turns out from this condition that this looks actually like the restriction, well, actually not a restriction, but it looks like a sub-bundle of the ith vibration. There's a well-defined sub bundle of the ith vibration. There's a well-defined sub-bundle of the ith vibration that looks like a boundary face of the ith fiber sort of being carried along. So, in other words, when two hypersurfaces meet, it looks from one direction like you're going to a boundary hypersurface in the base, and from the other direction like you're going to a boundary hypersurface in the fiber. So here's a picture. So, here in this picture, I've got three hypersurfaces meeting. And sorry, I'm going to do this in blue for fibers. Do this in blue for fibers. So maybe this leftmost face here, maybe the fiber is the whole thing, and the base is just a point. On the bottom here, maybe my fibers are lines like this, and the base is a line like this. Like this, and then on this third face, maybe my fibers are points like this, and the base is a like a quadrant like that. All right, so those would be three three fibers. So you can see that, you know, whenever you pass from one hypersurface to another, you know, one of the sets of fibers is strictly finer than the other. sets of fibers is strictly finer than the other. And we see this compatibility condition. So for instance, if now maybe I'll just point with a pointer now. All right, so where this hypersurface meets this other hypersurface at this codimension two corner here, we can see from the one hand that it looks like just the restriction over the base here to this boundary face. Whereas from the point Whereas, from the point of view of this hypersurface, we have the full base involved, but we're passing to the boundaries and the fibers. So, is that picture sort of clear enough to everybody? This is the, I should say there's two parts to the description of the metric here. The first I'm just describing the kind of differential topology of the underlying space. And then I'll say how the metric behaves. So the differential topology picture is this manifold with corners. The boundary faces all have these vibrations. Boundary faces all have these vibrations with this compatibility condition. And I should mention before I go on, maybe in a little sidebar here, that there's an equivalence here between M and an associated stratified space, which is what we get by basically collapsing out all the fibers of the fibrations at the boundary. Boundary. So, if you collapse out the fibers at each boundary face, you get a stratified space. And in fact, equivalently, there's a for a nice class of stratified spaces, those with so-called Tom Mather control data, you can take a stratified space and iteratively resolve the strata and arrive at a manifold with corners with this data. So, really, this is essentially it's a manifold with corners way of encoding the data of stratified spaces. Stratified spaces. But we'll see that to understand the metrics, it's much nicer to work on the mantle with corners side. To write this diagram that we wrote, you're using this partial order induced by this stratification. Yes. Yeah. So here, the fact that this diagram commutes implies in particular that whenever hypersurfaces meet, their bases have to have different dimensions. Could you explain what DJFI means? Yeah, it means that it's a. Yeah, it means that there exists a boundary hypersurface of Bj associated to Bi, and that there exists a fibration of that boundary hypersurface of Bj with base Bi. So that's the. So the fibrous still isomorphic. So DJ Fi is still isomorphic to Fi, isn't it? DJ, no, this is, this is DJ Fi is a, is as a strict boundary hypersurface example. Boundary hybrid surface. Yes, okay, thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so in fact, as a consequence of this, both BI, all the bases, and all the fibers also inherit this structure. They are also themselves fibered. I should say, I didn't give a name to this thing. We call this structure, a fibered corners structure. All right, so a manifold with corners with vibration, sign, and spound. So as a consequence, the base and the fiber. So as a consequence, the base and the fiber of the fibrations themselves have fibered cornice structures. And yeah, this is essentially equivalent in some sense. In fact, I think it's probably true that there's a useful equivalence of categories between some nice category of stratified spaces and a category of fiber corners manifolds. All right, so good. And I'll give you some examples in a minute, but let me just first say the metric structure that we're interested in. The metric structure that we're interested in. So, a quasi-fiber boundary metric is going to be G, which is again a Riemannian metric on the interior of our manifold such that g is uniformly bounded with respect to vector fields. Respect to vector fields such that restricted to each boundary hypersurface, the vector field is tangent to the fibers. So just like in the fiber boundaries case, but now with more boundaries, and annihilates a total boundary defining function to second order. So here x is the product now of boundary defining function. To know of boundary defining functions for all the hypersurfaces. So that's the most efficient way I can define a quasi-fiber boundary metric for you. So in particular, if you go out towards any one of the boundary faces and you stay away from the corners, it looks essentially like a fiber boundary metric in the previous sense, except that the fibers and the base. sense, except that the fibers and the base may be, you know, well, they're manifolds with corners, so their interiors may be non-compact. But if you maybe stay in a compact region with respect to the base and the fiber, it will look like a fiber boundary metric in the previous sense. So what are some examples here? Sorry, X is the product of all boundary functions? Yes, it's what we call a total boundary definition. Yes, it's what we call a total boundary defining function. So it's a product of boundary defining functions for the hypersurfaces So one example is if I have two fiber boundary manifolds or maybe asymptotically conic manifolds You would want to look at their product. Now, their product, I claim, is not actually a quasi-fibrid boundary manifold. And you can actually see that right away. So if we think about, you know, if I just naively take the Cartesian product of these two manifolds with boundary, of course, I have a manifold with corners. And yeah, so I can take the base. You know, I can take the base. So, as I go out to the boundary with respect to one of them, I have the base B1 and the base B2 in the other direction. And then here, I can equip it with the vibration where I have the fiber F1 and then times the whole manifold M2 over here at this boundary phase. And at this boundary phase, I have the fiber F2 times the whole manifold M1 at this boundary phase. But you see that there's a conflict when they meet. There's a conflict when they meet. You know, neither one wants to dominate, or neither one is able to dominate the other. So these vibrations are sort of incompatible when they meet. So we have to resolve that conflict. And I claim that if we take the so this notation here, this brackets notation is for the real blow. brackets notation is for the real blow-up of the product of their boundaries. We'll get a space that I call m1 tilde times m2. This is a kind of resolved product of m1 and m2. So I can, you know, just in words, the real blow-up is where I take some sub-manifold, in this case, just a code. Manifold, in this case, just a codimension two-corner, I delete it and I replace it with its inward-pointing spherical normal bundle. So, right, as opposed to projective blow-up where I'm replacing things with their sort of projective normal spaces, I'm replacing with a spherical normal space. And so in this case, basically just a portion of the sphere as drawn here. Here, the base of this new boundary face. This new boundary face is going to look like I've introduced, well, in this picture, basically, an interval. And so the base here becomes equipped with that interval, and then the fiber is just going to be the product of the fibers. And with respect to that fibration structure that you can define, the product of the metrics G1 and G2 will have this property. Will have this property, it will be a quasi-fibrid boundary metric with respect to this now thing with three faces. And as a remark, this is a product. There's a general notion of product for whenever I have actually not just manifolds with. Have actually not just manifolds with fiber boundary, but manifolds with quasi-fiber boundary. So I have a manifold with corners and I take their Cartesian product that is not the product. I mean, it's not, again, a quasi-fiber boundary manifold, but there's a way of resolving a certain number of corners in a certain way so that you actually get a product. And in fact, this product satisfies a category, you know, it's a product in the category theoretic sense in an appropriate category. So it's associative and commutative up to canonical isomorphism and so forth. So there is a Canonical isomorphism and so forth. So there is a product in an appropriate category here that I'll denote by times with a tilde over it. Another example, I guess example two here, that I want to focus on before I get to the monopole spaces, because this is kind of like a baby model for monopoles, are basically configuration spaces, configurations of points, also known as many body spaces or many body compact. Spaces or many body compactifications. So, here what we're going to think about is just let's say maybe I'll try to use the same. Yeah, no, K is fine. So just the space of K points in a vector space V, you know, and really we're probably interested in V being R3, but it doesn't matter here, a vector space. All right, so of course the configuration space of Configuration space of k points in V is just V to the K, but that's not compact. What's an interesting geometric compactification of that? So there are maybe two ways to proceed here. So two obvious ways to compactify V to the K are we can take its radial compactification. Radial compactification, the product of that, k times. The other sort of obvious way to compactify would be to take vk itself as a vector space and take the radial compactification of that. Neither one of these is the compactification that I want to think about, but they have a common sort of ancestor, common refinement. So rather than take the Cartesian product, as I just mentioned, that's sort of the wrong thing to do. Sort of the wrong thing to do. Really, what we'd like to do is take this resolved product k times, which amounts in this picture to blowing up the corners here. And from the radio compactification point of view, the sort of thing that we're missing, the bad thing that we've done. thing that we're missing, the bad thing that we've done is we're losing information as we go out to infinity parallel to an axis. And if we think about this as encoding information of points that are going out to infinity, if we have clusters of points that are going out to infinity but remain within a bounded distance of each other, in the radial compactification, we lose that information once they go out to infinity because of course all lines parallel to the axes converge to a common point here. So if we blow up the If we blow up the points where the axes meet infinity, so rather than take the radio compactification, we're going to blow up the boundaries of the axes where they meet infinity. I claim that we in fact arrive at the same picture. So these two things, these two pictures are actually the same picture. They're sort of an octagon in the simplified picture here. So this is either one of these descriptions. So, this is either one of these descriptions is the many-body compactification of VK. And maybe just to maybe to make contact with monopoles here, we actually, this really is a monopoles thing if we're thinking about abelian monopoles. Right, so if we take U1 gauge group. U1 gauge group, and let's say we're fixing the mass to be one, right? Then an abelian monopole is sort of uniquely determined up to gauge by the zero of the singularities, the Coulomb singularities of its Higgs field, you know, counted with multiplicity. So that just looks like k points in R3. So this really is essentially like the space of abelian monopole, although maybe there's a finite group that I should, I mean, a symmetric group action that I should worry about. A symmetric group action that I should worry about so that the monopoles are yeah, so that the point charges are indistinguishable. But I want to sort of zoom in on this picture and describe a little bit how these boundary faces behave, the fiber and base structures of these things. So I'll call that VK hat, whichever way. Hat, whichever way you define it, this compactification of VK. So here's another, let's say, sorry, here's, for example, k equals 4, just for giggles. You can, there's a region here. There's boundary faces associated to partitions of the integer k, just as Michael was mentioning for monopoles. Mentioning for monopoles. So here's an example of a kind of thing that you get if you define this space. You will have, well, there's lots of different hypersurfaces for k equals 4, but there's a region where three hypersurfaces meet, one which sort of corresponds to a 2 plus 2 decomposition of 4, one which corresponds to a 2 plus 1 plus 1 decomposition, and then a 1 plus 1 plus 1 decomposition. And just to describe what the fibers and bases of What are the fibers and bases of these spaces? I guess let me start with the bases. Let's start with the 1 plus 1 plus 1 region. That's the original, let's say, radial boundary of V to the fourth, the radial compactification of V to the fourth. So that just looks like the boundary of the radial compactified V4. Although we've done some, we've blown up some, so that's a big sphere, but we've blown up some sub-spheres inside it. I'll just say axes. I'll just say axes again. So it looks like a sphere, but sort of with punctures. These axes where the axes met the sphere at infinity, we've blown them up. So if you like, it's basically a punctured sphere. 2 plus 1 plus 1, what that sort of corresponds to is one of the axes where, let's say, maybe the first coordinate was 0. Yeah, I think so. So the base of this vibration is actually going to look like the boundary of a V3, radiocompactified and then blown up along axes. And the base of the vibration for the 2 plus 2 face is going to look like a DV2. And roughly, what's the information that this is The information that this is capturing is the idea of having k points going off to infinity. The one plus one plus one region is where the k points are all becoming widely separated. And in the base here, we're encoding their sort of relative directions that they've gone off to infinity in. The 2 plus 1 plus 1 region, we have a cluster of two points that have gone off to infinity together, remaining within a bounded distance of each other, and then two other points that are becoming widely separate. Points that are becoming widely separated. And in the base here, we're keeping the information of the clusters, right? So that the two-particle cluster sort of counts as one particle from the point of view of the base. And likewise in the two plus two region, it's two clusters, and we're sort of seeing, you know, two things go off to infinity and encoding that relative information. The fibers, on the other hand, are encoding the cluster information. The cluster information. So if we look at, and yeah. So the fiber, what you get if you write down this space, and you can do this quite explicitly. You just take the radial compactification and these blow-ups and think a little bit about what you get. And it's almost essentially linear algebra. Because when you write to replace something with a spherical normal bundle in a compactified vector space, the spherical normal bundle Space, the spherical normal bundle of an axis is basically just the compactified normal space to that axis. So if you think a little bit about what you get, you're going to get a two-particle configuration space, although centered, so modded out by, let's say, a translation in V, and then compactified. And then another two-particle compactifiedified And then another two-particle configuration, centered two-particle configuration space, compactified. And then not the Cartesian product, but this little sort of resolved product that I mentioned before. So that's the fiber that you get in a 2 plus 2 case. So what this is encoding, again, the base is encoding the relative directions that two clusters have gone off to infinity in. And the fibers are encoding the relative configuration. So if I follow one cluster of two points, when that reaches infinity, I've got some. Reaches infinity. I've got some, you know, I can essentially re-center those points. It looks like a centered two-particle cluster and another centered two-particle cluster, and those two factors are encoding those bits of information. Here for the two plus one plus one face, I have a v2 mod v and then two factors of a v mod v and a v mod v, but those are, of course, are just points. So this is really just a just a v2 mod v. Just a V2 mod V. And then here, of course, I have a sort of a V mod V to the fourth, but that's just a point. So yeah, I claim it's all very explicit in this Euclidean case where you're just blowing up axes in Euclidean, in radially compactified Euclidean spaces. And you can just sit down and think this through. And in fact, the fibrations in this case are literally products. The boundary faces are actually literally products of. Are actually literally products of the blue thing and the red thing in each case. So, any questions about that model before I go on? There must be some combinatorial object behind this, some sort of, associahedron, permit, ahedron, just some geometric object which takes care of all possible decompositions and how faces match together. And how faces match together. Yeah, I mean, certainly. I mean, well, yeah, I don't know the sort of fancy combinatorial object for it, but this kind of many body space is itself quite combinatorial. The spaces are indexed. And I guess I did this sort of un, it's actually a little bit more clean if I had done the centered configuration space. So centered configurations of k particles. Then it's a little bit more clean. And then everything is just indexed by diagonals, which are themselves indexed just. By diagonals, which are themselves indexed just by partitions of the integer, actually, partitions of the set, I guess. Right, so no, it is all very combinatorial. But now I want to finally get at last to the description of the monopole compactification. So, this is the theorem. Sorry that the monopole spaces, and here we're just talking about SU2 gauge group, but interesting question for higher gauge group, maybe with maximal symmetry breaking. So the MK admit compactifications. Compactifications. And we can, you know, you can say this for any version of the monopole moduli spaces that you want. I'll maybe just state the version for the original MK. This is the 4K dimensional space. Of course, there's similar compactifications for the centered 4K minus 3-dimensional spaces or the strongly centered 4K minus 4-dimensional spaces. But we'll get maybe the cleanest description or relatively clean description for this one. So I'll just call this mk hat with boundary hypersurfaces. As Michael mentioned, indexed by partitions of the integer k. I guess I should call this kq. So to make contact with Michael's notation, lambda denotes a partition of the integer k as a sum k1 up to kq. So we have a hypersurface K lambda, or H lambda, and the base B lambda is exactly the same as it is in this many-body space. So this is looks like an R3K, sorry, this should be Q, R3Q compactified and then blown up along, let's say, axes. And the fiber is a product of lower charge monopole spaces, but centered, as Michael mentioned, MK0. So these are the moduli spaces where we've modded out by translation in R3 or equivalently. Translation in R3, or equivalently, put fixed the center of mass of the monopole at zero. And their compactifications and this sort of little resolved product. All right, so I guess I didn't, I should have gone back and said this when I was talking about quasi-fiber boundary metrics. The, you know. The metric is meant to be essentially uniformly bounded in the fiber directions as we go out to each boundary space. In particular, it makes sense to restrict the metric to the fiber of any given boundary hypersurface. And a quasi-fiber boundary metric, the restriction to that fiber will be again a quasi-fiber boundary metric with respect to the QFB structure of the fiber itself. So we expect that the fibers of these boundary hypersurfaces to be Surfaces to be themselves have this fibered corner structure as manifolds with corners. And we expect the restriction of the metric to such a fiber to be a QFB metric, and indeed it is. It's the QFB metric that we get by this compactification procedure applied to lower charge centered monopole spaces, and then the product of those in an appropriate category. So, this kind of resolved product of those things. Right, and as Michael mentioned, this vibration is not trivial as it was in the previous case, the many-body space. There is some non-trivial topology to this vibration, but it's very explicit. As Michael mentioned, there's this underlying torus bundle that you can write down over B lambda that has factors that have explicit churn classes with respect to these sort of things that you. Respect to these sort of things that you deleted, these axes or diagonals in a slightly different picture. So that, you know, you have this torus bundle, so with a, you know, a torus, a U1 to the Q action on it. And likewise, these centered monopole moduli spaces each have a U1 action. So there's a U1 to the Q that acts on this thing, and this is an associated bundle to that. thing and this is an associated bundle to that principal torus bundle. So that describes completely the topology of this fiber bundle. And as Michael mentioned, the hyperkaler metric, GK, at any one of these boundary hypersurfaces is asymptotic to, well, again, let me first say the sort of safer thing here, restricted to any fiber. It's just the product of the, again, the hyperkaler metrics on the factors. And with respect to the base, it looks like, well, yeah, I guess it looks like it has this Euclidean scaling in the base, so it looks kind of like a R3Q scaling in the base. Scaling in the base and then plus GK1 up to GKQ. I mean, that's a little bit, it's a little bit hairy to say that that's sort of not a uniformly true statement because where the hypersurfaces match up at corners, that's not quite the right thing to say. But as Michael mentioned, if you go out to a boundary face and you stay in a relatively compact subset, And you stay in a relatively compact subset of the base and the fiber, then that's a true statement. And globally, at each fiber, again, the metric is going to reproduce the sum of the metrics on the monopole spaces. So any questions about that, the sort of statement of the theorem here? Actually, I had something, which is just: is there anything in your theorem that reflects the? Your theorem that reflects the metric intuition that somehow the big piece of the boundary should be the bit where it's all one monopoles. I mean, yes, in the sense that that has the most volume, right? Because as you go out to each of these boundary faces, you have volume growth that's determined by the size of the base, right? So the largest base of these fibrations. base of these vibrations is the one that corresponds to k equals one plus one plus one plus one all white separated right so then we have um basically sort of you know k-dimensional euclidean volume growth as you go out in that direction whereas the volume growth in these other directions is much smaller because the the geometry in the fibers is essentially um you know bounded and that the the conic volume growth that you're getting because of the base is is correspondingly less so i think So I think that's, at least in the sense of volume, that's the intuition that that's the big piece of infinity, is the widely separated region. And then in some sense, you know, there's a widely separated region as becoming singular, but this, we sort of resolve the singularities by putting in all these other boundary faces. Yeah, good question. Okay, thanks. That would be the biggest. That would be the biggest stratum as well, if you think in terms of the stratify, the associated stratified space. Right. Yeah, that would be the principal. It's the principal singular stratum in a stratified space. That's right. So I think, you know, I might actually just stop here. I mean, I could go on and say some things about sort of what the gluing looks like to actually produce this compactification, but I don't know that there's like a good amount. I don't know that there's a like a good amount of time for that. So I think maybe it's better to just stop here. Thank you. All right. Any last minute questions? I have a question. So Michael mentioned that you have like these finite groups, like this, which act on the Which act on the, so you have to take care of, like, I mean, none of the monopoles are special. Right. And like, these phenotypes are different for each boundary phase. How do you take care of that? I mean, like, they don't really come up in your theorem. No, so it's because I lied. So, indeed, really, there should be quotients here, right? Each of these things should have a quotient by some discrete group that's acting that essentially. Group that's acting that essentially, you know, what it does is it interchanges clusters of like charge, right? So if I've got a decomposition where all of these integers are distinct, then there's no interesting action. But if some of the integers coincide, right, if I have k equals 2 plus 1 plus 1, then I can interchange the 1 and the 1. So there's a z2 that would be acting. Yeah, so those are actually all present. What happens when faces intersect and you come in with different groups? Well, the claim is that it's all consistent. Well, the claim is that it's all consistent, that these groups actually act freely on the bases. If you think for a little bit about these groups acting on the base, you know, I mean, it's a acting on the underlying Euclidean spaces. They have singularities, but you've essentially blown up at infinity the regions where those sort of orbifold points would occur. So, in this part of the base, these groups are acting freely. So, it's a nice quote. Are acting freely, so it's a nice quotient. Um, yeah, and the claim is that everything actually does fit together in the right way. So, it's not that there's some big space and then you take these different quotients to get the right space, it's that there's one compact manifold that exists whose boundary faces have this description where it's a vibration over this space. But to even describe what the face is, I really should have taken the quotient by a discrete group first. Sorry, yes, I didn't mean to lie so bald-facedly like that. We attempted to get this completely straight in the preprint. Yes, you need to pre-print by the three of us. So if you want to read through that and find any mistakes, that would be great. Yes. Well, somebody should. Yeah, it's a little bit. Yeah, it's a little bit annoying to sort of carry around what the discrete groups are, but if you, you know, it's all pretty sensible. And the claim is that it all hangs together quite nicely. Any other questions? Maybe I have a little comment. So I really listening was itching to find a combinatorial object because once you have it, then the way It then the way, for example, this discrete groups are hanging together will become obvious as well. So you imagine some polytope where the interior corresponds to the interior of the polytope corresponds to the interior of the monopole modulus space, the usual one. The largest face corresponds to all monopoles being maximally separated. And then there are lower faces. And then there are lower faces. And since each face is labeled by Young diagram, it's certainly something well known and used in representation theory, for example. Yes, yeah. And then that will tell exactly the decomposition of all symmetry groups. And in this language, it might be this language might be useful in formulating the statement just concisely. It's not a difference. No, that's true, right? It might give a good way to do that. That's true, right? It might give a good way to do the bookkeeping. That's true. I think there's something called a Statf polytope. Yeah, that's associated, isn't it? Right, yes. I think that relates to this sort of partitioning and stuff. That's right. But you'll have to, well, go read some commentatorics. All right. Well, let's thank Chris again. Thank you. Thank you.
