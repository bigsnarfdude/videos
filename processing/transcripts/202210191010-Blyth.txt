Okay, absolutely. Okay. Oh, what's going on? Okay, right. Sorry. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the invitation and to the organisers for organising a very nice meeting. So, yeah, I'm an applied mathematician working mainly in fluid dynamics, and what I was going to say is that I'm going to Fluid dynamics. And what I was going to talk about is trying to apply what is quite an old idea actually in fluid mechanics to the problem of signaling in plants. So I'll get to what I mean about that. And the talk is based around this thing called the Reeker factor hypothesis. So in some sense, my whole talk actually is like an open question because it's not clear as I understand it whether this Rika factor Whether this recaffector even exists. But I will explain in a minute what that's supposed to be and what variation potential transmission is. But the first thing to say is this is joint work with Richard Morris. I'm just across from the John Innes Centre at the University of East Anglia and I've been collaborating with Richard for a year or so. And if you are interested in what I have to say, this work is published in Frontiers in Plant Science. Frontiers in plant science. The key word in the title of the paper is this one, candidate. As I say, this is like a suggestion for how this might work. Okay, so this sketch here is supposed to illustrate the fact that plants, when plants are under attack, say, so if they're nibbled by a caterpillar or something, or if you come along and snip one of the leaves, then some sort of signal is sent out to the rest of the plant to. To the rest of the plant to indicate that that has happened. And certainly, as I understand it, in some plants, this manifests itself as an electrical signal on the surface of the stem and the leaf. And the question is, how does that signal come about? And in particular, what I want to address is how might it propagate? So the signal, as I said, appears as an electric potential which can be measured. Electric potential which can be measured in the lab on the surface, some people of people have done this. There's some nice work by the Vedeniev group. So they did experiments on wheat stems, which I'll talk about a little bit later, where they measured this electric potential. So I think what they did was they burnt the wheat stem at a point and then they measured how the electrical signal propagated away from the site of burning. It goes relatively slowly. It's on the order of the state. It goes relatively slowly, it's on the order of one to two millimeters per second, and crucially, the speed goes down with distance away from the wounding site. So it gets slower and slower the further the signal propagates. And also, interestingly, the signal can go through dead tissue in the stem. So, as I said, the question is, and I believe this is an open question: how does this signal? Question: How does this signal propagate? The electric potential, by the way, is known as a variation potential, sometimes called a slow wave potential, I think. So, the question is: how can it propagate? And one hypothesis is that it propagates as a chemical that gets deposited into the xylem and is then carried with the water in the xylem to other parts of the plant. Although this might be a slightly simplified way of looking at it, I think that. Simplified way of looking at it. I think there's reason to believe that Phloem was also involved in this. But to keep it simple, let's just say that that's what happens. You wound the plant at some point and a chemical, this is the so-called recafactor, gets deposited into the fluid in the xylem and that then gets transported through the xylem and somehow that then initiates an electrical signal on the surface of the plant. There's much that isn't understood. That isn't understood about this process. So it was Rika, so this is a long time ago, over 100 years ago, in 1916. Rika hypothesized this might be what was going on. And this chemical, this hypothesized chemical, which gets deposited in the xylem is usually known as the Rika factor. And I think there are various ideas as to what this might be, such as reactive oxygen species, I think. But I But as I said before, I don't think it's known whether this exists or whether this is actually how the propagation is happening. So I'm going to assume it does exist and that it is transported in the xylem. And what I will assume is that there's some concentration of this chemical in the xylem, and that is somehow sensed by cells at the wall at the interior. Wall, but the interior wall of the xylem, and that when the concentration is above some threshold, that triggers something to happen, possibly via iron channels, which trigger a response up at the surface of the plant electrically. So that's the basic idea. Now, there's an immediate problem with that, which is that if you wound a plant at a particular point, then the signal goes in both directions away from the wound site. Now, in the xylem, the water is predominantly. xylem the the water is predominantly going in one direction from root to shoot so how might that work if the fluid flow in the xylem is in is in one direction how can the signal go in the opposite direction if the hypothesis is that it's being carried along with the uh with the flow so to answer that question there was a proposal by Malone in 1993 who suggested that it might be that what happens when you wound the xylem is that in an adjacent cell That in an adjacent cell, an adjacent cell filled with water is under significant pressure, that bursts and deposits almost instantaneously a certain volume of fluid into the xym, and that then pushes the fluid in the xylem in both directions. So that might explain how you might establish a flow going both ways along the xylem to transport this Rika factor. Now, I'm not going to go into that. I'm just going to assume that there is a flow. Going to assume that there is a flow in the xylem and that there is a chemical and work on work on that basis. Okay, so here are my key assumptions. So there is this flow, as I said, there is this chemical and it's transported passively. What I mean by passively is it doesn't affect the flow. It just sits there and it gets taken wherever the fluid is going. And the contact cells on the interior wall of the xylem can sense this chemical and if it goes above some concentration. If it goes above some concentration, that triggers some signal. And to try and get some handle on this, I want to take a very simplified view of things and approximate the xylem geometry as just being a circular tube. Of course, it's much more complex than that, but I just want to test the basic idea here and keep the geometry simple. Okay, so if we assume we've got a circular tube filled with, let's say, with water. Filled with, let's say, with water, and there's a flow in it, and then you deposit some chemical into that. Then, how will that chemical get transported? Well, that will predominantly happen via advection, just being carried along with the flow, but also it will tend to diffuse at the same time, although that diffusion will be relatively weak. And that turns out to be a key point in what's coming up. So, here's my very simplified view of things. I've got a circular tube with water. With water flowing along it. It's a radius little A. So the formula here don't matter so much. What we're looking at at the bottom is the classical solution for a fluid motion in a circular tube, which is due to, goes back to Poissier in the 19th century. The key feature that I'd like you to take note of is that the velocity profile depends on the radial distance from the axis of the tube. It depends on a little arm. So as you go. So, as you go, so the velocity is highest on the center line of the tube, as you might expect, and as you go out towards the boundary, it gets smaller and smaller, and then formally at zero at the boundary in accordance with the no-slip condition for a viscous fluid flow. So, U depends on R, and that's important. Okay, let's let little C denote the concentration of this chemical at some point in space at some time T, and we'll try and understand how that gets carried along. And understand how that gets carried along with the flow. Well, if advection and diffusion are controlling how it gets transported, then C will satisfy this partial differential equation here. Again, the mathematics is not perhaps so important if you're not familiar with partial differential equations. Let me just try and highlight what this equation is saying. So the left-hand side is governing advection. That's just saying that the chemical is transported with the fluid. And the right-hand side is the... And the right hand side is the diffusion part. So advection is going in the same direction as the flow, but diffusion is isotropic, that's going out in all directions. And capital D there is the diffusivity of the chemical in question. That will tend to be very, fairly small. Now, the fact that U there, that's the speed of the flow in the tube, depends on R, that's very bad news from a mathematical point of view, because it makes this equation very challenging to try and solve. Challenging to try and solve. So we'll come back to that point. Now, if we just talk about advection and diffusion in isolation momentarily, I think it's helpful to do this. What this sketch here is showing is this is distance away from the tube axis on the vertical axis here. If you look at this little yellow rectangle, that's, I'm imagining a disk of chemical spanning the cross-section of the tube at time t equals naught. Time t equals naught, and that I'm asking the question: what happens to that as the fluid flows in the x-direction along the tube axis? Well, that chemical gets stretched out into this sort of parachute-shaped yellow region here. But the key point is that the fluid particles right at the wall, they have to adhere to this no-slip condition I mentioned a minute ago, so they don't move. So, if the xylem contact cells are detecting chemical concentration at the cell wall, advection is not going to propagate. Vection is not going to propagate the signal because it will be stuck back where it started. To get it to move along the wall, you need diffusion present. So, what does diffusion do? Well, diffusion will spread the chemical evenly along the wall. I've got a little cartoon here to illustrate what diffusion does. If you start out with a sort of witch's hat of chemical concentration, so there's a peak in the center here, and then you let time evolve, then diffusion tends to smear that out and it spreads outwards. Okay, so diffusion. Outwards. Okay, so diffusion would carry the chemical along the wall so that the xylem contact cells could detect it. But the catch with that is that, well, Vodeniev did a calculation looking at transport just under the action of diffusion, and they estimated that to get the speed of signal propagation that matches the variation potential, you need the diffusivity to be of this kind of order of magnitude. So five times 10 to the minus. So five times 10 to the minus two or something. But in reality, in a typical fluid or in the xylem, it's likely to be much smaller, a factor of a thousand or two thousand smaller. So this is out by a lot. So it seems unlikely that diffusion is doing this on its own because there's just too much difference between what you need D to be and what it actually is. Okay, so the problem is advection won't do it. Diffusion can do it, but it's. It, diffusion can do it, but it's far too slow. So, what about if you put the two together? So, that takes us back to our invection diffusion equation I wrote down a minute ago. Now, the problem with that, as I said, is that U depends on R, and that makes this very difficult to try and understand. So that then takes us to an idea put forward by G.I. Taylor in the last century, which is that you make the fact that U depends on R a virtue here. And if you go through an averaging process, you average a An averaging process. You average across the cross-section of the tube. That's what this overbar here is in the next equation. We've averaged over the cross-section of the tube and you make certain assumptions. And I won't elaborate on what they are, but I believe that those will be satisfied under the conditions in the xylem. Then the equation at the top, which is difficult, gets replaced with the one below it. Now, the key differences here is that ur has been replaced by u bar. That's a constant. It's just the cross-sectional average of the velocity. Cross-sectional average of the velocity of the fluid, and d, the diffusivity has been replaced by dE. So, I'll say a little bit more about what that is in a second. But the nice thing about this equation, mathematically, is it's very straightforward to solve. You can knock out the second term on the left-hand side with what's called a Galilean transformation. That just leaves you with the diffusion equation, and you can look up the solution to that in a book. So, it's pretty straightforward. Right, but what is this thing, DE? This is called the effective diffusivity. This is called the effective diffusivity. And Taylor showed if you do all this averaging, then it's related to the original D through this formula that I've put in a box here. And the key point in that formula is the second term, which is inversely proportional to D. So D on the right-hand side is the diffusivity that you'd actually expect to occur in a static fluid, and DE is the effective one that you get when you have shear present in an advection-diffusion combination. Combination. So the second term is inversely proportional to D. So if capital D is very small, that term will be pretty big. So my next slide shows you a graph of DE against D. That's DE on the vertical axis, D on the horizontal axis. And the red dot is where that physical diffusivity is. So I said a minute ago that was roughly 10 to the minus 5. So that's where that red dot is. And corresponding to that diffusivity of 10 to the minus 5. To that diffusivity of 10 to the minus 5. Under Taylor's hypothesis, the effective diffusivity that the chemical would experience is much bigger. So it's on the order of 10 to the minus 3 or so. It's getting closer to being of the size that you need it to be to explain the speed of signal propagation. So if we take that idea forward, just a little bit more mathematics now. So there's that equation from Taylor again. Equation from Taylor again, and then below. What gamma here is if you take everything I've been talking about and you calculate the point on the wall where the concentration is just at threshold. So the threshold is, let's say, sigma. That's some nominal concentration that triggers the ion channels into action. Gamma here is the distance along the wall where that threshold has just been reached, and that will tend to propagate downstream as time evolves. The formula doesn't matter in particular, but if I show you But if I show you, okay, in a minute I'll show you what the graph looks like of that. This is Vadenio's paper where they burnt a wheat. Excuse me. We're about out of time. Yep, I'm just about to finish. I'm literally right on my questions. The black dotted line there is the experimental data from Vedeniev's paper. And the blue line is what you get if you apply Taylor's theory, as I've described, to try and match to this data. Match to this data. The data is a little bit coarse, as you can see, but the blue line is at least encouraging, and it seems to be in the right ballpark. Then, okay, so here are my open questions. The main one is perhaps, does this Rika factor exist? But really, one of the things I would be most interested in is trying to get more experimental data to try and test this idea a little bit more rigidly. Okay, I apologise for going over time, and thank you very much for listening. All right. Thank you, Mark. We have time for one or two questions, perhaps. So I'll start with one. Ewan had one. Go ahead, Ewan. Hi, thank you for an interesting talk. I wonder if you talked about the chemical being used by the cells next to the xylem. So do you have like any boundary conditions for the adduction, the fusion? The fusion term of the chemical being used up as it goes up the xyloid. Ah, so maybe I misspoke. So, no, so the boundary condition I'm assuming here is that the chemical cannot go through the wall, so it's contained within the tube. But I'm assuming that there are some sensor cells that can sense the local concentration. So, the chemical doesn't escape from the tube, it doesn't go out of it, but it does propagate along the wall. And there are some cells that can sense what local concentration is, and then that triggers. What is local concentration, and then that triggers some other mechanism that you need some other model to try and tease out how that works. Okay, thank you. Is there questions by Olivia Lachan? So, Olivia, do you want to unmute and share your question, or we can okay? Yeah, so since you're saying that it's propagated basically by the transport in the xylen, and don't you expect Xylon. And don't you expect that the speed of propagation would be very different in the two directions? Do you mean because there's a prevailing flow in the xylem? Indeed, yes. Yeah, I think that, yeah, that's a very good point. I mean, so, you know, I should be upfront here. This is a very first attempt to try and think about what might be going on here. And absolutely, I've assumed that, I mean, I've just assumed there is a prevailing flow and asked the question. And what I really wanted to do was to try and explain how this signal slows down. Try and explain how this signal slows down. Well, two things. First of all, how it slows down, and this model incidentally does have the signal slowing down with distance. And secondly, to try and understand how diffusion can be involved when the diffusivity is so small in reality, but it needs to be larger. So that's what I was trying to explain. But you're quite right. You might expect the signal to be different in different directions. And maybe it is because, you know, I don't think there's an awful lot of experimental data on this. Would no know the answer for that? This would know the answer for that. Sorry, no, I don't know. I don't know. Okay, so in the interest of time, we're going to break for coffee or whatever beverage you prefer. And let's thank all our speakers from this morning.
