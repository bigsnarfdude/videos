And she will talk about interactions between the three-body problem and the polar problem. So, thank you, Ariela. Thank you very much. Can you hear me? Yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Thank you. So, first of all, thank you very much for the invitation to this very nice conference that should be organized, if I remember well, two years ago, almost two years ago. Almost two years ago, and many thanks to you, Marcel, Susanna, Jacques, and Renato. My talk will be a review of some works that we have been doing by myself and some collaborators who are Kibo Chen, that now is in Sweden. That now is in Sweden, Jerome Da Ken that now is, I think, in Amur, and Sara Diroza now is at the University of Palermo. So my talk will be... Yeah. Okay. So this is the overview of the talk. In the first part, I will review some results concerning the three body. Some results concerning the three-body problem, and especially on the use of canonical coordinates in the three-body problem. In the second part, I will focus on the Euler problem. I call in this way the problem that is usually also referred to as the two-fixed center problem. And especially, I will talk, my attention will be focused. My attention will be focused on the first integral of this problem that I will call Euler integral. And finally, in the third part of the talk, I shall talk about some possibility of existence of motions in the three-body problem that can be regarded as continuations of motions of the Euler problem. In this review, I will also mention the Kepler problem. And so the Hamiltonian that I shall point are those three. The first one that I shall call Kepler-Hamiltonian, well known, this is the Hamiltonian of the two-body problem after you have reduced the invalids by rotation. The second Hamiltonian that I denote with the Hamiltonian that I denote with the J. This is the Hamiltonian of the two fixed center problem. Here you have two masses which are in the space into position plus and minus X prime and one moving particle that can move in R to the three or R to the two. And you look at the motion of these three particles. And finally, I shall look at the Uh I shall look at the most important one, that is the three body problem that all of you know very well. Here you have three masses that interact under gravitation, and all of them are free to move. So the number of degrees of freedom is three, both for K and J, while is nine for the three-body problem. After so, let us consider the three-body problem. This Hamiltonian of the three-body problem is invariant by translation. You see from here when you change each xi with the xi plus a constant vector, the Hamiltonian, and leave the y unvaried, the Hamiltonian remains unvaried. Under it, and so this means that there is a first integral. This is the linear momentum, the total linear momentum. It is possible and it is mandatory to reduce this first integral, otherwise you would have the generic. There are essentially two ways in the literature to do this that are very well known. Are very well known, and I like pretty much the so-called heliocentric rotation, the heliocentric reduction, which consists into fixing one of the three particles, maybe the one with the larger mass, but not necessarily the one with the larger mass, one of them. You fix one of them as the center of your frame and look at the motion of the two. And look at the motion of the two others with respect to the fixed one. You can do this reduction, everyone knows, in a Hamiltonian point of view, and so you reduce the number of degrees of freedom from in R to the three from nine to six, and so you will look only at the motion of two bodies of two bodies with respect to the third. Of two bodies with respect to the third. And you see that if you use the heliocentric reduction or the m centric reduction, where m is one of the mass of the masses, you will have an Hamiltonian which splits in this way. You will have two Kepler terms that are indicated here. Then you would have a term that I That I call the Newtonian potential, which is this minus beta divided at the distance between x and x prime. And finally, you will have a term that has the meaning of centrifugal force that is related to the fact that you have reduced the system to that you are using a non-inertial reference frame, which is this y times y. This y times y prime, this in the literature is indicated as the indirect part. And its main feature is that if you use Kepler maps, if you change coordinates, and for example, you use Delaunay coordinates, this indirect part has a zero average. So it is very, so this change of coordinates is very useful. So I call So I call Kepler maps, maps that act in this way. On the left, you have those are for the three-body problem, let's say, two actions, lambda prime and lambda, two angles, L prime and L, and some rectangular coordinates U and V, which have dimension four plus four in total A. Plus four in total eight. And this map sends from these coordinates to the Cartesian coordinates, y prime y, xi, x prime x, to the initial Cartesian coordinates. And what we ask to these changes of coordinates is that they transform the two Keplerian parts into the Hamiltonian. parts into the Hamiltonian of the three-body problem in the uh in the Keplerian form which is this one minus n times n divided twice the the semi-major axis of the ellipse and they does this does do for both the keplerian parts of the of the hammingtonian so they are this So they are these systems of coordinates are well known, well used in the literature. And the first of example is given by the Delaunay coordinates where the capital lambda is related to the semi-major axis and the same for the capital lambda prime. The small lambda is related. The small lambda is related to the motion of the celestial body on his ellipse. And finally, the U and the V are related to the elements of the ellipse. And those are the inclination, the perihelion argument, small omega, and the capital omega that would be the ascending node longitude. Landing node, longitude, and so on. They are well known. Other examples of Kepler maps exist. And for example, a very important example, very classical, was given by Jacobi and is usually known as the Jacobi reduction of the notes, that is, of the 19th century. In 2011, together with Luigi Keltia, we constructed another set of Kepler maps that we call Of Kepler maps that we call the RPS, regular, planetary, and synclectic. In 2013, I proposed another map which I call the Kepler map in this paper on regular enchaudic dynamics that was defined for three bodies, but next it was also extended for any number of bodies. And I shall describe this later. Grab this later. Finally, another map of this, another Kepler map is the one that I called the reduction of the perihelia and this appeared in a paper by myself of 2018. So if you use any Kepler map, for example, the Delaunay coordinates, let's fix the ideas on the Fix the ideas on the Lonnet coordinates. Use this Kepler map in the three-body problem Hamiltonian, you have this situation that the two Keplerian terms, you have the Hamiltonian that consists in the sum of the two Keplerian terms plus a perturbation. The sum of the two Keplerian terms gives you an unperturbed Hamiltonian, let's say, that has two degrees of. That has two degrees of freedom, and this is related, as everyone knows, to the superintegrability of the Kepler problem. And then you will have a perturbation that has more degrees of freedom than the unperturbable part. It has six degrees of freedom. This is a problem if you want to apply KM theory and so on, because all the theorems that are stable. The theorems that are stated in KM theory or normal form theory need some non-degeneracy condition that is not satisfied in this situation. And besides this problem that is usually called as a proper degeneracy, there is another degeneracy in the three body problem, but in general in the N body problem, that is called the derotational degeneracy. Rotational degeneracy. And this is related to the conservation of the total angular momentum of the system. So, if you consider the angular momenta of two bodies, for example, that are expressed using the elliptic elements in this way. And consider the sum of the two angular momenta. If you have the three-body problem, you have that the three coordinates of the total. Coordinates of the total angular momentum remain constant. And also, what you have is that the perturbing term into the Hamiltonian would depend on the inclination and the ascending nodes only through the length of the total angular momentum. And the length of the total angular momentum will have an expression like this, where C1 and C2 are the lengths of the two. Are the lengths of the two single angular momenta? I1 and I2 are the two inclinations of the bodies, and omega1 and omega2 will be the ascending node. So to deal with the to deal with the so the conservation of the total angular momentum is the origin of Is the origin of this of a stronger degeneracy into the Hamiltonian for which, if you try to apply K-N theory, what you will see, for example, if you try to apply Beak of normal form to average the perturbing function closely to the fixed point given by small eccentricities and zero inclinations. This will be the genetic. What you will have. Be degenerate, what you will have is that you don't see one degree of freedom, so you will have a degeneracy at any order. In order, so this problem can be solved in the case of feedback, as Arnold noticed in his paper of 1963, can be solved using the reduction of the nodes that is a very well-known tool that consists essentially in fixing a reference frame. In fixing a reference frame with the third axis parallel to the total angular momentum and the horizontal plane perpendicular to the total angular momentum. In this way, what you see is that if the motions are not coplanar, you will have the two planes of the orbit that intersect along a line and this line. And this line will give you the directions of the direction of the two ascending nodes of the two bodies. So, what you have is that the difference between the ascending nodes of the two bodies is given by pi and the length of the total angular momentum becomes very easy in this way because when you substitute this difference, omega 1. substitute this difference omega 1 minus omega 2 equal to pi into this formula here, what you have is that the length of the total angular momentum takes this simple expression. So this tells you that the Hamiltonian will depend on the two inclinations only through their sum. And so the Hamiltonian is naturally reduced that the perturbing term is naturally reduced from Is naturally reduced from six to four degrees of freedom and will depend on the two mean anomalies L1 and L2, the two semi-major axes, the two eccentricities, and the two perihelia arguments, omega one and omega two, and in parametrically by the total angular momentum. So, this is well known, very classical, but there is a problem in this kind of reduction because if Kind of reduction because if you use this kind of reduction, what you have is that the planar configuration is singular because when you take C to be equal the sum or the difference of the two angular momenta, you will have that the sinus of the sum of the two inclinations, the sinus depends in this way of the angular momenta. So this consideration Momenta. So these configurations, the planar configurations are singular. This singularity, however, does not appear into the Hamiltonian because, as I say, that the Hamiltonian depends only on the cosinus of the angular momentum. However, it is very annoying. So to deal with this problem, not really for the C-body problem, because here we do not have a real problem, but especially when you add more bodies. You add more bodies together with Ruigi Kietia in 2011. We introduced a new set of coordinates which we call the RPS coordinates. And we gave them the same symbols or very similar symbols as the Poincaré coordinates, but they are on one side similar and on the other side different from the Poincaré coordinates. Side different from the Poincaré coordinates. The similarity relies into the definitions of the main longitude, the small lambda, and the eta index i. They have very similar definitions. The difference is only the way that you define the omega, you change the semi-major axis of reference to define this omega. Reference to define this omega. So the two eta and psi are related to the eta and psi of Poincaré coordinates only through rotations. But the true difference of this set of coordinates is how you define the vertical coordinates, those ones that gives you the A inclinations that are the P and the Q. First of all, here we do not have two couples of P and Q, but just one, P and Q. One, B and Q, because the other is a cyclic, and so it does not appear into the Hamiltonian. And that definition, as you see, is very different from the definition of the P and the Q of the Delaunay coordinates. And those P and Q vanish just in case of planar coordinates, of planar motions. In this slide, I have shown the classical reduction that the classical definition. The classical definition that we have done with the Luigi that consists in regularizing the coplanar configuration when the motions are coplanar and have also the same verse. So the prograde motions. But in a very similar way, it is possible to define a set of coordinates that regularize the The coplanar motions and retrograde motions. So, retrograde motions are also very, very interesting to be studied because there appear instability features that do not appear into the prograde motions. If you use this set of coordinates compared to the Jacobi reduction of the nodes, what you have is that. Note what you have is that your perturbing term now has one degrees of freedom more, five, but keeps a regular for small p and small q equal to zero that consists in regular motions. And moreover, when you take the small p and the small q identical equal to zero, what you get are is the point the planar point coordinates. So this also is very very nice because the planar poincare Very nice because the planopuncare coordinates are very known in the literature. What I would like to describe with certain detail here are the coordinates that I call the previously K. K. I gave this letter in honor of Kepler. And so those are indicated here with those symbols, capital Z, capital C, and theta G, lambda, capital R, and the small letter. And the small letter, zeta, gamma, and so on, and a small pair. And let's say what they are. You fix one reference frame, I, J, and K, and consider we are in the case of three parties, so two planets, two particles, let's say, not necessarily planets. You consider the total angular momentum of the system, the capital Z. The system. The capital Z would be the third component of the total angular momentum. This is a first integral. And the small Z, that is the angle which is conjugated to the capital Z, is the anomaly of this line N1 that is assimilated to the line of the nodes. This S1 is simply the skew product between K and C. We also could take We also could take as Z the anomaly of this dashed line here, but for a historical reason I preferred to define the Z in this way. This step is very important because what happens is that here you have two coordinates, the capital Z and the small Z, which are conjugated and cyclic because they both are first in. Are first integrals. Then the coordinate capital C is also a first integral because it is the length of the total angular momentum. So those three coordinates, Z, C, and small Z, give you the direction of the total angular momentum. I have to mention that this construction appears also in the definition of the pre-coordinate. Definition of the pre-coordinates, of course, which is previous with respect to the k-coordinates because the pre-coordinates are of 1983. But the construction, this construction is pretty the same. Then, once you have done this construction, you will consider a new reference frame which will have as first direction the small n1 that is, as I say, the skew product to be. As I say, this Q product between K and C. And as a third direction, the total angular momentum, those two directions, capital C and N1, are perpendicular one to the other. So you consider a new frame with the first direction, N1, and the direction, the capital C. In this end, the second direction, the one that you have, taking the skew product. In this second reference frame, I will consider. reference frame, I will consider x1, the vector x1, the position of one of the two particles, and y1 that is its velocity. The length of x1 will be the small r the capital R will be the projection of y1 along the radial velocity along x1. Here x1. Here again, you will have another line that I have called the n2, that is the skew product as before, similarly as before of c and x1. And I call small gamma the direction of this line. What is important here is that this small gamma is the angle that is conjugated to the capital C. So as the capital C is a first integral, Is a first integral. This small gamma will not appear into the Hamiltonian. This angle, of course, varies, so this construction rotates around the total angular momentum. This plane rotates. But if the things, if you neglect this small gamma that you will not see into the Hamiltonian, what you say is that you are. You say is that you are reducing the system to a reference frame that rotates where the plane defined by C and X1 rotates. And this small gamma gives you the rotation of this plane. Then you continue in this way and you take another frame as before, that S, the third direction now in the direction of X1 and the first direction in the direction of N2. In the direction of n2 in this way, n2 and x1, n2 in the first and x1 in the third direction. And here you look at the vector c2, the total angular momentum of the second particle. The length of this total angular momentum is called as capital G, that should not be confused with the C, that is the length of the total angular momentum. This capital G is the length of C2. Is the length of C2, so is not a first integral. And capital theta that gives you the direction, the projection, the third component of C2 in this phase, the projection of C2 along the direction of X1. And the small theta will give you the direction of the line N3 and again this provides you the rotation of this plane formed by X1 and C2. What is important here is that those two coordinates, capital theta and small theta, that are defined in general both for the planar and for the spatial problem, those coordinates are well defined also in the case of the planar problem, because when the problem is planar, you have that C2 is perpendicular to X1, because C2 will be parallel or antiparallel. Will be parallel or anti-parallel to C1, which is perpendicular to X1. So those two vectors will be perpendicular. The capital theta will be zero, so it is well defined. And the small theta, according to whether the C2 is parallel or anti-parallel to C1, the small theta will be zero or pi. So the value in the case of planar motions of the small theta will depend on the Theta will depend on the case if you want to consider prograde or retrograde motions. And finally, when you have done this construction, you can continue in this way, you consider the third axis C2 and the first axis N3. In this system, you look at the Keplerian ellipse formed by X2 and Y2. So, as you see, and here you have the capital G, the angular momentum of. The capital G, the angular momentum of C2, the small g that corresponds to that one that before we call it the small omega, and the small L is the mean anomaly of X2. So what I wanted to point out here is that here we have only one couple of capital lambda and small lambda. The capital lambda will be related to the semi-major axis of the planet. Of the planet 2. And here we do not have a Keplerian ellipse for the planet that I have labeled as one. We have only one Keplerian orbit. So those coordinates are sort of delaunner in this step, only for one of the planets. So for this reason, sometimes I call this kind of coordinates as partial k. Coordinates as partial Kepler maps, just to distinguish with by Kepler maps that include also the Delaunay coordinates, where you have two couples of capital lambda and small lambda. When you use these coordinates into the Hamiltonian, you will have a situation like this. The first, you have a first term here that is Keplerian. The second Keplerian The second Keplerian term is this one, and then here you will have the Newtonian term and the indirect part. What is important here is that, in fact, the dependence of the total angular momentum of the other planets from the coordinates is not very easy. This is not a coordinate, it depends on. Corn, yes, it depends on capital theta, small theta, and capital Ng, and parametrically by the total angular momentum. It is not so easy, but also not much complicated. There is a square root of something. It is not complicated. What is nice is that this set of coordinates applies both to planar and to spatial motions with regularity. Regularity. And when you, as I said, when you take capital theta and small theta equal to 0, 0 or 0, you get the planar configurations that can be prograde or retrograde according to how you choose the small theta. The Euler-Hamiltonian is usually written in this way. As I said before, you have, as I said, to fix the particles. say that to fix the particles to fix the masses and minus and plus in two positions x prime and minus x prime and you look at the motion of the y and the x this hamiltonian when you look at it in r to the three has three degrees of freedom in r to the two obviously has two degrees of freedom what is important is that the planar the planar case is not easier than the Is not easier than the special place. But the most important, from my point of view, feature of this Hamiltonian is that it has an integral besides, it has in the space three integrals, in the plane, two integrals. The three integrals are two of them are trivial, one is not trivial. The trivial one are the total. 1i, the total energy, of course, and the projection of the angular momentum of the particle y along the direction x prime. Those are trivial because it is very easy to see that the Hamiltonian is invariant by rotations about x prime. This projection of the angular momentum in the direction of x prime. In the direction of x prime is zero in the case of planar motion. So, in the case of planar motion, you wave one of the two trivial integrals. What is not trivial is this third integral that makes the problem integrable. And this is what I call the Euler integral. It has this expression: the total delta, not total, the angular momentum of Total the angular momentum of the particle squared, the length of the angular momentum, then the inner product x prime times y squared, and then you have this expression. It is often mentioned in the literature that when you consider the limit of the two fixed center problem, when the two centers merge, that means when x prime goes. When x prime goes to zero, what you have, you have only this term, the squared norm of the angular momentum of the particle. Maybe what is not so much mentioned is another limit that gives you the Kepler problem. You can obtain the Kepler problem in two ways from here. From here. Either you let x prime equal to zero and you get the Kepler problem, or you take one of the two masses, for example, n minus or also n plus, one of the two equal to zero. So you obtain the Kettle problem in two ways. If you let x prime to go equal to zero, you see that the Euler integral reduced to the squared norm of the angular momentum. But what happens? Momentum. But what happens if you let one of the two masses equal to zero? To see this, I change a little bit coordinates. I switch, I put the two centers instead then on plus and minus x prime. I put the two centers in zero and x prime so that what you have is that the two fixed center problem. Hamiltonian is really. Hamiltonian is written more specifically as the sum of the Kepler problem that here is called J0 with plus another term that is the Newtonian potential. And when you get m prime equal to zero, you get the Kepler problem. If you do this change of coordinates, you see that up to a constant, the Euler integral. constant the Euler integral becomes in this way and so this tells you what happens when you take m prime equal to zero when you take m prime equal to zero this second term here will disappear and you will have only this zero that is a little more complicated with respect to the g square that we had in the other limit. This is this This is a combination of integrals of the Kepler problem, of course, and has in this form the squared norm of the angular momentum minus the projection of the Runge lens vector, that is the product of the eccentricity times the direction of the perihelion times the mass m, the projection of this vector. Projection of this vector along the direction of x prime. Here, the p is the perihelion direction and the e is the eccentricity. So, if you use, if you this has an influence on the Keplerian potential, because if you look at what happens to the Newtonian potential, sorry, I said Keplerian Newtonian potential. Sorry, I said Kepler Newtonian potential. You take a Kepler map, you express your Newtonian into one Kepler map, the one that you prefer, not necessarily one of them. For example, also the Lone coordinates. You compute the average of the Newtonian potential with respect to the mean anomaly of one of the two bodies, for example L. So this is a simple average and not double average. average and not double average. What you have, and it's very easy to be seen, is that this commutes with zero. This Poisson parenthesis gives you zero. And the proof is very simple and can be written in one page. So for this reason, I have written this here. You write the two fixed center Hamiltonian, as I said, as a sum of J0 plus J1. J0 plus J1. The Euler-Hamiltonian as A0 plus A1 when J1 and E1 vanish when M prime is equal to 0. And as you have that G and E commute, if you take the first order term with respect to M prime, what you have is that this sum is equal to zero. The Poisson parenthesis of G0 with E1 plus the With E1 plus the Poisson parenthesis of G1 with E0. This will be 0. Then you take the average of this identity and you use that J0 when you use a Kepler map has this form minus M plus divided to A. This would depend only on the lambda, the capital lambda. This would be constant divided the lambda square. The square. You take the Poisson parenthesis with L1, but when you compute this Poisson parenthesis, this will give you the derivative of E1 with respect to the small L, because here you have lambda squared times the frequency. And when you take the average, this gives you zero. So as this term vanishes under the average, this also vanishes under the average. But when you Average, but when you take the average of the second term, you just get the Poisson parenthesis of u and zero. So what you get is that the simple average of the Newtonian potential commutes with E0. E0 is the first integral of it. But there is more because if you use the Kepler map. Use the Kepler map that I saved before, that I denoted with K, what you see is that the Newtonian potential depends only on a couple of coordinates, of conjugated coordinates that are the capital G and the small G. Then it depends also on other coordinates, both in the planar and the special case. But it has one degree of freedom. The other coordinates either appear without Coordinates either appear without the action or appear without the angle. There is only one of them. There is only one couple of coordinates or conjugated coordinates. So two functions that have one degree of freedom and moreover commute are a function one of the other. So what you have is that the u depends on this capital G and the small g as a function of zero. function of E0. So what this is what tells you that if you study the dynamics of E0, you have the dynamics of U. And this looked interesting to me because U is very important in the T-body problem. There are many papers in the literature where the features of U, of the some average of the Newtonian p potential are used. Potential are used. So, from this observation, I raised the very natural question whether the motion of E0 could be continued in you, of course, but if they could be continued in the three-body problem. So, let's go with one step at a time. So, if you write about five. I think you have like about five minutes more. Five at what time should I finish Marcel? Like, say at well, here at 11.10. So for you, seven hours more. So it should be okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Yeah, yeah. I shall hurry up. Yeah, sure, sure. Thank you so much. So as I said, the Euler integral has one degree of freedom and Degree of freedom and its expression is this one. In the planar case, this square root does not appear because the capital theta is equal to zero, so this equal to one. And in the planar case, what you have is essentially a pendulum with its phase portraits. So, what we wanted to understand is whether these phase portraits could generate instability in the three-body problem. This is the graphs of the Euler integral in three dimensions when you have in the horizontal capital G and small G and in the vertical direction the small R. We needed those graphs because in the three-body problem the small R moves. If you look at the motion under E0 along the separatries, what you got is that you obtain a very similar motion. You obtain a very similar motion that you have in the pendulum, but the unpleasant new is that the equation of the separatrix, this separatrix, this one along the center in this case and in this case, so that there are three cases according to the value of small delta. And small delta is the ratio between r, that is the length of x prime, and a, that is the semi-major axis of the second body. Body. What you get is that the equation of the separatrix has the meaning of collisions in the free body problem. This makes the Newtonian potential infinite. So those are our questions if it was possible that those motions could be continued in the C-body problem. And at this point, we made some numerical Some numerical investigations. First of all, we consider the case when delta is smaller than two. This is unperturbed. This is what you get when you had the kinetic term of the second body, but this is still unperturbed. If you consider what happens, the three-body problem, what you see is that those graphs is more or less maintained, but you also see You also see chaos. And for example, with Sara, Diruza, and Jerome DeCam, we proved in 2020 the existence of an horseshoe. The proof was essentially, it was not a proof, it was a numerical investigation. We did not use interval arithmetics, but we controlled the errors. Controlled errors. And the proof was based, besides the tools that I have mentioned, on the techniques of the covering relations developed by Jegnitsky and Gitya. I think that I will stop here as my time is going to finish. Thank you, Marcel. Thank you, Gabriela. So, is there any question or remark? Or remark? Well, if not, I have one. So, this is a relation between the two-center problem and the three-body problem. Do you think it could be done also for the restituted planar circular three-body problem? I mean, because to try to analyze cows for the full three-body problem, it's very complicated. It has high dimension. So I was wondering if one could start linking it with a lower dimension. Linking it with a lower-dimensional model in a sense? Yeah, it can be tried with the scrutiny of this some year ago and it can be done, but I think that it would be not much, much easier. I think that it would be difficult, more or less. There would be a similar no, I meant in order to analyze invariant manifolds and whether they intersect always like. Intersect providing the dimension, it always helps. So maybe it would be a good start. It is possible. Thank you, Marcel. So are there other questions? Well, if not, let's thank Gabrielle again and we'll resume in 20 minutes. Thank you. Thank you. Goodbye.
