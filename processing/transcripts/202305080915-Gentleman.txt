This is a lot of work, but you've been great co-creating, communicating. So, thank you so much. So, I'm very excited to open the workshop today. And we will have an amazing talk here from Robert opening the workshop. And we try to organize the days kind of in theme. So today we are going to see an overview of the differentomics and different platforms that people have been using. Platforms that people have been using in computational biology. Tomorrow should be more a computational day. Wednesday, it's more mixomics and combination of different platforms and technologies. And Thursday, it's more database biobanks and how people have been storing information and extracting information available. Now, there are some exceptions to that because of some of participants having. Of some of participants of individuality, but more or less, those are going to be the things. We are going to have a five-minute session of questions and answers at the end of each talk. So if every presenter can leave some time for that, it will be great. But then also at the end of the day, we will have half an hour to discuss talks. And each session will have a discussion, organizing and coordinating that question and answer part as well. With the exception of Wednesday, because of the Of Wednesday, because of the tour, we decided to move the lunch a little bit earlier. So, Wednesday will not have a discussion. Maybe we can resume on Friday with some more discussions of that. Okay. Yeah, and then our title, Computational Biology Meets Data Science. We probably will define what that means. Computational biology already emerged as a Already emerged as a field in between statistics, computer science, and biology. And now we have this new field, data science. Although it might be difficult to say or to define what data science is, we all acknowledge some things that are growing more and more in data science. And I'm thinking of reproducibility, transparency, and storage of big data, new algorithms and big data. New algorithms and being more transparent about the algorithms. So, a lot of things are emerging, and it would be great to hear your work in those areas. So, thank you so much. And with that, I introduce Robert. So, please. Thank you for joining. Uh two are good there. This also not working is it working, yeah, yeah. All right, well, I'll talk hopefully loud enough. Good morning. Um welcome to Oaxaca, and so I'm going to talk. To Oaxaca. And so I'm going to talk a little bit about a couple of things we're doing in my group at Harvard. It's a relatively new center. I joined about three years ago. And since then, I've assembled a really great team. There's about 15 or 16 of us now. And we're pretty much focused more on the sort of operational side of things. We have some research projects, but mostly what we're trying to do is help figure out ways that you can sort of. Ways that you can sort of navigate through these larger and more complicated data sets in ways that sort of free up the analyst to be thinking about the biology and the statistical problems and not so much about, you know, how do I get this big data set to do something and how do I integrate data from multiple sources. And so I'll talk a little bit about a couple of projects that help in both of those directions. I'll talk about spatial transcriptomics and try to About spatial transcriptomics and try to get you a little bit excited about some of the stuff that's out there. I think it really is a fascinating time. I don't think that we'll ever be in a position where, or certainly not for quite some period of time, where we're able to do things like MERFISH on every sample we want. It has a pretty big prep time. You get a lot of information, and that's fantastic, but usually you're going to do that in a relatively smaller number of samples and use that information. Of samples and use that information to inform you about other assays that you can perform in a more high-throughput way. I'll talk a little bit about what's out there. I'll do a little bit of stuff in proteomics. We have quite a bit of activity in that space these days. And then we've been working with other labs at Harvard. And if folks don't know about Bioplex, I'm going to poke you in that direction. It's a nice protein-protein interaction database that can be used to help guide a number of interests. A number of interesting downstream tools. And then I'm going to talk a little bit about ontologies and why they're important for us, whether we do epidemiology, which is the place where I use them the most, but also in computational biology. They're becoming more and more important as we try to understand structured metadata in ways that allow us to reason on that structured metadata. Ontologies typically in computational biology. In computational biology, have been used not as knowledge representation tools, but as a way to sort of apply some labels to things and then say what other things have the same label. And that's not really using most of the power that's there. So we'll try to give you some examples and then I'll sort of go into these sort of large biobank scale data resources where things like UK Biobank, where you have genetics, genomics, imaging on people and FinGen companies. And FinGen companies like Genentech 23Me, most of Pharma have their own internal very large data resources. And you want to be able to go between those resources, mapping across phenotypes, identifying all the phenotypes in particular classes. And those turn out to be very challenging problems, right? If you went to the UK Biobank today and said, tell me all of the diseases, all the phenotypes in that resource that have something to do with an autoimmune disease, you've got To do with an autoimmune disease, you've got quite a lot of work ahead of you, and you'll probably have to find one or two immunologists, preferably trained in England, because their phenotypes will use names that are common in England, not common in the US. And they have to hunt through thousands of things to find the ones they want. And I'll show you how we can sort of make that happen in minutes and seconds rather than and require relatively little expert input than provide you with some ways to do things. Ways to do things. Okay, so what do we do at our center? We basically really try to enable scientific discovery in sometimes a little bit of a cost-effective way, right? If we can do twice as much work in the same period of time, then research gets cheaper and moves faster. Our main focus is on access integration. And then once you've done those things, how do you sort of bring in some of the new machine learning technologies to help aid in interpretation and understanding? In interpretation and understanding. And we've gone through in the last probably five years in biology, in computational biology, a gigantic sort of change, right? So people that do protein folding, alpha fold and its friends have been sort of truly transformational in the discipline. We're seeing large language models like ChatGPT, but others that can be applied strictly to sort of protein sequences, others that are applied more directly to medical. Are applied more directly to medical informatics and to discovery in those places will start to become a dominant technology. They're just sort of too good. They're not perfect. It's lots of fun to make, you know, get chat GPT and others to say silly things. That's not that hard, but the hard part is how do we take those tools and make them help us do better research that goes faster. And then most of the goal is really to help people who aren't necessarily. Really, to help people who aren't necessarily computational biologists be able to work in this space. And so, we try to, as I said before, look at integration. We worry a lot about reproducibility. How do I make sure that the analysis I did today can be redone by somebody else somewhere else and get essentially the same answer? And then, as I said, the real focus for me these days is how do we let people work on pretty complicated problems without having to think very much about the infrastructure. Much about the infrastructure that lies behind that. Because if you have to spend all of your time thinking about, you know, how do I get this file in the right format and up on the screen so I can start to do things, right, that just sort of keeps you from actually doing things because you're spending all your time trying to get there. So onto spatial transcriptomics. There's sort of three types out there that are reasonably common. I'm going to spend all of my time and show you stuff on the Time and show you stuff on the sort of hybridization in situ and point you to some data that we've made available from the Moffett Lab at Harvard. It lets anybody that wants to play with this do so and then try to convince you that there are advantages to these two that don't obtain for the first one. So this one basically, if you want to do one type of spatial transcriptomics, you get a tissue section, you take an image of it. Tissue section, you take an image of it, typically a pretty high-content image, and then you basically put it over some kind of a capture device, right, and dissociate the cells in a way that they fall into different wells in this capture device. Then within the wells, you do single-cell sequence analysis, and then you sort of know that all of the cells in a particular well came from a particular part of the image. And so you get back a reconstruction that looks like this, which is typically fairly highly pixelated. You don't get a one-two. Pixelated, you don't get a one-to-one mapping between a cell that you can see in the image after you segment it and the transcript, you have to infer those things. And then, of course, the dissociation probably does something to things as well. And so that potentially affects the transcript, and it probably doesn't affect it equally for all cell types. So there's all sorts of processing steps that I think we still don't understand. Then there's a different one where, again, in this picture, they sort of don't start with the high content image. To don't start with the high-content image, so you almost always want to start with a high-content image. You probably stained it for certain things. Then there's this rolling amplification sequencing step. The same approach. We take a whole bunch of images. We have to align those images. We get back some data. And I'll show you. And I think this data ends up looking a lot like the Murfisch data. The Murfisch data basically takes advantage of these ISH-type technologies, so in-situ hybridization. Hybridization. We're basically hybridizing directly onto the mRNA in that tissue slice that we have. And then we're using a special technology to figure out where particular RNA is in. And I'll walk you through this one in some detail, but I don't have time to do all of them. And then you get back and rather, sadly, there seems to be a real emphasis on let's get cells or spots and transcripts and go off and try to analyze things and the image sort. Things and the image sort of stays at the side, but we've been looking at images and saying this kind of cell in the image is this kind of cell in the body, right? This is what pathologists have been doing for at least 100 years, and yet somehow we're jettisoning all of that technology and all that knowledge and saying, let's try to do it from the transcript alone, right? And so that's sort of like a kind of a silly approach in general, in my view. Lots of infrastructure. Lots of infrastructure around, so there's a fair amount in the bioconductor world, a variety of authors and Stephanie Hicks and Leo Harada. No, what Torres? I have tools. There's a bunch of shiny and Posit Connect approaches for visualization that are often challenged because the server underneath them isn't sufficient to the. Them isn't sufficient to the size of the images that you need to display. Lots of Python interfaces into here. But typically, if you're going to work on the image data, a laptop or even a desktop is not sufficiently powerful for you to be able to do things. Then there's a whole bunch of different objectives. We'll come to this back to this image in a second when I sort of explain MERFISH, but this is kind of what you get out of it after you've done a certain amount of processing. We get some. Amount of processing, we get some sort of segmentation. That's when we try to identify the boundaries of the cells in the image that we took. And then we get these little pixels that are on or off that are trying to tell us which mRNA is present in which part of the cell. And so you can see from this, and part of the reason why I did wanted to put this one up early, is with something like MERFISH, not only do I know what transcripts are present in the cell, but I know where they are in the cell. So if I do a good job of segmenting, I can start to ask questions. Segmenting, I can start to ask questions not just about what's spatially happening across cells in the image, but I can start to ask what's happening within cells. And there's a pretty good chance that a lot of disease, especially disease that has a strong genetic component, we're going to see very different behaviors within the cell, not just across things. And so it's going to be very interesting to start to study these. So, first problem, not well handled cell segmentation. There are good cell segmentation. There are good self-segmentation tools out there. I'm happy to send the slides to anybody that wants them. Just let me know there's nothing secret here at all. You need to do some kind of segmentation. Then, oh, and I'm not going to talk about it at all, but for Merfish and many of the others, this is actually three-dimensional. We have nine Z layers that basically take us a cell deep in the tissue, right? So microscopy is not just the surface anymore. You can go down fairly far, and other modalities will let you go much deeper. Other modalities will let you go much deeper into the tissue if you want to. And so, Merfish gets you a sort of a stack of things. So, you have problems of addressing. I have to align that stack so that each layer in it is essentially in the same place. And that's very hard because we do some imaging, we do some processing, we image again. At the level of distance in here, those images shift a little bit in between. The microscope is never exactly in the same place. It does, it goes over and takes a whole bunch of images. And it takes a whole bunch of the images. So you have all kinds of artifacts that need to come out. We do the assignment of cells, molecules to cells. We create a cell-by-gene matrix, but as I said, these are actually much richer, as you can all see. And so I don't just want to know what genes are present in the cells. I want to start asking questions about where are they? What's in the nucleus? What's outside the nucleus? What's near the cell membrane, et cetera? Are these things, if we had other images that told me where organelles in the cell are, can I see organized? Cell are. Can I see organization at that level? And the answer is yes, but you have to work hard. We want to look at between cell variation. So there's cell cell signaling. We can see these two are right next to each other. Does that something different happen when cells are right next to each other than when they're far apart? We want to know about cells within an anatomical structure, and I'll show you what I mean by that. We might want to take one of these images and find all of the immune cells, all the NK cells, all the C D4 positive T cells. The CD4 positive T cells and start asking questions about their spatial distribution. Mostly, we want to look at disease versus normal. I'm not a fan. Unfortunately, a bunch of people have started to look at these things and they come up with null hypothesis of spatial homogeneity of gene expression, which is kind of a bizarre null hypothesis to start with. And certainly the statisticians in the room look at that and say, hmm. At that, and say, hmm, facial homogeneity of transcript in a piece of tissue. Well, that would suggest that there's no life present, right? Life requires organization. So now my null hypothesis is that there's no life present. So what does rejecting the null hypothesis tell me? Absolutely nothing interesting. So you shouldn't test hypotheses where the null is something that you would never actually hold, right? A decent null hypothesis in these settings is. Hypothesis in these settings is one probably too simple: there's a difference between disease and normal, right? That's something that I'd like to know. Does this disease tissue look like this normal tissue? But spatial homogeneity is probably not one of the things I would care about. Okay, so how does single cell transcriptomics with MERFISH work? So they basically do what they call optically bar-coded single RNA molecules. The single RNA molecules. So you start by making a library. You have transcripts A, B, C, D, E, F, and G. You look at their sequence. You design these little probes that are anti-that particular, whatever the RNA sequence for A is. In this simple example, I'm going to put three probes on each one. So I find that sequence, I find three places in it that I'm interested in that are close together in some way. And I make these little things. And then I These little things. And then I basically do that the same thing for B and the same thing for C, et cetera. And so I make this whole library. That takes quite a long time. And one of the unfortunate things is then potentially no two MERFISH experiments used the same probes. And hence they didn't probe for the c DNAs that are or the RNAs that are there in the same way. And so then you have a almost per sample batch effect, right? And we're not at the point where all of these libraries are the same. So you have some problems there. You have some problems there. And then basically, you come in and introduce your floors, which these things that anneal to your RNA actually have two little cups on the side. And now you bring in, so they're DNA, which is why this works, because RNA is not stable enough. So you takes a long time to get the DNA to hybridize to the RNA. But now that that's there, you introduce RNA probes that stick to these cups. These are designed not to have any sequence in the Not to have any sequence in the organism you're looking at so that you don't end up having them just stick to the RNA. And then you can introduce them, take an image, release them, introduce another set, release them. So the impact on the tissue you have is smaller than if you were probing the RNA directly, where you'd basically probably degrade it in a few seconds. So we do that for one, and we see this transcript got a one in the first. A one in the first one, a one, this one, a one, and these two didn't show up. And then we just keep going down. So now we're doing our second wash. We introduce a different set of probes. They should find, in the second set of probes, they should find the second one. So if A is present, I should have had a one in the first and a one in the second. So this could be an A, but this couldn't be an A, et cetera, right? And so you just design this so you can find the things you want and they can. They call them error correcting barcodes often in this sort of part of the world, but they're more just barcodes that are separated sufficiently far apart that you don't make mistakes as opposed to actually fixing a mistake. And after you've done that a sufficient number of times, each of these involves an image. Now I see, oh, if I saw a 1, 1, 0, that was an A. So now I go and hunt through that big image and find all the places where there's a single RNA where I'm confident I see a one. RNA where I'm confident I see a one, a one, and a zero. And that's how we take the image down to an RNA. And then that gives me a locus, a point in that big Z plane. Then I come through on the image side, segment it, and now I have the problem of which of those mRNAs are in which cells. That makes sense? Questions, anybody? So it's reasonably straightforward. And then we'll do proteomics in a little bit where they use. Bit where they use antibodies instead, so you're binding to proteins, and it's a very similar process you put them in. Yeah, Rich? I think you can pretty much do it as often as you want, but I don't actually know the answer to how many times, but I think it's like each time you have to, it's hours of machine time to capture one image. So I think it's like five or six times they do it at most. Times they do it at most. Yeah, the tissues fixed. Yeah, well, they were fresh at some point, but they're not formal and fixed, if that's your question. So you don't expect the molecules move? No, no, the molecules won't move. Yeah, there's some fixation done. Yeah. You have to target the, yeah. And you also, so, so another thing, so we'll come to that in a second, I'll show you. So it's, this is an older slide, so we're into the, but already we're into hundreds to tens of thousands. You could do a smaller experiment that went faster if you probed for fewer things. So here's an image. Now you can see it. This is a the full. You can see it. This is the full tissue, and we're seeing just the color here for one RNA. And so, as we see different RNA species that we're asking about, we see them show up. And you can see that some of them are like this. So, now you get into a problem. If I have too many mRNAs in the cell for a particular species, I'm sort of going to get the Manhattan effect, right? I won't be able to see anything because there's so much fluorescence in regions that I can no longer find the single. Regions that I can no longer find the single molecules. So then you have to titrate your probes down or choose different probes so you don't get so much luminescence in some places so that you can get signal from other RNAs that are nearby. So there are definitely challenges. Right. And then this is sort of what I mean. Here's a part of this piece of tissue that's really different than the other parts. So if you wanted to do inference, you might be asking, well, what are the cells in this? Might be asking, well, what do the cells in this part look like? So, can I come in and you know, with some kind of a tool and sort of cut it out, right? Sort of like a laser cheap on-screen laser capture micro dissection and basically ask about all the cells in this green part. And then, this image that I showed you before is just a little piece in there. So, we can look at this at the large-scale resolution, we can dive right into it and look. Resolution, we can dive right into it and look at very fine resolution. And all of these data sets give you some ability to do those kinds of things. And then you can, of course, pull them back out. And in this early experiment, there was about half a million cells. I think Jeff's up to 10 million cells now. And I think in the at around a thousand mRNAs here. Yep. So I suspect if you got stuff in the process of being transcribed, it would, you would, right? Like it just depends on how much of the splicing machinery has a hold of you. You have to have open mRNA to get a hold of, like for your probes to bind to. But it is largely in the nucleus. There's less cytoplasmic. Question? So, it's a collection of the image, the cell segmentations, and all of the transcripts and where they are. So, we've taken this image, we've identified the cells, and we've identified a set of transcripts, and we can tell that this transcript is in this cell, right? So, every in this, if I blew this up, right, this is just a big image, right? And so, in it, there are cells, there are points. There are cells, there are points where I've identified an mRNA, and now I want to understand how does expression of different genes change across the cells that are present. You could, yes, you, right. So, you could have some probes. If you wanted to probe specific things about B cells or T cells, then you design probes for those. And if there are genes that are unique to one cell type, and you'll see this in a second, it's really. And you'll see this in a second, it's really quite amazing. So you just give me a second, I'll show you some slides. Yes? Yes. Because it doesn't use anything about coding. It's just RNA. It's just so you can Yeah. Yep. And there are some interesting things that you can do because you can get long non-coding or even not long non-coding, like any RNA, right? It's up to you to design the probes and understand their distances. All right, so here's mouse gut. So full disclosure, it's hard to get a tissue fixed so that you can label it with merfish, not all tissues. So there's a lot of success with colon. A lot of success with colon, ilium, brain, other tissues. Skin has not been easy, apparently, although there's some obvious things you'd like to do with skin. All right. So basically, Merfish, this slide is just meant to show you that basically it recapitulates expected mRNA abundance. So if I take a piece, a segment of this. Piece a segment of this colon and do bulk RNA-seq on it. Then on this side, we're seeing bulk abundance from a FPKM measure. And on this, we're basically doing the same thing, only using the MERFISH data. And so there's a area here where we don't have very much, where it's fairly flat, but then as abundance goes up, as measured by bulk RNA sequencing, it goes up as measured by MERFICH. So we're measuring essentially a similar thing. A similar thing. And then here is sort of the, for me, at least one of the real action slides. So we're just looking here at these different genes and we're showing where they're expressed in the tissue, right? And so everybody that's done bulk RNA, you don't get any of that information, right? You get sort of grind it up and average out all of these things. You get no spatial information. But once you get spatial information, especially Spatial information, especially from a therapeutic perspective, right? You now get a potential mechanism of action, right? You can learn why my drug doesn't work. Well, it's because my gene is not expressed on this side. It was expressed on that side and the available surface was this side. So how do I get the drug over to where the gene actually is? So, yeah, it's in the tissue. It's probably differentially expressed, but it might not be in a place where you can actually get anything that's close to it. Anything that's close to it. And then again, you see these, and some of these are just trying to, you know, as I said, some of them where you see really high abundance, this will come back to it. Where did you go? Right, where you see these really high abundance things, like you really have to be. Abundance things like you really have to be careful because you're just going to saturate your gene. What? So the first time Jeff came and sat down and told me what he was doing, and then he just ran this movie where he ran through a thousand, like one piece of tissue through a thousand genes continuously. And it was just like, it really is quite transformative. And I think that's why I personally think this is a really good technology. Think this is a really good technology to try to learn as much as we can about, and hopefully, we'll keep going. Carol, like, why do you need all of his work at Shalvi's? Because I like, I remember at least a few years ago, like Jeff is Dust Lab was one of the first few work. Like, is it pretty widespread? So, there's a couple of companies that are putting out fairly early versions of the machine. I don't know how widely spread the, you know, Jeff has his postdocs build the machine. Build the actual microscope, and it's not very expensive. It's in the under $10,000 for you to build a microscope that can produce these things. The big problem is getting the tissue fixed, all of the prep work, designing the probes, right? And so, I mean, my argument is sort of like it's so information rich, it's worth trying to figure out how to do it as well as you can, right? And then you can imagine not just MRFISH, but putting something like. MRFISH, but putting something like SIFSIF or Codex or other things on top of it, right? So now you can probe for protein because often we know more about surface proteins for immune cells than we do about transcript abundance. And we might do a lot better to do, you know, sort of in the RNA-seq world of the sort of site-seq thing, we might do better to have one or two washes of something that's more antibody fluorescent related. But again, you have to design the right probes so they work. Have to design the right probes so they work in the setting that they have. But SISIF is essentially a similar thing. There's lots and lots of this data, so you just basically use this is FFPE data that you use, and then you use antibodies. You introduce a set of antibodies, take an image, you wash them, take another image. The problem with that is when you wash them, you basically often destroy the tissue that underlies the washing. And I'll have a slide that goes into it a little bit more, I think, here in a second. That goes into it a little bit more, I think, here in a sec. Okay, lots of other assays around. I'll talk a little bit. Neural imaging in the brain seems to have a set of problems that are not completely different from what you need for MERFISH, and yet there's very little discussion between that and not a lot of computational biology working with neuroscientists, but they have remarkably similar problems. So, here for folks that haven't seen this, I think this is essentially the same for Codex and a few other things you. A few other things you basically pre-stain to reduce autofluorescence. Basically, you introduce, do some HE staining, and then you basically have your conjugated antibodies. You basically take images. You have to stitch together multiple images to get a layer. You have to assign addresses across layers to, right? You have to move these around a little bit to get them all to line up. And then you basically get the same kind of stack. And now you can do the same segmentation. The same segmentation and analysis of this that you would have done with Murphish. So, there's a, you know, there's sort of an underlying set of tools that we should build over time that are reasonably performant, that can deal with this size of data and give us pretty quickly something that we can look at that has the cells segmented, things assigned to cells with some sort of quantifiable piece. And then, here, just to give you a sense of what they do in the mouse brain. Mouse brain world, which is kind of amazing. You take a little microscope and you stick it on their head. So basically, you take the top of their head off and you skull off and you put this microscope on top and you're imaging. Now, these mice have been genetically engineered so that when their neurons fire, they fluoresce. And so now the mouse is going around doing things, and you're taking. Is going around doing things and you're taking images over time and you're seeing where the fluorescent markers are. So you have the same problem. You have a series of images that you have to basically align because the mouse is moving around and things aren't going to be identical. You have to segment those images to find cells, neurons, which are hard cells to find, but because they're long and thin and right, they go all over the place. And then you have to basically assign fluorescent markers to the cells over a period of time. To the cells over a period of time. And so the underlying pieces are remarkably similar. And out at the end of that, you can then start to understand how your brain works under very complex realistic tasks, or at least how a mouse's brain works under very complex realistic tasks. And there are lots of other experiments. Sometimes the mouse is fixed in an apparatus and things go by in front of it so that they can see how the eyes work, right? They're fixed on, there's a just. They're fixed on. There's just a ton of these kinds of experiments that are being done now. And then this next piece, what time am I supposed to be done at? At 10? All right. Well, I'm going to skip over this. And anybody that wants to know about protein-protein interactions, I'm happy to talk in the intermediate part, but I want to spend a few minutes. Yes, yes, you can't get the tissue section without. And then, where should I go? I should just go back. And then here on just on these slides, so all of there's a number of Merfish data sets that we've put up. So if you just can go to Bioconductor, we've provided tools to get access to them, the image. To get access to them. The image data itself is very large, so it sits in, remember what the repository is called now. But the same here, we've basically wrapped up a bunch of SISIF and MERFISH data, everything that's public, so you can come in and start to access it. And then you can see the tools. We have some public tools that accompany Jeff's lab's papers that let you browse through it and start to see how it works. And hopefully, folks like Hector. And hopefully, folks like Hector will take those and make them even better. All right, so let me go on a little bit to ontologies. Again, just trying to convince you that it's worth your time to think about how ontologies help you out through things. So one of the places where we do lots of stuff is basically trying to understand metapoiesis, right? This is the process by which we start with some kind of a stem cell and we get all the different kinds of immune cells. The different kinds of immune cells that go through the body. And we know a fair bit about the process that we can go through. We have lots of experiments that people are doing of getting bone marrow, which is where this activity all happens. And we have a pre hematopoietic stem cell, a hematopoietic stem cell, a pluripro, something. I never remember what all these things are, but, and some of these. What are all these things, but and some of these states are not very well defined. Some of these states take a long time that cells are in them, some of them are very short. We go in, we take some bone marrow aspirate, we identify all the cells in it, we do some single-cell RNA-seq. This is a place where spatial transcriptomics probably doesn't help you at all. And then you need to put them into these different bins, but you sort of need to know what the path that things could be on actually is so that you can understand. Actually, it is so that you can understand where are they going in that process and be able to. And then for each of those, you want to be able to get hold of what are the biomarkers for different states. So if you knew of biomarkers for this state and this state, you'd like to know if I see cells that look like they're intermediate, does that mean they're transitioning, right? Because these cells are undergoing this start here and produce new immune cells, right? That's sort of we have to produce a whole bunch of new immune cells every single day. So this is this is not a Single day. So, this is not a static thing like tissue in an adult body. It's a very dynamic process. And so, we want to use ontologies to help us do that. As I said, many of you might have been introduced to ontologies through gene ontology, but my guess is that you basically picked some part of that and then you used if you're some kind of gene set enrichment analysis, let these things define your gene sets. These things define your gene sets, but you never used any of the structure that's within that, the way that you can sort of use relationships to map between entities. And so we're trying to build some tools that make that a little bit easier for people to use. We have a piece that sort of works with stuff from HubMap. And so, if you don't know what HubMap is, it's worth having a look at there. Is it's worth having a look at their website if you're going to do anything that has to do with spatial anything. So, HubMap is a program that's looking at normal humans, no disease, and I think no model organisms, and trying to get basically a map from for this part of the body, these are the kinds of cells you should see there. These are the relative abundances of those cells you should see there. These are the anatomical structures you should see in that thing. Structures you should see in that thing. So now, when somebody has a tissue block like a frozen section, they have a tool that lets you register that thing to a particular part of a body. And then you can use that information to start to understand, well, what kind of cells should be there? What biomarkers are there, right? Sadly, the biomarkers are not currently labeled as to whether they're protein, epigenetic, or RNA biomarkers. So you have. RNA biomarker, so you have some work to do to figure out: is it really a fantastic protein biomarker, but it's a terrible RNA biomarker, right? Which the biomarkers? I have no idea, and I'm not entirely sure they do either. I think right now they're basically trying to collect everything that they can collect, right? And so we're trying to put on top of that from. Trying to put on top of that from my group some information that will help us sort of harvest this and then at least ask the question of, okay, here's where my tissue came from. What cell types do I see? Am I correctly identifying things through my sort of single cell analysis? Are the biomarkers that they say present in the cell types that they say the biomarkers should be present in? So you can start to at least get a sense of how, what's the back and forth here. What's the back and forth here? And then ultimately, we would expect that experimentation will inform here and that we'll get better biomarkers, right? And for people that haven't done a lot of single cell, if a gene is present only in this cell type and nowhere else, but it's only present in a small number of copies per cell, it's very, very hard for you to capture it. So those don't turn out to be very good biomarkers for cell type. Rather sadly, transcription factors. Sadly, transcription factors, which are some of the best cell proteins or genes to tell you about the cell type, are things that are typically of very low abundance in RNA. So we sort of don't really get to use them. And that's where I think, as I said earlier, mixing a bit of proteomics with that. So you could sort of basically probe for immune cells on the surface and for other cells, look at really low abundance but highly informative transcription factors could be. Could be. Yeah. Yeah, and we didn't talk at all, like in the Murfish stuff, you could design probes against like exosomes and things like that if you knew how to design a probe against that, right? So you could detect extracellular pieces just through finding something that you knew would bind only to exosomes and then attach a floor to it. And right, it would just be another wash in that whole step. That whole step, which I'm trivializing, like getting the molecular, like the lab work correct is the thing that takes forever. The optimization of that is very hard. And so we have this tool called HubMap Pi from my center that you can use that basically tries to give you some way of saying, hey, I have a cell type. Tell me all the biomarkers for that cell type. Tell me all the cell types in this tissue. Tell me. All the cell types in this tissue, tell me the biomarkers per cell type, etc. So, trying to make that data that they have somewhat more useful from a computational point of view. And we try pretty hard to produce stuff in Python and in R for most of what we do. So, here I'm really going to change gears, but it's one of my fun ones. So, there's a project out there called Open GWAS. Basically, what they've done is they've gone sort of mined the literature for anybody who The literature for anybody who's reported a GWAS observation. And they have then taken that data, created a phenotype. So they describe what... So a GWAS is basically looked across the human genome and found locations where the genotype of a case is different than the genotype of a control for some particular phenotype. So you do it for asthma, like any disease you want. And typically for things like, as I said, for you. For things like, as I said, for UK Biobank, they'll do it for thousands, if not tens of thousands, of phenotypes, right? And so there are just an amazing number of phenotypes. Do you like, you know, spinach or not? It turns out there are genetic variants that will associate with people that like spinach, hair color, eye color, skin color, all of these sorts of things. We get lots of phenotypes and they get associated to these things. So there it is. Lots of luck finding what you want in that. Finding what you want in that because it totally just pulled out of the literature. There's nobody that sat down and said, All these, here's what these phenotypes all mean, right? Anybody that wrote a paper and said, you know, it's asthma as opposed to adult onset asthma, childhood asthma, eosinophilic asthma, right? All of these sorts of specializations. You have no idea what's in there. They just use whatever words they wanted. And so when you go to search that for phenotypes that are interesting. For phenotypes that are interesting, it's not that much fun. And as this is these are slides from Raphael Don Calves and my group. If you search for pancreatitis, you get, I think, six hits. If you search for pancreas disease, which you would think pancreatitis is one of the pancreas diseases, you get absolutely zero hits because all that you're getting from this is a direct text search, right? So pancreas disease is not severe. Pancreas disease is not sufficiently close to pancreatitis for their text matching algorithm to get you that. And so we wanted to fix that. So his group built something called text to term. It takes as input any terms. So it can be phenotypes, it can be whatever you want. And then you designate a set of ontologies. We use a big disease one called EFO, the experimental factor ontology. It's probably the most widely used in this space. In this space, and through some process, we align your terms to the terms in that ontology. We give you a mapping score, and then at the end, you've taken some fraction of these. And I think we map a little over half of the open GWAS terms into the EFO ontology. Some of them we can't map. Somebody could look at them and figure out what the mappings are by hand or give us some guidance on how to improve things. So if you do get interested in using this, we always want to get some feedback. Always want to get some feedback. You can look at the ones that didn't map and say, Hey, you need to use stemming or you need to do something else to get better matches, and we can do that. And this is a web interface that lots of people have been using. And then you can also get a Python package to do that. And I'm just going to jump over that. So, and now, after you do that, now when we search for pancreatitis. We search for pancreatitis. We get a different set of records, and we actually get a new one, which is this thing, autoimmune pancreatitis. And so in that mapping, there's a whole bunch of TL three-letter acronyms that are used. There's a bunch of aliases that are used in that mapping. And so we're able to take those terms and find new variants that we wouldn't have found previously. And then, as I sort of alluded to at the top of the lecture. Top of the lecture, you can now come in and say, Oh, I'm going to go up that hierarchy to the just to the node that says autoimmune disease. And now we can see everything underneath autoimmune disease. And I was going to do a demo, but I think I'm out of time. And then here I'll just show you two things. Yep, I have just enough time for one more rant. Chat GPT, so I challenged him to do something with chat GT. Challenged him to do something with chat GPT one day, and so he came back. This was his, I had everybody in the lab. We had a sort of Friday social drinks thing, and everybody in the lab had to bring a, here's a chat GPT example of something that works better than I thought. And so his was, write a program that uses the OWL Ready2 Python package to list all the classes in the EFO ontology, right? That was the prompt. And back comes a program that actually works. That actually works. Kind of amazing, right? Great, fantastic. Lots of people have pointed this out, whatever, to co-pilot or whatever is out there. Sadly, this is going to destroy computation as we know it, because these things are not actually very good computer programs in general. And now my cluster at Harvard is going to be full of people with really crappy computer programs doing things that run at like a quarter the speed that a At like a quarter of the speed that a moderate one was. So now we have a quarter of the compute capability that we had a month ago. What? We need to, so, so, so what's going to happen eventually is that we have to get much better on our hardware at finding these really bad pieces of code and kicking them off. It might. Can you show you some examples where like even GCC? So this is this bizarre thing that people don't always understand. Even GCC, I can write stuff in a way that the compiler can't optimize because it doesn't understand how to do it. And so often it's the most naive writing of it that lets the compiler take advantage. But, anyways, my point is that. But anyways, my point is that this is in some ways great, but it's actually going to hurt us because there's going to be a lot of really suboptimal code out there. Yeah, just a little. And then, you know, he had one example where Chat GPT lies to you like everybody else has found what term best represents acute bronchiolitis in the experimental factor ontology. Experimental factor ontology, and it says, Well, the one that's best for that is this EFO term right here, which is actually the term for that thing, except in EFO, it's heroin dependence, not acute bronchiolitis. So it looked in there. There's no term in that ontology for that. And so what does it do? Well, it wants to be helpful. So it makes something up for you. And so we're in this world of yes. And so we're in this world of, yes, it's great if you're an expert, if you know to check what it tells you, but if you don't know to check what it tells you, you would be going off potentially using this term, never looking at anything, and doing an analysis thinking you were finding fantastic new results about acute bronchiolitis when, in fact, you were finding well-known results about heroin dependence. Anyways, and I'll stop there because I'm right on tan. If you have any questions, I should put them to couple. I'm also inviting people online to send questions. So if there's any online questions,
