Thank you, organizers too, for inviting me and giving me the opportunity to speak here. Yeah, so I will start motivating my talk with the following picture. Everybody who's worked in TC for a while has probably seen this picture in a few talks. I've used it myself in a few talks. Maybe Mark Grant, my advisor, Robert Dean, was the first one to use it. So this is usually, of course, giving a bit tongue in. Usually, of course, given a bit tongue-in-cheek of the motion planning problem in a comic, but it actually illustrates one problem with TC, which is that this motion is actually not suboptimal for TC, right? There is no condition on TC for the paths to not do something like this, right? They don't have to be along shortest paths. We even have this thing called monoidal TC, where the point doesn't have to move when it, the initial in the final point is the same, we don't move. That is not. We don't move. That is not part of the original TC. That would be monoidal TC. And of course, there was a Sakai conjecture that we don't know if they're the same. But so what I want to suggest is a definition of TC or a variation of it where we do require shortest paths. So that this sort of thing is not an optimal motion. So, first of all, I want to say what a shortest path is. I have to define it. So I'm considering. I have to define it. So I'm considering metric spaces in general, not just Riemannian manifolds. And then the length of a path is given by the following definition. And so it's given by the supremum, which could be infinite too. So basically, the way to think of this is that we take a path and then we subdivide the interval, which the codomain of the path, the domain of the path, and then we The domain of the path, and then we look at all this. The subdivision gives us lots of intermediate stages of the path, lots of sub-paths, sub-segments. And then we look at the distances between the endpoints of that. So in the case of a path in Euclidean space, this is the same as approximating the path by a piecewise linear curve, piecewise linear path. And then we take the length of that piecewise linear path as an approximation for the length of the path. As an approximation for the length of the path, and then we take the limit as for smaller and smaller pieces, right? So we can think of it as we just approximate our path with lots of small rulers, and then we let the rulers become infinite, maybe in the limit, and that's what the supremum can be thought of. And maybe if the path is non-rectifiable, as it's called, the supremum is infinite. But if it's finite, then it gives you a notion of the length of this path. Of the length of this path. And so we say that a path is a shortest path if its length defined in this way is equal to the distance between the endpoints, which it's easy to see is the shortest possible because the trivial partition would give you the distance between the endpoints. And we're taking the supremum over is included in the set, or which would take the supremum. So this is really the shortest a path can be. And when this is the case, we say it's the shortest path. It's the shortest path, okay. And so, sorry. Um, and so, uh, but I, I, I, what I want to introduce, I call geodesic complexity. So it's actually associated with geodesics, which are not exactly the same as short disk paths. There's a small subtle difference there. A geodesic is basically going to be a shortest path along constant with constant speed. So there is a parametrization. There's also a restriction on the parametrization. And the definition is the following. And the definition is the following: the distance between the path at points t and t prime is proportional to the distance between t and t prime with this number lambda, which is the same for all t and t prime. And so we can think of this as the speed, this lambda, and so it's kind of constant speed. And so that this is the shortest path is an easy exercise. You can be shown that the length of such a geodesic has to always equal. So each geodesic has to always equal the distance between the endpoints. And if we put t equal to 0 and t prime equal to 1, we get lambda as the distance between the endpoints. So we can see because all these distances, all these rulers, you can use this formula for every one of the summons in the previous definition for the length. And then so every time all these sums over which we take the supremum are actually equal to the distance between the endpoints. Distance between the endpoints, every one of them. So it's a constant sequence in some sense. So, so yeah, so we can see that a geodesic definers here is itself a shortest path, but it also has this extra requirement on the parametrization that it's constant speed. And so when I say geodesic, I always minimizing geodesic, a shortest path between the endpoints. In differential geometry, usually this is called a minimizing geodesic to distinguish it from a geodesic, which is not a lot. From a geodesic, which is not a shortest path. In general, geodesics are only locally minimizing in different geometry. But here, I think of geodesics as always minimizing. And so I'm following the definition, more or less the definition of Brightson and Heflinger in metric spaces of non-positive curvature, for example. Okay. Oops. All right. So, just a refresher: the free path vibration. So, we know that we've seen in previous talks that a motion planner, a continuous motion planner, is a section of the free path vibration because for every pair of points, it associates a path which goes between them. That's what a motion planner does. And we know that such a continuous section, continuous motion planner, only exists. Continuous motion planner only exists if the space is contractible, and so that's what Michael Farber asked: what is the minimum number of sets we need to decompose x times x, pairs of points in x, such that over each of the sets we have a local section. And so the definition, which is the most common one, which we've seen in previous talks, is to have an open cover here. So x cross x has an open cover, and then over each of the open sets, we can find a section. Sets we can find a section, but there is an equivalent, or at least under in many cases, equivalent definition using locally compact sets, which Farber proved that it's equivalent, if X is an E and R, for example, to define it like this. So this definition of TC is equivalent to the one with open sets when X is an E and R. So in a very general context. So this is the definition of TC I will be using. And then And then, I don't know at least. Okay. So, what I want to do is I'm going to mirror that definition with locally compact sets of GC with the requirement that now all the paths are geodesics. So I define this GX, which consists of the geodesics in the path space, free path space, and then I I and then we restrict the free path vibration to the geodesics. So now we get a map which goes from the geodesics on X to the endpoints. It evaluates it at the endpoints. And this map is not the vibration anymore, which complicates things. So the free path vibration is a vibration, but this map isn't. So some of the techniques cannot be used anymore. But so, yeah, so then we just define the geodesic complexity to be the minimum. Complexity to be the minimum number minus one because we use the we start at zero reduced Tc and reduced GC. So the smallest number minus one of sets which we need at this joint to as a to get a decomposition of x cross x such that there is a local section of the geodesic free path vibration over each of the sets. Okay, so why am I saying geodesic and not shortest paths? And not shortest paths. If I was starting with we want to go along shortest paths. So it turns out that the definition would be the same. So we would get the same number if instead of saying geodesics everywhere, we should just say shortest paths. So it doesn't change anything. So this can be shown by if you have a local section with shortest paths, we can reparametrize the shortest paths to make them constant speed. And this can be done in a way that it maintains the continuity. Maintains the continuity. So, why do I say geodesics? Because it is easier to prove lower bounds when you assume geodesics, because geodesics are more rigid, because they have just one parametrization. And so you can have a better handle on the geodesics. So that's why I'm using geodesics. But it's the same as if you just assume that if you just require them to be shortness paths. Okay, so just by definition, the TC has to be a lower. Definition: the TC has to be a lower bound on the GC because we're just requiring more, we're just putting more requirements on the sections. But in which case are they equal? So if TC and GC are equal, this would mean that the optimal motion planner from the point of view of TC, so just without recurring shortest paths, is already can already be chosen to be geodesic. So it it can be realized with a geodesic motion planner. This is what the equality would would imply. The equality would imply. And there are some cases in which we can already, it was already known in some sense. So, for example, for spheres, Farber proved that it's either one or two, depending on the party of the sphere. And the motion planners Farber gave, I think Pavelic mentioned the motion planners in his talk. The motion planners Farber gave are themselves geodesic. There are long arcs on the spheres. And so, you know, his proof. You know, his proofs already give us the GC of the spheres as well, and it's the same as the Tc of the spheres because Tc is a lower bound, so the lower bounds he gives are can be we can use for G C and then the motion planners give an upper bound. Similarly, so this is a very famous theorem by Farber, Chavosnikov and Jusvinsky, which got many people interested in this field. The Tc of projector spaces is almost always equal to the immersion dimension, which is a very hard to compute and still open. Hard to compute and still open in many cases, number a very classical problem. And so the TC and the immersion I mentioned are, there's a surprising relation between them. And so in the paper they give, they give a motion planner, actually two, and the motion planner can be, oh, Farber Charlhan Jusvinsky, their motion planner can be modified to be geodesic easily. So it's not geodesic, but it can be changed a little bit to make it geodesic. So again, for RPN, So again, for RPN, for all projective spaces, GC and TC are equal. Okay. So we saw that in some cases they're equal, and there's more examples where they're equal. But so when are they different? Are there some cases in which the optimal motion planner can never be geodesic? We always have to have more discontinuity, more sets. More sets to if we require geodesic motion patterns. So there are some examples, and so one of the tricks to find examples like these is to use the following. So we say that a subspace of a metric space is convex for any pairs of points in the subspace Y, so every pair of points X and Y in the subspace Y, the minimal geodesic between these points is entirely within the subspace. Is entirely within the subspace in which the points lay. So there's no minimal geodesics between points in Y which have to leave Y. So if we have such a subspace, then we can get lower bounds for GC. So assuming that it's also locally compact and convex subspace of X, then if we now find, so okay, so maybe I should first explain that the proof. So we say that the Tc of Y is. The Tc of Y is a lower bound for the GC of the big space. So, how does this work? If we have a motion planner, a geodesic motion planner on X, we can restrict it to be a geodesic motion planner on Y because the motions between points in Y have to go along Y. So we can restrict the motion planner to Y because every geodesic from starting and ending at Y has to go through Y. So we can restrict it. And then the TC is always a lower bound for the GC. So the way we can use this now is if we find a The way we can use this now is if we find a subset, convex subspace, which has a very high TC and then X has a low TC, then we get a high upper lower bound for the GC of X, which is higher than the Tc of X is. So this is a okay. So one example which we can picture is just taking the three-sphere and stretching it. So this is an elongated three-sphere and And so, for in this space, the equator is geodesic because between any two points on this two-sphere equator here, it doesn't make sense to leave the two-sphere. It's always shorter to go along it. And so we have a geodesic subspace, and the lemma before gives us this lower bound of the GC of this stretch 3-sphere as being the Tc of the equator. The Tc of the equator, which is two, but we know that the Tc of the three sphere is one because it's odd, and so the Tc of this stretched three sphere is lower than the Gc. So this is using the idea from before, the convex subspace. And using the convex subspace idea again, we can actually prove much more. We can, in general, find we can We can find closed Riemannian manifolds such that the GC and the Tc is arbitrarily far apart by using a similar trick, by constructing them such that they have convex subspaces which have high GC. And even more, we can just take Euclidean space and give it a metric such that as the dimension of Euclidean space increases, the GC goes to infinity. Space increases, the GC goes to infinity. Well, the Tc of any contractible space is zero. So we see that this GC is far from being a homotopy invariant and it's very different from Tc. And it's also very different from efficient TC, this efficient topological complexity, which was introduced by Broaschick and Garaskel a few years ago. And so they introduce it in the same vein as we do. So they also want to move along, they want to be efficient in their motion planning, but because of the way In their margin planning, but because of the way they introduce it by integrating and things like this, the definition ends up being quite different. And they show themselves in their paper that the efficiency C is at most one away from the T C when M is a closed Riemannian manifold. And they don't actually give any examples where it is different. So it might always be equal. I think that it's unknown. So yeah, the efficient GC is pretty different from the GC, and also it's only defined for. The GC, and also it's only defined for Riemannian manifolds, whereas GC is for all metric spaces. So these are very different invariants, even if they're introduced with the same motivation. Okay, so one of the reasons that GC and efficient TC are so different is that GC is very sensitive to this total cut locus, which I'm going to define in a moment, but efficient TC is not. And so the total cut locus is the Is the subset of pairs of points, so x cross x, consisting of all pairs x and y, for which there is more than one geodesic from x to y. And remember, geodesic means minimizing geodesic in this context. So pairs of points for which there's more than one shortest path, basically, between them, we say they're in the total cut locus. So for example, for spheres, the total cat locus consists of pairs of antipodal points. And the cat locus of a point is And the cat logus of a point is we just fix the first point and we look at all the points y such that there is more than one geodesic between x and y. And the cat logus of a point is well known in the literature. I haven't seen anything like the total cat locus before, but if anybody has seen this before, I would be very interested, of course, in knowing where this has been treated before. So I just called it a total cat locus. But so the total cat locus can be thought of as. The total cat locus can be thought of as the union of all the cat loci over all points x. So, the total catalogus is in pairs of points and the cat locus is just in x. That's the difference. Okay, and so the reason the total cat locus is so important is that, for example, this theorem shows how much GC really has to do with the total CAD locus. The total card locus. So, given a locally compact, complete metric space, which is a geodesic space, so geodesic space means that every pair of points is connected by at least one geodesic. And so, assuming that, then we can show that this map evaluating geodesics at their endpoints, this restriction of the free path vibration, has a local section over the whole complement of the total cat logus. So, the complement of the total cat logus is by definition. Complement of the total catalogus is by definition those pairs of points where there is only a unique geodesic between them. And this local section has to just be mapping these pairs of points to the unique geodesic, but there is only one geodesic to map to. So what we actually show in this theorem is that this is continuous, because if you don't make these assumptions, there's actually contra examples. It doesn't have to, the unique geodesic doesn't have to vary continuously. And so one example, so in particular, if under the assumptions here, if the cat locus is empty, if there is no cat locus, there's always a minimum, there's a unique geodesic between any pair of points, then the GC is zero. There's one single motion planning set, which is the whole thing. And we assume this locally compact, so we can take the whole thing as one set. So yeah, so we can interpret this as saying motion planning outside the total cut locus is easy. The total cut locus is easy, you just take the unique thing and it's continuous. But then, motion planning on the cut locus is the hard part because this will give us all the other sets we need to get GC. Okay, so famously, Cohen and Vandenbrook a few years ago finally settled the question of what the TC of the climb bottle is. This was an open question for almost two decades. Decades, and it's very, very hard-proof and impressive result. And so, what we show is just that the GC of the flat clan bottle is equal to the TC of the clam bottle. We assume the flat metric because we have seen that the metric makes a difference. So, we have to say which metric we're using, and that's the easiest one to study. And so, even though the lower bound, So, even though the lower bound would follow from their result, because DC is always curtailed equal to T C, and this will give us the optimal lower bound, we actually show the lower bond directly by studying the total cap locus and basically saying that by how the total cap locus is, it's impossible to find continuous sections, local sections, with only four sets. So, we need at least five sets. Remember, GC is reduced, so this means that we need five sets. That we need five sets. And another thing we do is we give an explicit motion planner with five sets, which hadn't been done before, because we don't need an explicit motion planner for the TC upper bound, because twice dimension just gives the upper bound. So we give an explicit motion planner with five sets, which is along geodesics, of course. And the lower bound, proving it directly, gives a little bit of an idea, more geometric idea of why the previous. Of why the previous attempts to find a motion planner with four sets didn't work out geometrically. Because whenever, you know, in the past, there were a few attempts to have motion planners with four sets to prove that Tc is three, because we knew that the Tc of the clan bottle is either three or four. And finding a motion planner would compute the Tc if you find one with four sets. But it didn't work. And those motion planners were along geodesics, along shortest paths. So maybe the lower bound. Paths. So maybe the lower bound gives a bit of an idea of why that failed, a more geometric one. Okay, and so and also giving the lower bound independently of Tc was very useful for higher climb bottles. So together with Don Davis, we computed the Tc of all higher climb bottles. And the Tc of the higher climb bottles is unknown, except for the regular climb bottle. And it seems like it's very hard, it would be very hard to actually compute it. It would be very hard to actually compute it for the higher climb bottles, the TC. So we compute the GC for all of them. So, what is a higher climb bottle? So, if n is 2, we get the normal climb bottle. And so for higher n, what we do is we take the n torus and then we make this identification here. Maybe one way to think of it is if you, the normal climb bottle, you have a square, and then you identify the opposite edges by identifying two edges. Identifying two edges without doing anything, and then the other two edges we flip before we identify. And so in this case, we identify all the faces perpendicular to the first n minus one axis without flipping, but then along the last dimension, we flip all the other dimensions when we identify along the last axis. So there's one flip where we flip everything around one direction. Around one direction. So, this is the higher climb bottles, and Don introduced them when he was studying the polygon spaces, of which he also computed the Tc in many cases. Yeah, and so we compute that it's 2n. The way we get the lower bounds is again by studying the total cut locus. And in this case, it's much more complicated even than in the Klein bottle. And when you get to higher dimensions, very strange things start happening in the cut locus of higher climb bottles, which we weren't expecting. Locals of higher clam buttons, which we weren't expecting. So, the higher dimensions are, I think, pretty interesting. The sorts of things that start that are really qualitatively different as the dimension increases. For dimension six, there's something that wasn't there at five, and seven is different too. There's some interesting things. Okay. And so we're saying always the flat metric. And this turns out is an important distinction, at least for the toros. So we compare. The torus, so we compute the GC for all flat tori, and we show that is the same as the TC if the torus is flat. But for the two toros, the embedded two toros has a higher GC than the flat two torus. The cut locus of the embedded two torous is way more complicated than the cut locus of the flat two torus. There is a paper, which I cite in my paper, where they actually compute the cut locus of the torus. The cut locus of this. And it's pretty complicated, and that's what makes the GC be a bit higher. And for climb bottles, I'm not sure if the GC of one, I don't know where you would embed the climb bottle, but if you had some embedded climb bottle, I don't know if there's a metric on the climb bottle which makes the GC higher than four. That would be an interesting question, I think. But it is definitely important to specify the metric, as we see here. And so maybe one last example about total cut locals. Example about total cut locus. So when I approached Yaric Kedra at Aberdeen and I asked him, do you know any metric spaces with interesting cut locus, with a strange cut locus? And he suggested to look at the boundary of the cube with a flat metric. So the boundary of the cube is Is homeomorphic to a two-sphere. And so we might call it a flat two-sphere. Don suggested that name. So this flat two-sphere would have some corners. So it's not a smooth manifold, but it's a topological manifold and it's a metric space. I'm going to explain in a moment with a picture. But so what we show is that the GC of this cube boundary. A cube boundary, which is a sphere. So the G C of the sphere with a strange metric is actually higher than the Tc of the sphere. It's one higher, even though the Tc of even sphere is already high. So the trick with elongating wouldn't have worked for even spheres. But so if we make this corners, then we still get a higher PC. Okay. So this is what the cube is. This. So, I'm going to explain the paths in a moment, but so the identifications, the flat means that we just go like this, and then we so the H2 path, for example, ends up here, and then this is just a straight path, a geodesic. So we identify, we just kind of think of this as we just cut it out, and then we put it together and make a cube. And these are, that's how the identifications work. These two phases are identified, this phase is identified with that one, and so on. One and it's flat, and so these paths are all the paths between two opposite faces, between X and Y and opposite faces, which all these paths could be geodesics depending on where the points are, X and Y. So there's 12 potential geodesics, so it's pretty complicated. Even there's paths which go over four faces, integers of four faces. So we have to keep track of the length of these paths. Paths. So we introduce coordinates for the two points on opposite faces, x1, x2, y1, y2. And then we compute the length of all the 12 paths based on these coordinates. And then we get these formulas. These are the length squared. So we can compare the without the square roots. We can compare these things. And there's some common terms when we multiply things out. But it's still pretty complicated. And it's actually, so now to find out which paths are shortest, we would have to compare all the lengths. Have to compare all the lengths and figure out which ones are equal and which ones are shorter than all the others, and yeah. And so, this is actually pretty complicated. And so, I basically gave up on it. And what I did is I just looked at very specific points, which are a little bit symmetric, so that the formula simplify. And that was enough to get the lower bound that shows that the GC is higher than the TC. And so, these are the sorts of points I looked at. Sorts of points I looked at. So we have pairs of points which are on opposite faces, and there will always be on these diagonals, so between the center of the face and the corner, opposite corners, these are opposite corners of the cube. And so y will move on this diagonal and x will move on this diagonal. And then if they are not symmetric, so if y d, this distance, is bigger than xd or the other way around, if they're different. Or the other way around, if they're different, then there's only two geodesics. And these two paths have the same length, the A1 path and the A4 path, which ends up over here. If the distance are the same, so Y and X are at the same distance from the center or from the corner equivalently, then there's four geodesics which have the same length, exactly four. So again, A7 goes up here and then down there, and then A10 comes from here, there, and so on. And if they're on opposite. And if they're on opposite corners, then there is six geodesics. They're all the same length. Okay. So studying these things, studying points like these, which are close to the pair of opposite corners in a neighborhood of the pair of opposite corners, we can see that the catalog is too complicated to motion plan with only three sets. We need at least four sets, it turns out, to motion plan continuously. And yeah, so we study how we approach with x and y from this phase or from that phase or from that phase. And then we see how things come together. And for points like these, the formula simplifies sufficiently that we can show that the geodesics are these and that the same length and so on. So this is how I'm not giving the details, of course, but this is how it works, just to give a bit of an idea. And so finally, another And so finally, another space for which more recently we computed the GC. This was joint work with Don Davis and Mike Harrison. So we compute the GC for ordered conversion spaces on graphs, on some graphs and two points on graphs. But so I think this is an interesting thing to study. And Don is going to talk a little bit more about conversion spaces. Little bit more about configuration spaces in his talk later today. I think this is interesting because configuration spaces are interesting from the robotics point of view because we can think of them, especially on a graph, you can think of them as this automated guide vehicles or robots moving on rails or on roads or something like this. And then they have to avoid each other. So in the compression space of a graph, we have points on the graph which are not allowed to. Points on the graph which are not allowed to coincide, so they have to avoid each other. And on a graph, it's especially difficult sometimes because you have to figure out how to avoid each other and rearrange because on R2, for example, on the plane, you can't just go around each other, but on the graph, maybe you're stuck in some place and it gets a bit complicated. And so, motion planning geodesically on configuration spaces generally and on graphs particularly seems to be pretty difficult when Pretty difficult when motion panners were given before for optimal motion panners for confirmation spaces in the past for TC, they're always pretty far from being geodesic. Maybe this is for convenience, but it seems like it's hard to actually find an optimal motion panner which is also geodesic, also along shortest patterns for configuration spaces. Usually the motion planners involve moving all the points on a line and then rotating and for a graph, the optimal motion planner for a tree is known to be that all the points are Known to be that all the points are moved to a little root somewhere in the tree, which is chosen. We move all the points there, then we rearrange the points to reorder them at the vertex, and then we move all the points into the final position, which is, of course, ridiculously wasteful in the sense of shortest paths, right? So we had to, to compute the GC for the spaces, we had to find geodesic motion banners. Okay, so what we Okay, so what we looked at was ordered to point epsilon configuration space on graphs. Epsilon configuration space means that the points are at distance at least epsilon. And epsilon is greater than zero. We needed this because if we don't assume epsilon, if we don't have this epsilon, then this space is not going to be geodesic with the metrics we put on it. And so if a space is not geodesic, if there is not a geodesic, Geodesic, if there is not a geodesic between two points, then their geodesic complexity is infinity. You just cannot motion pan between those two points geodesically. So we take this as an approximation for the confirmation space, where the points are just, this distance is just required to be non-zero. So it's an approximation because this space, if epsilon is small enough, this space is homotopy equivalent to the usual configuration space of two points. Usual configuration space of two points. So, yeah, so we consider the epsilon for ordered. For unordered, we don't need an epsilon, it turns out. So, we just have two points on the graph which are undistinguishable. So, we model the action which flips them around. So, we think of them as unlabeled, undistinguishable points on the graph, which avoid each other, but there's no epsilon. So, the two metrics we look at are the O1 metric, where At are the L1 metric where we're so let's say we're moving between two points A1, A2 and two points, two other points B1, B2. Then the L1 metric is just the sum of the distance between each of the two points. Whereas in the L2 metric, we have the sum of the squares of the distances and then the square root. And these two metrics have some differences in their what is the shortest path. Their in their what is the shortest path? What is a geodesic? There are some differences there because L2 requires the path to move very simultaneously, like a diagonal on a square, whereas in L1, the path could move one at a time. You could just move the first the particles. Sorry, you could just move the first particle and just leave the other particle fixed if that is possible, and then move the second particle after. And that would still be a geodesic. But in L2, they have to move simultaneously, and then they might collide somewhere, or it's more things. Or it's more things maybe get more complicated. So it's not clear which metric is more natural. So we just use both. And for the unordered, we only use the L1 metric because that allows us to not have an epsilon. So maybe I didn't explain this. Maybe I should explain why the ordered compression space is not geodesic when we don't consider the epsilon. The reason for this is: let's say we have a Y graph, just a graph with Just a graph with one vertex and three edges. Then, and we want to move a particle from one edge to another edge going through the vertex. And then the other, the second particle starts at the vertex and has to end at the vertex too. So the second particle should not move and the first particle has to go through the vertex. Then the second particle has to make space. So it has to move a little bit out of the way. Otherwise, the other particle can't go through. And it could, if we don't consider an absolute It could, if we don't consider an epsilon, it could just move out of the way always less and less. So there's no optimal moving out of the way, there's no geodesic between those configurations. So we need an epsilon so that we say, okay, we just move out of the way epsilon, and then the other path goes through and then we move back. So that's why we need the epsilon. For unordered, this is not a problem, because if you want to moving this particle from here to there through the other particle doesn't make sense, because if they're unlabeled, you would just move the particle at the vertex to the edge. The particle at the vertex to the edge and then from the edge to the vertex. So, an unordered situation, at least for two points, doesn't happen. If you take the L1 metric, with the L2 metric, you still would have points colliding in some instances. So, that's why we only take the L1 metric. So, what we show is this. We have two theorems, one for ordered, one for unordered. For ordered, we only consider star graphs. So, we have a vertex. A star graph is a graph with a single. A star graph is a graph with a single vertex and k edges sticking out of the vertex. And so we consider the order two point absent fresh space on those graphs. And we take both the L1 and the L2 metric. And we see that in both cases, the GC is equal to the TC. So if there's three edges, we have the Y graph, then the GC and the TC are both one. The Tc was computed by Farber. The TC was computed by Farber some time ago. And if there's more than three edges, we have a star graph with more than four edges, then with four or more, then the GC and the TC of two. It doesn't matter which for both metrics. If there was only one edge or two, we would have a an interval and the the G C and the the the C are both infinite because the two points cannot go past each other. The two points cannot go past each other in the order case. So, this is why we don't include k equals 2 or 1. It would just be infinite. For in the unordered case, as I said, we only consider L1, but we also consider every tree. So we don't restrict ourselves to star graphs. We take any tree, and then we don't have an epsilon. So we compute the GC for the another two-point compression space on any tree. And we see that if the tree is an interval, then the GC is. The GC is zero, just like the TC. If the tree is a Y graph, then the GC is one, and otherwise, for all other trees, it's two. And this is the same as for the TC. Okay. So yeah, so I was thinking about how much I should explain about this. I think it wouldn't make sense for me to give all the different sets we compute. Sets we compute because so to give these theorems, we basically what we do is we give motion planners, which are optimal, geodesic motion planners. The lower bounds are given by TC. So we just give upper bounds by motion planning. But this gets pretty complicated. There's many different cases to consider, and you have to think about it for a while to realize that this is really, that it works out. And it takes a while to explain. And I think it won't really be that beneficial if I just went over all the sets and the motions and everything. So I think I'm just gonna so. I think I'm just gonna decided just to give the ideas in the hope that they might be used for other graphs or they might be a good introduction to then read the paper or maybe they can be used in more general context. So some of the ideas, so first of all, to explain the ideas, this is a useful way to think of it. We think of we're going between two points, the square and the circle, to these other two points, the empty square and circle. So these are the initial points. So these are the initial points and these are the final points. We draw them on the same diagram even though they're not really living in the same space in some sense, right? So they could collide, they could coincide because they're in different spaces. We just draw them on the same diagram because that makes it convenient. It's just convenient. And so the geodesic in this case would be that the circle moves up and the square moves across. So this is the geodesic here. So this is an easy case. These intervals, I'm going to talk more about them, these intervals are epsilon, the epsilon distance from Intervals are epsilon, the epsilon distance from the vertex. So we can see how much space has to be made. Okay, so these are the diagrams. Mike made these diagrams for our paper with a nice software. So one of the ideas is to understand a bit better this geodesics is in cases in which emotion is an emotion each part. In the motion, each particle is restricted to an interval inside the graph. So the circle only moves along these two edges, and the square only moves along these two edges. Then the movement of the circle we keep track of as x, and the movement of the square we keep track of as y. And then we have this representation of the initial point, initial configuration, which is here, and the final configuration, which is this empty dot here. We can represent them on the plane. We can represent them on the plane, a product of two intervals. And then there is a forbidden region in the plane, which is the region in which the particles could come too close to each other. So this region is not allowed. And now, because this is an isometry, we just need to find the geodesic in this representation, which is easy, just along, at least for the O2 metric, we just go along diagonals like this. And this would give us the, and this would also give us the length of this path. And this will also give us the length of this path. So, this is how we study the length of these paths by representing them like this. So, this is one of the ideas. Another idea is that there's these bottleneck points. There are the intermediate stages which one can argue a geodesic always has to go through. So, for example, if we want to move the circle here and the square over there, then the circle first has to, one of the two has to move through the vertex eventually. So, let's say the circle. Move through the vertex eventually. So let's say the circle moves through the vertex to go into this edge and then let the square pass. The circle has to go to the vertex eventually and then the square has to make space because otherwise it would be too close. Remember this is epsilon distance. So the square has to make space for the circle to go through, but it wouldn't make sense for the square to make more space than just the necessary. So the square will be here and the circle will be here. So this is a stage which will be. So, this is a stage which will be hit at some point. So, this is this intermediate stage will have to be hit. So, we call it a bottleneck point. So, it's a point through which we have to go eventually in a geodesic. And the trick is we use the diagrams to represent motions where points only move along an interval each, or the particles only move along intervals. And we use the bottlenecks to connect such diagrams. And so every geodesic will be represented. And so, every geodesic will be represented as a concatenation of diagrams with bottlenecks between them. So, this is how we keep track of the geodesics. This was just to give a bit of an idea. And I think this is very interesting, the difference between L1 and L2, I have to finish up, but the difference between L1 and L2 is actually, so there is some interesting difference there. And it's not clear which metric is better. But so, in both of these pairs of configurations, the L1, the no-L1. The no L1 geodesic is an L2 geodesic, and the unique L2 geodesic is not an L1 geodesic. So they're completely disturbed from each other. So, for example, let's look at this point here. It turns out that the L2 geodesic here is given by the square moving through the vertex here and the circle first making space for the square. So the square moves through the vertex first and the circle makes space for it. And then the circle moves into the end position. Into the end position while the square is still moving. So they do it simultaneously in some sense. The squares along here, and then the circles start going down. So they move simultaneously. That's the L2 geodesic. But for L1, that is a wasteful path. In the L1 metric, the circle making space is unnecessary because the circle has to do this anyway. So the circle will first do this, and the square will just wait for the circle to go over here, and then the square will go through after because they can't just move at different rates. After because they can't just move at different rates. A point can wait for the other point. This will not be an L2 geodesic because the circle is moving over here first, and the square has to wait the whole time, and then the square still has to move. That is not L2 geodesic because they're moving at very different rates. So maybe if you want to minimize the total distance traveled, you would use the L1 metric. But if you want to minimize the time it takes for both points to move, maybe you should use the L2 metric. So there's really a O2 metric. So there's really a difference. And the same situation happens here for the Y graph. So O2 and O1 metric, they're a bit different. They give the same GC at the end, but for which motion planner, which metric to use, I'm not sure. And just very briefly, in the unordered case, the inequality comes from a different place than from the ordered. In the ordered case, we have to always rearrange particles, move them around, and that's what the discontinuity, what creates this. What the discontinuity creates discontinuities in the case of unordered, what creates discontinuities is choosing which point to move where, because now in the unordered case, the points are unlabeled. So we go from the two dark squares to the two white squares. And so which point do we move where? So do we move this point here or there, right? We have to choose because it's completely symmetric. And both would give you the same length. So we have to make choices and they have to be. We have to make choices and they have to be continuous. So we number the edges and then we use that to make choices. And it turns out that for any tree, we can reduce it to these five situations because under the L1 metric and unordered configurations, the motions, the geodesic motions between two configurations, two pairs of points, always happen within the convex hull of all four points. So these four points here. Four points. So these four points here are two of them are initial and two are final, but it doesn't matter which are which. So two initial and two final points, like here, four points, the geodesic motion always happens within the convex Hull. And so it always has either a Y graph of one of these two kinds, an X graph, an I graph, or an H graph. And so we just need to motion plant geodesically on these graphs and then keep track of what happens to the geodesic motion planners when one When one of these graphs transitions into another. So, this could become an I-graph if this point moves over there. This is now an I-graph. Or an H-graph could become a Y graph. In this case, a Y1 graph if this moves over there, and so on. They can transition into each other. Okay. And so we reduce it to five cases, and then we keep track of that. And that's how we do it for the unordered case. Order and unordered are pretty different in terms of. Okay, I should stop here. I should stop here. Oh, I think you're muted. You're muted, so thank you very much, David. Is there any question, comments? I have a I have a couple of questions. Yes, sir. Go. Oh, I can't see David anymore. Where is he? Oh, there he is. My first question is about general upper bounds. So, I mean, it seems like there's not going to be an upper bound in terms of dimension of x, because this map from the geodesic path space to x times x is not a vibration. Vibration. But I think you note in your paper that x times x is kind of stratified by the number of shortest paths between pairs. Is there hope that there's an upper bound in terms of the number of strata in this stratification? Or yeah, that's a good question. Yeah, so yeah, I'm also interested in upper bounds because some of the theorems I give, I only Because some of the theorems I give, I only give lower bonds. So finding upper bonds is pretty hard. One has to basically find a geodesic motion planner. Yeah, I'm not sure if there is... That would be very interesting if one could find an upper bound just based on the number of strata. But the question is whether there actually exists a local section over each of the strata. That would be, because I use this strata to give lower bounds, and then because I just study a neighborhood. And then, because I just study a neighborhood and I see how many strata are hitting there. But to give an upper bound, you would have to find, you would have to study the whole thing, and you would have to have a local section over each of the strata. So yeah, so it would be very interesting to get a general upper bound like that. One hope would be to have an upper bound given by some sort of geodesic category of x times x, because the category of x times x is an upper bound for Tc. Is an upper bound for TC, but it's not going to be an upper bound for TC because of some of the examples I gave. But maybe if we instead have a geodesic version of category where all the homotopies, where all the paths, we contract these sets to the point along geodesics always, there is some hope, I guess, that this is an upper bound for GC. But it's not obvious because the usual way one proves that the upper bound. one proves that the upper bound of Tc is category of X cross X the usual the usual way is to basically motion plan to the point and then from the point to the other and this is not geodesic even if the if the two paths we use are along geodesics if that makes sense so the usual upper bound the usual way you prove the category upper bound for TC does not preserve geodesics so yeah so I don't know how one would prove that but that would be very interesting and there's Very interesting, and there's probably not going to be a dimensional upper bond, but anyway, yes, it would be very upper bounds, is a hard problem, I think. Okay. I was also going to ask, you have these funny metrics on Euclidean space for which GC is equal to the dimension. I mean, can you explain? I mean, for example, for the real line, can you get a metric on the real line such that GC? On the real line, such that GC is yeah, it would work on the real line, but it doesn't work. Um, it has to be a bit higher-dimensional, so I guess, yeah, at least that's a good question. What is the lowest dimension which it works? I guess I was thinking of R3. I'm not sure if, yeah, it has to be at least R3. So, no, I guess on R2, it would also work. So, in R2, the example would be. So in R2, the example would be to have a metric where, so we want to make something like this, a circle, we want to make it a convex subspace. So we want to have a metric, we want to take the circle and take a tool or neighborhood of it, and then make the metric, modify the metric so that perpendicular to this circle, it is the distance increases. So maybe we can think of it as we take the plane. Can think of it as we take the plane, we take a surface, and then we maybe raise the circle up or something. So, in some way, that motion planning along the circle is going to be shorter than going outside of the circle. So, it has to be very expensive to move off the circle and then just go like, let's say the direct path in R2 between the two points. That has to be take a long time. So, you might as well go along the circle. I guess, yeah, you could picture it as a surface where the circle is being raised. Where the circle is being raised, I guess. And the same volcano metric. Sorry? Volcano metric. That's a good name, yeah. Volcano metric. Yeah, and so for other Oklahomian spaces, you could do a similar thing. You would get a torus. You would just get a torus and put a torus in there because the Tc of the Taurus grows linearly. We embed a Taurus and then a tubular neighborhood around the Taurus is stretched in the manner. Taurus is stretched in the metric, and so getting off the torus makes no sense. So we just motion along the torus. So, yeah, so we just embed tori and then we make them convex, just like for the stretch three-sphere. That's also embedded tori. Thanks. Okay, thank you. There was some uh Stefan, Stefan, you have a comment, a question? Yes, hi, hi, David. Um, just somewhat um Just some thought. I mean, I'm thinking from the perspective of Riemannian geometry here a lot. And of course, the cut locus can be a very, very complicated set in Riemannian geometry. And there are very few general results. But have you thought about some class of examples? I think there's something that for globally symmetric spaces, you have some nice stratification of cut loci into manifolds and so on. I don't remember the details, but I think there are some particular results. Have you thought about these things or about other? I've seen some of those results, but I have to say, my, yeah, my. Results, but I have to say, my expertise on Riemannian geometry is not very good. And I found it hard to actually make some more general statements about it. Maybe it could help there. That would be good. Yes. You're right that I was pretty surprised how hard it actually is to compute the cat locus. Like, even in the case of an ellipsoid, I think until very recently, it was. It wasn't known what the cat locus was until not that long, a few tech or 20 years ago or something like this. I don't know. So, there are some spaces even which seem pretty simple, like an Alps, where the card locus is very, very hard to compute. That's true. Okay, thanks. That is a problem with GC. Yeah, I imagine. Okay, thank you. Okay, okay. Okay, um okay um uh David, there was a question from Dan Guralnik who has no who does not have a micro.
