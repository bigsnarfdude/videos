With Ian and Peter. You know, I got dragged back kicking and screaming into it with Tom, and mainly having to do with the elliptic case, which he mentioned. And that forced in trying to understand the elliptic case, I went back to look at how Vessio initially studied Garbou integrability and where it all came up. And I'm going to try to talk a bit about that today. Okay, that's the plan. And it has to do with equations of Lie type. Now, There we go. Yeah, so it's always a little tough to talk about equations of lead type just because there is so much known about it that you know you can't really do it justice in a short period. And certainly people that know a lot about it will say, hey, you're missing a lot of the key points. Well, that's probably true. And it's a very well-studied topic. Everybody familiar with that? Raise your hands here. Sort of okay. Well, I'll just give a quick introduction. Um, so this is going to be in the case of the reals, and then later I'm going to take a look at the case of the complexes. So start with an n-dimensional real Lie group, and I'm going to take a basis for the tangent space to the identity. And I'm going to write down the right invariant vector fields. And if I need a bracket on G, I'll use the rights, but I don't really need to use that. So there they are, just push. So there they are, just push forwards. And so there's a basis for the right invariant vector fields on a group. So the equation of Lie type, they start with giving some curve from the reals into smooth curve into tangent space of the identity, which I'll just write in terms of the basis epsilon i here. Okay, does everybody see that? So you start with some prescribed, some curve like that, and then you write down the system of ordinary differential equations for a curve into the group. For a curve into the group, where the tangent vector to the curve at the image point is the push forward of the prescribed curve at the identity. There's a couple of ways to write this. One is you can write it in terms of the right invariant vector fields at the point. And so the tangent vector of the curve is this combination, this t-dependent combination of the right invariant vector. Write invariant vector fields. And, you know, kind of in a matrix form, this is sort of the standard matrix form of it. If you were looking at, you know, say GLN, this would be a map into the inverbal matrices. This would just be some square matrix of smooth coefficients. And then that's the case of a matrix group. And that's an equation of a Lie type. And again, this is the given curve into the Lie algebra. Algebra. So you're trying to solve those differential equations. And if you look for the curve which goes at t equals zero into hits the identity, that's called the fundamental solution. I think possibly everybody's pretty familiar with that. And of course, in matrix case, it's exactly that. Right, so there's a number of ways to think about what these differential equations are. One way is to think of them as being integral curves of a integral curves of a t-dependent vector field on r cross g where r is just as parameter t so you whoops whoa whoa uh right so here you know this is the t dependent vector field and then these would be integral curves of this vector field on r cross g or you know stated in another way that the push forward of partial t becomes this uh vector field on g at the image point so At the image point. So there's quite a few ways you can, you know, I do kind of like it as take this big t vector field. I'm looking for an integral curve of this thing, and I'm going to use t as the parameter. Okay, fair enough. And there's lots of ways to talk about these equations of lead type, but one way is an integral curve of that vector field. That's my sort of preferred way, I would say. Okay, so that would be, so this is a So that would be. So this is a case where I'm talking about a equation of Lie type for a curve into a Lie group G. Okay. If I give you a homogeneous space, so G over G mod H, the right invariant vector fields, and this is why I stuck with the right invariant vector fields at the beginning, they project down to vector fields on the homogeneous space. And this is just the homomorphism from the Lie algebra of G to the Lie algebra. algebra of g to the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of the action of g on g that goes over at the that homomorphism goes over at the level of the the right invariant vector field since we're if we quotient by a right subgroup quotient on the right which is sort of traditional you got to use the right invariant vector fields and those project down okay so this would be the tilde is just the infinitesimal generators that one would have is this uh clear enough okay um i could write down I could write down an example. So, going back to the vector field here, whose integral curves give you an equation of Lie type on the group, you can project that down to a vector field on the homogeneous space where the right invariant vector fields project to these infinitesimal generators. And if an integral curve of this projected vector field on the home Vector field on the homogeneous space, this t-dependent vector field. An integral curve of this, this projected time-dependent vector field on the homogeneous space, is satisfying, well, just that, more or less the same condition that the group case satisfied. Okay, so then that's an equation of lead type on the homogeneous space. And is everybody familiar with the famous Riccati equation? Riccati equation. Yeah, okay. And this would be this would be the Riccati equation. See, I wish I could write on there. I can't write on there. Oop. It'd be the Riccati equation on R. Okay. Anyway, so that's an equation of Lie type on homogeneous space. And you know, you could see, by the way, if I wrote this equation down, or if I wrote this vector field down, I could write up the vector field up on the group that projects down to the vector field. Down to the vector field and the homogeneous space. So, how do you solve these equations of bleed type on a homogeneous space? Well, the integral curve of this vector field through a point M in the homogeneous space, you get it by just multiplying the fundamental solution times the point, and that generates the solution. And in some, and you know, a lot of times one thinks about that as giving you the general solution because it's really a formula for any initial data. Okay, so that's typically how one. Okay, so that's typically how one thinks about how one would solve this equation. And via that viewpoint, there's a lot of stuff known about this having to do with these nonlinear superposition principles, differential invariance, or well, sorry, not differential invariance. What's that? Product action. Joint invariance. Joint invariants play a big role in solving. Role in solving these differential equations and the theory of nonlinear superposition. And that's why, you know, there's tons of articles on that stuff. Okay. Francis probably familiar with that. Pavel wrote a lot on that particular problem, eh? Okay, so anyway, that's the relationship between the equation of Lie type on a homogeneous space and the integral curves for that can be obtained by integrating up on the group. By integrating up on the group, and so there's those two points of view of equations of lead type. Okay, so that gives a general solution. I just want to do, I want to see where these are showing up in the method of moving frames. There's a lot of ways these can be seen, but I just want to do one simple example to see how they show up in the method of moving frames. Okay, so I'm going to just consider the congruence problem for maps from the reels to the reels. Reels to the reals. And I'm going to take an action of a two-dimensional Lie group, solvable. Here it is. You can think of it as a matrix group. It is subgroup of that. And here's the product. And I'm going to look at the action just on the dependent variable u. And here's the prolongation of the action up onto the second jets. Okay. And you know, the differential invariant is really easy to write down. Of course, it's just the Easy to write down. Of course, it's just the quotient of the second derivative by the first, and that's an easy invariant any way you want to try to do this. And this invariant can be used to solve the congruence problem. No problem. Easy. Two curves are congruent or two functions are congruent if and only if they'll have the same invariant. And you know, the reconstruction problem, so this is where equations of lead type are going to come up, is the following. If I give you that invariant, what curves have What curves have this function of x as the invariant? Well, the invariant is just the second derivative divided by the first, and so you just can integrate it out and figure out what the functions look like. So simple enough, very easy to solve the prescribed curvature problem in this example, not having to do with the group being a 2D solvable group. Okay, so there's the solving the prescribed curvature problem. All right, so what happens with if All right, so what happens if you start applying moving frames to this scenario? So here I've got this right action of this two-dimensional solvable group on second jet space. I've got my invariant. Using the map into the group, you can find a diffeomorphism from the jet space to the quotient, or the quotient just being, well, there's no action on X. Here's the differential invariant. And then to the group. And then, of course, this map is just the moving frame map from the J. Just the moving frame map from the jet space into the group. Okay, and I've set this up so that it's right equivariant with respect to the so I have a right action of the G on the jet space and then a right action on the group. And so this turns out to be right equivariant. Pretty easy to check for this example, eh? Yes? Anybody awake? Anybody out there? Good. Right, so the contact system on jet space. The contact system on jet space is, I'm just giving it in terms of vector fields because I knew there was somebody from Norway out there. So I'm going to give these two vector fields. And, you know, the integral curves of these, of course, are just prolongations of maps. What? What? Oh, no, like the joke. Yeah, anyway, so yeah, yes, inside joke over there, eh? Anyways, yeah, so the integral curves of this distribution are very easy. You just give u is a function of x, and then of course, ux is its derivative, and uxx is the second derivative, and the coefficient of uxx, of course, is the third derivative, but you don't really care. Okay, now what if I take that context, those vector fields? Those vector fields or the contact structure, and I rewrite it in terms of the moving frame coordinates. Okay, so here's the push forward. I could do the calculation, but this first vector field is the total derivative. You can see it from that. And then the differential invariant more or less just comes along for a ride as the second derivative. Okay, so now I'm sitting in these so-called moving frame coordinates, which are just the differential invariants across the group. And you say, well, what does a group and you say well what does a what does an integral curve of this thing look like okay well i mean this uh vector field partial k no coefficient you can do whatever you want so you can choose k to be arbitrary but then from the coefficients of the vector field right here i need the derivative of a with respect to x to be this function and the derivative with b respect to x to be a so those are the equations for an integral curve using x as a parameter An integral curve using x as a parameter. And k, of course, can be freely chosen however you want. Okay, so here are the differential equations, and I would claim these are actually of Lie type. Not a surprise. And here the vector fields that are showing up are A partial A, A partial B. You can see them right here. And it's corresponding to this curve through the identity of the group. Okay? Group. Okay. So, yeah. So, if I look at the contact structure, whoops, where'd she go? Right here. So, here's the contact vector fields if you want. Here, all of a sudden, the right invariant vector fields are showing up. I'm trying to write on the screen, but maybe you see a little hand. Oops. So the contact structure can be now rewritten in terms of the right invariant vector fields. Write invariant vector fields. And so this is now looking exactly like the type of vector field I wrote down initially. Can you see this? You guys see what I'm pointing at? Yes. That right here. That would be a vector field exactly like I said for a trying to find an equation of Lie type on a group, except that I need to specify this coordinate right here, which we view as, you know, we saw this as the differential invariant for. This is the differential invariant for this problem, and if you specify that, this becomes exactly one of those types of vector fields. Okay, so finding the integral curves of this is an equation of lead type. And this is definitely how people thought about, well, at least one way moving frames, this stuff shows up. And you can integrate this to find the fundamental solution easy for this equation. Okay? And it just becomes. Okay, and it just becomes via two integrations. So if you specify this k of x, you can find the curve into the group through the identity satisfying the equations of Lie type, and it's right here. Closed form, pretty easy. Okay. Now, one thing one should note here in this, let me back this off. These, the right invariant vector fields are not coming from the action that's used in the congruence problem. Used in the congruence problem. Because the congruence problem was I took an action on the right. And so the generators of that are the left invariant vector fields. So there's a little bit of a switch going on here. And the reason is that this differential operator is invariant under that action, eh? Okay. Anyways, on we go. So what happens? And let me just do a quick homogeneous space situation here. So if I just take this subgroup. Situation here. So, if I just take this subgroup of that two-dimensional solvable group, just the scaling part of it, here's a quotient. Here's a coordinate on the quotient. And so, and then here's the residual action of G on the quotient. And this vector field of Lie type up on the jet space, well, you know, whether you want to think of it as J2 or, you know, sort of the invariance across the group doesn't matter. The invariance across the group doesn't matter. That vector field projects down into the homogeneous space, just as I said, and it gives rise to here's the equation of Lie type. Here's one of the infinitesimal generators, here's the other. And I just write out the coordinate form of that. This is the differential equation of Lie type for that example. Really simple, easy to integrate. And you see the curvature showing up right there, right? Okay, and then the fundamental solution gives you the general solution to. Gives you the general solution to this just by multiplying the fundamental solution by an initial condition and outpops the general solution. Okay, so that's sort of a quick summary of what happens in the case of equations of Lie type in the case of real curves, into the Lie algebra. And let's say a ton is known about that. The only thing that's a little bit different about how sometimes this is presented. How sometimes this is presented, and this is how Vesio was thinking about it: if you go back to the contact distribution right here, it's not quite an equation of lead type until you specify the k as a function of x, okay? All right, so what does this have? Oh, yeah, yeah, Bessio, yeah. So, uh, in this paper in 1937, surin class de faisaux computer. Class de faisaux complete de grade de. How's that, Francis? I think that you're missing a E in the end. Spoken like a true Canadian. Anyway, so Sylvesio was studying a generalization of these lead type systems, okay? And so here's what he did. He said, okay, here's one, which I showed you how these can appear in the method of moving frames. Method of moving frames. He said, Okay, well, and you know, here you're trying to find an integral curve into a Lie group. You know, here you'll specify K. I guess in this case, K would be a function of T. And he said, well, what happens if I try to augment that with a second one? So now I have a surface. I'm going to look for a surface where in one coordinate, I have an equation of Lead type. I have another coordinate with another equation of Lee type. And these things were compatible in the sense that. Compatible in the sense that if I gave you my k as a function of t, my l as a function of s, so you had two of them, then they commuted. So that you could get some kind of an integral surface to this, the sum of these two distributions. Now, what happened was, is that if you, so let's say you take one of these equations of Lee type and then you write down another one, and you want these things to have an integrability property via brackets, you find these things need to commute. You find these things need to commute. And so, what happens is that you find that, so here's your first equation with the rights: that the second one has to have the lefts. Okay. And so what you start to see is the left and the rights. Now, one of the key things in the, you know, he uses all the time is that the left and the right invariant vector fields on a leak group commute. Okay. So this vector field would commute with this vector field. And so even though these are not Frobenius systems. Though these are not Frobenius systems at all, I mean, you know, you don't know what the drive systems is, but they kind of act that way if you specify your differential invariant. Okay, so he would definitely consider this as an equation of Lie type. Consider this as an equation of Lie type. Okay, and they're existing together on a surface. Okay. Or you're looking for now maps from R2 into the group, which are integral manifolds of these two things. Okay. So it was a long grind. I mean, he worked on this. It was a long grind. I mean, he worked on this for quite a few years besides that 1937 paper and eventually found that these were what was lying behind the integration method of Darboux. This was really a grind, pretty tough. But what happens is if you write it just this way, if you have these two distributions like this on a group, you can prove the integral manifolds are. Well, you integrate the first one, you integrate the second one, and you multiply them together. And you multiply them together. And that was it. Okay, so that's actually a pretty easy calculation. If you want to look at the integration of these two systems together on a group, you just have to integrate, say, specify k as a function of t, integrate this one on its own, integrate this one on its own, multiply them together in the group. Okay? So there was some kind of like a superposition principle there at the level of partial differential equations, but the solutions were combinations of a solution. were combinations of solutions of equations of Lie type. Okay, and so the one I just wrote above with that 2D solvable, if you take two copies of that, what you end up with is this hyperbolic system. Okay, so I mean, maybe I should have written a T and an S there, right? Having to do with these two parameters. But you end up with this hyperbolic system of equations, which you can show in this case of the group. Show in this case of the group does become a hyperbolic PDE, system of PDEs. And in this example above that I wrote, this is exactly what the PDEs are. And what happens also is, oops, well, where'd it go? You also show, and this is again a bit of a long story, but these things being dark root integrable have these things called intermediate integrals. And these are the two intermediate integrals that showed up in this case. Okay? This case, okay. So that's kind of what Bessie was doing. I was, I, you know, I haven't read enough of the stuff to get a complete picture of what he was trying to solve because he did a lot of, or a lot of papers on equations of Lee type. You know, Peter, like you were around back then, eh? What was he up to? Do you know? Man who says he won't ski, man who says he won't ski because he's 100. So what equation do you get if you eliminate, say, V from those? Eliminate, say, V from those two equations, pardon me. You can eliminate V from those equations. Which hyperbolic equation do you get? Oh, what do you get there? Yeah, so the second order hyperbolic. Yeah, what are you going to get? UXY is... So you're just going to do it. I can do it. I thought you knew the. No, I don't know if it has any even special name for it. Never mind. Yeah. I mean, it's going to be certainly one in the Certainly, one in the list of Darboux integrable equations. I don't know if it has a particularly nice name. Well, the only thing that's particularly nice about it is that the group is a 2D solvable. And I mean, it's unique in that sense, by the way, that it's the only Darboux integrable equation that's coming from this 2D solvable group. You know, because of that, you can write everything down in closed form and it's easy to work with this particular equation. Okay. So, but in terms of the name, Tom, does it have any name? In terms of the name, Tom, does it have any name? Darbu 5.3 or something? Tom? It probably has a number. Yeah, but I don't know what it is. But it's characterized by this Lie algebra of 2D solvable, which again is not a symmetry of the equation at all. Okay. Mark, quick question on the previous slide. So it's automatic that C1 and C2 are compatible because the lefts and the rights commute, right? That's right. That's right. Okay. Yep. Right, that's right, that's right, okay, exactly. Yeah, and that's that's how he started. I mean, actually, what he did is he said, okay, scratch this thing out, just shove something in there. I don't really care what you shove in there and ask for these things to be compatible. And he said, oh, well, geez, you know, at the end of the day, you know, I probably instead of using like partial A for the coordinates on the group, which is kind of how he started, eh? Just put some coordinates on the group, start bracketing those up. Oh, geez, you know, it would have been smarter if I had just picked the left invariant value. I had just picked the left invariant vector fields here and the rights here, and then express compatibility in those, eh? And off you go. And so, you know, what he really did, and this was the grind, was that he was able to show that for these, he had these two distributions that show up in the hyperbolic case, which he talked about, and he proved that they commute and they had this canonical form. That's what he did. And that was tough. It's kind of not so different than what Ian and I were doing in a What Ian and I were doing. It's somewhat similar. Okay. All right. Well, after that weak attempt at French, so what happened is, as I was studying this with Tom in terms of Darboux integrability, and I was looking back at what Bessio had done, I realized that in order to understand the case of elliptic Darboux integrability, I had to start doing some complex geometry. I had to start doing some complex geometry, which I knew nothing about. And so this is sort of my attempt to construct the theory of equations of Lie type in the setting of complex Lie groups. Okay. Is Emilio out there? Emilio? Okay, good. Then I won't get into too much trouble. Oh, he is. He is. Oh, oops. Okay. Yeah. Okay, yeah, so here is my attempt. I just kind of made this up as I was going, so I mean, it seems to make sense. But so I'm going to start with a complex, an n-dimensional complex Lie group, and I'm going to take a basis for the tangent space at the identity, but these are what are called one-zero vector fields versus partial w bar. So those form a basis for the so-called one-zero vector fields. And from that basis, And from that basis of one-zero vector fields, or just think of them as vectors at the tangent space of the identity, you can push those around to make vector fields on the group just by write multiplication. And these turn out to be holomorphic vector fields of type 1, 0. That is to say, they're just really in terms of the basis partial w, you have the conjugate, and you know, the two of those together form a basis over the reals, if you want, for the tangent space. The tangent space. So, anyways, those are the n complex vector fields on the group and the right invariant. Okay. So, what I did was I said, okay, suppose you have a curve, just like in the case of the reals, from now instead of r, I'm just going to take c into the complexified tangent space of the identity, given this way, where these things are holomorphic. So I'm more or less removing smoothness as a function. As a function of t and asking for it to be holomorphic, then as a function of z. Okay, so I'm looking for a holomorphic curve into the tangent space at the identity. And then the equation of Lie type determined by that is now a curve from, again, this would be R in the real case, but it's a curve from C into the group, which pushes forward the tangent vector partial Z into the right invariant. Into the right invariant vector field. Okay, so this is just asking for a holomorphic curve whose tangent space is this little two-dimensional tangent space here. Okay, and you can write this if it was a if this was a matrix group, you certainly can write that equation this way, where this is just a matrix of holomorphic functions. Okay, so that's all I'm doing is more or less switching out the parameter t for the parameter. Parameter T for the parameter Z or Z. Okay. All right. So again, here you can think of it exactly by going to, oh, that was supposed to be a plot cross, not an O cross. So I can write down a holomorphic vector field on C cross G, not that's not an O times there, sorry. So I can write down this holomorphic vector field on C cross G and then integral. And then integral curves to this. And again, you know, it's not a curve in the sense of a map from the reals, but holomorphic curve. You're looking for holomorphic integral curves of this vector field. And so the push forward, you know, you could write that condition as the push forward is this prescribed vector field, which depends on Z. Okay? So I'll call that equation of Lie type in the complex case. And so, you know, this what happens here is things go over, you know, in terms of groups, you know, nothing particularly surprising happens, but the homogeneous space case, things are different than in the real case, okay? So all I want to do is sort of trace through that, trace through, trace through the previous example where I have replaced the reals by the complexes, okay? See what happens, okay? So here I'm going to take, it's that same. To take, it's that same 2D solvable group, and instead of it being real, I'm just going to take complex, everything complex, okay? And that previous group, by the way, is a real form of this complex group. All right. Anyways, if I just write A here, so A here is a complex number, and I have the partial A derivative, and I take that as these two bases for the ones. These two bases for the one zero vector field. So this is just partial A right here, partial B, no problem. If you push them forward to anywhere on the group, super easy calculation. It's just a partial A, a partial B looking very similar to the real case, except for, of course, these are complex and everything's complex there. So it's a little more complicated. But so now let's see what happens if I take this group and I act on the Take this group and I act on the two jets of holomorphic functions. So, same action I took before, but in this case, I'm thinking of w as a function of z and z bar, but the z bar derivative is zero. So holomorphic functions, and then I have this action on the space of two jets of holomorphic functions, and then I can prolong and I get this more or less the same action. And then, of course, again, the differential invariant is very easy to figure out. It's just the quotient of this derivative. Quotient of this derivative and that derivative, and there's your differential invariant. Same situation, right? Nobody's surprised. What I did in the real case is I mapped, I took the group action, and then I wrote down the moving frame and wrote the jet space as a quotient cross-group using the moving frame. So here's the function, and of course, here's the projection into the quotient. There's no action on. The quotient that there's no action on the Z variable. Here's the differential invariant. And then this was what you could choose for your frame. And this would be right equivariant. So I had a right action on the holomorphic functions. I have a right action on the complex lead group, just by multiplication. This is a holomorphic mapping between these two spaces. And here, rho is the moving frame map. So what happens to the total derivation? So, what happens to the total derivative? The total z derivative? Well, if I write it in these adapted group coordinates, very similar thing happens if you take a look. Here's my right invariant vector fields showing up. And so the whole contact structure becomes very similar, almost identical, except for, you know, I have complex variables here for A and B, and kappa is, of course, also a complex variable. Of course, also a complex variable representing the invariant, the differential invariant of the problem. Okay, so if I take that, let's take a quick look at very similar situation where I have the prescribed invariant problem. So I prescribe the differential invariant as a holomorphic function of z. What are the differential equations for an integral curve of this? Well, they're exactly, well, A is holomorphic and it satisfies this differential equation. This differential equation, B is holomorphic. So I just read off the integral curve condition off this vector field by placing this could be arbitrarily chosen, and that's what the equations become. And so a very similar situation. I can write the contact structure again in terms of these two right invariant vector fields and the differential equations for the flow, excuse me, differential equations for an integral curve of this contact structure. Of this contact structure are these differential equations, which are just an equation of Lie type on the complex Lie group that I wrote down, that two-dimensional solvable complex Lie group, eh? Two complex dimensions. And so these equations are again a Lie type on the group almost identical to what happens over the reals. Took me a while to convince myself that all of this stuff is okay if I switch over to holomorphic functions, eh? Right, so that's looking good. So, if you want to just, oh, was that a question? No. So, prescribing this differential invariant, and if you want to find an integral curve with that or a curve, excuse me, a function, if you want to find this integral curve, then you just have this equation on lead type to do the reconstruction problem for prescribed kappa. And you could do this for lots of other groups. Well, you just stick this one. For lots of other groups, well, I just took this one because it was easy to write everything down. Okay? All right. And you can integrate, you can actually solve those equations of Lie type to get the fundamental solution. And if kappa is entire, you could go over the whole complex numbers and write down those integrals. And so you have a very similar situation to what's happening over the reals for a solvable real Lie group. But I've never, I still have not seen a good. not seen a good there's lots of good studies on on different aspects of equations of lead type over the reals but i have not seen oh i don't know if i've seen any good study of equations of lead type for holomorphic curves even though it's got to be used in in moving frames maybe amelia knows better about that stuff okay all right so all i would like to do now so this is where things get a little weird what happens in the case of a homogeneous What happens in the case of a homogeneous space? Okay, so in the real case, you take an equation of Lie type up on the group, it projects down to a nice equation of Lie type on the quotient. You can go up, you can go down, you can do anything you want. It's all makes a lot of sense. But what's going to happen if we go to a homogeneous space? Okay. Now, this holomorphic vector field I wrote on R cross G, I can project that thing down. But the problem is, is that the is that you know this k mod g might not even be a complex manifold, not even close to a complex manifold. So you kind of got to dispense with the holomorphic problem. Okay, so let's just see what happens in this case. Okay. So here's my here's my subgroup of K. K was the exact same group, but A and B were complex. Okay. I guess I should have had a plus there, but anyways, so the quotient. Anyways, so the quotient here, and I chose it this way. So, this is the quotient from the complex group to the homogeneous space. You know, it's not globally defined, but I chose it this way for a very particular reason. I'll see coming up, eh? But, you know, this is a map from a two-dimensional complex space or four-dimensional real down to a two-dimensional real space. So there it is. And, you know, I can identify that real space with the complex numbers, but the mapping here isn't going to be holomorphic. The mapping here isn't going to be holomorphic mapping. And I, well, I mean, I don't know if there's a complex structure I could put on it to make it that way, but it just is what it is, and you can write it down in terms of the reals. Okay, and so there's a risk, and the residual action of G on the space is just easily calculated. But what I'd like to do is see what happens to the right invariant vector fields. Whoa. So the right invariant vector fields, one was A partial A. That's this one, and it projects. A, that's this one, and it projects down to s partial s in this complex coordinate. And the second one projects down, which was a partial b projects to s squared partial s plus s s bar partial s bar. So it's not a holomorphic vector field on the quotient. It just is what it is. Nothing you can do. But the total vector field, so this total vector field that I have in the Field that I have in the reconstruction problem, the equation of Lie type for the reconstruction problem with a prescribed invariant. It's right here. That total vector field projects down. So these project down to what I showed, these project down to what I showed. And you can still ask yourself about integral manifolds of this. Well, I mean, it's complex vector field, but you can still look at integral manifolds of this. They'll be two-dimensional. And so an integral surface of this is going to. An integral surface of this is going to satisfy just looking at the right-hand side: the z derivative or z derivative of s has to be this coefficient. This is going to, whoops, where is it together? Oh, sorry. These two, this coefficient plus this coefficient. So combining those together, that's what an integral surface is going to satisfy in the z direction. And then in the z bar direction, it's got to have this. It's actually the conjugate of this, but because it's real. Actually, the conjugate of this, but because it's real, it is that. So that's what an integral surface now of this is going to satisfy. And we lose, you know, we lose the ability to talk about holomorphic functions anymore because we've mixed up these vector fields. But what you can look, what this corresponds to, you know, in terms of the vector field upstairs, if you specify this differential invariant as a whole morphic function, this thing is. This thing is integrable as you know in terms of equations of lead type. So this becomes integrable as well if I specify this invariant as a function of z. So if I look at these two differential equations for the surface, compatibility condition, if I assume that this kappa function is a function of zoo is a function of z, if you just calculate the compatibility conditions, no problem again using that kappa as a function. Problem again using that cap as a function of z. Okay, so that's what the equation of lead type projects down to onto these two equations, eh? How am I doing? Okay. And so, you know, this forms a Frobenius system if I specify that holomorphic function, okay? And it could be obtained in a similar manner from the fundamental solution, eh? But another way to think about this is if you're looking at this equation. If you're looking at this equation and you solve for kappa, okay, so what do you get? Solve this thing for kappa. You have, just throw that s over on that side, you have this, here's what kappa would be, okay? So you can split these two equations into this first one, which I'm calling Ben's equation because it's in Ben's thesis, but you know, there's maybe that's not the greatest, but it's a, this is an elliptic first order system of partial differential equations. Partial differential equations. And so if I look at this right here, what it says is that if I just look at the left side of that, if I give you a solution to this equation, which is like a generalization of Cauchy-Riemann, the function I would compute by, what's that noise? This function here, I take a solution to this equation, I plug it into here, that will be a holomorphic function. Okay? Okay, so this plays the role of what's called an intermediate integral for this differential equation. So, the theory of intermediate integrals is really very closely tied to the notion of Darboux integrability. And so you can see how the curvature, well, I'm going to call it curvature, but the differential invariant in the equation of Lie type produces this intermediate integral. Intermediate integral. And this is sort of typical of how Darboux integral equations work. Okay, so for every solution that's sort of the key to this equation, this is a holomorphic function. Okay, and so this differential equation, which if I write it out as two real equations, it's just, you know, this is, if it was zero, it'd be Cauchy Riemann, but there's one real side of it. So it's this equation. This equation is. Equation. This equation is Darboux integrable in the sense it has an intermediate integral, which is this nasty thing. I didn't write it out because it was kind of long and I don't think it really makes really helps very much. But in terms of this, another way one thinks about this whole thing is that these two equations, if I give you these two equations, they're obtained as a quotient of an equation of Lie type. Okay, so they are an equation of Lie type for. Are an equation of Lie type for where's my thing there, right? Yeah, so I should have written it, I guess. Oh, yeah, here it is, right? So, you know, it's coming from here's the partial. Oh, I didn't write it out. I should have wrote my Z1 here and my Z2. So, in this equation of Lie type on this homogeneous space, just as in the real case, okay, for this projected vector field, right? So, anyway, this gives Anyway, this gives there's sort of two ways then to think about this: is this these Darboux integral equations? Okay, if I went back to the first set of coordinates, the non-group coordinates, and I traced this through, it would give me a closed form solution to this Benn equation in terms of jets. Okay, so that's one way one thinks about it. And the second is if you prescribe the intermediate integral. The intermediate integral that the system together is an equation of Lie type. And so there's a lifting to, you know, equation of Li type on a group like I showed. So this is what Bessio was doing for sure. I don't know, I don't, I never saw him really try to deal with the elliptic case. He never really made much of a distinction in that. Mainly worked with the hyperbolics. Uh, mainly worked with the hyperbolic, as far as I could tell. It was a little hard to say in his analysis. Okay, but, anyways, with respect to what Tom was saying in his talk there, oh, there we go, that what we found is that these are these are coming up as equations of Lie type where I have a complex Lie group and I'm moduloing out by a real form. It almost goes the other way. You take a real Lee group, form a complex Lee group, shove the real one in, and you know. Real one in a natural way. And then it's an equation of Lie type on that homogeneous space of a Lie group modulo, a real form, a complex Lie group modulo real. So I think that is all I have to say. So that is equations of Lie type and how they occur, of course, in the reconstruction problem for moving frames, lots of different ways, but they're also showing up in these Darboux integrable equations. And a lot of that goes back to work that Ben. And a lot of that goes back to work that Bessia was doing. So, all right. Any questions? Questions? Mark, on your previous slide, this is Tom. Let me put it on there. Sure, if you wouldn't mind sharing screen again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This one? We're not seeing it yet. Oh, I didn't share. Yeah. Okay. Stop the share. Okay. There we go. Go to the big screen. Okay. Yep, there we go. Right. Actually, one slide back from that. So this vector field. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, this vector field on Thank you. Yeah, this vector field on the homogeneous space to be an integral across the complexes to be integral surface of that. I guess I'm not sure where you're getting d, but dz bar of s is ss is s. Yeah, this is right. So it's a little bit of just an identity. You know, what's the push forward of partial z? Right. So it's just that coefficient, right? This is actually, you know, partial. Know partial S bar partial Z, but there's a little identity, so you can trade this off to get this piece of it. All right, all right, not sure about that, but I have to think. Okay, yeah, I had to calculate it myself as a little that, and this is partly because I know so Zippo about complex geometry, but right now I have a related question, just I think it's the Related question, just I think it's the previous slide you divided by b bar minus b, right? Oh, so that's just uh that's just an you know, I was trying to write down this this homogeneous space. So if I take a if I look at the action of this group on, I wish I had a pen, this is a subgroup of the group where A and B are complex, right? And so this is just the quotient, this is just the This is just the quotient. This is just the invariant under that action on the right side, eh? Why is it not A divided by B? Just like before? Well, this is a real. This is real. Oh, B is. Yeah, B is real. Yeah. Yeah. So it only acts. This is the real subgroup of the first place. Yes, correct. Okay, correct. That passed by me. I just thought those R's were sneaky. Yeah, sneaky, eh? Yeah, sneaky, sneaky, yeah. Yeah, so it just translates the real part of the B coordinate. So I need the imaginary part. And I just, I wrote, you know, I could have put m B in there if I wanted to, I guess. So the imaginary part of B is going to scale under this action, but not the real, well, the real part will too, but the real part translates, but not the complex part. And that's where your SS bar comes from? More or less? Yeah, but you know, I mean, this is just some kind of somewhat somewhat arbitrary choice of complex structure on the quotient, right? I mean, there's no natural reason why I have to do this, right? So, but I mean, it's certainly an invariant. You know, it's an R2 valued invariant on K. You know, you can think of it, it's, I mean, it would have been smarter to flip it upside down, right? Because A is not allowed to be zero in this. Is not allowed to be zero in this, but then it doesn't match up with the Benn equation. I mean, it's very similar, it's very close, but it's not exactly the Benn equation. And I kind of wanted to match it up with, you know, other list of Darboux integrable equations, right? So, you know, I could take wherever that weird thing is here, I could take this equation and just, you know, let W be one over S and rewrite it, but then it doesn't match up with what was in his thesis and other places, eh? And other places, eh? But you know, it's a global coordinate on the quotient if I flip it upside down. Are you okay with that, Peter? Yeah, yes. I probably should have written out the action. No, that's okay. No, no, no, no, no, I understand. Okay. Yeah, sneaky. Anyways, you know, you can get the complete or the general solution from the equation of Li-type via this action on the quotient as well. Quotient as well. So they behave really similarly. I just didn't write it out, but it's very similar to what I wrote out in the real case. You can either express the solution in a closed form. So there's two ways to express the solution. Either it's a closed form in terms of jets of holomorphic functions and maybe reals and moving it around, or you express it as a solution to equation of Lie type where you prescribe the invariance. Type where you prescribe the invariance. That's the two ways these things, you know, these solutions expressed. It's the same with the hyperbolic case, too, eh? You know, if you look at Liouville equation, eh? There's, I wish I maybe I could pull something up to write with. Well, I'm probably going over time, eh? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Louisville, there's two ways to think about it. You know, either you have that closed form log of f prime g prime over, or Prime over, or you express it as a system where you write down the intermediate integrals equal, and it's some kind of Frobenius system, which turns out equating to be equation of Lie type. So, yeah, that's it. Mark, huh? Mark, listen. So, you are mostly working in the holomorphic setting for this equation of Li-type. Pardon me? You are mostly. Pardon me, you are mostly working in the olomorphic, yes, yes, yeah. Well, hey, I mean, I would ask you that. I mean, so this is part of the problem. I don't really, I've not really seen it in the complex setting at all. Yeah, but I was wondering what's going on if you have something meromorphic around a singularity. Oh, never tried. Can you have some particular type of Particular type of this equation, if you can control? Good question. And I have no idea. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Like I say, I want to try to find a reference on this because there's only a thousand references and books on equations of Lee type over the reals. Okay. Yeah. You know, like I think Spain, there's just stuff coming out of there all the time on that. But in terms of And but in terms of the complexes and holomorphic equations, and then you know, there's something funny going on on the homogeneous space because nothing's holomorphic anymore, because it might not even be a complex, you know, could be odd dimensional, who knows, right? And so, you know, the whole theory is a little bit unclear to me, except for the fact in a very special case where you take this real form, you get one of these Darboux integrable equations. So, but in terms of like any other Any other restrictions? I don't know. I don't know. I sent you a confused story. So, when we said one-dimensional, talk about real dimension. But if you go in holomorphic category, then you just talk about physical dimensions, right? And that's usual promotion, then everything is just directly goes through. Well, I mean, so it goes through for sure that, you know, you've got this holomorphic vector. You've got this holomorphic vector field, it projects down to some complex vector field on the quotient, and it has nice integrability properties and everything. But it's not a holomorphic vector field or anything anymore. And so the differential equations are more or less just a Frobenius system in a sense, once you specify the invariant. So that's true. And I mean, you know, that's true. Well, real, you know, Frobenius doesn't mean that much, but they. That much, but you know, the equation of Lee type up on the group is a Frobenius system, but you know, one of the good types of Frobenius systems. Okay, so anyway, but yeah, I mean, it goes through, but you do lose some, you know, the holomorphic setting kind of disappears, eh? But it's also weird that you get these Darboux interval equations. In this particular case, we've taken the real form, eh? Well, thank you very much, Mark. I think we'll stop here since we're a little bit over time. Isn't there somebody behind me there? There is. Oh, sorry. Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
