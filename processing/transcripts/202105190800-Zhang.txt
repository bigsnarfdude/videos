Okay. So it's a pleasure for me to introduce Sidi Zang from the University of Notre Dame. And the title of his talk is Conformally Invariant Rigidity Theorems on Four Manifolds with Boundary. Please. Thanks for the introduction. I wish to thank the organizers for inviting me to give the talk here. Inviting me to give the talk here. And actually, today I'm going to talk about the conformally invariant rigidity theorems on four manifolds with boundary. Actually, the work is inspired by the corresponding work on four manifolds without boundaries, the closed four manifolds. Okay, let me start by establishing the notations I want to use for my talk. So in my talk, I will always assume that I have I will always assume that I have an oriented connected compact Riemannian format for this boundary. And I always denote my boundary by Ïƒ3. 3 stands for dimension. And I denote by L and H the second fundamental form and the mean curvature of the boundary respectively. Note that I only assume the manifold M, the ambient manifold is connected. So from this definition, my boundary. From this definition, my boundary can be disconnected. It can have more than one connected component. So, I want to define the first Yamabian variant in this way. I need to mention that actually in Professor Moso's talk, she defined the so-called, in my convention, the second Yamabian variant. The subtle difference is that here I assume the ambient manifold is having unit volume, and in a her talk, according to And in her talk, according to my understanding, that the restriction is that the boundary is having the unit area. Okay, so actually, this Yamabian variant can be defined for any smooth manifold with boundary, Romanian manifold with boundary. Here, I will just focus on the four-dimensional or the three-plus one-dimensional case. By the work of S-Cobar, we know that the first MRB invariant in four-dimension is always a The four-dimensional is always achieved by a metric which I call the Yamabi metric, maybe the S-Co-Bay Yamabi metric with constant scalar curvature and minimal boundary. Okay, this is again in contrast with the result in Professor Musa's talk. So in her talk, the Yamabi metric means the zero scalar curvature and CMC boundary. Here, I'm considering the constant scalar curvature and the minimal boundary, which means that the boundary. Boundary, which means that the boundary has mean curvature zero. If, in addition, the boundary is umbelic, then the boundary is totally geodesic. So, in my convention, umbelic means that the trees-free part of the second holy man form is vanishing. Okay, okay, now let me introduce some more conformally invariants on four-manifolds with boundary. It turns out that many conformally It turns out that many conformal invariants arise from the study of the Chen Gauss-Bernay formula in four dimensions, which has a very compact form. So in higher dimensions, we also have the Cheng Gauss-Bernay formula, but the formula turns out to be much more complex, and more items will appear in the formula. So here in the formula, the left-hand side, chi is the older number, which is a topological invariant, and on the right-hand side, I have... And on the right-hand side, I have two items. The first item is the wild curvature, the outer norm of the well curvature. And we know that if we consider the differential four form, wow square dv, this is actually a pointwise conformal invariant in four dimensions. And we are also having this last item. I grouped them together. So this is actually the integral on the manifold. This is the integral on the boundary. And here, Boundary. And here again, my PG is the Schaalton tensor as defined in the talk by Professor Yi Wang. And actually, here I'm abusing the notation a little bit. So technically speaking, I should use G inverse P, so which will make the tensor 1, 1. Here, my PG is actually a 2, 0 tensor. And sigma 2 again means that I'm applying the second elementary symmetric polynomial to the eigenvalues. Polynomial to the eigenvalues of the one-man tensor here. And this is actually just the standard sigma 2 curvature on the four manifold. Here is the boundary item. So this is quite complex at the first glance. Let me first explain the notations here. My IJK, the Latin letters, will run from 1 to 3, and they denote the tangential directions of the boundary. And the 0, the 0. And the zero means the normal direction of the boundary. And again, my H and L will be the mean curvature in the second fundamental form. This trish cubic means the contracted cubic power of the L, like L ij, L J K L I K. So you contract them together. So this curvature term B is complex. However, let's look at the special case when you are bounding. Special case when your boundary, when our boundary is totally geodesic, when our second fundamental form is vanishing, it is clear that this B will be vanishing. And we are reducing the formula back to the standard Chengao-Spani formula on closed formats. Okay, so you can consider this is actually the additional part for the boundary. So as I mentioned, the left-hand side is actually a topological invariant. The first item, the integral, is a First item, the integral is a conformal invariant, which means that the term left here is also conformal invariant. And I also mentioned that when the boundary is totally geodesic, I will only have the integral of sigma 2, which means that this energy E can be viewed as a generalization of the total sigma 2 curvature. Well, the invariant has been studied extensively, especially in the work of Sophie Chen. Well, in particular, Sophie Chen. Well, in particular, she showed a very interesting result about the priori bound for this energy. When the Yamabi invariant is positive and the boundary is umbelic, then we have the priori upper bound for E, which is actually 2 pi squared, where the equality holds if and only if my manifold of its boundary is conformally equivalent to the drawn upper hemisphere. Let me mention that this result is actually. That this result is actually an analog of a similar result on four closed four manifolds by Professor Matgurski. So in his work, there is no boundary, and actually you just replace this boundary MRB invariant by the standard Yam RB invariant, and actually you replace this E by the sigma 2 curvature, and you will have a corresponding result. Okay, now let me. Okay, now let me try to use some additional notation. Well, I'm just trying to state the results in a more compact way, and I want to introduce two conformal classes. They are fairly standard, and actually they, well, the corresponding conformal classes on closed manifolds have been also introduced in the previous work. So here, I just say if I have y1b plus, b stands for the boundary. B stands for the boundary. It means that I have the positive, I have considered all the conformal classes with the positive Yamabian variant for manifold. If in addition, I also have the positive energy E, I will denote by Y2B plus. So once I have a metric in this Y2B plus, I have two non-negative terms, the integral of the wild energy and the while energy and the E term. So you know the sum of these two items, the denominator and the numerator, well, up to a constant module, they will be a topological invariant, which is actually a constant module of the older number. However, the quotient of them can be arbitrary. And here I introduce this beta B, B again stands for the boundary. This is actually characterizing. This is actually characterizing the interaction between these two conformal invariants. Note that we assume that my metric is y to be plus, which means that the denominator is always positive, it is always valid, and actually by definition, this conforming invariant is non-negative because both the numerator and denominator are non-negative. And we also use the smooth invariant. Here I vary the conformal class because in Conformal class. Because in each conformal class, I have a number. If I vary the conformal class and I take the infinimum again, I will get a smooth invariant for many for this boundary. Okay, so here are just some notations. Now we have the invariant to calculate the interaction between these two conforming invariants. It is also interesting to understand the variational property of one of the conformity invariants because if The conforming invariants because if we know the sum is actually a topological invariant, I only need to consider the variational property of one of them. And this turns out to be the generalization of the buck flat metric on the four-manifold with boundary. So first, let me try to explain the generalized well functional on the four-manifold with boundary. If I don't have this boundary item, this is just a standard well energy on a four-manifold with boundary. manifold with boundary on for closed four manifold here i add the additional part boundary integral so let me first uh recall the work of uh professor chang and go in their work they show that actually the critical points of this new energy i call wb are bach fat matrix in the interior and the tensor s tensor defined in their paper vanish on the boundary in this case i call the metric In this case, I call the metric with vanishing x tensor s flat. So here, when I use the Greek letters, that mean the full indices from 0 to 3. So this is actually a condition in the interior, and this is the condition on the boundary. Let me mention several things about the wow energy here, the wow functional here. If you note the symmetry of the wow curvature, then you see that I can replace this. That I can replace this second fundamental form by the treat-free part of the second fundamental form because the trace part is just a GIJ, and you use the trees-free property of the well curvature, you see there is no contribution, which means that if my boundary is umbilic, then the last item will drop. Okay, in that case, I will just reduce the wow energy to the standard. Reduce the wow energy to the standard one on the closed form manifold. This actually makes sense because you see that this is actually a conformally invariant, and actually, you also know that umbilic condition is conformally invariant, which means that I only need a conformally invariant condition to reduce it back to the standard closed case. Okay, I want to remark that both back flattenings and S-flattenings are confirmed. And the S-flatness are conformally invariant conditions. I also want to mention that Bach-flat condition is actually a fourth-order condition on the metric. So, which means that when I say fourth-order, I means that I differentiate the curvature of the metric four times. And after this S tensor can be understood as a third-order derivative on the boundary. So, it is natural to say, oh, if I have a fourth-order equation, I should be able to. I should be able to specify two boundary conditions. This is a third-order condition. It is possible to specify another one. And actually, in addition to the as factness, we are going to specify the umbilic condition. Let's see why this is reasonable. So, in a joint work with Professor Matt Gursky last year, we showed that even a compact four-manifold is boundary, and we did Manifold is boundary, and we did not m0 the space of all Riemannian metrics on this manifold, such as the boundary symbolic. And if I restrict my, oh, so sorry, there should be a subscript, but well, this doesn't really matter because in this class, w and w b will be the same because I mentioned that when the manifold has an umbilic boundary, the boundary term will drop. If and only if g is bar fat and the sigma is s fat and umbelic. Sigma is SFAT and I'm Belic. Okay, so here I have one equation in the interior, which is the Bach fat condition. Fourth order equation, I have two boundary conditions. Umbelic is a first order normal derivative and SFAT is a third order normal derivative conditions. We will discuss a little bit more about this corresponding relationship later. So, note that unbeliev condition is also conformally invariant. Here, I have three conformally invariant conditions: Bach-flat condition, um-belief condition, and S-flat condition. Here, well, in this sense, I can consider this kind of manifold to be the generalization of closed above-flat four manifolds. Okay, because all the conditions are conformally invariant, and actually, I have the right number of boundary conditions for the Boundary conditions for the equation. Okay, so far so good. Let me explain something about the basic results. So all these results are actually motivated by the corresponding results for the CCE manifolds and the closed form manifolds. Let me also mention that for a conformally compact Einstein manifold, if we consider the compactification, it always has embedded boundary. Has umbelic boundary. That is actually another reason why we think that this umbilic condition is kind of natural for the discussion. So, first, if we have a four-manifold with boundary admitting a metric in this conformal class with some basic boundary, then you have some vanishing property for the Dirand co-homology group. In particular, you can show that the boundary is connected in this case. Case. Okay, clearly, this is actually an analog of the result on the closed four manifolds proved by Gersky, and also there is another proof by Professor John Gersky and Yang. They show something more stronger in the closed case. So now we have only assumed that this class is not empty. If we know something stronger than this set being empty, we also say, oh, can we have some range? Say, oh, can we have some range for this beta b if it is bounded from? Well, this is actually always true because we are we mentioned that this is always non-active. If we have an upper bound, which is a magic number eight, then the double of the manifold is homeomorphic to S4 up to a finite cover. If I even strengthen the condition from eight to four, then I can improve this homeomorphism to diffeomorphism. To different morbids. So, for audience who are familiar with the work of Chang, Qing, and Yang on the study of the CCE manifolds, you may see that these theorems three and four are partially motivated by their work. The interesting thing is that in their work, they assume the manifold to be CCE, and actually they have the pointwise condition for the curvature, which is the Einstein condition. Here, the only pointwise condition. Here, the only point-wise condition is on the boundary. The boundary is symbolic. And the interior, you know that this beta b is actually an integral condition. Let me mention a little bit about the ideas in the proofs. I don't have time to discuss the detail of the proof. So, for the first theory. C, can you say a world-quite of eight appears here? Okay. The model case the constant is a. That's a very good question. So, first That's a very good question. So first, this eight is actually used in the argument. So actually, if you consider the double of the manifold, then you will see that this eight is actually, well, for the closed manifold, this eight is actually, you will see that it's actually S2 cross S2 number for that beta. And actually, you can also see that this eight is used in the argument to show that if we consider the universal cover of the double. Universal cover of the double, this eight will be used to show the second very number is vanishing. And from there, by the work of Friedman, you know, if you have a simply connected manifold with vanishing B2, and you see that this must be homeomorphic to S4. Okay. And actually, you see this equal to eight. You can rewrite this as the comparison between the energy E and the energy while, and that is actually in the CCE case. Exactly in the CCE case corresponding to your work's condition by comparing the older number and the renormalized volume. Okay? So this is actually the case here. And for the first theorem, theorem two, we use the work of Sophie Chain to conformally deform the metric to have the positive sigma two with totally geodesic boundary. Totally geodesic boundary, and then a Bochner type vanishing argument will show the result. Well, let me also mention that in Sophie's work, she also used the umbilic condition heavily. That's the reason why I do need the umbilic condition here. And for the theorem four, the theorem is proved in another way. The reason why we can improve the homeomorphism to diffeomorphism is that instead of using the work of Friedman, The work of Friedman, we used the Ricci flow to flow the manifold to the standard S4, and you can see that the Ricci flow will respect the symmetry of the double. And in the end, you will be able to show that M4 is diffeomorphic to the closed ball. Okay, here in this page, I call the topological consequences from the range of beta b. It means that I'm not assuming any point-wise condition for the metric. Condition for the metric, and only the point-wise condition on the boundary, and I have the integral condition in the interior. We have some topological consequences for the underlying manifold. If in addition, we assume the manifold is having a Bach-flat metric, then we should be able to improve the rigidity from topological category to geometric category. And that is actually the theorem here. Theorem here. So here I assume my manifold is back-flat with embedded and S-flat boundary. So I mentioned this is actually the natural generalization of Bach-flat closed four manifolds. If I also have this special range from a beta, then we can show that this manifold is conformally equivalent to the upper hemisphere, the strong one. This can be understood as an analog of the result of Chang-Ching-Yang. Of the result of Chang-Ching Yang for the closed four-manifold. And if we replace this condition on beta v by some condition on the energy, you know that the upper bound is 2 pi square. Then you know there is a small gap epsilon such that if your energy is close to the upper bound, then you can show that this manifold is also conformally equivalent to this standard. Standard model. For audience who are familiar with the work of Professor Gangli Yeqing and Yugang Shu, you can see that this can be understood as a generalization of their work on the CCE manifold. In their work, they don't have this S-flat condition, they have something called the G3 vanishing condition. And we are going to see that these two conditions will be the same in the case of CCE. Okay. Okay, so let me also mention another result. Perhaps this result is not really so natural in this page. It is not really a geometric reality. In this case, we can only say something about the topology of the underlying manifold. However, the number here is very interesting. So the condition is almost the same. And actually, we weaken the condition of beta from 4 to 8. Of beta from 4 to 8 times 1 plus epsilon, then we can see the double of the manifold is homeomorphic to S4 up to a fine cover. Why is this number interesting? Let me, actually, this will also answer the question by Professor Alice Chang before. So, if we consider the double of the manifold, you will have a closed flat four-manifold. And for a closed four-manifold, we have the For a closed four-manifold, we have the following numbers. So, this beta is just well, you just replace energy E by sigma two, and you should get this beta. And you can calculate for the canonical metrics on the sphere, on CB2 with the Fubini-Studin metric, and with S2 cross S2 with the standard product metric. You have these three magic numbers, or you can just calculate them directly. Here, in the closed case, so if you have this condition beta, You have this condition beta, less than eight times a small number bigger than one, you should have these three candidates. However, because we are considering the double of the compact manifold boundary, we have additional symmetry on the double manifold, which helps us to rule out these two cases. And the double can only be this guy. This is actually something interesting for me, at least. And this is in contrast with the closed. In contrast with the closed case, so we remarked that the applications of the preceding theorems to conformally compact Einstein manifolds will recover some rigidity results by Chang Qingyang and Li Ching Shu. So the results I mentioned before. Well, I only have two more minutes. I don't really have the time to explain the proof. Let me mention just one important ingredient in the proof. So if you do the calculation of the expansion of the remote, Of the expansion of the Riemannian metric near the boundary, say you have a smooth manifold with a Riemannian metric smooth up to the boundary, then I do just the Taylor expansion. And here, my Hi, HK are symmetric two tensor defined on the boundary. You can consider them as the lead derivative of this H in the direction of the normal direction evaluating on the boundary. So for the first So, for the first several tensors, they are very well known. Like if you restrict on a boundary, you have the restricted metric-induced metric. And the first derivative turns out to be the second fundamental form up to a constant, which means that if you have total geodesic boundary, you have the vanishing von Neumann condition, kind of. And we are also calculating the higher-order derivatives. Interestingly, if you look at this H3, H3, in the special case of the total geodesic boundary, we have the following lemma. This is exactly the S tensor up to a constant multiple, which means that if you say S flat, it simply means the third order derivative of the metric is vanishing on the boundary. Remark that, okay, Bach tensor can be roughly understood as a harmonic by Laplacian operator on the metric with some La Facian operator on the metric with some lower-order terms. By choosing the MIV metric with minimal boundary ambelicity and S-flatness will be viewed as the vanishing conditions for the first and third order normal derivatives on boundary. So this is actually the idea from the PVE viewpoint for the serums. Okay, I guess I'm running out of the time and I will just thank the audience for your attention. Thank you very much for the wonderful. Thank you very much for the wonderful talk. Questions? So let me remark that there are non-trivial examples where your conditions are satisfied. I mean, non-trivial means besides the standard model. Uh which one do you refer? You mean the back flat case or the yeah, you you say back flat, S flat, and then oh, yeah, so that's a very good question. So the interesting thing is that I cannot believe this epsilon can be very large. Maybe the only case is the standard case. So let's consider a simpler case. If you consider the CCE manifold and you assume in four-dimensional case, you In the four-dimensional case, you assume the say the non-local term G3 is vanishing. According to my knowledge, the only example is the standard hyperbolic space. I don't know any other example. Yeah. I see. You know that that is actually even stronger than the condition here if you assume G3 is vanishing. Okay. I guess maybe well, this will, it is possible that maybe this hyperbolic. That maybe this hyperbolic space is the well, maybe the universal cover for that CCE will be hyperbolic space, and that might be the only possibility. Well, when G3 is vanishing. Okay, okay. Okay, any other question? I have a quick question. Is there a natural relationship of any of these conditions with the Q and T curvatures? Oh yeah, that's a very question. So I think there should be some, at least that there should be some corresponding relationship between that E energy and Q curvature. And the Q curvature on the four-manifold is boundary. So you see, actually, in the work of Professor Chang and Qing, so they also define something about the boundary curvatures on the boundary terms for the Q curvature. I guess this item will be related to their construction, but I haven't checked that. I guess there should be something in that. Oh, by the way, so I strongly believe that this is not. I believe that this is not only a four-dimensional thing. Maybe there should be some higher-dimensional analog, but I'm not sure about that. Thank you.
