 And the main question that I'm going to address. So let me talk about commensurators and normalizers in general. So that I set up the notation and the question. So I'm going to be taking G a discrete group. And I'm going to say that two. And I'm going to say that two subgroups K and H of G are commensurable, and I'll be the numbering H is related to K or is commensurable to K, if you can consider the intersection. This is a subgroup of H and it's a subgroup of K. And what I'm going to ask is that this is a finite index. Index. So, in particular, if k is a subgroup of finite index in H, then H is commensurable with K. And I'm going to be studying during this talk, maybe use this one, the commensurator. Of H in G. And I'm going to use this notation. I gave this talk in another place and people complain a lot about this notation, but I think it's standard. So I'm going to keep it because it's easier to keep it. But well, I can accept complaints as well, I guess. So this is going to be the set of elements in G so that A. G so that h is commensurable to the conjugate of h by g. And one thing to notice about this is that if I have h commensurable to h prime, then the commensurators are the same, just by definition. And also, the other sort of main guess. Sort of main guessed here, the normalizer is always a subgroup of the commensurator. And I guess the complaint of the notation is because it's too similar, but I think it's in purpose actually that people choose this notation. And I should mention here that sometimes this is strict. And there is an example of Luke Bayerman, and I'm not going to describe it here, but there are examples where this inclusion is strict. So the question, one of the questions that I'm going to focus today, and I'm going to put, sorry? I don't know about, I don't remember now. The example is of infinite Luzwork. Is of thinking Luciora knows better, and he says yes, yeah. Um, and so I guess uh it's relevant for the following question. Um, so I'm asking for which groups and subgroups we have this condition. We have this condition. There exists H prime commensurable to H, such that if I look at the commensurator of H, well, this is the same as the commensurator of H prime, and I'm asking this to be eralized as a normalizer. And I'm going to be addressing this question quite a bit in the talk, so I'm going to call it like this so that I don't need to write it all the time. Yeah, so this is H prime, and so this commensurator is realized by a normalizer in the same commensurator shown class, I guess. Is that okay? So there are several examples that satisfy this. So any subgroup of virtually polycyclic groups satisfies this. Certain abelian subgroups of author thing satisfy this. The n satisfy this infinite virtual cyclic subgroups of linear groups. And in this talk, I'm going to be talking, I'm going to go around this question for mapping class groups. So this is the second point of my talk, I guess. And I'm going to try to answer this question for these families of groups. So I'm going to be dealing with S, a surface. A surface for the examples. Is it known if that can be done? So, the examples, actually, as far as I know, it is naturalized, I think. It's actually, I guess the counterexam is actually a counterexample of that question. Yeah. So, I'm going to be considering S, a surface of finite type. So, that means that it's compact with maybe finitely many punctures. And I'm going to be dealing with the mapping close group of the surface, and in particular, mostly I'm going to be talking about orientable surfaces. So, I'm thinking of orientation preserving the fields of the surface relative to the boundary, if the boundary is not empty, up to isotopy. And let me And let me give you a sort of like a partial answer to this question in this setting. So, this is Tere May. And I'll go with the attributions in a bit, but let me state the result. So, if the Euler characteristic of the surface is negative, and I'm going to be considering S-orientable surface. And H, a subgroup of the mapping class group that is virtually a billion of rank greater or equal than one. And I guess something to know is that all virtually abelian subgroups of Virtually a billion subgroups of the mapping class groups are finitely generated. So it makes sense to talk about finite rank. This is a result of Beermann, Lubotsky, and McCartney, I believe. And so the point is that for all this family, we have proposition, we have this condition. So property star holes. So So, these virtually abelian subgroups of rank greater or equal than one, the commensurators can be realized as normalizers of a subgroup of the group that is commensurable to it. So, this is the statement, and then let me tell you about who did that. So, this is a result of Juan Pinera and Jorgillo Negrete. And also of Nusinki's, I don't know if the spelling is correct, Petrosian. They did it for rank equal one. And what we did with this work in Porfirio, so myself, Leon Alvarez and Sanchez Saldani. Leon Alvarez and Sanchez Aldaña is the rank greater equal to case. And before moving on, let me give you a bit of comments about this statement. So I guess some remarks. If the surface S is closed, meaning the boundary is empty, in the property star that I stated here, we can take H prime to be actually a finite index subgroup of H. Not just commensurable, but a finite subgroup. Not just commensurable, but a finite index subgroup. And in this case, condition star can be inherited to the family of virtually a billion subgroups of Of gamma being gamma and the subgroup of the marking class group. So that includes, in particular, the case when γ is a non-orientable surface. So then this is true also for mapping class group where n is a non-orientable. Is a non-orientable surface with Euler characteristic that is negative, just because you can take the double cover, double orientable cover, and then you can realize this mapping class group as a subgroup of a mapping class group of an orientable surface. That also includes rags because there's a result of Britson that says that you can realize the rug as a subgroup of a mapping class. As a subgroup of a mapping class group of a surface with large enough genus. And you can also include surface break groups because the Berman-Sach sequence allows you also to see them as subgroups of mod S. And let me say something else. Maybe here. Maybe here. So, the other observation is that this is the first one, and the second one is that this condition star also goes to Goes to central extensions, so it's inherited to again infinite mutual subgroups of a group gamma that is a central extension. Of the mapping class group. But yeah, Freyabelian group. And this is actually what allows us to go from the non. I told you we can do this for plus surfaces, and this is going to imply the case for non-plus surfaces. And here. Surfaces and here the thing is that we have the capping homomorphism, so we can go for a surface that has non-empty boundary, and with the capping homomorphism, we can go to a surface that is closed. And then this gives us a central extension where the kernel is actually a free abelian group generated by the dent twist along the boundary component. So if we have the result for this one, we can extend it to surfaces that have no. Extended to surfaces that have non-empty boundary. And then, I mean, this also will tell you that the property holes for acting groups of finite app AN and BN equals CN because they are also extensions. And I guess here I'm going to leave a question that was asked to me by. Was asked to me by Alan Reed, which is: do we know actually examples where this doesn't hold? And I don't know. So do we have actually subgroups of the mapping class group, infinite subgroups, so that property star doesn't hold. Doesn't hold. And I guess he was speculating that there may be a property about the mapping class group that don't allow this to happen. But the methods that we used that are based on the previous work only work for this type of subgroup. So I don't know the answer about this. It's true for any. It's true for, yeah. I mean, this is always true. That's why I want an example that is infinite. Well, I guess I don't have to say it. You're right. Yeah. Are we okay? Okay. So, I guess before I'm going to try to see if I can leave the result on the board until I say some. On the board until I say something about the proof. But before that, I wanted to give a bit of the motivation that is behind why we wanted to know that, in particular, there may be other reasons, but this is the reason why we studied this. And this has to do with geometric dimensions. And I'm told that this may be a good introduction to the next talk. So maybe it's just going to be definitions. It's just going to be definitions, but it's going to be useful for next talk as well. So let G, this is going to be sort of a parenthesis, and then at some point I'm going to come back. Let G be a discrete group. And I'm going to say that a CW complex X is a model for the classifying. The classifying space, and usually the notation is BG. If, and this is information that I think all of the people here are familiar with, X is connected by one of X is isomorphic to my group, and the universal cover of X is contracting. Is contracting all. So, this is in the case of discrete groups, this is just the Eilenberg-MacLean space of the group. And I guess, I mean, there are things to know is that such models exist always and are unique of the Up to homotopy. And I guess, I mean, you may be familiar with examples of that. For instance, S1 or S1 because R models. I'm putting the easy one for busy or figure eight is a model. Or BF2, and I guess we are interested in finding the model of minimum dimension, and we'll put a name to that. So that's what is called the geometric dimension of the group. So Geometric dimension of G, I'm going to be denoting this by G D of G is precisely the minimum of all positive or non-negative integers so that Bg admits a model. Of dimension M and some examples of this geometric dimension. I guess geometric dimension of G is zero if and only if G is trivial. It's one if and only if. If and only if he is free and non-trivial. And the model is going to be the Cali graph. This is the Stalin's one. The geometric dimension of an abelian group of rank n is precisely n, and one of the models is S1 cross S1 cross S1 n times. One n times, and if my group G has torsion, the geometric dimension is going to be infinite. And I guess there's this algebraic notion of dimension that is very related with this, which is the homological dimension. I'm not going to go into the definition of that, but if But if G is virtually torsion-free, one can consider the VCD of the group, the virtually cohomological dimension, is equal to the cohomological dimension of H, where H is a finite index subgroup of G, which is torture-free. That exists because my group is virtually torsion-free, and this is always less or equal than the geometric dimension of G of H in this case. And I guess equality holds when you don't have two specific cases of the B C D being two and the geometric dimension being three. Geometric dimension being three. So, I guess something that I want to mention in this respect with respect to the mapping class group, maybe I'm going to gather the facts about the mapping class group here, is that the BCD of the mapping class group has been computed in the 80s by Harris. So, in particular, computed the B C D of the mapping class group. Let's go open orientable surface. And I'm going to come back to this in a moment. So let me introduce sort of the generalization of this notion of geometric dimension and classifying space. Then I'm going to do what is not recommended, but I'm going to use the same and I'm going to write over. Same, and I'm going to write over. So I start with G, a group, and now I want to consider F a family of subgroups. Maybe I should do that with GLOS, but you can see what I'm adding. And by a family, I mean a collection of subgroups of G that are closed undertaking subgroups. Closed on their taking subgroups and on their conjugation. And the families that I want to keep in mind are the following. So, one possibility is to have the trivial family that just has the trivial subgroup. The other possibility is to have the family of finite subgroups. Another one that is very popular is the family of virtually cyclic subgroups of the group. And the one that is more relevant. The one that is more relevant for the purpose of this talk is the following. It's going to be, and this is not optimal, but let me put it here. It's going to be the family Fn that is given by H subgroup of G so that H now this is this feels good. I'm going to put it in a little space. I'm sorry about this. I guess I can do it here because I get all. Yeah, I guess I can do it here because I can want to use my so it's going to be fn h subgroup of g so that h is virtual virtually z to the k where k moves in between zero and n. So this is sort of the familiar virtually abelian subgroups of G. And you should notice. And you should notice that the family of finite subgroups is just F0, and the family of virtually cyclic subgroups is just F1. And with this in mind, and other families in general, you can define a classifying space for the family as follows. So I want now, and I think I wanted. And I think I wanted this before, but I want a G C double U complex to be a model for the classifying space for the family F. And I'm going to be using a different notation than this. It's going to be the classifying space of the group with respect to the family. And I want the following conditions. Following conditions, I want now that for every X in X, I look at the stabilizer of X, and this belongs to the family. And I want the set of fixed points, that is to say, the set of X in X such that h of X equals X. H of x equals x to be contractible whenever h belongs to the family. And again, such models exist and are unique up to homotopy. And let's see a bit of examples of this before we go to the case of interest. The family that you consider is the trivial family, then what you recover is that the classifying space for this trivial family is precisely BG. It's the universal color of BG, sorry. It's TG. So, what is the definition saying? This is going to be a G C double U complex. Be a G CW complex such that for every X in X, the stabilizer is in the family. So the stabilizer is trivial, so there is a free action of G here. And then there is only a group in the family, which is a trivial group, and this is saying the whole space is contractible. So that means in particular that EG mod G is precisely a classifying space in the sense that I was defining before. Space in the sense that I was defining before. And then, maybe more interesting for the purposes of this talk is that if I take F to be the family of finite subgroups, so this is the collection of subgroups of G such that H is finite. Then take mirror space is a model for the classifying space with respect to this family of the mapping class group of an orientable surface of genus G. And actually, And well, people know what is the dimension of the Hmm space, we know that. But actually, if n is greater or equal than one, so we have at least one puncture, higher define the spine, take Mueller space. And this is actually a model of minimal dimension. So this is also. This is also a model, but this model has dimension equal to the B C D of the group. And this is actually the, as far as I know, the way that he computed the B C D of the mapping plus group. And I guess we want the minimum dimension again. So this definition of having geometric dimension of G, I can. I can give it with respect to the family F. So I'm going to put here an F. And so I want the minimum so that the classifying space with respect to the family admits a model of dimension n. Okay, so let me give you facts about geometric dimension, and then I'm going to go back to the term that I. Mentioned, and then I'm going to go back to the term that I was quoting there. Yeah. Knowing that you have a finite dimensional classifier space for families doesn't require that you have a finite variable from all the configuration, does it? I think it's always bounded above the BCD is always. About the B C D is always bounded above by the geometric dimension. The rational B C D is at the left bound for if most notes. The rational D C D bounds from below from below. Yeah, but then the geometric dimension bounds for about okay, so let me give you a bit of examples that are known here. You have a bit of examples that are known here, and then we go back to mapping gaze groups. So, this is the geometric dimension of the group with respect to the family F is zero, if and only if the group itself is in the family. The geometric dimension for the trivial family is precisely the geometric dimension that I defined before. The geometric dimension for the family. Dimension for the family of finite subgroups of a group is known to be one if and only if, and this is gives like a complete characterization of G being virtually free. And this is a result of downloading and then maybe I complete my set of claims about mapping. Of claims about mapping class group here. Hare in 86 showed that the geometric dimension with respect to the family of finite subgroup of the mapping class group of an orientable surface with n punctures, n needs to be greater or equal than one, is precisely the BCD. So this So, this is sort of this spine is sort of the minimal model that you have. And this technique will require CP5 general processes. Maybe, maybe I'm forgetting that. Otherwise, you'd be taking a graph of five groups and then you're X in the sheet. Yeah, maybe you're right. Maybe you need G final the generators. And then, is it okay? It's good that we are in finitely generated world here, I guess. Then, I mean, I guess her proofs uses like gives an explicit model that has the dimension, but then Agamayona and Martís Perez, who are organizing this conference but are not here. Not here. They actually extended this for closed surfaces. So they computed the geometric dimension with respect to the family of finite subgroup for a closed surface of genus gene. And they also showed that this is the BC. And I mentioned before this family of finite subgroup is this. This family of finite subgroup is this family F0. And so one can ask the question about what happens with the family F1 and the family Fn that we defined before. And it's a result of Nusinkis and Petrosian based on workers of Daniel, Juan Pinera, and Alejandro Trujillo negrete that if S If S is compact, the only characteristic of the surface is negative, then if you compute the geometric dimension with respect to the virtually cyclic family of the mapping class group of the surface, and this is orientable surfaces, this is always less or equal. This is always less or equal than the V C D of the surface plus one. And I recall to you that this family is what we call also F1. And they actually did a bit more. They show that there is equality when the surface is closed. So equality holds. What? The equality? I don't know. You remember if it is conceivable if it is that it's always true, the equality. I don't remember what is. They really use that disclosed to show the lower bound, but I don't know if. So I guess the technique to show the upper bound, I'm going to explain it a bit because this. Bound. I'm going to explain it a bit because this is something of what we did. And the technique to show the lower bound is a cohomological argument. And I don't know how precisely they use that disclaimer there. I don't remember the. So I guess I'm going to state the other result in this direction. And then I'm going to come back to theorem A. So I should mention that one of the reasons that people care about Reason that people care about these classifying spaces of families is because they appear in the statements of the isomorphism conjectures of aurel germs and bound calls. So in particular, these two families, F0 and F1, appear in these statements. Malvi Farrell John's conjecture and Baumko's conjecture. And there's been bartels proved that the mapping class group satisfies this conjecture. Well, let me state theorem B. And well, I guess I already I guess I already, well, this is this is joint again with Porfigio Luis Jorge. Let me state it. So if S is connected, compactory, well, compact, connected, orientable of finite type with Euler characteristic negative. With Euler characteristic negative, then for every n greater or equal than 2, the geometric dimension with respect to this family F2, Fn, sorry, of the mapping class group is bounded above by the BCD plus N. And I guess, I mean, this is sort of like a generalization. I mean, this is sort of like a generalization of the results that I quoted there of Jarera, Amayona, Latinos Peres, and Musinque Espectorción for the cases and greater or equal than two. So let me give you a bit of why we needed a result like A to get a result like B, and then I'll go back to say something about the proof of the RMA. Then I guess I can keep the destination of the family here. So, a bit of the sketch of the proof, and this is also. Sketch of the proof, and this is also sort of the strategy that Musinkis and Petrovan follow. So, this is about the upper bound. It doesn't answer the question about equality, I guess. So, the idea is to do an inductive argument on N, and being this rank of the abelian groups. Rank of the abelian groups that we're considering. So, what we what I mentioned in the late the board up there is that it's true for n equals zero and n equals one. And I should mention that the proofs of this, at least the zero, one goes to a construction of a specific model, and then after that is more like sort of an argument as the one that I'm going to describe here. That I'm going to describe here. So the idea is: I'm going to denote g is going to be the mapping plus group of the surface. And the idea is that we assume that is true for n equals k. And then we want to get it for k plus 1. And we consider a look-Weyerman construction. And I guess what this machine tells you is that you can build a model X for the family S K plus one using a model for the family K. For the family k. So, this one we know by induction, we know a bound of the dimension. So, this is bounded by the BCD plus K. And then the push-out construction tells you: well, this X can be built up with from this space and other spaces. Other spaces. I'm going to write here just so that you see where the commensurators appear. So, this is a disjoint union of this type of spaces. And this is in the Amily, this is looking at this as a subgroup of. Sorry, this is not correct. Let me write this down carefully. I think I'm missing something on my notation. I'm sorry. And I guess my formula is probably incorrect, but what I want to emphasize for the purpose of this talk is that. This talk is that the pieces that appear in this sort of like abstract construction have to do with commensurators here. And the point is that the dimension of this can be bounded if we bound the dimension of the vertexes of the construction. So this and this are going to be bounded by the induction hypothesis. And then one needs to work out in this corner to bound this. And here we have commensurators. Have commensurators, and it turns out that in order to bound this, it's easier, or you can do something if you use the RMA so that instead of commensurators, you can put normalizers. And moreover, you need to know more about that, not just that they realize, but you need to know something about the structure of the normalizers. So So, and that's something that we needed to figure out as well. And this is sort of the strategy that also Nucinke and Petrosian used to show the bound that they have. And I don't know, maybe yours as well. So Daniel and Alejandra did also have a statement like that, but the bound is worse. But the strategy is sort of the same. And they were the first one to give this for the case F1. So I don't know how I'm doing on time. On time. I guess I should say something about the proof of the RMA because the whole geometry of the mapping class group is hidden there. So all of this is sort of like the algebraic topology part of the talk. And then how do you prove something like that has to do with the geometry of the group? So I guess this goes to a technical step. And the technical step says the following: so for sketch of term A and so the main technique. And so the main technical step is the following. So, since we are going to be working in commensuration classes, we're going to be working instead of with the mapping class group with a subgroup of finite index that is torsion free, which is the congruent subgroup of the mapping class group when m is greater or equal than three. So, this has the advantage of being torsion-free. Advantage of being torsion-free, and we're going to take H to be a subgroup that is free abelian of rank one. And let me call this term C. So, what we had to show in order to show term A is that there. Is that there exist short exact sequences as follows? So the point being that we need to understand what is the centralizer somehow of this group, what is the normalizer, and what is the commensurator, which is the one. So the ones that appear in the theorem are actually these two. ones that appear in the theorem are actually these two but this is sort of like a a piece of information that we need in order to get the results about this and so what we managed to do inspired by the work of of Daniel Alejandra and Juzinki Sen Petrosian is to put this in a short de sac sequence where we have a bit of control of what is the cute Of what is the Q that we have here. So, this Q here is going to be a subgroup of finite index that needs to be checked of the mapping class group of a disconnected surface cross A and A is a finitely generated virtual abelian group. And actually, yeah, and I guess, I mean, it's not the same Q for each of this, but all of them lie in a structure term like that. And this row here comes from a coding homomorphism. So let me see what I should say next. So let me say a bit of how you use this to get the theorem, and then I'm going to come back to what is this row and how you build up that. So I guess the consequences of that description of the centralizer, normalizers and Of the centralizer, normalizers, and commensurator is that something that we didn't know for rank greater or equal than two is that the centralizer of the group is always a subgroup of the normalizer. But from this, we can say that it's actually a finite index. And that's also true here. To here with respect to B. And this has to do by the way, this is by the way that we build up this short sex sequence that appeared there. This was known for the rank one case, but here we needed to get it actually, because we didn't know if this was true before. And the other consequence that is going to be crucial is that we can say from this, from the Schoto-Sac sequence, that the commensurator is actually. Is actually a finitely generated group. And then I guess theorem A follows from this plus the fact that the mapping plus group satisfies some property C that I'm not going to go into. Property C that I'm not going to go into. And this is actually recent work of Leininger McReynolds, combined with work of Caprase Krop Hollner Wreath Lisolic. And this too is what allows us to show. Is what allows us to show that we have term A. So, I guess we can apply this property C for the group. One of the conditions that this property C has is that the group that you apply this property has to be finitely generated, and now we can apply it to this normalizer, this commensurator. So it's a bit of a black box because I'm using this property here. But I guess what I wanted to emphasize is that in order to be able to use this, we needed this finite generation and we could get it like knowing the structure of the group. And in the few minutes that I have left, let me tell you a bit of how we get that structure theorem. And so this has to do actually with production systems and the cutting of amorphism. And again, these ideas go back. And again, these ideas go back to the work of Daniel and Alejandra. So, I guess here I'm going to be assuming that the surface has empty boundary. And I'm going to be recalling that Malaren told us this morning that the mapping class group acts on the group complex. So, I'm going to be quoting this definition of, I think it's Ivanov. Of, I think it's Ivanov, this is a subgroup of the mapping class group is reducible if there exists a simplex that is non-empty of the cure complex so that When I act on it by elements of the subgroup, I fix the simplex. I guess people may be familiar with the case when you have a subgroup generated by a single element, that's what we call a reducible element. I think it was pointwise. Was it? Well, I guess maybe it was setwise, but then we can restrict to the But then we can restrict to the top group of finite index that fixes pointwise. And this is a trick that we need to use several times because we don't want this to fix it pointwise in order to do the description before, after. And in the same sense as you have with reducible elements, there is a theory of canonical reduction system for subgroups and not used for elements. So this is also even odd. And actually, apparently, there are like two notions of reduction. Two notions of production systems, one from Ivanov and one from Birman, Lubatsky, and McCartney, and they are not exactly the same. They are the same with one element, but then after that, they are not. You wrote two quantifiers. What's the order? So does it say, is that just saying that the subgroup H is supposed to be contained in the stabilizer of sigma? Yeah, that's what it says. And that's, yeah. So this is a subgroup of. This is a subgroup of this one. And actually, yeah. Actually, I think, isn't it that this should fix the practice, I believe? I think so. Yeah, if you're in the Congress Hub group, I think you can guarantee that this fixes point-wise. Yeah, and that's why one of the reasons why the technical piece needs to go to the congruent subgroup is because then you are pure and then pure you fix this point-wise. But yeah, that's one of the subtleties that you need to be careful with. Yeah, so I guess I need to wrap up. So let me, I mean, there's a canonical system, I guess that's what I wanted to say. Canonical reduction system. So, if you are familiar with what happens with reducible elements, this is the analogous statement for subgroups or H, and I'm going to be focusing on H in the congruent subgroup. And I mean, things to check is that if you're reducible and non-trivial, then this is non-empty. If you are free abelian of rank greater or equal than two, you are reducible, then this is non-empty, and you can use this sort of machinery. So, I guess just to point out where the role in my structure fertile sex sequence comes from. comes from well it comes precisely from working out with this canonical reduction system so there is sort of like a canonical form or H so here we need H to be a subgroup of the mapping class group Be a subgroup of the mapping class group, the congruent subgroup that is three abelian or rank ray equal to two, that is the setting that we are working in. And then you need, I mean, you can check that using Ivanov's theory about this, edge turns out to be irreducible. And the canonical reduction system is non-empty. There exists one and is non-empty. And if this canonical system is represented by isotopic classes of curves alpha one to alpha n, one can consider the surface that you get by cutting out. By cutting out these curves here. So in the paper, this is the notation that we borrow from Nusinkis and Petersian. So we're cutting this. And maybe let me draw a picture so that I can finish and explain what's going on. So by cutting this, we may disconnect the surface. But the point is the following. So I need to stop. So let's say that you have a surface maybe with functions. I should copy my and say that the canonical production system is the one that I'm putting here. So, what we want to do is cut the surface along the system. So, this disconnects the surface in pieces and introduces maybe new punctures. This is just like an illustration of what's going on. So if I cut the surface along the surface, along the I'm going to give these pieces. And I guess the point is that there is a morphism that goes from the stabilizer of the reduction system to the mapping class group of the disconnected surface. Connected surface. But then if you restrict this, well, and this is called the cutting homomorphism. And how it works is that you take a mapping class here. Since the mapping class is fixed as this, you can restrict a representative to each of the components and get classes in each of these components. And this is going to give you a class here. And well, I guess in principle, since this may permit. Principle, since this may permute the curves, this may permute the components that you have here. But if you restrict to the subgroup, and this is the subtlety that you were asking about, that fixes this point-wise, this actually goes to a subgroup that is the product of these mapping classes, mapping class groups, as much as many as the components that we have there. And the point is that this canonical system gives you more information. Gives you more information about that, tells you that H lives here and H is going to act in a set of pieces here as the identity and in the other set as a pseudonym. So this is going to decompose this sort of like in two pieces. In the first one, in the first set of pieces, the action of H, when you take it. When you take it with the cutting homomorphism, it's going to be the identity, and then the other ones is going to be a pseudonym action. And the point being here is that when you analyze, centralizes, normalizes, and commensurator, you can sort of like see what is the image here and how it lies here. And this is sort of the Q that I'm describing here is going to be lying here somehow. To be lying here somehow, one needs to be careful with this passing to finite index subgroup so that you can do it, but that's basically the idea. So, that is this particular structure comes about by using the canonical reduction system. The canonical reduction system. That's a sigma particularly tailored to that. That's true. That's true. We are using that. So, this is not just a coding homomorphism. You need to choose the particular reduction system that works. Reduction system that works. And that's why I was telling you that in order to get this structure, we are really using the geometry of the mapping plus group hidden in this particular way. That kernel is the interests or what is the point? That kernel has to do with these ones here. So it's of interest because when you want to say something about finite generation of destruction of this, this is well known. This is well known, but otherwise, I don't think that we use it for something more specific. I don't remember. I don't think so. So, what took us sort of like some time was to figure out that this Q, I mean, it's not that hard to see that this is a subgroup, it's actually the construction. Well, it's not obvious to say that this is finite index. And this is needed for the proof of the geometric dimension. The proof of the geometric dimension that I mentioned before. Yeah, I guess I'm going to stop because I'm over time. Sorry about that. Yeah. Can't restrain myself. Where does the A come from? Yeah, the A comes from this piece where. Where this is where the H is going to act as a pseudonym. So, are the product of the mapping class groups or the pieces when the action is going to be non-trivial? And the A is going to be a subgroup of that. And I mean, the thing is, because what is important and it's also not obvious, is why this is a virtually abelian group. So, that has to do with the fact that centralizers of pseudonymous are well understood and are. Understood and are known to be virtually abelian. So that's hidden here in this statement as well. I hope I'm not lagging, but maybe my co-authors can correct me. That's the advantage of having them here. Yeah, I don't know if this sort of answers from the C. Oh, yeah, let me see. I don't know by heart, but yeah, I can write it down. So they say property C is in this context is that for every three abelian group age of the mapping group every abelian group of rank Every abelian group of rank and greater or equal than one and all k subgroups of the commensurator that are finitely generated. And this is this is sort of the ingredients that we added so that we could use it. There exists H prime commensurable to H such that Such that the subgroup generated by H and K is contained in the normalizer. So I guess they do most of the work. I mean, what we added was knowing that this was finally error. Am I SH prime? Yeah. Thank you for paying more attention than me. On me.
