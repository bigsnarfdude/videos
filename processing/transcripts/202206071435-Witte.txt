I'd like to thank the organizers for giving me the opportunity to hike, I mean speak, speak here. So what I'll be talking about today is well, like this morning we've been talking about all of Morphin block syntactic structures. And what I'll be talking about today is about the real one imaginary parts. This is what we're calling syntactic structures. And I'll talk to you a bit about what these are, how they relate to generalized complex structures, and how we can construct lots of examples about them. And how this is About them. I know that this is a story I've been telling for some time, so I hope that in the end I'll also tell you a bit of how you can use all this theory to tell something about T-duality. But let me first start with some very basic theory, namely that of V-algebra symbolic structures. Just to set a stage a bit. Sure, most every most of you here. Most of you here have seen this definition. So, if we have a Lie algebra, then we can speak of symptomic structures on this Lie algebra. And what are they? They are two forms for the Lie algebra, which are not degenerate, sensitive at looking at only one section in the If I'm looking at only one section of the L2 by an isomorphism, and there are people in perspective. Now, over the last couple of years, many of us have been studying Poisson structures with mild and of singularities, such that they can be understood as syntactic structures of the algebra. So, a bit more precisely, if I give you a Poisson structure, some manifold. Structure. So manifold and Lie algebraic, then we say that a section of wedge 2 of A is a lift of pi if it sends under the anchor to a soft structure. And then, furthermore, this is. And furthermore, this is Poisson for this Lie algebraic saying that the scouting record you get from the Lie bracket on the Lie algebraic with itself is zero, and this is non-degenerate, then, well, I would say that pi lifts symplectically. To any. Or a bit of abuse of notation, I'll just say that by itself is an asymptotic structure. And the simplest example or the first where there was within our differential geometry community that we do a study of is that of B or log syntactic structures. So these are Poisson structures on even the national manifolds. On even the next one manifolds with the property that this top words power of y vanishes transversible. And if you have this, then you can consider the vector fields. Tangent to z is formally algebraic. For Lie algebra just denote the A of Z, called the B or log tension bundle, and by lifts effectively to just the object and there is like. And there is like an abundance of variations of these real son structures with these kind of singularities which have been studied over the past. So the ones I want to be talking to you about, I suppose, and I think I'll just give the definition and later on explain why this is something interesting and what we can consider. So I'm again on an even-dimensional manifold. I'm again going to impose some condition on the vanishing of the top exterior power of pi. But I'm namely ask that there exist around any point local coordinates x1, y1, xk, yk y k w 2 k plus 1 w n to m such that this complex theory power has a specific normal form in this local coordinates. So I'm going to pick a local volume form and consider this to be a function. And then I want this to have this form. And such a posonical structure I call self-crossing elliptic select Okay, that that's the definition. That's the definition. And now, so I'll lose control for some notation. D, the set where this topic's theory power vanishes, open OPED, and I'll call this the degeneracy logus. And this is an immersive submanifold. And you see that, just as in this case, that the Poisson structure is symplectic away from this subspace, but now it degenerates in this manner in a quadratic fashion along this particular subspace. And in terms of the case that D is embedded, so that's okay. So that corresponds to this number k being equal to 1 at all times. That has been studied before by Cavocanti. And we have expanded it to allow for these degeneracies which occur along an immersive manifold. And it will become clear in a moment why we have done this. So now I'd like to try to understand these Poisson structures using the algebras. But contrary to the case of the log symplectic structures, you need a bit more data than just the sub-manifold along which the singularities occur to get the knee algebra. An extra bit of data which you need is what's called an elliptic. It's what's called an elliptical class. What is this? This is an ideal of functions, real value functions. We have a manifold such that it is generated by a globalization. By a global function f, which has specified normal form. Again, the same coordinates as I have a second ago. The dimension of the manifold is set to n strictly necessary. Strictly necessary and if I have one of these Poisson structures with this property, you see that given by elliptics eclectic. So I'm So, I'm gonna sometimes forget to append this self-crossing in front, and whenever I'm dealing with something which has actually an embedded degeneracy locus, I'll explicitly stress that. So, if I have one of these infected structures, and I pick a global goal for you, I'm not sure we call it cube then. Then red of pi will equal f lambda q and you see that f generates, look at the ideal generated by this function, I get many buttons totalogically, because by assumption I ask that wedge and pi has this specified not before. Global form. Of course, this also tells us why I'm doing this kind of strange-looking thing, because I have a global function f, but of course, the function you get out of it is not well-defined, it's only well-defined up to, well, change your volume form, and the thing will be rescaled by an over-vanishing function. But the function itself is not well-defined, but the idea will be generates this. So that's the piece of data which we get out of the Poisson structure. Which we get out of the Poisson structure we'll be considering. And then, what we will do next is we will consider all vector fields which preserve this ideal. So, I pick one of these latest devices, I look at the vector fields which preserve it. Fields which preserve it, and then a lemma which proves is that they are given by the following expression. So here, Ri, VRI, is the radial vector field given by xi, dxi, yi, i, and d theta i is the rotational vector field given by xi, dyi, minus yi, and another And another way of seeing this, if I were to use complex coordinates, then Ry dri is the real part of Zi Dzi D theta i is the imaginary part. Inting towards, like, we're going towards the holomorphic log symplectic structures which we saw. So the dilemma is that if we look at all vector fields, preserving such an ideal. By preserving such an ideal, in this set of local coordinates, you have this expression. Otherwise, it's nice, because now what we can do is we can apply the CS1 theorem. What does this theorem state? It states that if you have a locally free sheaf, then that is necessarily And that is necessarily the sections of some given vector bundle. So we can apply this to vector fields preserving ID and we obtain a vector bundle which I'll be noting by multi-call a absolute variable v and with sections vector fields. Vector fields preserving I president and because its sections are vector fields naturally have a Lie bracket, so this gets this Lie, this vector bundle naturally gets the structure of a Lie algebra. And we call this Lie algebra E the elliptic penguin. You get it. Now, the upshot of the entire story is proposition given one of these elliptic syncalactic structures. Elliptic syncalactic structures. Out of one of these Poisson structures, I naturally get one of these elliptic divisors, and then I look at the corresponding Lie algebra, which is an elliptic divisor that defines, and then to there, this Poisson structure lifts. making the entire theory kind of sense why I'm not using this theory. So, okay, perhaps as well. Fact, give a very connective example. We don't have C2 or R4. C2 or R4. And in this kind of coordinates, I want to consider this muscle structure. If you compute the second wedge, you will find that it's R1 squared, R2 squared, times The co-volume, so this gives you, this is an example of an elliptic symplectic structure, and the corresponding symplectic form you get of the Lie algebra at this expression by these vector fields, these one. Vector field, these one forms are simply the singular one forms dual to these vector fields. So if I were to draw this ARFC2, here I have C the coordinate axis, this one say 1 is 0, this one says 2 is 0. And we're looking at a Poisson structure which is symplectic away from the coordinate axis and degenerates along uh the axis. And also, so saying that this pi over here is the real part of Z1 complex coordinate axis. Yes, the complex coordinate axis is the real part. This possible structure, is the real part of this all-pointed four balls. And these were the kinds of structures we have been talking about this morning. These were the holomorphic log symplectic structures. And I'll come back into that in a second. Another thing which I want to remark at this point is that indeed, something which Micola has also been talking, talking about, that indeed this degeneracy locus. Degeneracy locus is not an embedded submanifold that's immersed, but it is quite nicely so because it's stratified. This picture is quite clear. So the stratification consists of the number of components intersecting, or in these coordinates, it's the number if you describe your elliptic symplectic structure in this manner, it's the number of functions you need to describe it. To describe it. So over here, only Z2 is zero, and Z1 is not zero. So we would always call V1. So the first stratum of the Genesis locus. Here both of the coordinates vanish. The coordinate, the second stratum. So that's just the origin. And in general, we get self-certification in this manner. In this matter. By the way, there is a little bit of ambiguity in that definition, because you're saying there exists some local coherence where that happens, but then there is some global thing where you're saying that there is a device. I mean, this K, would have different Ks for different points. Exactly. Indeed. But that's precisely. So this value of K at every point is precisely what the stratification tells you. So that very strategic. Uh that fairly struggled. So the way I've written it right now is part of the definition. But so if I want to just assume, for the sake of the stock, assume manifold is orientable. This turns out not to be a condition. It turns out why? Because if you have one of these elliptic symplectic structures, they're symplectic. They're symplectic away from a co-dimensional 2 subset. And if you're oriented away from a co-dimensional 2 subset, you can prove that you actually, this orientation extends of the entire method. So you can always pick an orientation, so you can always pick a covalent form, and therefore you can just look at this expression, and therefore you get to globally define F. This is where you get this elliptic divisor out of the possible structure. Okay, maybe I'm just confused. I thought I'm a cool feature. Why can't I have another point in the axis where I have another crossing with something that has like, I mean, more dimensions where you have just like k equals to 2 and another point where there are intersections where k is equal to 2? That's possible, sure. And then how do you get a wellly defined f that works everywhere? And it's fixed here. Is fixed here. Here the top fixed theory power. Right, I'm looking at the topics theory power. Okay, now I see what like right this is the failure of the thing to be symplectic, and that's covered by a function. So these are the kind of structures I want to be considering. So now I would like to tell you. Now I would like to tell you why I want to consider them. And the motivation of why we want to consider them comes from generalized complex structure. So well, we haven't seen the definition of generalized complex structure so far in this conference. So very quickly, for me it will be a pair of an endomorphism. It would be a pair of an endomorphism of the double tangent bundle, tm plus t star m, which squares the minus the identity, together with a three-form, such that you have the property that the plus i eigenbule of this map is involative with respect to this Dorf mark bracket. Now, what you can do if you have one of these generalized complex structures, you have this. structures, you have this splitting of the double tangent bundle Tm and T star m. So you can write the thing as a 2 by 2 matrix, and then the conditions of the thing being generalized complex will imply that this matrix is always of this whole. And well you can do the exercise and then you can find out that this will be an anamorphous and multangent bundle. You'll get this in the right corner. This will be a two-form, this will be a bifactor. Way a two-form, and this will be a bifactor. An important observation is that this bifactor is actually a Poisson structure. So, any generalized complex structure induces a Poisson structure. And some the standard examples, so what are generalized complex structures? They interpolate between symplectic and complex structures. Just J is an ordinary, almost complex structure, which is integrable, then this defines a generalized complex structure. Omega is symplectic, and this defines generalized. And this defines generalized complex structure. A bit more interesting: if Q were a holomorphic Poisson structure, then if I take its imaginary part, put it over here, then this defines a generalized component structure. Now, what I want to consider, this is perhaps a bit butchering the actual definition, but it's a quick and dirty way for a Poisson audience. I want to consider those generalized complex structures which have the property that their underlying. Have the property that their underlying Poisson structure is one of these self-crossing elliptic symptomic structures that is defined. And those I call self-crossing stable. And well, so some things to remark is that this map, which sends the standardized complex structure to its elliptic symplectic structure, is injective on gauge equivalence classes. And, well, it is not a subjective map, but there are clinical. Map, but there are clear conditions when a given elliptic symplectic structure induce a generalized complex structure. They're only a bit technical, so just ignore them for the second stop. The most important example I'm talking about today, if I have holomorphic log symplectic structure with simple normal crossing singularities, then its imaginary part of that is going to be an elliptic symplectic structure. So this defines for you one of these self-crossing stable generations. For you, one of these self-constantly stable generalized complex structures. Just as the example here. Okay, well, there are generalized complex reasons why one would be interested in these structures. And our big goal, in a sense, was to construct examples of these structures. Not any kind of examples, we really want examples where this degeneracy locus is embedded. And what we'll see today why it's good to first go to a bigger class. First, go to a bigger class where this degeneracy tokens is out to be immersed because it will be easier to construct. But then you might ask, okay, why would we want to construct this? Well, there are generalized complex reasons, physical reasons, but I'd like to give you one Poisson reason. This is this result by Pavocanti and Krainek. Well, the other day we had some like twenty, thirty estimates of when a result of Krainek would come out. I mean I leave it to your imagination, wonders why it should be there. Imagination one is why to reappear. This one stays very nice. It states that if you have one of these stable generalized complex structures with embedded general symbols, then out of it you can cook up a co-rank one Poisson structure or co-dimension one syntactic coordination. So what you do is you pick the canonical bundle of this generalized complex structure. So the generalized complex structure is in particular a complex Dirac structure. Then you can pick its canonical bundle. If you don't know what it is, A canonical bundle. If you don't know what it is, it's some kind of complex line bundle of the manifold. So it's a complex line bundle, so you can take its associated circle bundle. And then this statement states that you will get one of these codimation once and vector foremost. And trying to construct examples of these beasts, these codimes once in vector forecasts is something which is pretty downhard. It's been very difficult to find examples of these. For instance, it was only proven about 10 years ago that we actually have one of these on the five. That we actually have one of these on the five scale. And this was a result by Mitsumatsu. And using this result, you can re-obtain, for instance, Mitsumatsu's S5. By using a stable generalized complex structure on CQ2, you're able to cook up this codimion on CQ2 for the H. I think that's a cute piece of motivation for can we get any other diversions for you? Any other diagnosis for you? Can you get any other digital? No. If only, if only. But I mean, we would really like to have a stable generalized context structure with embedded regenerative local results. CP, well, I'd say 4, but we don't know whether that exists one. If we would have one, we would get seven, so that also tells you that probably it's pretty hard to find one of these examples. Still, if anyone. Still, if anyone ever manages, please do the other one. Any questions up to this point? So, you just have a CP4, but if you take just some form of the syntactic extract from CP4, it doesn't really simple to find examples. Make sure you kind of do that right now. It's very simple to find examples. It's very simple to find examples, for instance, on CB2N. But let me write this, and then if it has answered your question, not answered your question, then you can ask again. So I'll just consider C P to N as the C star quotient, and I'll consider the holomorphic Poisson structure. I'll use Q for holomorphic Poisson. Q for all normal platform. Z1, EZ1, actually Z2, EZ2 is standard. Well, it's not a log symplectic structure because it's normal degenerate. 2n minus 1, minus 1, which z2n vz yeah. So that this Poisson structure on C2n plus 1 minus 0. C to n plus 1 minus the origin, you immediately see that this guy is invariant and rescaling, so it descends to a Poisson structure on Cp to N, and this guy is holomorphic logs. So, in particular, we will imagine it part will be quantitative elliptic symptomatics of this. But its general C locus is precisely the coordinate hyperbase in the CDM. So, it's very simple to cook up an example of one of these self-crossing holomorphic box and factory structures with one finding one on CB4 with an embedded degeneracy locus. Embedded degeneracy locus? It's impossible. It's impossible. I mean, for holomorphic log symptoms, it's impossible, but we had this discussion also during the discussion session. We have this classification that you can do this fano business. I'm 100% sure you can do a stable generalized complex structure. I mean, I think I don't think so, but not 100% sure. Does it answer your question? Right, so so you just one device I think is one smooth component and that's it. That's what you need to imply this result of GovHub in CRAINIC and that would be like the nicest possible. But yeah, it's difficult to find examples, but it's easy to find examples with this more general crossing behaviour. And quite similarly you can find Quite similarly, you can find, well, using the same starting situation, you can, for instance, do CP1 times CP1, get one of these holomorphic log symplectic structures. You can also get S1 times S3, not holomorphic log symplectic, but it will have one of these state which are highly complex structures, using the same kind of construction. So, okay, it's simple to cook up examples of these structures. Uh now I'd like to discuss why these elliptic syntactic structures are nice. One of the things which makes them, like in my opinion, pretty cool is that they behave well with connected with respect to connected cells. And that will be the next part of the talk. So we saw this today as well, that if you're looking at all of Mortal Blocks in Paraguay structure, that there is no unique local form, but you can find the required data to describe local forms around the point. To describe local forms around the point, and these are these bioresidues which we call as logic. You can also define them, you have a couple more of them, because you need to look at the bi-residues of Mycola. He was looking at the singular, define them as an integral, but in local coordinates they were like the coefficients of these singular generators. So these were the byte residues. So, this is where the byte residues we call that. And now, similarly, if we want to describe normal forms or elliptic syntactic forms, we would have to look at all the possible combinations of these guys, log R, the I, the J, etc. If I have a given, a given elliptic Have a given elliptic symplectic form. If I want to prescribe its normal neighbourhood around a given point, then what I would have to do is I would have to look at these coefficients. I get these residues, and those all together will prescribe for me a lower form. What's somewhat funny is that depending on what kind of these residues are zero or non-zero, the behavior of the structures can be very different. Very different. So for today, I'll cut to the chase rather than saying about which residues I want to be zero or not, and then giving you a normal form, I'll define the structures I want to consider by the normal form. It's a bit dirty, but it gets the job done. So I'm particularly interested in looking at around the Around this point of intersection. And perhaps I should also say, from now on, for the rest of the talk, I'll restrict myself to four dimensions. It just makes life easier and the constructions which I'm talking about that work also there. So I have on a gap, on a four-dimensional, an elliptic form, on a four-dimensional manifold, and I'll be looking at this second struct. So now this is just a collection. So now this is just a collection of points. So I look at the point ben and I call omega nice around this point if there exist coordinates such that x1, y1, x2, 2, such that in these coordinates, Such that in these coordinates omega is of the following form. Or if you want, you can again go back to the logs in Blecter case. And I want to consider the real part of the Consider the real part of these logs and one, logs at two. But I'm also allowing for some scalar to appear over here. I mean, this is an invariant of the structure, you can manage to get rid of it. So, okay, these are the structures I want to consider. I call them nice, because I have a reasonable app, because what's so nice about them is that they behave well with respect to taking connected subs. With respect to taking connected subs. Well, I suppose I have omega 1, omega 2, elliptic sync on two manifolds, and one. Two. I have that, I have picked two points, p1, so let me denote it. I'll pick the point. I'll pick one point in the second stratum of the degeneracy locus of M1 in the second structure, the degeneracy locus of omega 2. And I assume that both omega 1 is nice at B1 and omega 2 is nice at is nice at V2. And I furthermore put an assumption on this coefficient, namely that the coefficient at this point f of the one is minus the other. I mean if you can always just ignore this because we're dealing with two different manifolds and we scale one of the syntactic forms so that it's satisfied. It's not a real condition, then the conclusion is that if I take the connected sum of these manifolds, why do I call them n and of n? Hello? At these points, and this inherits an elliptic symptomatic structure. And moreover, if I for instance include N1 minus P in here, then this map preserves the elliptic sync structure. One which I have here, which I have later. So this is quite amazing, surprising in a way. Let me just draw you a picture of the connected sum procedure. Connected some procedure. So I want to go about proving this. And it's, I mean, the way I've set everything up is actually quite simple. I suppose. Two manifolds. These are all four-dimensional, of course. You just can draw that. So if I want to. So, if I want to take a connected sum, what do I do? I pick two disks around a given point. I remove one, I remove the red disc, then I'm left with an annulus. If I want to do the connected sum, what you do is you identify this annulus with this annulus via a map that always goes for it. Right? I mean, in this case, it would really be straight. Right, I mean, in this case, you would really stretch it out, sit in there. This is what happens. And then you identify these two pieces together. You get yourself manifold. So the orientation is important here, by the way. Hold back in a second. Hold back in a second. And suppose I want to do this symplectically, or elliptic symplectically, what I would need. Well, I would need an F with the property that on this green part, it would pull back. it would pull back, let's call this one n2, add one, omega one, omega two to omega one n3. If I have that, well then this construction is symplectic and therefore the resulting manifold will inherit. And doing this right now is not particularly difficult. You just well because we have this local moment for you just write that You just write out a map. And it just becomes a tedious but straightforward exercise to show that this actually works. Just this map, Z1, FZ in complex coordinates, Z1, Z2, Z1, Z2 bar, divided by Z1 squared, Z2 squared. This works. It's a miracle. And this is great because now we have a really nice way of cooking up examples. For instance, we can just pick the CP2 we started with, and I'll draw it suggestively in a rhetoric way. Oh, here there is a point of intersection. And I can keep going like this. And I'll get uh a little disymatic structure of it like the sum of the CPTs. Now I can just keep on going. I just give you a very small list of examples. For instance, CP2. CP2 and by combining all these things, I can get a pretty big list of examples of these structures. Is there something called a special point after you put that together similar to your Yes, so I mean so that's that's the that's the entire the way how you go about improve this and what's nice so I didn't say but I didn't say, but for instance, in this example of CP2, you have that the structure is nice at all these three points. And if I take the connected sum, which say itself, then what happens to the degeneracy locus? Well, two of these points will be cancelled, but the rest will remain. And I haven't done anything away from a small neighborhood. So if these points were nice, So, if these points were nice, these will remain nice. And I can just repetitively keep applying the theorem. Exactly. So, there are a couple of things you can see in this thing. So, for instance, you can start with S2 steps S2, and then you can do two things. You can either start connecting some manifold manifolds, different manifolds, or you can start doing a connected sum with itself. And that has the effect of doing a connected sum with an S one times S three. Some with an S1 times S3, topologically. That's a nice topology exercise. So, indeed, if you do that, you'll get these examples. And similarly, here you'll get, you can also do some blow-ups, and they'll get examples. So there's conditions when they exist and when they correspond to stable generalized complex structures. Okay, and now I'm really not going to make everything what I wanted to say, but Everything what I wanted to say, but try at least something. So the last thing which I wanted to state is that given we can always go back. We already have this picture up during the discussions session. If I have one of these a stable. Is a stable cell processing. One of these nice, if I have one of these elliptic symplectic structures which is nice at all points, or stable, it's of course a stable general symbolic structure, then a small deformation Around the second button will turn itself crossing stable structure. Structure with embedded generic objects. And, well, the theorem or just behind the board, we already kind of saw this part of this discussion of four dimensions, these locally around these points in D2. Locally, around these points in D2, this is the picture of how the singularity set looks like. And well, obviously, the singularity cell itself I can locally deform into something of this form. And it turns out you can do this modification also with the Poisson structure, this elliptic symplectic structure. You do this locally around the twenty-pole points, you'll be able to remove all the singularities and get. And get that if you have one of these self-crossing stable structures, you can actually have one of these within that general securities. So you can apply this to all these examples, and then you get all these very nice, stable, generous complex structures. And then you can also, for instance, apply this result by Marius and Geo, and then you get a bunch of co-dimensional symptomatic variations. And then you're happy. And then, well, yeah. So I wanted to say. So, I wanted to say a bit of how all this helps in understanding the duality, which is a virtual mirror symmetry. But given the fact that I'm out of time, I probably should stop. But I would advertise, I will be talking about this on Monday in Madrid. So, if you're interested, to happen to be around, you can go to that later. All right, thank you for your attention. Questions? Questions? So the deformation that you use to make a singular structure into a non-singular one is obviously changing the isomorphism type of the structure. Yes. What about the connected sum? Sorry, what I mean is, what about the connected sum? Is there a parameter that changes since isomorphism, right? Or is it canonical once you make this? Take two structures. Take two structures, take a connected sum. Does it matter how big the annulus is? How big the annulus is? No, I don't think so. I think indeed you can. They're all isomorphic, is what it is. Yeah, I think if you did, you can do the root. So, yeah, okay, so this is actually a good point. So, it's also here this matters a bit. The size of the angles really doesn't matter precisely because you have this very invariant normal form. That's something local. You're saying something local, right? Sure. The entire manifold may have a volume. The entire manifold may have a volume. Sure. Sure. Does it change? No, no, because I have to say this. So I think you can pick, because your structure itself is invariant, you can pick your size of this disk which you want, as big as you want, with the thing. So there is no parameter in that. Any other questions? Any other questions? Any other questions? I have another question. So you mentioned six, or eight. What do you think is the difficulty if you just proceed? If you try to do the same thing, what happens? The bad answer, of course, is try to do the computation and see that it feels horrible. Somehow, what kind of happens, but is it a problem in the connected sum, or is it a problem with? In the connected sum, or is it a problem with the connected sum? So, but I think, so I have to say that the point being, I think the fact that we're dealing with, we're looking at random points where this is happening, and the fact that we're dealing with some codimension, like the normal bundle of this thing is a codiment to complex space. I think that's really what helps you improving this thing. This particular map is what makes everything. Makes everything work nicely. So I think it would actually be possible to try to come up with a construction in six-dimension, but you would not be gluing points together, but you would have to gluing coordination two things together. So there should be a coordination for operation around it. Real coordination four. I was going to ask you something that's probably connected with that. something that's probably connected with that which is have you tried to look at dead twists in higher dimension to try to dead twists with things uh so they take uh yeah they appear like when you're studying like there's one way of making these things with vibrations and compatible with some singular vibrations and they're like the monoharmies which are appearing are precisely the databases. But like the symplectic procedure Like, I mean, yeah, you can always do something symplectically away from the degeneracy codes, right? But I mean, I don't know. Yeah, no, but I haven't tried to do something like that, but that, yeah, construction like that would be possible. Not to lift to the spherical law. Is that premium why it was nice to go? So what you can I mean what you can always do you can blow up this degeneracy locus. Yeah you can take the re so what you can always do is you can take the reoriented blow up of this degeneracy locus and what you'll get is a loxyflectic thing. And those move as you would be interested. The boundaries there, I guess so, in this memory, yeah. They're dealing with corners. Yeah, I think Yeah, I think there might actually be a way of describing some of the simplest feature here. Yeah, but I'm uh yeah I mean like the blow-up blows up the entire thing, not just the perhaps you can also just blow up the if you just blow up the point in a manner you get a bit of an odd structure because it will still have elliptic singularities along D and it will have kind of log singularities along this DC which you've just blown up. It's a bit of a strange duck which you're working with but I guess you can Are you working with that? So the values together between forty five  It would be like a large record without the boundary. Otherwise, that would work. But then you just put them together and put them together along the boundary, exactly. Yeah, still a bit. That would be decent. And then you can scroll down that well I think just you have to do it. It's just that. It's just that. We'll have a three-speed curve in there. Which is not degeneracy focus. Yeah, but I didn't get to the things we discussed. So yeah, sorry, so when I said that it's a decent snapdraft. Probably just like a lot of something to manifold with boundary, where the boundary is not transverse. I was just saying that one way you could do it is to sterical log of point three. Then what would you get? You would get something that's log symplectic on the outside, and with boundary. The boundary, however, is just like it's it's not it's not a degeneracy focus. It's not a degeneracy focus. Then you have these two spheres which are these boundaries and you're just equivalent together. You could literally lay together without having any overlap in a way, just like the primary things that you know.
