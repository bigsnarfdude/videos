Actually, this ambition what I want talk about is mainly about the of the free DFG and the subsist DFG. So the title is much located now. So which is the form of the very big ambition. Actually, when I first be first ABS graduated, I told to my boss that what I want to do is What I want to do is try to use quantum mechanics to describe the real world. I don't know how hard it is, but that is a real season. And then, you know, in 135 years, and SIES Journal proposed the 135 big challenge for normal human beings, and they are smart. One of them is fit my ambitions. Of course, it's very difficult. That is the can we actually simulate? Accurately simulate the macro and the micro world. I think that's not our ambitions. So, what's the key point for this? We know for small system, we have quantum mechanics. We can do such these easily for the macro world if system larger than quantum effective subsidies in the system. So, finally, we can use the classical stuff to deal with it. But for the massive scale system, But for the massive scale systems, on one hand, we have a quantum effect, right? And another means that for such systems, there are many real materials, actually. If we want to simulate, we need to law less, a lot of time at a quantum effect. I'd like clearly that some very simple cases like the aluminum side effect, we need to maybe, if we want to simulate it, maybe up to the million atoms for the nuclear process of. For the nuclear process of a lithium, we can need to the nanoscale second. So it's really a lot stuff. You're boasting less at the time for quantum mechanics simulations. Okay, since we want to consider about the quantum effect, so we need to use the quantum effects. It's a very simple principle. We can see that. Okay, it's very useful, but most of case, it's useless. Okay, it's useless, right? We cannot use it, it's limited due to the computational complexity. We know, we also, everyone knows that the DFT is the smart guy, then they propose DFT is much reduced the computational cost that it can the computational complexity from the order into the explanation complexity to the order. To the auto reduced. But it seems that we can solve everything because every system we can write in the total energy functional as the only saving to construct the so-called energy functionals. But the problem is that how to implement of the OFDFC in practice way. So I think the first one, first way is very Firstly, it's very famous. Everyone knows that the cultural scheme can be regarded as one of the most successful scheme in the past maybe one half century. And maybe we can directly remove the one of them. It's the most successful, right? So, but in most cases, the less scale use quotum DFT is limited to thousands of atoms, and time scale may be limited to the P second. Scale may be limited to the P-circuit. Of course, sometimes some software wants to show their muscles, they can simulate hundreds of thousands. It's also possible, but in the muscle case, it's limited to thousands. So it's far from our ambitions. Actually, the quotient DFT, they want to escape the construction of the anti-functionals easily. Yeah, easy way so they use the other so-called y orbitals. Actually, the orbitals we know is not necessary. If we directly face the original challenges in DFT, how about construction of the kinetic energy functional that deal with this set to the culture of DFT that we have many experience to describe the extra correlation functionals. So, what we need to do is just to construct the noise. To construct the non-interactive kinetic functionals. And with this one, we can simulate millions of atoms U1 CPUs, and Kelly told you guys this morning. And actually, if we use many CPUs, we can simulate one more than 100 million atoms. It's not an ambition, it's a fact, and we did it successfully. So, in this way, we can say that we can get our ambitions. Our ambitions in terms of the computational cost, but the most challenging is still the accuracy, how to improve the accuracy, to make it really predictive. Actually, we know kinetic energy factor is the central of the OFDFT, but we did a lot, but still, still it's limited. So actually, we have another reason to escape. With them to escape this, try to reduce the challenges of construct accurate kinetic functional like subsys DFT, use a strategy that divided at the conqueror. And for small system, we can use the well-developed quantum DFT. But the interaction for this weak interaction, we can describe by the so-called non-additive kinetic analytic functionals. And with this scheme, we can still get the quasi-linear scaling computer. Quasar linear scaling computational cost with increased number of system and number of process compared to the typical quotient DFT stuffs. Okay, I think preference this stuff everyone knows. So I just to remind you, I want to begin with a very, very easy things. And now I want to talk about the recently like six, eight years work in my career. And I want to And I want to talk about these old stories in a new way and try to summarize what we did and what we need to do next. So let's begin with our optical 3DMT. Okay, everyone knows that of the 3DFT, the most challenging is the kinetic energy function. Okay. But you know, if we have exact kinetic energy, okay, everything is exact. So there is nothing, everything is very, very simple. But you practice, we all But in practice, we also need the pseudo-potato method. The way the reason we use pseudo-potato is not like quote-de-DFT that we want to reduce computational cost. I think the most needed is that we want to reduce the complexity of the construct reliable kinetic energy. So that's still a very challenging stuff. Okay. So basically, we can see that the KDF, of course, is the central. Of course, is the central challenge of WebDFT. And how to evaluation the IO-electron interaction also are challenged. Yeah, that we can call it the pseudo-potential stuff. And actually, these two stuff can be solved. I think it's a technical. Nowadays, it's already not a challenge. So that's the everything still, right? Okay. Okay, how about the state of the KDF? Okay, we actually everyone knows that the development of the kinetic energy functional even earlier than the exchange correlation functionals at one about 100 years ago, we from LDA to GGA to non-local. Right? Many, many functionals. I just lost some of them, but the general KDF is still a major issue in application or FDFT. I said many times, I know, but we have two. I know, but we have to stress this, right? Okay. Then we want to know what the universal and executive KDF should be like. I can Eliopa and other guys talk about this stuff this morning, but I was just actually at Kohn proposed the DFT idea in 1964. They already proved that, also, measure about that. Also, measure about that in general the kinetic energy should be non-local, right? And actually, we can summarize, I can rewrite it very simple way, and all the complexity we can absorb using the so-called kernel, right? The interesting thing is that a kernel has a physical meaning. It's not just a mathematical trick, like if we describe non-local functionals, mathematical. functionals you mathematical way we can find is a double integration some plus but of course we can include many complexity using the so-called kernel and the kernel actually describes the interactions between the two point two different points in space right and interestingly this stuff also can be related to the second derivative of the kinetic energy function with respect to the electrodes so now it seems the So now it seems the formula is here. So it's the right way we need to construct the non-local functional. But the value that we told y'all also proved that we have the non-local formula, but the complexity is infinite. So what we need to do? So I know some guys do LDA, some guys do GGA, some guys do machine learning. So even a local field, I think most standards. I think most strategy at the very beginning, people doing is like, okay, we can try to write on the local formulas with some parameters, and we can impose some conditions, then to determine these parameters. These are very normal strategies. Then we want to, if we have another strategy to construct kinetic, non-local kinetic functionals, so we want to. And so we want to use another strategy. As I mentioned, that we know that there are very physical meanings for the kernel. So why we not start from the physical meaning kernel to the potassium and from potassium to the energy? It will be more meaningful. And in this way, we do not need to set any parameter at the very beginning. And if needed, then we deal with it. Okay, based all these logic. Okay, based on this logical Mikely actually guide me and after this field that we want to step by step to exploit. So step one, we want to try a very, very simple stuff. As I mentioned, we know the kernel should be density depended and who knows what's the formula it is, right? We want to start from very simple stuff. Make the density is a GDP of kernel. It's simple. GDP of kernel. It's simple. We just use the average of the electrodesity. This stuff is similar as other stuff, okay? Nothing new, but the standard is from the kernel to potential, from potential to energy. That's all. That's our strategy. How about the results? The interesting thing is that we can found that even use the UD padded kernel, we can still get some nice results. Some nice results compared to WGC that's dependent. HC, that's dependent results. Okay, it was sometimes better that this. It means that this render is useful. Why we go further? Actually, this work is not by me. I guess by my collaborators, I define it's their step is defined as step two because they were twice a slightly dependent of the kernel density. The kernel density. Because the unfortunate strategy, we want to use this strategy, but from the electron from zero to the real density, it's a lot of variations. And finally, we get our density independent kind of stuff. But they integrations from the average of the density to the real density, it's much reduced the flexible of the reactor density. And finally, I don't know how to show more details, but finally, we get a utility result. Finally, we get a interesting result that one, zero-order can be regarded as the very famous WT functionals, and the first order terminal has the best slightly dependent kernel. Okay, in this way, they can get some better results. Even for this simple metallic system is okay for this functional is all well, especially for the CD silica, it's a kind of semiconductor. A kind of semiconductors, we can get better results compared to WTE, WTC. It seems that this functional works really good. I always think this may be a kind of one of the most functionals for the free electrolyte systems at some times is semiconductors. Okay, what about furthermore? Then we added to the step three. Step three is a very Step three is a very simple idea that previously we want to use the desk, like the first step, we use the destiny-debt kernel. But now, if we consider the, how about we consider about the local density debated? Why we do such things? Because for the box system, it's fine. Also, there are meaning that for the average of reliable density. But for the finite system, such as clusters, quantum dots, such systems, actually, there is no. That is actually, there is no meaning of the LD density. So, we want to make the kernel local density dependent. That is simple, and we can do it directly, right? But you know, if we do it directly, it's straightforward. But the problem is the computational cost will be quadratic scale. It will be so expensive and useless. So, we finally find a way, we call that the numerical. A way we call that the numerical LDA scheme that to consider a local density-debated effect is a kernel. And how about results? That we actually test this finite system for metal cluster at the semiconductor quantum dots. It's pretty good. So it seems that this strategy is really useful. Actually, after this, Michelle also talked about this morning. Also, talk about is this Moriad we use the so-called FGPC KDF FDA user interface, nanoparticle, quantum DOS, surface, and so on. So I think it's really open to study, use of the free DFT study systems is not just limited to simple metallic system, especially for the bulk systems. Okay. Okay. Should we go to the step four? Yeah, I think because till now we can do many many stuffs, but still limited. We really need to the step four. So why we not consider more complexity KDFs, right? We can consider more the correlations or stuffs in the kernels, but wait, you know, in our North functional, it's already the double integrations. The double integrations, if we do not adopt any techniques, it should be called quadratic scale at least. And we should censor to the techniques of FFT, use the numerical SPLY techniques. We much reduce the computational cost. Actually, we already, I think we already do the limitation of the complexity of the key local functionals, because if we impose Because if we impose more complexity stuff, it will destroy us. The KDF will really kill us because the computer culture will be more expensive with cultural DFT. But nowadays, we find some DL, maybe we can have a try, and I will talk it at the very end. So please wait. And let's back to the pseudo-potential problems. Okay, everyone knows it's pseudo-potential. Everyone knows it's suitable that I already taught. And actually, in 2012, 2017, in the review paper, he mentioned about the remaining challenge of WebDFT is to construct LPPG from the already exist non-local pseudo-potential without any FIT or stuff. That's all. Actually, we based on these aims. We did some works and we based on the OEP method. Actually, it is to Actually, it is too vain to construct the exchange correlation functional, so I want to show details. But we use the same strategy to try to construct the local optimal local pseudo potential from the existing local pseudo-potentials. Okay, results seem good because we can get the good results as others best pseudo-potential BLPS, but without any parameters. Okay, I don't want to I don't want to talk about how good or how bad, but I think the most important thing in our OEPG paper work, we want to show a color map for the elements. The mostly that we found that actually for given elements, if there exists a good quality local suitable potential, sometime somehow it's independent from the scheme you adopted. Scheme you adopted, it's a heuristic property. So, you know, for most of the SP systems, we can construct the transferable local potentials, however, which way you used. But for some guys, like these traces metals have D orbits, 3D, 2B orbitals, 4F, no way. This is the conclusions. So, what we do? So, what we do? We should close the OFDFT section? Oh, no, wait. That we want to strangle for the last time. So, actually, we found that because of the 3DFT, we do not have projectors. This stuff cannot use. Actually, we can rewrite it in a density metric space. This way, we do not need the projectors. As the core idea is that we try to construct. The idea is that we try to construct the density functionals to represent the density matrix and use other formulas. The idea is like that we want to have a try and we use into studies like the very simple metallic system. It works well, right? Much better than preverse OEPG or these stuffs. And we also do the MD. It seems the traceability is okay. The traceability is okay for this simple metallic system. This year, we also try to the semiconductors, we get better results. But be careful. This is just the positive part. I show you guys also have many negative parts. The negative part is that the accuracy of this scheme is also determined by the density functionals. So now we know the limitation is this stuff is also suited. Is this stuff also suitable for the SP block systems? And I can give you guys a conclusion. The conclusion is that if for the SP systems, you give a score for your local potential, maybe you can give 80% and use LPP, you can get 90% or 95, that's all. But if for the traditional metal or other stuff, you have a local stuff you have a local stable potential it's scroll like 20 30 user ppf maybe still that stuff so what i said so this is a still stuff okay the method developer i i should for web developer i should uh stop now for a while and we talk about the atlas code actually we are we are developed the atlas code for managers more than 10 Atlas code for many years, more than 10 years. And okay, basically, we can now do the static analytical calibration, structural relaxation, MD simulation. All this stuff is okay. I show some cases we can do them 100 million atoms, like with thousand processor and with five hours with non-local functionals. We have better scaling. And we also have the diameter optimized. Have the diameter optimization. Actually, we implemented most of the advanced algorithm and do some benchmarks. It's already very stable. And we also do MD, include all the assemble systems. Okay. So that's why we also do some like toy applications like the alumina sol solidification we we simulate is us uh up to uh nanosecond at the Nanosecond adds the number of atoms to the 10,000 atoms. Okay, now I want to this one to say that in terms of the computational cost, we really get the stage that do a mass cross gape simulations, we can recover the quantum, most of the quantum effect. But the only thing that we still need to improve the accuracy of these stuffs. That's my point. My point. This is my store atlas actually since 2011 and to now we keep doing it. Okay, so now back to the one. Till now that is user OFDFT, we can do some calculations for element like this stuff is okay, somewhere is available, but you have to be careful because you don't know the transfer. Know the transferability of these stuffs. And our aims is, of course, we hope that one day we can do all these stuffs. I think it's also everyone's aim. Okay, now I stop the OFDFT part. I begin to the SDFT. Because we know that the pseudo-potential is local pseudo-potential part really restricts the application of OFDFT. Actually, for the substitute view, there is not such a restriction. Such changes because we can directly adopt the non-local stop tension using substance DFT. Because you each system, we can use core DFT. That's maybe an alternative choice for the large-scale simulations. And actually, before NAVR works, there are many works in the subsidy DFT, but they play with them in the TJA level. Thesis is that most of these cases, we can find that. Of this case, we can found that it's not only can much reduce the computation of the column DFT, it also can improve the accuracy of this stuff. I'll discuss it later why it is. So it seems good. But we know user SDFT is the only affirmation compared to the quotient is the so-called non-additive kinetic anti-functionals, actually. So we back to the key df. So we want to have a try. Previously, I said that SDFT can work well for some weak interactive system from these figures. We can see yes, use the GGA functional Ruby PBK. It can work very well for the weak interactions. But for the store interactions, with the distance of two subsystems close to each other, it failed. So we adopt. So when we adopted our non-local subtitles, it seems it can much improve the accuracy of such stuff, especially for the stronger interactions systems. And we also test the absolute error, absolute difference between the code on DFT stuff. And we also get the better result. It seems that it's not by accident, it's really improved the performance of the. It's really improved the performance of the SDFT. And how about electrodes? We know most of functionals, not most, maybe a lot of functionals, they can perform well in the energy, but not in the good electrodesity. So we also do benchmarks. The conclusion is that we really also improve the performance generating the electrodesity. And moreover, that we test some molecule crystal stuff. Molecule, crystal stuffs, the utility. We really, for the substance DFT, it really can improve the accuracy of the quotient DFT. You can see this is a regular quotum D with PBD functional. This is use the SDFD PB. This is for the local function extended correlation. And we use the non-local telexial correlation with the non-local functionals. We always get better results. Get better results. Another is that we have found a molecule correct. So, these guys, and we know that DFT, all DFT method is failed, cannot reproduce the correct energy of order. But luckily, we use this stuff. Although the absolute error is there, but the order of the energy is correct. So, it means that in such a way that we cannot. In such a way that we can not only increase the computational speed, also can improve the accuracy. And based on such benchmarks, we can found that it's not by accident. Actually, for most of such systems, we can use the subsidy DFT. It cannot only improve the accuracy, also can reduce the computer cost. Okay, and we also Okay, and we also coded it in the EQE2 and we compared the computational cost with the conventional code from DFT. It's much reduced. Actually, now Mikeli and Sha Chin, they also coded in Python, EDFT Py, DFT Py. If you guys interested, you can play with it. But user the password is installed is very easy, but but a kind of is not very user-friendly compared to EDAFTP. Readily compared to EDAP TPAC. So it's an old version, but the idea is there. Okay, and after that, actually, my collaborator is especially Xian Chen and Michelle did a lot of work. They further developed the new KDF to improve the performance of the SDFT and also do the OFDFT embedded with COTROM DFT. Do Martin also do the ADFT subsystem? We know that subsystem if the We know that some system, if the interaction of system is too strong, that maybe all functional is failed. But if you use this stuff, they can be regarded as one system. If they separate, we can use subsystems. I think this method will be very useful. It's a great work. So I highlight it here. Okay, let's back up. Basically, we developed some method for WebDFT for some CDFT. For WebDFT, for sub-CDFT. But the most involved CIC on our field, we urgely need to identify research errors where OFDFD can be most effective utilized to achieve widespread application. That's my ambition. And we know we use OFT, do some stuff, we do warm dust matter, we do some simple metals. But I think we cannot just leave. I think we cannot just limit it here. Maybe we should work together to push it to make it more widely used. That's the aims or ambitions of this our workshop that we can change our ideas. So the interest is that this guide cause preference will talk about the precipice, but this chemistry stuff also begins to interest in our stuff like this review. Like this review about the growth state, and another one we review on reviews the growth state, finite temperature, and the time-dependent stuff with our collaborators. Okay, what about another my group? Actually, my group also tried to do some out-of-free DFT plus Ivan beyond covision of DFT. Because I also know that it's really limited. If we follow the regular way, it's hard. It's so hard. It's hard, it's so hard to make OFT really very, very useful. So we try some stuff. We see that have some trust. Finite temperature, especially for warm dust matter, and time-depaired OFDFT, if we couple with Maxwell equations, just as Michelle said this morning, a sum of fields we begin to add. Another thing that is to the machine learning of the 3DFT. The main idea is this. This guy does such as we try to do the NR do not use machine learning. We try to use novel ideas to do novel limitations and the rest of the complexities leave it to the machine learning. That's the best ideas. This guy does not do the presentation, but I asked him to prepare some slides. If you guys interested in this field, we can discuss it. And this guy will. And this guy will discuss about our recently work. And this guy is doing some new schemes of FDFT. Okay, let's back to the step four. I have a crazy idea. I discussed with Michelle yesterday, actually, we have a very simple try because any time we get a kind of steady limitation to Limitation to make the functional more sophisticated, but we have to consider about the computer cost. Now, in this field, like Mike, I mean that we do like OESF stuff, try to reduce the computational cost of non-local functionals. But it's there. One way we want to make the functional is more reasonable, one way we consider about the computational cost. It's very, very hard. It's very, very hard. And we use a very simple stuff that the idea is similar to the TB, but very, very roughly appropriate. The good thing is that we use this very roughly stuff, we get very excellent results for simple metal and box system. At first, we think it works well. Okay, it's just that Kelly said, I can say, but we try semicolon cluster. It's excellent. Why I say exactly? Because we do benchmarks. They are even. They are even better than the original functionals. But the computer cost is okay. Wow. So I think about these days, I said, maybe we can find a way to construct the more sufficient KDF because we do not do much type calculations. So maybe next step we need to try CAT or similar stuff to fully debated local functionals. Let's see what. Let's see what will happen. I hope we have some utilist results. And another way is that in this strategy, we can directly use the local stup potential. We can escape the limitation of local stupidity. I think it's also a great way. We are all going to test it. Hopefully, get some. Okay, you should be all detailed on the last day of the talk. And another thing that I mentioned about in the step two, we they In the step two, they developed the Schwarma functionals. I think that was very suitable for the near-uniform gas systems. Actually, based on this idea, that we want to why we do it on the warm design system. Because in that case, it's really such like the free electrogas uh like systems. So we want to try. I can tell you guys, this work is the only one, only one. only one only one till now that i think the result should be look like that and it turned out right i'm right and this functional is really kind of suitable for a broad range of one decimal simulations and actually much did a lot of benchmarks we believe it is very be very useful for warm decimal simulations and consider about computational cases that sam said this morning that non-local functional is super expensive That the local functional is super expensive. Actually, for finance, it's not really true because actually we test, we compare with the POM3. Actually, they are almost same. Almost same. Why? Because the functional is more reasonable. So the number of self-consideration is much less than other, some functional, some LDAs, some TDA. So I think we have. So, I think we have a great chance to do some application. If you guys have some good system to study, we can collaborate. Okay, tomorrow we all detail the other last day. Oh, I don't know how much time I have. Okay, I should thanks to my friends, my supervisor, Yemin, and also special thanks to Michelle. I learned a lot from. Really, I learned a lot from him. I stole many ideas from him. So, and these guys are our golden collaborators for many years. So, and also our PhD cadets and all members of Math Group at the PRG. And I enjoy the very, very exciting time, both in Math Group and PRG. And thank you, everyone.
