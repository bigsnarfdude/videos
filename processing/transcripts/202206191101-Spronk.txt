He's my former PhD supervisor. I'm sure that he's known for other things as well, but that's clearly the most important. And Nico is going to be talking to us today about amenability from operator algebras to algebras of harmonic analysis. Oh, thank you, Matthew. Well, you know, you're actually one of my largest contributions to the world, so I'm very grateful, in fact. You know, speaking of people who've contributed to the world, I'm the last in-person speaker, although Surat follows me. So let me just. Folllows me, so let me just really extend my gratitude to Keith and Brian who worked in the background, especially Folker, who was not in the background and is here. So, thank you, sir. This has been just brilliant. All right, so I have a talk prepared that I've decided to sort of make a kind of an overview talk. So, I promise several things. The talk has too much content. I will go very quickly, and I'll be really spartan with the details. So, bear with me. So, bear with me. Alright, so now, of course, one problem with having Folker here is I'm not the expert in the room on immutable monic algebras. He is clearly Folker. So he's written a really, really good book. It's called Immutability, a Panorama. But this is the first major concept as it pertains to Bonach algebras. So let's just recall that the projection. So, you know, let's just recall that the projective tensor product is our device for sort of linearizing bounded bilinear maps. That's what it does for a loop. And so our context here is let's live in the projective tensor product. I'll say my Bonach algebra is amenable if it has one of these nice bounded approximate digits. This was featured, for example, in John's talk and implicitly in Yemen's talk. So, you know, I'm the kind of person, I actually prefer writer nuts to. And I actually prefer writer nuts to means, and I prefer bounded approximate diagonals to virtual diagonals. That's clearly a matter of taste. And it's equivalent that we have one of these to the fact that derivations, pardon me, I'm sorry, that derivations into dual modules are in there. And of course we do have to sort of stick with dual modules because all of the machinery that surrounds this is based on really Ali Abu's type theorem arguments. Algorithms type theorem argument. So you'll see that sort of dual modules have to feature very, very heavily when we talk about such things. Okay, so let me begin with certainly the most famous sequence of algebras to which one can imagine this type of theory, and this would be the C star algebras. And, you know, part of the purpose of this slide is just showing that amenability connects to extremely famous things that have to do with C star algebras. So based on, I guess, the vector space theory Takasaki, first turned algebra as Newton. First yearned algebra is nuclear when there's only really one possible choice of C star tensor product against any other algebra. That's a really nice thing, but it's quite external. And then there's a sort of more internal thing that's, I guess, an equivalence due to independently Ketchburgh and Choi Afros, which is this completely positive approximation properties. Almost factorization through finite-dimensional C-star algebra. So these would all characterize immunability. So if any point in the future one So, if at any point in the future one gets a little bit bored or distracted, this is a fun exercise. Prove for yourself that compact operators admit one of these bounded approximate diagons. That's given here. So, trying to figure out why anything I say is true. Notice that this really has a sort of correspondence with somehow the completely positive approximation property. I sort of, I doubt I'm alone in this. I maintain a fantasy that one could go. I've maintained a fantasy that one could go from one to three without going through two, but I've never actually worked out the details. Perhaps Foker has, I don't know. Yeah. Okay. So let me just talk about the joy of amenability. So this in part advertises stability properties of amenable algebras. So I have bounded homomorphisms to its range, but notice that I could have a non-amenable algebra embedded to an amenable algebra by the same token. By the same token, we can characterize ideals of immunable algebras which remain immunable, and this is through this sort of weak splitting property. And again, let me just highlight that we always have to kind of go to dual modules and dual spaces to do this stuff. And let me just remind you that there's no reason to expect that a sub-algebra of an immutable algebra a meet mean. Here's the disalgebra example, which is one every student of this theory should learn. Okay. Okay, so we talked a little bit about C-star algebras, or I did. And of course, it's also interesting to talk about an operator algebra. So for me, that's just a closed sub-algebra of BH. And this has been studied for compact operators by George Willis and his student, Frank Gifford. And Gifford sort of really made a lot of advantage in the so-called reduction property. And this reduction property was used featured very heavily by Markulipopoff. Very heavily by Markup Popov. And they showed that an immutable commutative operator algebra is necessarily not only isomorphic, but similar in the way it sits to some ambient C-star algebra. And of course, I'm defeating the question, but it is a general question to what degree is this true. There's at least one example in the literature. Yemen Choi has been here. He with Farad Ozawa had an example of an amenable operator algebra. Of an amenable operator algebra that is not isomorphic to a C-star algebra. And their example is intrinsically non-separable. So, actually, to my knowledge, and Yemen might be able to help me out at the end of this talk, I believe that question remains. I have a sense, based on an abstract I saw for a talk in Athens, that Yemen is still thinking about this, but he can confirm or disabuse me of this notion. Okay, so this is the story with the operator algebras. Story with the operator algebras, these types of operator algebras. Now, von Neumann algebras, typically, of course, they're quite big, right? These are weak star-closed self-adjoined algebras of B of H or the unit. And amenability or nuclearity, if you prefer, is not that common, like Deren Simon Rossi. So, but of course, the problem is, is when we think about a dual object like a Feynman algebra, we're just addressing the wrong topology. So, this is recognized. So, this is recognized a long time ago, not with this terminology. This terminology is thanks to Floker. Sorry? Halemsky. Khalemski. Ah, nice. Thank you, Floker. So we're going to call a von Neumann algebra conamenable if we have this sort of normal notion of derivations always being here. Okay, so what's the story of these? Let me give a partial account. So the partial account of the story of these. So the partial account of the story of these is that this condomitability, thanks to Mr. Guy here, Mr. Khan, is equivalent to lots of nice things, in part con, many, many people. But it's equivalent to injectivity, which is a really important property of fundamental algebras, which is equivalent to semi-discreteness, which is just sort of a normal version of our completely positive approximation. And then Efros and Kishi Moto gave a paper, and this has also worked out nicely in Fulbert's book, where there's a so-called, what I'll call Where there's a so-called, what I'll just call, a whole room, normal virtual jacket. Let me not get into the details of what this space is, but it's some space that has to kind of cope with, you know, the normalness of the types of bilinear forms I want. And we get this sort of interesting virtual diagonal, and then with some structure theory, it can be reduced to replace this curious whole world product, Ronics-based projective tensor product. Sometimes at the cost of a little bit of norm here, but I think FROS has all. Here, but I think F-ROS has also done more on this since. This is a really nice approach. And I actually have a secret reason for featuring the Holgra product because it is kind of an entry point to discussing why things work for operator immutability, which we'll come. Alright, so what's our relation between this injectivity nexus, this con-amenability with C-star algebra? Well, it's beautiful, obviously. C-star algebra is amenability. C-star algebra is amenable if and only if it's second dual. It's conamenable. It's all very good. Alright, now, you know, I'm kind of a simple person. There's a certain class of C-star algebras that I prefer. And they all look like that. Locally compact group, you make a C-star algebra. And one asks oneself, well, when is this amenable? It turns out there's lots of ways in which a C star algebra can be amenable. If G is amenable, almost connected, turns out Almost connected. Turns out type 1, such as algebraic over a local field, that's a pretty recent result of Acherhoff. And these are amenable. So there's a lot of non-amenable groups to which these are amenable. And to my knowledge, at the moment, there's no full characterization of when amenability of the C star algebra holds. For discrete groups, this is extremely well known. The immutability, for example, of a reduced C star algebra is equivalent to immutability of the underlying group. That's an older result. Of the underlying group. That's an old result of Lance. So let me just sort of throw in a little bit of bragging. So this is actually a result. The one in three equivalence is due to C. Kane, who's also a collaborator between us. But there was sort of a simple proof picked up by Brian, Matthew, and me. So we can show that the immutability of G is equivalent to the immutability of C G plus a condition. Star of G plus a condition, which is that. Of course, this is also, Huliniski's theorem is deeply in the nexus of our. You can't do this without Huliniski's theorem, which is the equivalent of these C-star algebras characterizing immutability. And Matthew, he pays attention to the good part of the literature and just recently noticed the following thing that we can do with some of the work we have. It's related to the work that we've done, is that we can actually. We've done is that we can actually learn a fair bit of things like when a C star algebra is immediate into an AF C star algebra. And in fact, we can also learn that for many imenable groups, the reduced C star algebra is quasi-diagonal. And this is probably a necessary condition for getting a reduced C-star algebra quasi-diagonal. There's lots of nice Lie examples doing the Bill Teaches that show that sometimes for certain solvable groups, a C-star algebra is not quasi-diagonal. Ceased algebra is not was a guy. So, um, this is quite a nice result. So, this is a paper we have just archived, so it is now available for public view. But the heavy lifting is not us. Mr. Schaffhauser, who's really a giant star now. Okay, let me change tone. Let me go to my happy place, which is harmonic analysis. So, without making sort of formal introduction of the objects, the way I like to see harmonic analysis is The way I like to see harmonic analysis is this sort of diagram that I think Zhongjin Wuan has been popularizing, you know, up to 10 years, 20 years ago. But I think it's a foyer mirror. Imagine there's a mirror right here. So this is my group world, right? There's a certain covariance between locally compact groups and L1 and G. It's in fact in certain unlimited ways very categorical. And then on the other side of the mirror, if I was like Ben and I had the courage of my convictions, this would be L1MG hat. L1 of G hat. But I'm going to call it A of G because I'm old-fashioned. But this is L1 of G hat from Ben's talk, this is so-called Fourier algebra. And there's just this beautiful sequence of relations. These are like function algebras that look nicely in other function algebras. These are convolution algebras, convolution operators and related things. Everything's just beautiful here. And really, the whole point of introducing things these ways is, you know, we sort of entertain this, you know, perhaps now, now even. Perhaps now naive fantasy that things that we can learn about in this world get reflected in this world and vice versa. Some sort of fantasy that we try to maintain. So before I get into this fantasy, I want to talk a little bit about the fact that these are duals and pre-duals of operator algebras, and it's really constructive then to acknowledge that they have an operator space structure. And the operator space structure, it allows us to slide. Operator space structure allows us to slightly limit how we think about things, in particular immutability. So I'm going to take my first slide and I'm going to replace the bilinear form with a certain jointly completely bounded bilinear form. This is the so-called operator projective tensor product. That's why I used the gamma notation earlier, just to distinguish from this. And I need sort of a completely contracted Bonic algebra. My multiplication map kind of goes through this, et cetera, et cetera. And then I have my first slide. And then I have my first slide really repeated, but with this new tensor product. So this looks almost the same. And then I just have to worry about these sort of completely contractive modules and completely bounded derivations. But then really it's kind of mutatus-mutanus, sort of same idea. And we should sort of acknowledge that if we look on the left side of my mirror, this L1 and M, these are associates of commutative C star algebra. Of commutative C-star algebras. And as such, there's a kind of trivialization in this operator space structure. Maps coming out bounded and completely bounded are the same. So the tensor products turned out to coincide. So in effect, the bounded theory was a completely bounded theory in disguise. But as I wish to, of course, indicate with the other side of the diagram, that is not the case, right? These are, if these are non-abelian groups, these are highly non-abelian. These are highly non-abelian operator algebras, the operator space structure as a non-trivialization. Okay, so let's get into it then. So with immutability and A of G and L1 of G, our sort of expectations hold true. So G amenable, L1 of G amenable, or hidden operator amenable, that's Barry Johnson. That's, you know, really coined all the terminology, amenability. And then Zhangjin Ruan. And then Zhangzhen Ruan sort of really realized the role of the operator spaces. G amenable if and only if A of G is operator. So everything is our friend here. And now if we go back to our immutability definition, let me track back two slides. Oops. Yeah. So, you know, remember we have this whole module notion of immutability. I could be super lazy and test exactly one module. And test exactly one module, which is the Bonic algebra itself, and its dual space of the derivations. And that's so-called weak immunability, or operator weak immunability. In the case of a commutative algebra, this is actually extremely meaningful, right? This is scales and a little early in the morning for me, I'm afraid. But so at any rate, in the weakenability world, again, the duality is our. Commutability world, again, the duality is our friend. Everything works. We always get an operator weak immutability in these nice cases. I was the one that sort of benefited from the first published proof of this, but independently, Ibrahim Sami also proved it. And I think actually his proof had more legs than the way, so there's credit. Operator immutability of L1 of G was after a sequence of papers of Barry Johnson, but this is clearly the best proof. Yes, Beach and Darmani. Okay, and Okay, and Zhang Chun Ruan has noticed the following. So, with all this Holgrup tensor product machine problem, it turns out that for C-star algebras, the amenability and operator immunability are the same. So it turns out it always kind of works out really nicely. And if you sort of look through like Ufa Holwork's proof that a C-star algebra is always weakly immunable, you can see that every map in there is naturally completely bounded. So in fact, operator we can maintain. So in fact, operator recommendability is for free in C star algebra. So somehow C star algebra seemed to mimic my friends. Everything's working really, really well. Okay, let me just advertise why I wanted the operator space structure. If we lose operator space structure and forget about these extra adjectives, obviously life is weird. Luke Miller had already hinted at this result of Folker and Brian Forrest. Meetability of A of G is actually quite restricted. You need a virtual ability. We need a virtual abelian massage. Actually, the easy direction of this was noticed earlier by Tony and George and I think Rick Lloyd about the hard direction is this. Okay, and there's a huge sequence of papers. A lot of people deserve credit here. You know, in particular, Choi Gandhihari really did some early cases. But for general sort of connected lead groups, this is one by a gang of four, including Ibrahim Samij. Including Abraham Samij, Alude, Khagni Lee, who we saw this morning. So, we sort of generally know now that AFG weakly amenable entails necessarily that the connective component is abelian. This has been finally proved by Victor Lozer. It was announced a few years ago in Winnipeg, and I believe the proof. I think Yemen does too, but those aren't archive, so this will show up, I hope. I hope. Okay. And then when it comes to amenability, of course, we do have a sort of friendship here, right? Our Forrest Runda result does win in B of G. This was noticed in a slightly more general context. Oh, that's already in the paper by Brian. Oh, yeah. Oh. You know what? That's my fault. But that's just where I remember seeing it. I apologize, Folker. Yeah, I knew I was right. Okay. Okay. Okay. Now our Fourier Stilches measure algebra nexus is starting to get... This is where my expectation of my Fourier mirror starts to unravel really desperately. Okay, now measure algebras are typically quite large. They're very infrequently operated weekly. You need a discrete group for this, and that's the only possible situation. So then you mix it with Barry Johnson's theorem. You mix it with Barry Johnson's theorem. Amenability, or operator immutability of a measured algebra is discrete and mean. So, in some sense, it's rather weird, right? Any bit of topology messes this up. There's point derivations, there's all sorts of miserable stuff in MEG. This is a world of dragons. And the Fourier-Stilts' algebra is our sort of, you know, it's our quantity dual algebra. Like, it should also be a world of dragons. It isn't, it isn't. Some groups just have so few unitary representations. Unitary representations that P of G is a tame dragon and you can handle it. So, this is noticed more than 10 years ago by Folker and me. We actually get sometimes it's operator immutable, this is unexpected, that's a non-compact group. Sometimes for a non-compact group, it's weakly immutable. So this is not the expectation based on our Fourier mirror and what we know about the approach. Mirror in what we know about approach. So now we're starting to recognize that the world of B and G is really weird. And then Money has hinted at this. So he's the victim of this phase of my career that I've got really sort of manically obsessed with weird compactifications of groups. But, you know, with some of this strange technology, one can prove, at least amongst almost connected groups, what is the situation for operator immutability and pH? It's now the expected. Now, the expected outcome. Thank goodness. And I have to admit, there's a lot of limitations to my knowledge and my own strange technology. I don't think we can even address what happens for discrete immunable groups. So if I have a discrete amenable group that's not compact, not finite, say, then really it should be that B of G is not operator immutable. Now, the cheapest proof would entail discovering an infinite abelian group. Discovering an ultimate abelian group, relying on my measure technology somehow. But I think geometric group theorists don't know the answer to this yet. We have a discrete, amenable group possessing no infinite suburbs. This is unknown. If the answer to that question is false, then we can answer this question easily for discrete groups. We can nail it. I don't know how to. And of course we have deeper questions. Can we even classify V of G is operator amenable, right? We have some counterexamples, but actually we only have one C. But actually, we only have one sequence of counterexamples. I don't, we haven't built its sisters yet. We don't understand. Okay, now conammenability. Well, we just soup everything up to our operator world. We have to admit that certain algebras we like. Fundeum and algebras, as I hinted at, four measured algebras, B and G are dual spaces. Ah, this is the notion of immutability we should look at, right? If fundamental algebra theory taught us anything, we want a normal immutability. We want a normal immutability. Okay. And again, this whole hog rut business helps to show that operator is somehow a superfluous adjective on Strangely, a von Neumann algebra. But it is not a superfluous adjective in this world. All right. So this is quite impressive work of Folkers. He he was talking about contradibility for measure algebras. Immunability for measure algebras. And he was able to prove this characterizes immunability. Actually, a sequence of two papers on this. So in one, he establishes also like von Neumann algebra as it enjoys this so-called normal virtual diagonal technology. But you know, Folker really has an interesting follow-up. Turns out this this von Diamond algebra kind of replication, this normal virtual diagonal, sometimes more subtle things that I'm not going to talk about. Subtle things that I'm not going to talk about have to happen to me. Volcker showed with certain types of weekly, almost periodic functions, that in fact this can fail, but yet we still have sort of con amenable things. So this world actually starts to get a little bit murkier, I think. And now let's really hit the merc. So at least we have the expected. So at least we have the expected. Luved by Foker and a student at Farouk. I guess is he still in Middle East somewhere, UAE? No, he's returned to Edmonton. He's now as a sessional. Thanks, he live on the same street, just a few houses away from each other. Yeah, so this is really a lovely paper. Economility of B of G is the expected result we've gotten from the forest runa. Forest renda is A of G is amenable, if only if G is virtually abelian. This works with the Abelian. This works with the conamenability. This is a friend. Strangely, the amenability sort of worked at least by our second set of expectations. Now con-amenability is a nuisance. So, okay, here's the sort of obvious thing. Amenable G is going to give us an operator con-amenable because it's not difficult to prove. But then some years ago, Folker and I, we had at least one counterexample to what one would imagine should be. Would imagine should be the reverse direction, and that a free group allows an operator called immutability of B of F2. This entails, in part, Mandelin Choi's realization that universal seaster algebras of free groups are residually finite dimension. It's part of the indexes of its proof. But in some ways, this is still a kind of outlying result. You know, I think with Brian, we have some other examples, etc., but they kind of have the same under. But you know, they kind of have the same underlying technology. So we've written up a really nice observation that I'd say is primarily due to mat, folker mat and me. There's question marks, because this is, to quote money, this is embryonic work. I don't know when we'll submit it. But we have something really curious. Amongst discrete groups, B of G implies a property coined by Kirchberg called the factorization property. And this can be not too difficultly proved once you know that B of G is operator commu. We get this so-called factorization property. And I don't know what your thinking is, Matt. I still fantasize that the other direction is true. I keep trying to mimic Folker's proof on compact measure algebras. But I don't know. I still believe it's true. I actually don't have sufficient evidence to tell me. Have sufficient evidence to tell you. And then also we have nice observations. You know, certain property t groups whose non-unital Fourier Stilts algebra is really small cannot be operated condimentably. So, you know, we're starting to at least peer into the merck of this problem. But the condimentability of B of G is really a strange domain. So if you look at part one, as Matt kindly points out to me, at least gives us one. Kindly points out to me, at least gives us one thing. We know that in the ether there are discrete groups for which BOG is not operator condimentable. So thanks to Kirchberg, property T factorization group is residually finite, and Gromoff has monsters that are property T and not residually finite. So so at least we have something that shows that some B of G cannot be operator continuity. Operator economy. Thanks for ending me here. That's the end of my talk. I really regret that Tony Lau is not here. I don't know what to thank him for other than, you know, everything. So, and thank you all. Are there any questions for Nico? Jason, is it known for L1 algebras of quantum groups when they are like operator weekly? I don't believe it to be known. Try to remember. So Hun Hee Lee is, I think, the biggest expert in this. You know, he had that paper more than 10 years ago with Caspers and Recon. Re-card, recard. And uh I think I feel like Michael Brannon has some results with Song Yun as well, but I have to admit, I'm going to confess to a really rusty on this. So I think the entire problem is really wide open. Any other questions for Nico though? Yeah, I have a question. Hello, Keith? Question. Hello, Keith. Hey, Nico. There was an awful lot of stuff in that fire hose. Could you flip back to the slide where you were talking about the theatic semi-direct product example? Almost there. Yep. There. Okay, so in this example, I think it has the It has the GP as the semicircular product. This is the property that every unitary representation is a direct sum of irreducible representations. Yep. Is that the critical property in this argument? It is absolutely used here. There's no question. And I have no imagination of how to even find an example where V of G would be operator renewable and we don't have. Of G would be operated in one. We don't have this property. So I think, as you extenuate, this is a reasonable conjectural equivalence. Because it's a natural generalization of compactness on the global side. Yeah, I completely agree with you. I mean, that's actually the whole point of these funny groups, right? That's the Martin Walter's emphasis. Sorry, Yamon? Yeah, I was just going to say that something else must be needed, right? Else must be needed, right? Because the classical x plus b group is is that not also AR? Or have I missed it? It's AR, Yevin, but when you do the real line quotient, you still need direct exposure, I guess. Yeah, every unit is going to be represented. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Keith, I actually think this is the characterization might be really surprising. Okay, so given that, now let us propose: do I have some way of staring at a group? Do I have some way of staring at a group without hammering out its representations to expect that I would get this atomic property in the representations? Why would you hammer out the representations? Because I'm a wimp. You're not a wimp. You know, I mean, but just, you know, so like we have all these pretty theorems, like, you know, definable property A is equivalent to definable property B, right? And okay, I grant you that complete decomposability. That complete decomposability of all unitary representations is a perfectly good definable property. But there must be a topological dynamic that points to when this happens, yes? Think about that. Maybe you're the right man to ask. Okay, great. Thanks, Nicole. Thank you, Keith. All right, let's thank Nico once more. Next talk will be starting momentarily, and it will be Sarappa Hostel. Yes, thank you very much. William Miriam
