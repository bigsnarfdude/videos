So that's kind of what I explained some circle of ideas that I don't know if you want to presume they're familiar to everyone here, like they're, I think, becoming more and more familiar to more people thanks to various invasions of our subject from both the kind of inside and the outside. But so I maybe so maybe to start with I want to talk about kind of what you might call categorical local landlords. And so the basic idea of categorical local landlines, well maybe they Well, maybe they're two. Yeah, so let me talk about or sort of motivate it or something in two different ways. So the first way would be to start from just some somewhat vague formulation of local lemons. So for local lemons, you would have some. Reductive group G, and we would take its QP points. And let me just do the usual thing of saying that you can imagine GPGLN, and that's going to be no loss of generality for. I mean, I'm not going to say too many detailed things, and so I'm happy to have GPGLN. And we've And we're going to be looking at representations of G of QP on IP. So this will be some kind of smooth representation. And kind of what do I'm trying to actually what I mean to say is that I'm writing some kind of bijection. I'm wagging some kind of bijection, but I mean very roughly, these things correspond to kind of representations of GFQP into some dual group, which could be literally, you could write it as a dual group group, which again will be GLN if G is GLN. And sometimes you should put an L group or a C group if your group G is not GLN, then it's. If your group G is not G Ln, then especially if it's not split, then you should put something else. Again, I don't want to focus on any of the questions about the podium is of course like a big question and lots of people's work and thought. I don't want to downplay its importance, but I don't want to focus on any kind of technical issues. And here we might And here we might say, we might kind of put irreducible things here. On this side, we're certainly not putting irreducible objects, but we're rather constraining the dimension of the representation. So we're looking at n-dimensional Gau representations. But maybe irreducible, maybe irreducible. And there should be, this was my objection, of course, that there should be such a thing was discovered by Lennons. And kind of one. And kind of one way to think about where that will come from is, so why do we do this? We might look at something like cohomology of a shimur gravity. And we might look at something very specific, like might look at something very specific like the H1. I'm going to put compactly supported down here, but it's again only because later on I'm going to say something, make a precise conjecture which we'll have compactly supported, but it's completely irrelevant to the level of generality I'm talking in. So we look at the cohomology of our modular curve. This might be a modular curve of level n with some coefficients. With some coefficients. So let's put, we could put, say, CP coefficient for some prime p. And we want to think about what structure this has. And so one thing is that since our modular curves can be defined, so I should say this is a modular curve. Since our modular curves are defined over q. Well, it kind of is defined over q. So, here, I guess, the way I'm writing it, I'm imagining it as really a complex Riemann surface, and I'm taking its kind of singular cohomology. But if I think, of course, if I think of it as being an algebraic curve plus over q, then I can think of this as the eighth alpha homology of the curve over q bar, and we have a Gala action. So this thing has sort of an action of Gala Q over Q. And one would like to understand that. And of course, understanding the Gala action on this homology is very closely related to modularity theorems. Related to modularity theorems and things like this. And the kind of key observation is that this homology sort of has another symmetry, which is a sort of a sort of automorphic symmetry and comes from thinking of it as the upper half-plane motor of a congruent subgroup. And only one way to encode that is some kind of heck action. But as we know, the heck action is most easily thought about at primes for heck operators not dividing n. And if you look at heck operators that do divide n, they are, of course, stories for G or theory, not Kinlana theory. But on the whole, the situation is maybe, especially about primes, is better understood by really looking at a taking a limit. Taking a limit. So we could take a limit over all levels. So maybe I'm going to take a kind of a limit one time at a time. So this will be a limit over a little n, and I'll start with my level n, but then I'll add some other time, little l, to the n, p. And this thing would have taken the limit of all L to the F. So of course already at level n, I have an action of Also, at level n, I have an action of this modular curve has an action of GL2Z mod nz. And so in this limit, I get, so this guy has an action of GO2 Z mod L to Vn. And in the limit, this thing has an action of G O  of the ic integers, but of course, it actually has an action of G O 2 Q L the limit. Which you don't kind of see directly at any finite level. And so we get representations of G O 2 Q L and we And we and I suppose somehow we were late into GQ. And so sort of a classical kind of local local compatibility, one formulation would be that If we're with an irreducible rep of GQ appearing in H1. So let me make this letter just be cute for a minute. Let me say, what is Let me say, well, the irreducible representations that appear are typically two-dimensional, apart from some appealing things. So let me just say irreducible dimensional appearing in here. Then, then if I look at the GQL action, so I can look at exactly how this row appears. So I can look at all the copies of row inside here, but inside the limiting object. Object. So let me just call this thing H1C Y and delta B infinity. So delta delta V infinity H1Y and delta V infinity QP back. And look at all the copies of row inside here. And this thing has an action now of Now of um GO2 of QL. I think it's GL at the beginning as well, right? You don't mean the conclusion. Ah. Yeah, sorry, yeah, yeah. I think I saw you twice. Thank you. The GeoTelection on this is determined sort of well by a local elements. By our local islands by this representation, and he, I want to say, is English. So that's sort of one, I mean, it's one way to say to local global compatibility, is that the kind of Gauva, the local L Gawadi structure of a Gau representation that's governed by this virtual curve, is controlled by this kind of automorphic data of how GL2QL acts. And probably it's even, I mean, it's even better because even bookkeeping bars, just to have kind of an algebraically closed field of coefficients, and then this is a very safe statement and true. So what So, just thinking about this story, why would we want to go further? Why would this story already make us want to kind of push local leglands further? When this story by itself kind of uses the very traditional local leglands and seems to be kind of quite nice. And so, the first reason, for me, the original kind of motivating reason was that I want to study congruences of modular forms and Congruences of modular forms and corresponding congruences of galaxy representations. So I really want to work with ZP coefficients. And if you have ZP coefficients, already you can talk about decomposing a ZP module into kind of irreducibles from either kind of GAWA or GL2 perspective is harder and maybe not possible. And so already one might want to Already, one might want to kind of think about something like this, like this representation of GL2QL. You could imagine trying to make some kind of Lennon statement where you want to say this representation maybe matches with this Gamma representation, perhaps, by some local Lennon's, without decomposing into any kind of pieces. And already you're not allowed to do that. And already you're not allowed to do that in classical local elements because sort of this left-hand side only involves irreducible objects, sort of just by its very formulation. And there's sort of a second reason, maybe. So just to try, well, a related reason, to try and motivate it. I just want to remind you how from the kind of formulation in terms of local. The kind of formulation in terms of local elements, we get back to the classical statement of Delene, which would be: so Delene would tell us that if we have this row appearing in this homology, and L is co-prime to the level, and away from P, he would tell us that this representation is unammified at L and that the Frobenius action is governed by a Hecke eigenda. And so, how do we So kind of so we're covering the identified a L story. Well, what we can do is we can say that there's a Hawkshoe observe statement. So that the comology at level N comes from the comology comes from the cohomology at level L to infinity by taking invariance under the subgroup GO2ZL. So if L doesn't divide N, then the cohomology of level N comes from the cohomology at level L to the infinity by taking invariance under GO2. And the GO2ZL. And these invariants we can write as hum from GO2QL of the compact induction from GO2ZL just by just this is just the complete topology of so taking invariance under this group, this mapping the trivial representation of this group into this thing. Group into this thing. And now, but this thing is actually a representation not just of the ZL group, but of the QL group. So I just want to enlarge the trivial representation. So why does the trivial representation GL2ZOL? But I want to promote it, kind of just induce it to a GL2QL group. Then I have this statement. And so now Well, now, this is a representation. So, this object is kind of a purely local object. It's a certain representation of DOTQL. Again, it's not irreducible. In fact, it has a big algebra of endomorphisms, a Heck algebra of endomorphisms. So this guy has an action of the usual HECO operators S sub L, like a diamond operator with L, and then a T L. And the HEC operators acting here. And the hecker operators acting here, the hecker operators at the prime L acting on the homology of level n are just the operators induced by the endomorphism algebra n. And so that's, and then the, and this guy has, it has a, has a big, kind of this big algebra random morphism acting on it. And so it has, you can specialize the eigenvalues of these operators and take, and get corresponding quotients of these things. And get corresponding quotients of this thing, which give you various unnamified principal series, which via local lemons correspond to unnamified Gao representations. And so kind of this diagram and then this statement sort of give you the idemified case of, they recover the kind of idemified story for Gala representations in comology of modular curves. But what I want to emphasize is that they, sort of the already identified story from this perspective, involves this representation. From this perspective, it involves this representation of DO2QL, which is again not irreducible. And one has sort of lots of related statements of a similar kind, in kind of classical Galai representation theory. For example, often we'll look at, we'll go to maybe some like level gamma1L, and then you have Nabin Typus characters acting, and then you know that they kind of act on Gaucker, that they kind of Know that they kind of act on Gauer, that they're kind of enabled. If you have a certain neighbor type of character in your Hecker eigen space that corresponds to some feature on the Gauer representation side, but if you want to kind of pluck out, suppose you want to take, if you have a gamma1 L level structure and you want to find an eigenspace for a given character, where you're taking kind of a character of a little torch, you're taking a character of F L star and asking this out of field. But then you can induce that up and eventually say what you're really doing is taking some other induced representation. Doing is taking some other induced representation of D or GQL and mucking it into this guy and looking at a certain, and that's how you pick out a certain eigenfundance. So there are lots and lots of kind of constructions you make in classical kind of modular form theory, which more or less involve having kind of test representations that are not irreducible. And they pick out certain interesting parts of this representation. The identified part, the part with a certain name titles, whatever it might be. Nebron titles, whatever it might be. So the types that we're about to talk are examples of things you can put here and then pick out interesting pieces of chromology. So that's sort of so one so one would sort of like to maybe have statements where you have um where you're allowed to take larger representations. Larger representations of GO2QL than just irreducible ones. And there's another thing that happens in kind of classical modular forms, which is you want to prove modularity and you do it by doing Taylor-Wiles patching. And what Taylor-Wiles patching essentially does is kind of takes homology here, but you start to kind of vary the end maybe. And you get some larger object, some pattern. Some patched object that you still kind of probe with these representations. And you get modules now living over local defamation rings, or local defamation rings that join power series variables. And so with those patch modules, I mean, people proved various things with them, like Taylor Miles, of course, famously proved modularity of Luke curves with them. And then Diamond reproved classical models of D1 theorems with those patch modules. And so at some point, people kind of realized that the patch modules. Point people kind of realize that the patch modules are devices not just for proving modularity theorems but for probing the structure of the cohomology of a modular curve. Regardless of trying to prove modularity, like for example, so this diamond argument that proves multiplicity one statements by patching is the first example I know of, where you're getting an interesting kind of theorem about the structure of homology modular curves for Zp coefficients via patching and via using some properties of patch modules and some structures. And some structures of local deformation being considered more accessible than global PEC algorithms. And that certainly is a tradition that's continued to try and deduce global statements about homology from local statements. But what that meant is people were looking at these local modules and trying to understand, well, they have these properties. Well, why do they have them? Maybe it's because they're sort of somehow canonical. And so that sort of leads to the question. And so that sort of leads to the question. Yeah, so there's this general question about patch modules somehow purely locally. And that was a question in the literature about patching for some time. And I think, honestly, the community seemed to vacillate back and forth between what would be true. But I think there's no doubt now that consensus is patch modules should be purely local. And again, that's what I'm using to do categorical local elements, is to try and describe what the patch modules are supposed to be. And again, those of you who know Taylor Wilson patching know that often you kind of choose a type and then you patch for that type. And that will kind of correspond to, in this picture, to putting some, you could patch this effect as a trivial type, and that would literally be taking what I've put in here and patching. Or you could have another type here, like in balance clock, patch. And so again, tailor-wise patching can be thought of as a machine that takes some kind of compactly. That takes some kind of compactly induced representation and produces a module now, not over a global HECA algebra now, but over a local deformation ring. And you'd like to understand what that module is and maybe have a framework for thinking why it could be purely local, proving things about. And so, altogether, categorical local landlords are supposed to do all these things. It's supposed to kind of explain Taylor Island's action or all Kind of explain parallels patching or sort of give a framework for kind of thinking about parallel patching and its kind of hopefully purely local nature, but also sort of let you work with situations where irreducibility is a more complicated notion, or maybe a notion you don't want to apply. And so, when you kind of state, then what should be true? So the kind of so here's a graph statement now of categorical local elements, which would be, I would look at So let me say G of already probably like floated back and forth using L and P. Let me say like G of Q L. So on, let's say over here I was writing Q Z P and then Q P, but let me do So let me think about say smooth grips on torsion and ZP mode and then you will kind of access ZP by taking some inverse limit maybe. And so I could look at that category of smooth representation of At that category of smooth representations of GQL on torsion ZP modules, and then I can form its bounded drive category. And maybe I want to look at the boundary drive category of complexes and such things whose cohomologies are finitely presented representations. Finally presented means essentially sort of the analog of finite, so finitely presented module is one which has a two-step resolution by kind of finite three modules, finite ring three modules. Finite reg 3 modules. So the analog of kind of finite reg3 is one of these compact inductions. You put some finite dimensional representation or some finite length representation of this group here. And you compactly induce. That's kind of the model for finite free. And so a two-step resolution by such a thing as you've got flat representative means. And then very roughly, although the kind of meanable statement. Or the kind of meanable statement one wants is that this should have a beautiful effectial functor into some category. Say, battery drive category for here in sheaves. Efficients. And this moduli stack with two versions. So when L equals P, take the EG stack. When L is different from E, which is sort of, in some sense, the sort of easier case, we take a Beta Linux. On both whether L equals P or not, P, you're supposed to imagine that each of these is supposed to be like a multiplier stack of GA represents. A moduli stack of Galois representations of the appropriate dimension or into the appropriate L group or into the appropriate C group. But since Galois groups are pro-finite, it's always a little bit problematic we talk about. So formal deformation theory is fine, but kind of actual moduli theory of the representations is a little bit tricky because they're pro-finite. And so when L is not equal to P, you can essentially resolve that by replacing, if you're looking at P. If you're looking at p-i-cryps, but of the Galois group of L, and you think about their deformations, in a given kind of pi active family, you'll never be able to change the image of wild inertia. And so wild inertia will have some finite image and that will kind of never change. And so when kind of connecting components of whatever modular stack you're trying to build, wild inertia, you can imagine factors through a finite quotient. So if you take the kind of logarithm group at L and you kill off an open normal subgroup inside wild inertia, An open normal subgroup of cycle out of inertia, what you have is up to a finite group, just the tame-Gala group. And the taint-gala group is basically, it's just a pro-finite completion of a very natural thing. You choose a lift of fobenius, you choose a cyclic generator of tame inertia, they satisfy a well-known cognitation relation. So you have a very explicit two-generated group with one relation that you can then study this modulized backwards representations. And again, that that's so for that that's written down in different places. In different places in the literature. And sort of the most contemporary accounts that are related to this will be Jin Wenzhu's paper on modules taxable parameters and in Far Schulze. But that way of studying representations and deformation spaces, I don't know how he goes back, like it's in Richard Zihara-Woyden's paper, it's in Jacques Chardonnay's thesis, it's in lots of other people's work, it's probably in Jeff's thesis. It's sort of as a Sort of as if that's sort of a very standard thing. And then when L equals P, a Vega-Lean group approach is not enough to make the correct moduli stacks because, for example, if you look at even two-dimensional functions of five representations at GQP, you can make kind of natural connected families, which you just feel like have to be in a family. In a family. Because, for example, you take, you just fix two characters, like I don't know, trivial and somehow cyclotomic, might be cyclotomic, and you just sort of twist them by a numbered characters. And then there's always a one-dimensional x to one. So you kind of look at that, so you think those extended representations, they kind of have to move in a family. Because if you go on the board, you can thus write them down. You can thus write down omega i extending unemployed lambda star, and then I can say that stars the unique unomified extension. The unique INFID extension. So you know what I mean. So on the board, I've written down some family that depends on this parameter lambda. So some of I can put a writing down on a board with pronumerals, and you know what I mean. I've kind of written down a family. So then you just have to figure out what the correct mathematics is to make sense of it. And so the problem is that although these will have kind of a bounded swan conductor, the images are kind of non-abelian, and that doesn't bound, that doesn't make you factors. Bounds that doesn't make you factor through a finite approach to the bottom of inertia. And so you can't kind of use a Vaydeline approach, and so we use fee-gellow modules. But somehow, when Toby and I make these stacks, we kind of also show that in some contexts you can use kind of A-inf versions of V-Gamma modules. I mean, diagonally that thankfully we didn't have to deal with as we were writing, like could have been basically any kind of prismatic perspective kind of. Kind of work to describe what's going on. So, like, for example, a family of font-time defined modules is a way to kind of model parts of our stack. So, basically, any kind of legal piece of code code theory is a kind of fine way to, in whatever range of validity it holds, it's a fine way to describe that part of our stuff where it kind of applies to the description. And we just say feature modules as a starting point because those are kind of valid for all piadic representations. So, they're kind of a good initial. Of a good initial reference point to describe things, but then we kind of maneuver to other geodynamic theory devices to kind of describe different parts of our stack and prove different parts of our theory. But in the end, you have these kind of modulized stacks of Lambda's parameters, and then one is going to produce coherent sheaves on them. And what are these coherent sheaves going to be? What are they supposed to be? They're supposed to be sort of, in a way, well, basically they're supposed to be kind of like the patch modules. Patch modules, but spread out over the whole stack. So this to say that the way I've described things, I mean, I've said almost nothing like a billion dollars. How do you build this kind of thing I've written down this category. I've written down this category. I've sort of talked a little bit about what the staff is. Probably there should be this fully faithful functor. Of course, these are somewhat complicated categories. Probably it's not clear there should be any fully. I just give you two categories. You shouldn't actually realize one is a sub-category of the other. So kind of asking to be any fully faithful functor at all is a bit much without sort of some reason for believing in. On the other hand, there's not much data to try and figure out what the There's not much data to try and figure out what the functor is. Like, it's not much of a characterization. And so, you can imagine trying to put in different characterizations. So, Toby and I and Eugen Hollmann have lecture notes related to the IHES course last July, where we talk about these conjectures, especially the L E Go to B conjecture, in a lot of detail. And we give some properties this should satisfy that I sort of know if they will pin it down uniquely, but they help pin it down. Pin it down. But I want to show you the actual property. So, for example, so personally, I believe these conjectures, I believe that this, yeah, so this is a conjecture. Sorry, I should have made that perfectly, this is a conjecture. I believe it's true. I've definitely computed lots of instances of the value of this function, essentially using just that it should exist and one other property. So I just want to tell you what the other property is. So a kind of a key property. Okay, the key problem is it any kind of so I just talk about patching context. And so I just mean, say for the group DO2, I would mean like a modular curve situation where you choose a row bar that's globally irreducible and satisfies certain Nelwaus conditions, or a Shimboya curve that's split at the prime GO, where we're starting the DO2. So we ended up sort of some situations. So, sort of some situation where you end up patching together local two-dimensional GAOD information ring, and where global, and sort of where the, whatever the global group is, locally, it's giving you a GL2. So, any kind of, and then there's, of course, for GLN, there's an analogous journey where you have to replace modular curves and Shimura curves by like unitary Shimura varieties. But so, any patching context, so when you get some Some will give you some kind of R infinity. And that R infinity, as I've said, as everyone here I think probably knows, is a local deformation ring with some power series variables added. A cool thing is that adding power series variables is super frustrating in some contexts in patching some restaurants or other times it's frustrating. You kind of don't know what you're, you don't really know what they are, how many people added. But in the world of stacks, there's a kind of But in the world of stacks, it's a kind of pretty natural thing because the stacks we're looking at here will be normal algebraic stacks, but also Atom stacks as opposed to, say, Deline Manfred stacks, meaning that they kind of emit covers by schemes that are smooth maps, but not necessarily etaal. And in that world, like there's sort of when if you have something etaal and you formally completed a point, you really get an affine, like a formal completion. That fine, like the formal completion of an in the in the Delemanto context really gives you a nice complete local rib. But in the R stack context, since to ever get to a scheme and take a formal completion, you have to choose some random smooth cover. You could have added power series variables or not. You don't really know. So kind of R infinities, the appearance of R infinities looks in a way kind of natural when you're supposed to be thinking about them in relation to a stack. Because what you'll know is that this R infinity will map to sort of one of these stacks of Langless parameters. One of these stacks of language parameters, and the map will be versal. Meaning it'll look like a kind of the formal completion at some smooth cover of your stack for some uncontrolled smooth cover that you don't know how many Pound services you added to that smooth cover. And sometimes when you do patching, like in the very traditional earliest days, you kind of chose one. One, maybe you patch over one prime, but following Kiss and you can patch over sort of many primes, and so you might really have some product over primes in some set S. So we'll call this stack set X sub V. So you have this kind of this guy sort of verse over here. And patching And so patching lets you make patch modules over spurs of R infinity. And how do they go? Is we kind of have to choose. So if we have tau V for V and S, our reps. Let me just do the GOQ case. The GOQK is He does do the GL2 case, a GL2 case of Z V, so B is kind of my prime, GO2ZV. Then this functor has some name, which is a little bit kind of factor A. This is what comes, I think, out of LaFox papers maybe, but this is what Jin Wen uses, this is what we use. Uses what we'll use. So then you will do A as a convective induction from GL2ZV to GL2QV of this tau B. Maybe it's the A for the particular prime B. So that's supposed to be some coherent sheaf or some complex of coherent sheaves here. And then I kind of tensor them together. So the box tensor means that I have like a coherent sheaf on each radio, and I try to radiate together my kind of exterior tensor. Yeah, I think I'm writing everything for GL2 just to, because it would look the same for GLN, but it's just for me mentally easy if it's in GL2. So it pulls back to the patch module. M infinity for these types of each of those. Like this collection of types, it's like a level structure basically of each of the primes v, this ball is what you're choosing. And so you kind of patch that homology, and that gives you an M infinity here. And that's what. And so somehow this is So, somehow, this key property is sort of the statement that this flee faithful factor should be making patching be purely local, because there should be this sort of purely local guys you build on each of these type of things, and you use them together to produce patch modules. And conversely, this means that if you know some patch modules, you can kind of start to figure out what some of the modules Can kind of start to figure out what some of the values of A might be. And so, for example, one thing when you do televised patching, you can sort of, there's a question like what local deformation ring do you think about? So, maybe you were patching like comology with constant coefficients at level prime. Coefficients at level prime to p, then you know that that's going to have to do with Galois representations that are crystalline, hot shape, weight 0, 1 at p. So you can think that you're patching where the local deformation ring is that crystalline deformation ring. But you don't have to. You could think that your local, that the local deformation ring, that crystalline deformation ring is a quotient of an unrestricted one, and you could use unrestricted deformation ring in your patching, and you could make the iron field be out of the unrestricted deformation ring. It's just that. Deformation ring, it's just that the patch module will still be supported on the crystalline deformation ring. So by knowing say PID-hydrostatic properties of the Galaxy representations attached to modular forms, you kind of know what the supports of patch modules are supposed to be. And so then this formula tells you kind of which GAO representations this. Of which Gau representations this A should be supported on. Like you want to know, should I choose some tau, and I want to know, should this A, B, tau, V be supported at a particular point in the stack. So you choose a global situation whose local representation is that point. And then you kind of patch, and then you look and see, well, I know where the patch module is supported or supposed to be supported because it has PRI hardware properties. And Fronten Mazer told me they should be the precise stipulation for where. Me, they should be the precise stipulation for where it's important. And so that I see if my local representation satisfied those properties or not. So you can kind of begin to figure out where these things might be supported. And sometimes by patching, you know that things are supposed to be line bundles, but by Como Cole, necessarily Diamond Diamonds, they're supposed to be line bundles. And so then maybe you know this patch bundle is a line bundle. And then you know it supports, you know, it's a line bundle, and that supports some geometric object and it has a Picard, and you might want to figure out which line bundle. Which line bundle it could be out of the possible choices from that big card. And then there's a thing you can use, and this is a thing that you can't do with patching. So if I do this function and I compose with this pullback, you can't expect that composite to be fully free. Because for example, some representations here might go to different line bundles with the same support, and then they wouldn't be isomorphic. But if you pull them back to a local ring, those line bundles will both become trivial and they would. Those line buttons will both become trivial and they will become isomorphic. So, this functor, gothic A combined with this pullback, you can't expect that to be fully faithful. But we believe that there's such a fully faithful functor here. So, using full faithfulness and using some knowledge about maps between different representations here, you can try to even pin down what kind of line bundles you might get. And so you can start to kind of try and compute things. So in our IHES notes, um we kind of explain examples of these kind of calculations. Explain examples of these kind of calculations. So that's kind of what this category, at least for me, what this categorical landlord is mainly about. It's about a way to explore patching and think about patching and put it in a more kind of purely local, but also kind of a more structured framework. And so I should say this is a conjecture, but there are lots of partial results. Partial results. So if I do cut L not equal to P, of course then I can talk about smooth representations not only in torsion context, but I could go to a more classical situation and do like, say, QP coefficients or QP by coefficients. So if I do, so then so there it's sort of fine. You know, there's no mystery about doing QP coefficients. So this is, so for GLN, I've got PGQP coefficients. This is a theorem. This is the theorem of Benz Vadelo also of Tzu and more generally what what these what most of these people do in slightly different ways Well, but I think for GLN then everything is kind of in the audio algorithm. I mean like the heck out there's the Benzene centers for GLN always look like the overhead algorithm. So I think they can extend really they have to use local lemmas as an input, but then they can really extend all of GLN. But yeah, but what I was going to say is for general G, they kind of handle the Ohori block, but for GLM, somehow that's enough. And then for GL2 and L equals P, this is a theorem. This is a theorem in progress of Andrea Data, myself, and Today. And we use a lot of known results about local theatric local landmarks in the GL2 case as well. So. Yeah. And somehow I always just. Okay, but there is not essential, right? There it's not essential. Yeah, so here it's not essential, but here it is. So I want to kind of use the last 15 minutes to now go back to a kind of global setting and cohomology of Schumoured-Barratti modular curves and sort of yeah, maybe kind of complete some kind of a circle. Maybe kind of complete some kind of a circle. And so one slightly unsatisfying thing already about this statement, about this formulation of the key property, is it's sort of, I mean, of course it's mathematical, I think it sort of makes sense, but it's a little bit sort of like it's not sort of a structural thing. I don't know if it involves like choosing type patching context, sort of choosing different tumor varieties, and then there's supposed to be some sort of For more varieties, and then there's supposed to be some sort of some functor supposed to equal some other functor. And I'd like to do something sort of more, again, just more sort of structured and conceptual. And so what we can think about is in this situation, maybe let me Go back to kind of a global picture. So let me think about does this product be? And so there's a global situation that would relate to this. So, I could look at a modulized stack of representations of the global Gaua group unemployed outside S, into, let's say, two-dimensional kind of representations of, say, ZP algebras, Z-power torsions, ZP algebras, organically complete ZP algebras. And I can make a modulized stack of those things. Yeah. Sorry, I have a slightly unrelated question. If you were to Slightly unrelated question. If you were to just project, so you're saying if you pull back this, like, this tensor product called A V's, you get M infinity. If you just project onto one of them and pull back, can you describe what you get in terms of M infinity? Well, in some sense, yeah, well, maybe in some you sort of we can try and think it through after this because I'm going to get it myself a bit but I don't if I think it through too much. But you can imagine, like, first of all, you could take a single, you could kind of be patching where you only kind of have reference. Patching where you only kind of have ramification conditions at one s and then isolate a single V. And you can also sort of think like if you know that some of these A V's are trivial, then, I mean, you sort of know in classical packaging, especially for unitary groups, you often have to worry about primes outside the prime you care about. But you often handle it by imposing some kind of very simple ramification condition. So you can sort of play similar games here to try and isolate a simple week. Okay, and that's sort of related. I think that's related to what you asked. What you ask. But so you can make a global stack. The stack global graphs. So I guess this is going to be explained carefully in a write-up that Jing Wenju and I are trying to put together. But here, this will really just be your take a, well, equivalently a Equivalently, a P-power torsion ZP module, so ZP algebra, or a paiadically complete ZP algebra, one is a piadic limit of the other. And you'll just ask for, say, two-dimensional representation of GQS into the two, you know, over that. And those form a group wave, and so you can make a stack. And again, you get a formal algebra rate stack. And sort of globally, that's sort of the right thing to do because globally. Because globally, there's sort of no free parameters for global GABA representations. The global GAA group doesn't really have a map onto, it has no kind of like, I mean, in case language, it's R-type and not Z-type. Like, you know, local GAA groups have these sort of Frobenius, so their V groups get a Z, and global function fields, like the multi-function field case, you again have a kind of the Z type. You have a kind of global Z, so you have a V group. Global Z, so you have a vague group. But here there's sort of no vague group inside the global Gala group, and so there's sort of no reason after to make a stack using the global Gala group. So you can do that, and you can have this restriction map. And then we could do this kind of a thing where we Where we take this kind of product of these zero products of these guys. Maybe I'll call this restriction map F just so I can talk about it. Well here there's not an error because that's kind of a process. I call this A just to make it easier to write. I could pull this A back and get some coherent sheafing on this global. Get some coherency floating on this global stack. And so now what am I doing from the point of view of patching, or sort of going from my Or sort of going from R infinity to the global stack will basically be like the thing where you kill off all the patching variables and you go from R infinity back to the global R. So this looks kind of close to the process that would undo patching and you produce just the global commodity. So one thing is that when you patch, for example, when we say in a multiplicity one theorem that we have multiplicity one, what we actually mean is that some piece of comolynu modular curve has Komalinu module curve has Zp rank 2 because it's a two-dimensional Gaut representation tensored with a kind of rank one module. And so when we say patch modules or line bundles, again, if you're going to patch homology modular curves and get line bundles, you have to have kind of factored out the Galois representation. That's a traditional first step that people do when they patch it, is kind of pull out the Galois representation, the universe of Gao representation, and then sort of patch what's left. So if you want to kind of recover, Left. So, if we want to kind of recover homology of a modular curve, we better put the Galois representation back in. Because somehow, philosophically, these A's have stripped it out. So, let's put it back in. And we can do that, because this is a modular Gala representation, so it has a universal Gala representation over it. So, I can tensor this with the universal Gala representation. You could also, if you like, think of that as adding in a factor from infinity. Infinity. At least, like, this is a product kind of overall primed, and you could add sort of more prime, like you could add other unimified primes, and that wouldn't change what's happening. So, it doesn't matter that we've omitted them, but we could add as many unemployed primes as you like, and somehow they probably should be another factor for infinity, so you can also think of this for that. And so now we have this here-in-chief over this stack. Here in chief over this stack. And well, now I have to write a formula then that says something about what this stack would look like. But a coherent sheaf on this stack is not a module or is not a Z P module. So this itself can't be kind of a comology of a modular curve. A more structured object than a comology of a modular curve. It's just a coherent shielding stack. So there's a conjecture, myself in mean way, is that if we take the homology on this of this object, then what we get is completely sported homology of Homology of the modular curve, kind of with respect to these types. So to be precise, these types determine a kind of a coefficient system, like a local system on the modular curve at an appropriate level. So you take the modular curve at the appropriate level with the appropriate coefficient system, and then there probably should be a And then there probably should be a shift because they're kind of most generic. Probably there should be a shift by one just because the kind of most interesting situation here is that this is all living in, these are a priori complexes, but in the most basic situations, they're really just coherent sheaves in degree zero, and this is just a kind of vector space or CP module or degree zero. And the most interesting cohomology here is the H1. So I want to make sure the H1, the combat support, matches up with degree zero. So I think that is actually quite. So, I think that is a sheet. That's a good question. So, this street might also be shifting. Let me just put in a shift here. This number confuses me every time. So, let me not try and get the number streak. So, one thing I should say is that, in fact, for GLN, I should have mentioned, so here I should mention that for GLN, For GLN, this is due to Carl. In his thesis, Carl constructed these stacks for GLN. And so what Jimwon and I are adding is, on the one hand, for groups other than GLN. And also, one should really have them be derived stacks. And so they should have an actual drive stack. And so they should have an actual derived structure, and so how they don't. I don't think anyone doing number theory really was doing derived stacks in all code cases. So should be derived stacks of global representations. But so but so this is so this conjecture is So this conjecture is sort of a, it's in some sense like if you have this local version of patching and you had it, then this is sort of the version of how to go from kind of patch models to cohomology, but with no assumptions on the robot. So I just want to finish up by showing you what this stack kind of looks like. Stack kind of looks like in some, vaguely what it would look like in some situations. And I should also say that, so in my old kind of global global compatibility theorem for comology of modular curves, it's roughly proving this conjecture for kind of robotic, if you restrict to the part of here where you have an irreducible robot. So, like my local global compatibility theorem involves this, for the L not equal to P part, it involves this local Levantine family that David Helman and I developed. And Hellman has kind of conjectured that that's exactly one way to describe this categorical local elements for GLNs in the L not equal to B case. That's how it sort of shows our local elements in. That's what our local moment in France was. So, in fact, David Helm said that he worked on that with me, and then he worked on this stuff with Ben Zhen, himself, and David Babba. And then he didn't kind of realize they were the same story, and then Neuken sort of pointed out the same. So, which we definitely didn't have any kind of categorical inputs in mind when we did that, but we did have in mind trying to kind of escape the irreducible region. So, justice, what do these stacks kind of look like? What kind of thing are we talking about here? So, these stacks actually are kind of global quotient stacks. They're kind of formal affine much more reductive, and so they have nice GIT quotients, which are basically going to be stacks of serial representations. And so, but that's not a stack, that's just a modulation. Which if that's on a stack, that's just a moduli space of pseudo-representations. And that will be a disjoint union over the different possible mod P pseudo-representations. So, and that will really just be the formal spectrum of a pseudo-deformation ring of some pseudo-representation mod P. So, essentially, it's a theorem of Chenevillier that. This is not the rough. This is not the rough. This is the theorem of Chenevillier that This is a theorem which we get that kind of I sort of in this context used exactly by Carl, which is that even if you if you kind of try to deform a pseudo-representation, so the difference between a kind of a monitorized stack and a formal deformation space is in the monetized stack you kind of go outside deforming over local rings. You really allow like non-trivial parameters. But for pseudo-deformations, somehow you really can't deform outside a local ring. Like the MOP pseudo-representations are just rigid. Rigid. I mean, they can have formal definition, so they never actually have genuine algebraic information. And so correspondingly, this guy just breaks up as a sum of kind of connected components labeled by these theta bars. Or at least these kind of unions are connected components. So it has the same sort of decomposition. So this is kind of the stack of all sorts representations. Sort of Gau representations who's kind of where the mod PC deformation is sort of equal to this fixed trace. So now I guess to finish up, I want to give you sort of two examples. So one will be if theta bar was, say, let's say like absolutely irreducible, dimension two. And let me just say odd. Odd just because otherwise I'm a bit nervous about what exactly I'm not sure if I need that for this, but I'm actually a bit nervous about exactly how, what's involved in the proof off the top of my head. But in this case, in this evidently irreducible case, this stack is not really much different to the deformation rate. So then this data bar is kind of equal to some robot, which is irreducible. And so you just have the formal deformation space of the robot. Space of the robot. But then when you deform those representations, each representation has a kind of, as it you know, you're deforming the representation. There are automorphisms, but only scalar automorphisms. So you just kind of have to quotient out by some kind of scalar automorphism to some appropriate completion because everything is formal. So you get this stat. But this is acting trivially on the ring, so it's a kind of, it's just. kind of that's just and and that GM would be acting trivially on this sheaf as well and so in so if you kind of if you if you do this story and you restrict to the kind of chemical component here corresponding to an irreducible rubber you get then then the sheaf is just turning into a module of a distribution and it's just going to be your classical chromology. But I think this is true for any reducible animation. Yeah, I think so, right? I think so, right? Just as I was preparing my talk, I read some email from someone and got suddenly very worried that I was missing something. A good question. That was a question. I think so, yeah. Yeah. For that, I should have R. Because I probably need to know the expected dimensions. Because I probably need to know the expected dimensions. I need to know the dimension. Yeah, so probably I'm using. Ah, that's why I have to be careful. Yeah, to be underived, am I using. Whose theorem am I using? I'm talking using theorems of maybe of yours or Gerbhard's. I mean, people sitting here who have, because I probably have to know it has the correct expected dimension. So that's kind of a big I for big T theorem. So that might be Gerbhard's theorem. But maybe your most improved theorem for this. The GL2 is definitely Gerhardt. And so yeah, so then, yeah, so it's. So, um, yeah, so then yeah, so then we need to identify the expected dimension. And then we know, let's say P. Then we know that our Gallo homology O vanishes about degree two, so it's kind of the cotangent complex is a kind of LCI. So it's a derived LCI, but it's the correct expected dimension. So it's classically LCI and non-derived. So sorry, I wanted to show one more example. One more example, but I'm going to impose some conditions. So I can kind of impose kind of deformation conditions, for example, locally, and then find a product and get something, you know, get calculated conditions globally. And so I want to look at x g q s, where here s would just be two primes, infinity and p. And I want to have my determinants. If I determine it to be supercomic, and I want to be finite flat at P, and I want to be a n unipotent at some other prime L. And so I better put N in here as well. Some other prime N. N as a prime. And but modular form fairly what is this? Module of form theoretically, what does this correspond to? I'm saying 5 side of p and 10 meters per minute away from n, so it's in determinant. So I'm just saying weight 2, gamma 0, n. And n is prime. So I'm saying wait 2, gamma 0, n in the context of Maises, Eisenstein, ID or paper. And so here again I'm going to write down a stack. I think it should be non-derived, but Zuma and I have not completely checked this yet. This is a little bit tricky. Check this yet? This is a little bit tricky. But the X, so I'm going to look at the part that has to do with trivial plus mob V sequence, the kind of part that's covered. And so this will be the following thing. Maybe it's kind of easier to just draw it. So I have my Um, maybe I can kind of write it in the auto draw. So here I'm going to have a script of some kind of ZPA join U, which is patiently completed GM. And so this should also be pianically completed, so it should be like a diagraph to, because everything's pianically completed. So that's, so I have that thing, and then So I have that thing, and then I have a um for T of a zero, I mean the caspital heck algebra. So the cospital, the weight, the heck algebra acting on the weight two cusp forms at this weight two and prime level, dema zero n. Adjoin two variables, again I guess it's diamond brackets, u v where the product product UV equal to peak of appropriate power and the power that's the ring and then there's a quotient again by a GM half and the power here is exactly the modulus of reducibility so it's um so we've like we were doing So if we were doing mod 5 and n equals 11, then this would be 25. That's the modulus of reducibility. And this product is five over uh so maybe this power should be kind of P to the A and this power is P to the B. This power is P to the B. Join U mod, where this guy is P to the B exactly divides N minus 1. That's the kind of modules, the converse modules between Eisenstein series and customers. And the coordinate TE acts on this U and V. That The acts on this U and V variables by T X on UV as T squared U of T to the minus 2. But the picture is, it's kind of easy to just draw a picture. The picture is just, so does, sorry, I've finished, but I just draw this picture to finish, is kind of a disc. So this is sort of a disk, a closed unit disk, and then it kind of has an affine line as its mobility reduction. And then this guy is a tennula. This guy is an annulus. It's like u times v is some power of v, that's kind of an annulus. And his model reduction is two lines crossing, and then sort of one of these two lines gets identified. And so that's the, so you're going to have deformations of the kind of Eisenstein, kind of deformation to the kind of custom. Or you have representations of the kind of Eisenstein and representation to the customer. And I should say that the And I should say again that this computation, I mean, the intuition is not so bad, but to make it correct, to actually do it, we have to again use the description by Preston Wait and Carl Ray Ericsson. They describe it very explicitly what the generalized matrix algebra is that kind of governs the situation, and from that generalized matrix algebra you can read off this stack. Essentially, following the way that Carl constructed these stacks in the first place. But that's the kind of non-trivial the first sort of non-trivial example of a kind of actual stack that appears in this context. So just to give you a feeling for what will be happening here. So anyway, I'm over time, so I should start. So thank you very much for listening. Any questions for Matt? Are there any questions for Matt? Yeah, I have two questions. One, is that statement that the stack of pseudo-representations breaks up like that, is that written down for G-valued pseudo-representations as well? Extendation of the usual not by me, but I'm not sure with why Jean-Mike. I mean, because he has considerations about sort of microserial representations. About sort of microservices representations in that existing paper. I'm not sure exactly what he knows. Because I don't have a feeling for like, basically, when you shift from GLN to G, I don't have a good feeling for what things are just kind of easy to then group again and what things are kind of unfreezing. And the other question was: can you, I didn't really understand the comment about interpreting V as like a thing at infinity. Could you just say something? Well, for example, if For example, there should be a formula like this in the non-tramural variety case. And in the non-chemur variety case, there is no global Gau representation to add in. But there would still be a factor you would add in that would come from this data. This kind of a less AP is different from 2. Then, first of all, for any locally symmetric space, all the kind of Gau representations are explained by its. All the kind of Dawah representations explained by its Hecker eigen, all the reactions of kind of the C groups that are explained by Hecker eigen systems from that locally symmetric space, they should all be odd in a certain sense. So there's always a certain canonical, in the C group or in the algebraical C group, there's always a certain canonical involution.
