Harry, so she can talk about the content framework for hydrodynamic units. Thank you very much for the introduction and for the invitation. So, I guess I'm going to present some part of our recent work with Cl√©mon Lamont and Nemo Evans. So, the goal here is to propose a new simplified quantity framework in order to derive hydrogen limits when we start from stochastic particle systems on a lattice typically in the microscopic level towards microscopic PDs. And to give explicit rates of convergence, to revisit some results, but these. To revisit some results, but with explicit resourcence, which are uniform in time, sometimes. And also unified in the sense that we can apply it to several particle systems. Okay, so the motivation is an old question of mathematical physics to get a continuum description of the evolution of. The pollution of microscopic evolution of particle systems. Okay, so this is also part of the sixth problem of Hilbert, which is deriving macroscopic physical neuroscience. Physical laws, okay, and typically the description we get is through a fluid equation, so this is what's called halogenical limit. And mathematically, this corresponds to proving basically a law of large numbers. Okay, if you assume that initial time, we prove a propagation of time, propagation of a law of large numbers. So we're going to propose and so you want to go with this to be And now Kate will give you the screen knowledge, so do then. So this will be 37 points. Get the dimension. And I'm going to, okay, we have time, okay? I'm going to show you how we can show this higher limit when we start from two examples microscopically. So one of them will be this little range process. This is a range process. So, this is a stochastic dam process. And this is called Gender now with Causagenets. So, this is diffusion personality. And okay, before I tell you a little bit more what this process is doing, how they evolve, let me give you some translation. So we consider the total, so I'm not specifically our own space with the total. And to be taught, I have to be a natural number, and this will represent the inverse of the distance among the sides and the bodies. And the limit we want to take then is. And the limit we want to take then is set in here. Okay, so now given such n, we discrete the terms. So this will be very important at the end. I will consider, say, a configuration for our space, I will call it Iga or Ziga. So this will be a collection point. So here with zero will be the number of particles outside zero, outside one, so minus one, in the case of the zero range houses. And in the case of Landau have charges of this case. So the charge. Right, so okay, so let me just go around and get on. Okay, so the lattice, we have So by the sides, we if the distance among the sides is one we want to take so yeah on each side we have particles and okay this has to be another edge why is it to do um And if now, in the limit as n goes to infinity, we want to get a description. We can say u is a space of terms. In the limit, we want to get a description with the script. Okay, so with this one please. I don't want to understand what this situation displays. So this is somehow on non-imaging language because we want to understand. And to get it to the straight, okay, so we have two scales, micro mantra, and a way to connect these two scales is the To connect these two scales is presenting. So we take X. Okay, so now how this process works. So the zero-range process. In the zero-rate process, we have each particle here. So each particle waits a random exponent at a round time and then it tries to jump. And then it tries to jump to the point. And the jumping rate is determined by a given partition called G and the jumping P. So D will be typically a function called M toward flux. So if we have say K particles that have X with With rate zk pxy, a particle at side x will jump outside y. So it's called zero rate because this depends only on the number of particles at the site x. So it doesn't depend on the number of particles at other sides. And we have some assumptions for our halodynamic limit on G. Okay, P is typically finite range. Finite range, probability, tension probability, so not really nothing special here. And here we assume that d will be an increasing function. DL will be zero if and only if I be zero, that's the zero range assumption. And also, we want to bound Bound this point here, so all this will be final. So, these are the assumptions and arrangements. And the Kinswatian Dau is a diffusion process. So, here, okay, so here I didn't say that the space is n to the different points. So, we take, so at sine x, we take sine x. So at side x, we take side x and we return a number of particles. In contrast, here this green space is r so eta x will belong to r, so we have green variant spins. And the evolution of the fields are according to one side potential. Okay, so we have potential V for this potential. Typically, for this potential, we've seen that it's very convex. And very recently, we are able to also allow some more complexity near the origin. And also, okay, so it evolves according to onset potential way, and also it is using exchange screen. So it's kind of interacting with particles. Maybe just to give you an image of how this equation takes place. So, the SD that we follow is at MT is the If B is the ownership potential, we can see again, and then the noise and there's okay, let's give this. Okay, let's give the staying for now. It doesn't have the interaction comes to the end. Okay, so let me give some, you know, more absolute setting the evolution of the system. So we have two evolutions, a macroscopic and a macroscopic evolution. Evolutions, immediate and the macroscopic evolution. So, the menu evolution will be given by probability measure. So, it will start as a process. So, we start with initial data, say, M0, mu0. So, this will be a measure that will be based on this configuration spa, XN. We will have a semi-group, say STN, so that we can uniquely determine the evolution of time t through again a complete method. And the generator, this, usually depends on whether we have a diffusion or a jump process. Yeah, we call it ARN, maybe. And so now in the case of the jump process, two functions with some overall sites and why the neighboring sites. Here we have a jam, right? And here, I will just do your design. Okay, so this is the configuration after we have done from x1. Okay, so if that's why this is with x minus 1, leave y equals leave x equals 3. And in the diffusion process here, so this is a dam diffusion. We have the generator of this process. We have a second order. We have the second order being in some other conservative form. And the book and support. Okay, so this is typically the generators we're working with. And now on the macroscopic level, we have an operator, typically an varied non-linear operator, a particular infinity. In case we lens the microscopic operator, operator. And we want FT satisfies the public. And now the form of this operator depends on the macroscopic system and what we see microscopically. So if we start with a process that is symmetric, so say the mean of the process is zero, then the limit we see if we escape. We see a limit only if we scale time by n squared, then space by n so diffusive scaling and the limit we see is diffusion process. So hyperplasm, seed muscle is a non-linearity. Okay, and this non-linearity depends again on the jump rate or on the potential here. So it's given by an explicit formula because we have a gradient model, so it's quite simplified. So this would be, in this arrangement process case, for example, the sigma will be the average example. And now if you have an asymmetric process. Symmetric process. We can rescale time by n and scale by n. So the hyperbolic scaling and with this we see a conservation. So sigma is the semi linearity and gamma here is the mean of the process. In the middle of the post. So this is kind of more interesting because this operation develops shocks, discontinuities. And for our hydrodynamical limits, typically we want to have some regularity of our limit VD for solution. So we're able to get this limit for all times. Times okay, and this unit for up to a final time as long as we have a delay. Okay, so now what is good with these microscopic processes is that we know that we reach a sessional state, a kind of bloom, cannabis measure. So we know that there is unique families of equipment measures. And these are typically Gibbs measures. I will call it new alpha M. So alpha will be a parameter. So you can posit it as alpha. And this will be so that we have massive concentration, this is constantly invariant, and whatever. And we also have this dot of P. So the mean, the average, is exactly alpha. So we have this, we choose sigma so that we have this. We can construct the process so that we have two. We can construct the process so that we have the property. And now for the zero-range process, this takes the form to have its productivation of a row size. So half sigma alpha of economics over T. And then normally this is a constant. So this is like a partition constant. So that the mass number is just one. And in the Guilt-McLared Au case, this is so this can be also written in the second exponential form, but it's a matter of hackathon. It's a mother puppet. This particular part of the alpha with one of these. Okay, and now it's important that we have such a measure because now the idea. measure because now the idea is that we can instead of considering alpha here to be a drop of equilibrium so a quantum parameter we can consider this to be small so slowly slowly varying so that we can from start with a lower equilibrium okay and um okay you can see how we can construct this system of work so we take f of this new function Yeah, and okay, we want this to be productive in the same sense of here and so that under this measure all the values are independent. So it's not really translation harder, but it's close because it's quite small. So the measure of the site where the number of particles is k, or this page is k, is given by that leads parameter, but that's okay. Okay, so. Okay, so also how if you zoom out, you have a constant. And now this is a nice object because we can choose F if we know the hydrodynamic limit, so if we know the limited dip, we can take the solution to the limited D, which will smooth. And we can construct this measure with the solution to the limited limit. And since now the variables are independent under this law, it's really the law of such numbers to show that this measure, if f That this measure, if f solves, gives the correct hydrodynamics. Okay, so this is somehow can be used as an artificial process, a fake one, but gives the correct hydrodynamics. And it has an explicit formula. And then the idea is to compare the real one medium with the artificial one in some distance. Some distance. Okay, so before I give the results, how much time you have? Five minutes. Five minutes. Okay, I will also write some names. Okay, this is true. Okay, so there is one robust, the first robust number that has been applied to many particle models, which usual go off and for long but I can't. We may deny. It's far from being quantitative. It uses candidate reduction. It's remarkable. And the second one, which uses, okay, it gives in a stronger sense convergence. So this is in a convergence probability. It's due to Yao 91. 91. This is really natural method. Okay, so this is somehow a nicer group. It gives stronger components, but it has stronger hypotheses. So you need a really small solution. And the idea here is to compare this problem, with the one that's explicit, with the real one through the right magnetic resistance. So this is close to being conductive, but it gives really much. Being productive, but it gives a really bad rate in terms of time. So it's close to a normal estimate and it gives exponentially growing rate in time. But we expect, at least in the diffusion case, so here, we expect the limit to be uniform in time. Okay, so well so that's for the parabolic limits. Then there's a look. Then there was a new group extended to hyperbolic scaling for all times, so it would include shocks at the microscopic level, through a measure volume and increase in discussion. More recently, there have been attempts to quantify the rate. So there was one by Bruno, Otto Gileni. Otto Gileni and Westigen, Westinghouse where they introduced a more scale, they had some intermediate dynamics and it's semi-quantitative. So from macro to meso, they are quantitative, but from meso to macro they're not here, so it's semi-quantive. And recently by And recently by Otto Manns, we have an explicit convergence which is n to the minus confirmed for the Ginbuk and DAO clauses only and modulars. Um okay. So, our notion is with waste-line distance, but in microscope was a standard distance. So, define it like this. Okay, so we write the cost of retrieval, so here we have the coupling measure. And because it's like a microscopic one distance, okay, we normalize it, so it's like divided by this. I will do this. And you can also write this in a dual formulation form. So you have a loop sheet, function phi, and in this sense it means that for two configurations zeta. So phase one uses if you have this property. Uh Either here, the two measures here and you two. And okay, so what we saw is that if you assume three things, okay one, a microscopic stability. So in the sense that in the So in the sense that in the microscopic level you have a contraction property, so in masses time one, okay. So the semi-group is contracted. Second, the macroscopic stability, so this is about the regularity dissolution in the middle. So see three examples now. And start the consistency and estimate. So, enoughly, this is to show that an average somehow, this one here is small. So, this is a DD generator and this is the microscopic. So, this is the clock that we're generating. Okay, so we know that this was new here, the airport is just zero. Of this is zero, uh, but it's not, so this gives an error. Okay, so we want to estimate for some limited function in this way. And now if you have an error here, say, then under all these assumptions, which only technical one is the third one. Then we get this time this is in the building but it's in So in the latest norm, which is like this Plus an initial calculator. V infinity is the limit of, as time goes to infinity of the limit of V, if this exists and the diffusion process will not exponentially fast again, then this gives an error that doesn't identify. An error that doesn't do any time, and so we get this. We are ending up with an error in an error in end, but it's only the static frequency specific. And what we saw say, in dimension one, and I'm finishing, the error isn't in dimension eight for both the zero range and this in the window. And for this, we also need to use quantum quality. And for higher dimensions, if you use electroportan quality, you get a slightly good. Questions? So, any technique that you managed to get from Do you manage to get completely around this mesoscopic scale that other intriguing screens? Can you go directly from equal to Mars? Yeah, we also reduce force for this step. We need one to scale, right? But we don't need explicitly to know the evolution of the mass of the scale. But yeah, so, okay, so here we have an explicit formula. This defensive actually, it's not that hard. So, this quantity here is exactly so you have a sum over all sides. You have zero bit x, examples, and you have a sigma prime, so this is from the unit to be time differentiated, times eta x minus eta x. And now the idea is to zoom out. Okay, so here's on every side, so it could divide the space into boxes. Instead of looking at the center of each box, you look at all the box, so you have intermediate scale L, so somehow you average, so you look at the average quantities of the L, and then you. And then you want to replace this by signal. So this is the density, but we use lots. So the technical step is to do this replacement. And in all the other methods, this replacement is where you need to look at this difference with respect to the reactor cross. With respect to the reactor processing OTN. And in our case, by splitting the steps into the nucleus and the macro and the consistency part, we need to look at this error with respect to the local to the group, you see. So it's simplifying. All right, so thank you very much. That's long as T. And this time we're on the very tight schedule. Let's move to.
