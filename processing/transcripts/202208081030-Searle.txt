Thanks so much. Okay, so my thanks to Diego, Andrea, Jesus, and Massume for organizing this conference. It looks like it's going to be really great. It's a great idea. Thanks so much for the opportunity to speak. And I also, long list of thanks here. Also, I want to thank Fernando, Galas Garcia, for doing such a great job with the first part of this talk and setting things up for me to continue. Okay, so I'm going to be talking. Okay, so I'm going to be talking about group actions based on metrics basis. The plan is similar to the plan, you know, well, just a continuation here. We're going to be considering large group actions on spaces in M. M can be a set of one of the following types. It can be any set you want, but I'm just naming four types here of closed metric spaces. So Riemannian manifolds, Riemannian orbifolds. Ramanian manifolds, Riemannian orbifolds, Alexandro spaces, RCD spaces. As Tremando did, I'm going to be concentrating on the manifold case, and I should mention here, you know, when we're talking about G, we're talking about a connected, in general, connected compact Lie group. You can talk about the discrete groups as well, but we're going to focus mainly on connected ones here. Okay, so as Okay, so after that though, we're gonna talk about this and I'm gonna separate into basically three types of large and then discuss in each case future directions as well as I mentioned survey results for manifolds and I mentioned future directions. Okay, so I wanted to talk the general overarching vision here on some level is this extended symmetry program. Level is this extended symmetry program. The symmetry program originally was proposed by Karsten Grove. He asked that we classify manifolds, Riemannian manifolds with positive and non-negative sectional curvature with large symmetries. Large is purposely ambiguous. That's one of, as Fernando already mentioned, it's one of the great parts of this program is that you can define large to do what you want. You can modify this then for pretty much any space you want. Pretty much any space you want to consider, metric spaces mainly. We want to look at isometric group actions. I just put, you know, curvature bigger than zero and non, you know, positive and non-negative here, but you can extend lower if you want. Although I'd say, you know, the main focus, one of the goals of the program originally was the idea that we haven't got a classification of positive and non-negative curvature for Riemannian manifolds. So this was an attempt to So this was an attempt to move towards a classification and also, you know, if possible, find new examples and encounter any topological obstructions or find new constructions for the same. Okay, so this is the main idea. What is large? Fernando already talked about this a little. So I'm going to give three definitions. There are lots more. These are just the ones I'm going to focus on for this talk. Are just the ones I'm going to focus on for this talk today. So, one of them is small quotient space with respect to the dimension of the manifold. That is, the dimension of M mod G is small. And as Fernando already mentioned, this could be called the cohomogeneity of the manifold. And a second is we talk about large fixed point set. That is where, and I'm going to denote this. I'm going to denote this MG here is the same as fixed of Mg, I think that Fernando was using. I think I'm using them interchangeably. So here we're talking about, say, the dimension of the fixed point set will be large with respect to the dimension of the manifold. That's somewhat ambiguous, but it is what it is. And then the third is that I'm going to talk about today at least is large rank. That is where we're considering group actions. Where for which the rank of the group is large with respect to the maximum possible rank of a group action on a manifold? That is, we're talking about rank of G is large with respect to the rank. I should write this again, sorry. So the rank of the isometry group, which is also a compactly group. Okay, so. Okay, so before I move on talking more about these, I want to mention an important open question in the area, and that's the bot conjecture. This asks, well, it conjectures that if we have a closed, simply connected Miami manifold of non-negative sectional curvature, then the manifold should be rationally elliptic. Just to remind you what the definition of rationally elliptic is, that means that any simply connected closed Any simply connected closed topological space is called rationally elliptic if it's rational homotopy groups and it's rational homology or finite-dimensional rational vector spaces. If we're talking about manifolds, the second condition is automatically satisfied. So what do we know about rationally elliptic manifolds? Answer is not much. At this point, they have been classified in dimensions less than or equal to five. That's a curvature-free classification, and they're diffeomorphic to. And they're diffeomorphic to the known examples of manifolds of non-negative curvature. In particular, I'll just list them. We have S2, S3, and lower dimensions. And dimensions 4 and 5, the classification, if I didn't say it already, is due to Patronine and Petian and consists of, I'll keep cutting the eraser when I don't want it. We've got S4, CP2. CP2 product of 2S2s, connected sum of CP2s, plus or minus. And then in dimension five, we have a five star. We have the two S2 bundles. Sorry, S3 bundles. Let's write it backwards over S2, trivial and non-trivial. And the womb. And the wu manifold, which is a homogeneous space. I should three minutes in three. Okay. And I should, well, kind of run out of space here, but this, I'll run it up here. Then four and five, that classification, petene, and patan. And again, these are curvature-free classifications. Classifications. Okay, I want to go back to this example of the theorem that was originally proven of Sheng and Kleiner for positive sectional curvature. This is extended by Yang and myself and Kleiner independently. This is just, I'm just talking about the homeomorphism case in this particular moment. We showed that if you have an S1 action on a four-manifold that's closed and simply connected with non-negative sectional curvature. Connected with non-negative sectional curvature, then it's going to be homeomorphic to one of the five rationally elliptic spaces we know of in dimension four. So this was, Fernando already mentioned a little bit about this for non-negative curvature. He just spoke about the case where it was S4CP2, but you get these other three spaces, and this result was extended to. The result was extended to equivariant diffeomorphism by work of Fernando Galas-Garcia, Fernando Galas-Garcia, and Karen, and also and Grovom Wilking finally. So in this case, what they can show when we're talking about the equivariant diffeomorphism classification, you can show that the T1 action extends to a smooth T2 action. And in this case, well, we know that. Well, we know that the T1 action for S4 and CP2 will extend to a smooth linear T2 action, but for on the other spaces, any such T2 action is obtained as the quotient of a T4 action on S3 cross S3 with the induced T2 action. So you'll get a T2 action on and all of these spaces. And all of these spaces you can view as quotients of S3 cross S3. Okay, so another reason for mentioning this is that you can actually, you know, it's a little bit of a stretch to a certain extent, but you can look at the circle action as satisfying these three different definitions of large that I mentioned. So if you If you look at the dimension of the quotient space, that's three, and that's still small enough that you have quite a bit of control over the topology. So that's small. There is a case in here where you have the dimension of the fixed point set is equal to two. So you can think of that as being large fixed point set. So we've got small quotient space, we've got a large fixed point set. Space: We've got a large fixed point set, at least in some cases. Even, you know, on some level, even when it's zero-dimensional, you can still think of that as large with respect, you know, it's only co-dimension four. And then lastly, you can think of it, it can be shown, and I'm going to mention this a little bit later, so I'm jumping the gun a little bit, but the maximal symmetry rank here is equal to two. So Um, so rank one is actually almost maximal symmetry rank, so you can think of this as also quite large. Although it obviously doesn't look that large in this dimension. Okay, so well, it does look large in this dimension, but it doesn't look large in general. Okay, so I also wanted to mention that this result has been extended to almost non-negative curvature by To almost non-negative curvature by Harvey and myself. So the same five spaces occur. And I should remind you all what the definition of almost non-negative curvature is. So that's where you have a sequence of manifolds and you say it's almost non-negatively curved if you have a fixed number D, fixed positive number D, that gives you a uniform upper bound for the diameter of all these manifolds. And you have a And you have a uniform lower bound of minus one over n squared for your curvature. So you can see that as n gets larger, they're approaching zero, hence the name. Okay, so why am I mentioning this? Well, Grovan-Helperin proposed that the Bach conjecture, remember that said that simply connected closed manifolds of non-negative curvature should be rationally elliptic. So Grovan-Helperin proposed that this should continue to hold. Proposed that this should continue to hold for closed simply connected manifolds of almost non-negative curvature. And if you like, the result of myself and John Hardy, this confirms what some people like to call the plot grove Halpern conjecture. Help and conjecture for circle actions on four manifolds that are almost non-negatively curved. Okay, so it certainly makes sense. Go ahead. To understand the conjecture, I mean the statement here. You mean eventually? I'm a bit confused. So the bot conjecture should hold the, I mean, for a given sequence of many folds with almost a negative curvature. With almost a negative curvature from a certain point on. So, is that the statement? No, I mean, if a manifold, I mean, this is if a manifold emits almost no negative curvature, that means that eventually there's a metric that, you know, is actually very close to being. Oh, M is fixed. Thank you. Okay, M is fixed. Yeah, M is fixed. I'm sorry. I didn't really emphasize. It's the same M. So, yeah. Okay, okay, okay. Thank you. That was a good question. I should have made it. Was that a good question? I should have made that clearer. Absolutely. That's, I mean, it's confusing otherwise. It's like I said, sequence. So, did somebody else ask something? Yeah, sorry, Catherine. Hello? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay. I want to say that I think what was it Fabio suggested that I think this should be true. I would generalize this conjecture to sequences that if you have if you can put some epsilon there that If you can put some epsilon there, that there should exist epsilon where so that if you fix that, say, apodiameter one and sectional curve should be n minus epsilon, then it should be rationally received. Even what you're saying, if you let the manifolds vary. That's right. Okay. Okay. Yeah, sure. And I mean, I don't, I haven't thought about this, so I don't know enough to say yes or no. Anyway, I would like to propose that also. Okay, okay. So next time, I'll. Okay, okay, so next time I'll add a vodka, I'll bring Gapovich then. Okay, it's just going to get more and more names. That's fine, though. That's actually, okay, thank you. That's interesting. Okay, so where was I? I was right here, right? Okay, so the plan now at this point, you know, I mentioned a few like, you know, basic facts here. Basic facts here. We now want to look at the three different types of what we mean by large group actions or large symmetries. And I'm going to proceed in order. I'm going to talk first about small quotient space, then large fixed point set, and then finally large rank. I'm going to survey some of the results for each type of large. I'm focusing mainly on Riemannian manifolds again of positive, non-negative, and in some cases I'll include almost non-negative curvature. Cases I'll include almost no negative curvature. And then, when I finish with each one of these types of large, I'm planning to mention some possible future directions for each type of large that people might want to consider looking at. There are quite a few results, but there's also still lots and lots of stuff to do, which is great. Okay, so I want to begin with large meaning small quotient space. It bears mentioning that, you know, so smallest possible quotient. You know, so smallest possible quotient space would be dimension zero. So, you know, if this is equivalent homogeneous, means that the dimension of mg is zero. So that's as small as you can go. We know that all of these manifolds will have nanometric with non-negative sectional curvature. You can get that out of the Gray-O-Neal equation since you can put always a bi-invariant metric of non-negative curvature on the compact group T. Group G. On the other hand, though, when we move to cohomogeneity one, there are actually closed, simply connected cohomity one manifolds that don't emit non-negative sectional curvature. That's due initially to work of Grove, Wilking, Verdiani, and Ziller, and then some work of He, which extended the class of manifolds that don't emit non-negative sectional curvature. Okay, so that said. That said, there's a theorem of Schwachhoffer and Tuschmann that says that if we consider instead closed simply connected N-manifolds emitting isometric effective G-action of cohomogeneity one with G-connected, then the manifold does admit a G-invariant metric of almost no negative curvature. So if you like, you know, certainly all homogeneous spaces admit a metric with almost no negative sectional curvature, and so do homogeneity one. To kind of One. To kind of continue with what do these two sets of small quotient space type manifolds, if you like, with a group action on them, have in common, they're also both rationally elliptic. So in these two cases, this would, you know, these are confirmation that the Botgrove-Halperin, not Yekopovich, conjecture hold. Okay, so just to briefly give Okay, so just to briefly give an idea of quickly why this is true, if you have a vibration and any two of your spaces, it doesn't matter which two, right? So M, B, or F, any two of those are elliptic, that'll mean that the third is. So, and we know that compact Lie groups are elliptic, so. Lie groups are elliptic. So that gives you the result for homogeneous spaces. And then, as Fernando mentioned, there's a disbundled decomposition for manifolds of cohomogeneity one. So this is homogeneous here. And if you look at cohom one, these all decompose as disk bundles. Hopefully I'm imitating, I'm not totally remembering the notation he used, but so I can decompose it as a So, I can decompose it as a disc bundle over both of the singular orbits along the principal orbit. And I just erased that. I didn't want to do that. Okay, and then there's a result of Groven-Helperan. And that says that if we take any disk bundle, any manifold that decomposes as a union of disk bundles, if one of A, E, or B is elliptic, and B is elliptic. And in fact, if one of them is elliptic, since E is a sphere bundle over A and B, then you can go back to this result and you know that, well, in this case, since you've got a sphere bundle, that means that two elements in here are going to be elliptic. So the third is. So any one of these guys is elliptic, means all three are. And that in particular implies that the manifold is. So that's how you can see that easily, hopefully, that these manifolds are rational. These manifolds are rational elliptic. On you know, if we go back, um, if we move on though to cohomogen 82, so I want to look at cohomogen 82 now. You already see, though, in cohomogen 82 that in dimension four, I should say, that there are plenty of closed simply connected manifolds that not only don't admit a G-invariant metric of almost non-negative curvature. Of almost non-negative curvature, they're not rationally elliptic either. One example is given by CP2 connected sum CP2 connected sum CP2. You can just keep taking connected sums and generate as many examples as you like at that point. Okay, so a better question to ask might be at that point, are closed, simply connected, almost non-negatively curved manifolds emitting an isometric deaction of low coomogeneity rationally elliptic? And this question was answered. And this question was answered in part by Grove, Wilking, and Jaeger. And they showed that if I look at a compact Lie group acting by collagen V2 on a closed simply connected n-manifold of almost non-negative curvature with, yeah, then the manifold actually is rationally elliptic. So I do want to mention that using singular Romania foliations, which Fernando mentioned in his talk, that these can be. Mentioned in his talk that these can be viewed as a generalization of group actions. Khalili, Semani, and Muradeski have recently shown that you can simplify what would probably be considered the hardest part of the proof in the groove-looking results. So they split it into two cases. You can show that in a lot of cases for cohomogen 82 in this instance that with almost non-negative curvature that the manifold, you automatically can not automatically. Automatically can not automatically. It's easy enough to show that a decomposis is a union of disbundles. The other half of the proof is showing that for those cases where that's not so obvious, that you can tile, that your quotient space will tile a constant curvature one or a constant curvature zero space. And then they have to do a whole bunch of work to get that the manifold is then rationally elliptic using the result of Kalili, Semania, and Vradesky. Once you have that. On Gradesky. Once you have that tiling, you're done. Okay. So I wanted to talk a little bit about future directions that one could explore. So Fernando already mentioned, he talked about Alexandra spaces of local homogeneity. So I'll just briefly mention it again. So Alexandra spaces of cohome zero. Cohome zero. I don't remember if you mentioned this though. They're all homogeneous spaces. That's a result due to Berestovsky. If I look at Alexandrov spaces of Cohom 1, there's been some work, a fair amount of work. Fernando and myself, we found the structure theorem and did all the low-dimensional classification. And then there are some lovely papers. Some lovely papers of Fernando Carlas Garcia and I should say, Massume Saroy classifying in higher dimensions. And they got all of these results, I should say, these are all curvature-free. So an obvious question one could ask at that point is, you know, what about adding curvature restrictions? I'm just as a start, right? If you wanted to go into RCD spaces, that's as well. I should say, here, for I'm only talking about Alexander at this point. Here, you may need some extra restrictions to actually start, you know, to be able to kind of get a handle on this. It might be a good place to start with Lamania or Buffalo at that point. Yeah, and then you can also ask the Yeah, and then you can also ask the same question about RCD spaces. It's already been mentioned a couple of times already. There's a nice result of Gavas-Garcia, Kettle, Mandino, and Sosa that starts off looking at principal orbit theorem and establishing a few results for cohomogeneity one. It'd be nice to see if you can say any more, obviously. So, yeah, I think that's that's. So, yeah, I think that's all I wanted to say about future directions for, and there's plenty more. Yeah. No shortage of ways to move. Before I go to the next one, though, the next type of large I wanted to talk about is where you have a large fixed point set. So I wanted to remind you all about some facts about fixed point sets just to make it a little bit easier to, yeah, a little bit, yeah, just to orient ourselves. Okay, so. Orient ourselves. Okay, so the components of the fixed point set of an isometry are going to be closed, totally GIDS, except manifolds of M. So this is just the manifold case. You can generalize this to the Alexandrov spaces, et cetera, although the conditions you can impose are slightly weaker. The totally geodesic then tells you that whatever lower curvature bound you have for your manifold, you also have on your fixed point set components, which is a nice bonus. Bonus. If you are in particular looking at a circle action, then the components of the fixed point set will be of even codimension. So you have the same parity of dimension for fixed point set components of circles as you do for the manifold. Another nice constraint or another nice result is that for any proper subgroup of the group you're looking at, the group of symmetries, the fixed point set of the group is contained in the fixed point set of the subgroup. Contained in the fixed point set of the subgroup, and the normalizer of the subgroup acts invariantly on the fixed point set of the subgroup, with ineffective current being the subgroup itself. Moreover, you get an induced action then of normalizer modulo H on the fixed point set. And even better, if that group turns out to be connected, then the action will be invariant on each connected component. So this sets you up for induction arguments. For induction arguments, which is pretty nice if you have connected. If the group is not connected, then you may be out of luck here. But in general, what this gets you is that if you like, your fixed point set components are mini-mies of the manifold. And often the group action, that's the induced group action on the fixed point set components is sufficiently large that you can run an induction argument. Can run an induction argument. So it's pretty nice. Okay, I wanted to remind you as well. I know you just saw it, but what do we mean by fixed point homogeneity K? That means that we're looking at manifolds where the dimension, well, sorry, what do I mean by fixed point cohomogeneity K? So I mean that it's the dimension of the quotient space minus the dimension of the fixed point set. The dimension of the fixed point set if it exists. So, this is in general for non-transitive actions. So, this is g, this is a non-transitive action. And then you subtract one. So, I should also say that, you know, if we're looking at non-negative sectional curvature as opposed to positive sectional curvature, we don't have any guarantee. We don't have any guarantee of fixed points. So there's quite a bit of work in positive curvature where you don't have to have this additional assumption of fixed point sets. But if you are assuming that you have a large fixed point set, it's still natural to assume it, even in a negative sectional curvature. Okay, so there are classification results, as Fernando already mentioned, for closed. Fernando already mentioned for closed, I think he mentioned mainly the positive curvature ones, for non-negative curvature, fixed point homogeneous, that means k is equal to zero. In dimensions less than or equal to four, the results are due to Carlas Garcia. He does any type of, you know, fundamental group is not fixed here. So I should say, well, you know, I don't want to say any say no restriction. Say no restrictions on fundamental group as a classification got whereas if in dimension five Galaz-Garcia and Spindler gave a classification here is just no restriction here we assume pi one is zero and then in higher dimensions Spinteler found Spinteler found the following structure theorem. Just to compare it for positive sectional curvature, what you get is that the manifold decomposes as disbundle over F, meaning a disbundle over the orbit at maximal distance from F. Instead, in a non-negative sectional curvature case, we get a whole smooth sub manifold. This has more to do with the fact that in both of these cases, when you look at the quotient spaces, when you look at a fixed point homogeneous space and you look at the quotient space, then f maps to itself. I'll write a bar on it, but it's really equal to this. This f will be part of the boundary of mm g. Boundary of mi g. In the positive curvature case, it's a unique boundary component, and in the non-negative curvature case, you could have another boundary component, and then you get a double sole. But in general, what happens, though, is that you have a boundary component, and then you have the sub-manifold now at maximal distance from M and you can decompose the manifold then as a union of disbundles over the Union of disbundles over the fixed point set component, this largest fixed point set component, and the sub-manifold at maximum distance. So, this generalizes the theorem, the structure theorem in positive curvature. Yeah, unfortunately, though, a classification of because we do have a classification, so and Fernanda mentioned it, sex bigger than zero fixed point home. Bigger than zero, fixed point homogeneous. I should add pi one as zero, closed. That implies that the manifolds across, so compact rank one symmetric space. In non-negative curvature, we don't have any hope in higher dimensions at the moment, I should say. This was observed by Spindler that to get a classification. The six-point homogeneous classification. For non-negative sectional curvature, for dimensions bigger than or equal to six, this is actually equivalent to a classification of non-negative sectional curvature for dimensions bigger than or equal to four. And that's actually, you can see that if you look at just take any closed manifold. Take any closed manifold of non-negative curvature, cross it with an S2. You can take a circle action, and I can take the circle action on this that acts trivially on N and just rotates the two-sphere, the same action that Fernando was talking about in his talk. And that action is fixed point homogeneous. So you can see that, you know, as you're going, I mean, that's basically why this, you know, why it's equivalent, basically, because you can. Why it's equivalent basically, because you can find these n cross any n cross s2 where n is non-negatively curved and simply connected will be fixed point homogeneous. I mean, I should say this is n. Okay, that went the wrong way. Okay, so yeah, so a classification for this type of action. This type of action is out of the question, although you know we could basically need to classify non-negative sectional curvature in lower dimensions in order to be able to do it. Okay, so I wanted to talk a little bit more about future directions then. Okay, so there's work of Grove and Kim. Grove and Kim for positive sectional curvature, which is classifying fixed-point cohomogeneity one manifolds. Again, they show that you get cross. Crosses are your only options here. This might be a little bit ambitious. I have no idea. Really, I haven't thought about it too much, but you know, it would be nice to see if you can generalize this fixed point coho one result. Fixed point coha one result to non-negative sectional curvature. The structure theorem, I should say that the fixed point homogeneous structure theorem extends. Well, maybe I should say generalizes actually. So, this generalizes. To Alexandrov's basis of positive curvature by work of John Harvey and myself. So, a natural follow-up question there is: can we generalize spindlers? Fixed point homogeneous structure theorem Alexandrov spaces with non-negative curvature. So this is probably potentially too ambitious a question. Again, maybe it might be better to consider Ramonian orbifolds at that point first. But still, you know, these are just a few directions. You know, I don't know. Yeah, I mean, certainly you could start thinking about this for RCD spaces too, potentially. Okay, so the next type of large I wanted to mention would be large rank. So again, Fernando set all this up for me, which is, yeah, thanks again. Yeah, thanks again. Um, so just um, you know, when we talk about large rank, first, you know, what is the symmetry rank of a g-action? That's defined to be the rank of the isometry group of n. That is as follows. And so that's, you know, the largest dimension of the maximal connected abelian subgroup of the isometry group of the manifold. And I think I said this already. I think I said this already, but it bears mentioning again. Unlike manifolds of positive sectional curvature, manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature that admit an isometric TK action may not have any subtorus with a non-met fixed point set. So there are results of Berger and Sugahara that generalize work of Einstein. So Berger shows that for TK on M to N. On M to N, and this is for sec positive. So that implies that mt is non-empty. And then the work of Sugihara says that if I'm looking at an odd-dimensional manifold, then there exists a circle orbit. So you'll have a subtorus of co-rank one fixing points. Okay, so what we have no guarantee of this in general for Of this in general for Tor sections on manifolds of non-negative sectional curvature. That said, going back to the Bach conjecture, which I'm kind of doubling down on here, obviously, if you look at a rationally elliptic manifold, it turns out that, yes, you have fixed point sets for torus actions if the rank is large enough. So, this is a lovely result of Fernando Velas-Garcia, Martin Karen, and Marko Radeschi. And Marko Radeski, and tells you that if you've got a TK action, then on a smooth, rationally elliptic n-manifold, then the maximal rank is a floor function of 2n over 3. And any subtorus that acts freely on the manifold has rank bounded above by fluor of n over 3. So, certainly, that tells you if you're above floor n over 3 for the rank, then you're going to have some fixed point sets of some subtry. Sets of some subtrai. So that's, you know, then, you know, if the Bach conjecture holds, then we know that, for example, for a non-negative curvature, you are going to get fixed point sets, which would be great. So that was my next remark. If the Bach conjecture does hold, then yeah, this would get you fixed point sets. This would get you fixed point sets of subtori if you have a large enough rank action. Okay, so Fernando mentioned that there's a maximum symmetry rank theorem in positive sectional curvature. We know that the rank of the largest torus that can act is about half the dimension of the manifold for positive sectional curvature. Unfortunately, in non-negative sectional curvature, we don't have an established maximal symmetry rank. An established maximal symmetry rank, except in some low dimensions, what we do have is a conjecture, which goes as follows. If we're looking at a torus action, so I'm looking at a TK acting isometrically and effectively on an N manifold, I want it to be closed and simply connected, then the following should hold. So this is what we conjecture for the maximal symmetry rank that it matches the same number that Micheles-Garcia, Karen, and Gardleski got. Karen and Radeski got namely that it's floor of 2n over 3. And moreover, in the case where we do have, when we hit maximal symmetry rank, the conjecture then is that the manifold is equivariantly diffeomorphic to a space Z, which I'm going to describe in just a second, modulo torus with a linear TK action. So you've got a TK action acting on this quotient of this manifold. Of this manifold by a torus. And the manifold itself is a product of spheres. So yeah, the spheres here are all, so you've got a bound on the total number of odd-dimensional spheres, which you've given to you in terms of the dimension. And here, if you notice, since ni is bigger than or equal to two, that means my spheres are all of dimension three or larger. And And this is just, you know, the shortest way possible to write that essentially zero is less than or equal to m is less than or equal to two. But to give you the parody, in which case, so I want to, you know, explicitly, what are the manifolds that should be showing up? They are, so in dimensions 3m, this is a case, well, an M full product here of three spheres. If I move on and look at 3M minus If I move on and look at 3m minus 1, this should be, let me just double-check that I got it. Yeah, this should be an m minus two-fold product so that the dimensions add up. Or so it's going to be S5 cross m minus 2 S3, or it's going to be the manifold from before modulo a circle action, or in this last. In this last M3m minus 2, you can have S7 cross a whole bunch of S3s. And this is going to be, if I'm not mistaken, this is M minus 3 fold again. And likewise, this is as well. It's actually n minus twofold cross NS4, but I wanted to write it so that you can see that you're essentially getting the same dimension here. Either that or it's going to be. Either that, or it's going to be one of the spaces from before. It can be the top space, modulo T2, or the second modulo a T1. Okay, so, and those are all the spaces that can occur, that are conjectured. I shouldn't say that can't occur, that are conjectured to occur. Okay, so what do we know about this conjecture? So, so far, in dimensions four through six, by work of Fernando Galas Garcia and myself, and Galas Garcia and Karen, we have the We have the conjecture is totally confirmed. We've got the upper bound on the rank of 2n over 3 floor function, and we also know that they are all equivariantly diffeomorphic to quotients of products of spheres by torus actions. And in dimensions seven through nine, we've also confirmed the conjecture. Again, the upper bound and the equivariant diffeomorphism classification. That's by work of Christine. That's by work of Christine Escher and myself. And we also know that the upper bound holds for n less than or equal to 12. That's work of Fernando Galas-Garcia and myself, and Christine Usher and myself. Okay, so what do these spaces have in common? Or what do these actions have in common? It turns out that all of these manifolds and that Of these manifolds and that show up in this equivariant classification and that are maximal, they all turn out to be what we call isotropy maximum. My pen is messed up. Still messed up. Okay, so they're isotropy maximal. What does that mean? That means that the dimension of the isotropic group is going to be n minus k, that is the cohomogeneity of the action, or equivalently, the orbit is going to be a dimension. equivalently the orbit is going to be of dimension 2k minus n. You should note that this n minus k is the maximum possible rank for any isotropic group of a TK action on an n-manifold. I left out the n here, but that's the dimension on a manifold. That's not hard to see, but that actually follows from the maximal symmetry rank theorem, if you like, for actions on spheres. But that being maximal, that's where the name is coming from. So it's isotropy maximal. It's isotropy maximal. So, what do we know about isotropy maximal torus actions? Well, Veemuller showed that for those where the dimension of the fixed point set of the torus is zero, that they're all equivariantly diffeomorphic to a quotient of a free linear torus action of a product of spheres again. So, of three spheres, and again, this n. Three spheres and again this NI is going to be bigger than or equal to two. So you're looking at three spheres as the lowest dimensional sphere that can show up here. Okay, so and that's where, you know, again, so that's the lowest possible case you can have showing up. I should mention that this condition that the dimension of mt equal to zero and t isotropy maximal. This is what's called a torus manifold in general. So moving on from there, you know, it's reasonable to then say, you know, what happens if the dimension of that fixed point set can be larger? And I put my whole name in there, just with the inconsistent here. So, Christine Escher and myself, we just Christine Escher and myself, we generalize this result to all isotropic maximal torus actions on such manifolds, showing that they're all equivariantly diffeomorphic to a quotient of a free linear torus action of this space Z here. Okay, and I guess I should emphasize that for all of these results, both for Weemuller's result and for the result of Escher and myself, we're no longer the, you know, when we're writing, it's, we're saying that this is, you know, you're getting Z mod T here. Getting z mod t here, so mod t sub m. But now m is not limited. You know, certainly we want it to be bigger than zero potentially, but the limit here is a function. I'll just write it, it's a function of the dimension n and the rank k. So it doesn't have to just be two as it was in maximal symmetry rank case. So this is a whole range of manifolds that can occur. What else do I want to say about this? What else do I want to say about this? If you combine this last result, the result of Escher and myself with the theorem that I mentioned earlier of Gales, Garcia, Karin, and Radiski that tells you that you have the upper bound and the lower bound when it's rationally elliptic. That would, if you, well, what do I want to say? Yeah, I don't think I. To say, I yeah, I don't think I, yeah, okay, it does say what I wanted to say. Okay, so if you combine these two results, um, that would give you then, and you assume, in addition to, you know, you assume that the Bach conjecture holds basically that, you know, non-negative curvature implies rationally elliptic, then that gives you, you already get part one of this maximal symmetry rank conjecture by assuming that you've got that non-negative curvature implies rationally elliptic, but you now get part two of a maximal symmetry rank conjecture, namely you've got. Maximum symmetry rank conjecture, namely, you get the classification up to equivariant diffeomorphism of what the manifolds would be if they had maximal symmetry rank. Okay, just a final remark is that together with Dong and Escher, we extended the result to almost isotropy maximal actions. That means that instead of rank n minus k guaranteed for isotropy, so let me say rank T. So let's say rank GP equal to n minus k. Now what you know is that the rank is going to be bigger than or equal to n minus k minus 1. So it includes almost isotropic maximal, includes isotropic maximal, but you can have things that are strictly almost isotropic maximal, namely that the rank is at most n minus k minus 1. Okay, so I did want to mention a few future directions that we could go from here. That we could go from here. And that's where I'm actually close to being on time. So that's kind of amazing. Okay, so yeah, I wanted to talk some questions that you can ask. So there's some obvious questions you can ask just to follow up from this maximal symmetry rank conjecture and these results on isotropy maximal action. So, you know, I'll mention a few of those, but there are quite a few other directions you can go. So you can certainly. So, you can certainly ask, you know, what about TK actions on manifolds with non-negative sectional curvature? I'm always assuming simply connected here because you won't have that bound if you don't assume that. If you look at rank, then strictly less than n minus k minus one. So, look at those with you know that are almost almost isotropy maximum. I've got to come up with a better name there. I should mention, I didn't mention it, but we do have an almost maximal symmetry rank classification. So in positive sectional curvature, there's the maximal symmetry rank classification, there's an almost maximal symmetry rank classification, and then there's a half maximal symmetry rank classification. The almost maximal symmetry rank classification and positive sectional curve. Classification and positive sectional curvature goes from a so maximal symmetry rank was a diffeomorphism classification, it lowers to homeomorphism for almost. Here though, for non-negative sectional curvature, we have a classification in dimensions less than or equal to six. This is due in dimension four. If you like, the result is due to that whole string of people that I mentioned for the People that I mentioned for the Shang and Kleiner result, that then, so it's Yang and myself, Kleiner. I'm running out of space here. Let me write it over here, Velasque Garcia Karan and Robin Wilking are responsible for it in dimension four. In dimension five, that's worked myself with Fernando de Las Garcia. And in dimension six, this is due to Escher and myself. So we have an almost maximal symmetry rank classification. I guess it's I guess it's. I wanted to mention that only in dimension five. So, in dimensions four and six, we only see the same sorts of manifolds that we see in the maximal symmetry rank classification, whereas in dimension five, the Wu manifold shows up. It's not going to show up for an almost isotropy maximal action. It shows up when the rank is strictly less. So, it'll be, in that case, that's five minus two minus one again. Minus one again. So, um, is that right? I mean, basically, it's when you have circle isotropy only and you have isolated fixed points that you can see that blue manifold showing up. So, it's not part of the previous classifications, but it does seem to indicate that, well, it does indicate that presumably you are going to start, you won't get the same classification that you got for almost isotropy maximum. So, it'd be interesting to see what happens for those. For those, you know, so obviously move a step lower with the rank, but another question, too, is also here, I guess, can we extend both the almost maximal symmetry rank and the maximal symmetry rank classifications to higher dimensions? So, for almost maximal symmetry rank, that would be dimension seven and higher, and maximal symmetry rank would be 10 and higher. I have, yeah, plenty more comments here. I wanted to mention as well that there's a lot of work just on tourist actions that are Alexandro spaces. Should have been doing this earlier with a notation. There's work due to Jesus Nunez Simbron. This is all curvature-free. Well, you're assuming curvature bound and below, but that's all. There's work of Fernando with Niño Simbron, so Fernando de Las Garcia, Niña Simbron, as well. I'm going to manage to mention all. Well, I'm going to manage to mention all of the organizers. So, Coro, Nunez, Simbron, and Soray have also done some work. And all of this is extending work of Orlik and Raymond in dimensions three and four. So So, a reasonable question to ask is: you know, what about higher dimensions? So, this again, it's so there's work of O and dimensions five and six. This would be natural to see if it can be extended. Finally, I wanted to mention, I think Fernando mentioned it briefly. You know, if you're looking at A closed manifold, a non-negative sectional curvature with finite fundamental group. Boom and looking showed that you can put a metric on the manifold such that the Ritchie curvature is going to be positive. So, certainly a direction to go here. You know, if you're looking at non-negative sectional curvature, and it's one Looking at non-negative sectional curvature, and it's one that's been explored by Muye recently. So he's looked at the K intermediate Ritchie curvatures. Let me see if I can copy this page. Okay, so there's this K intermediate Richie curvature. I'm going to denote it as Richie K, and he looks at positive. This is a curvature that interpolates. A curvature that interpolates between sectional and Richie. He's shown recently that you can get bounds for the symmetry rank. And so he's shown bounds for symmetry rank that depend on the K you pick. And then there's a generalization of Richie K that's been extended to RCD spaces. That seems, you know, by Hederer and Monkino. So, you know, certainly it seems, you know, totally natural to explore what happens when you have symmetries in this case. So yeah, I'm, time is up. And that's all I wanted to say. And that's all I wanted to say. So, yeah, thank you. And gracias. So, thank you very much, Catherine, for this beautiful talk. So, any questions for Catherine from the audience? Okay, so just so it's a very vague question, but say what are the main tools used in, say, when you talk about these results in Alexandrov geometry, say in addition to parentman stability, what are the main tools that are used of Alexandrov to get this kind of results? These kinds of results. Well, another important one that's been used is the Soul theorem. So, you know, if you happen to, at least the fixed point homogeneous, and you know, you've got a quotient space is an Alexandro space. It's either, you know, if you're looking at positive or non-negative sectional curvature, you've got positive or non-negative curvature in the Alexandro sense, and then you'll have a soul. Um, you'll have a soul. You know, the fixed-point set component that you're guaranteed by the fixed-point homogeneous condition guarantees you that you have an Alexandro space with boundary. And then you can look at the distance function from the boundary, and what will be at maximum distance will be the soul. And using that, that's part of what was used to get these structure theorems. That's a large part of what was used. Other tools, other tools. Other tools, other tools, I mean, certainly the stability theorem was certainly very important in the slice theorem. And then maybe is the slice theorem an underlying tool also in the result that you talked about today? Is it hidden in the proof of most of the results that you mentioned today? I mean, the slice theorem shows up all over the place. So, yeah, I would say, yeah, I mean, you know, the slice theorem shows up. I would say, yeah, I mean, you know, the slice theorem shows up, and then, you know, you certainly use, you know, when at least when you're talking about small quotient space, for example, or a quotient space that you want to be able to get some control over, that's not so much true necessarily. And for non-negative curvature with large symmetry rank, you still use your quotient spaces. But for positive sectional curvature, the tools are a little bit different. You use this connectedness principle. Use this connectedness principle, which is really working in the manifold. But when you are working with a quotient space, yeah, I mean, the slice theorem just shows up on some level trivially in the sense that, you know, you have this action by the isotropy group on your normal space to the orbit, and the quotient of that action is telling you what the space of directions around the image of the orbit is. Orbit is so you know, or the full strata of orbit that you have, so it gives you control over the local geometry of the Alexandra space in general. Got it. So, yeah, it's a super important tool. You kind of can't live. Okay. So, thank you. Sure. Any more questions for Catherine? Yeah, so I had also a naive question. So A naive question. So, in all of these results for Alexandrov spaces, so you have a group action acting on the Alexandrov space, a posteriori, like all the spaces turn out to be like homeomorphic to, say, Orbifolds, right? So, is it expected to get some like new Alexandrov spaces, which are maybe not homeomorphic to Orbifolds, or is like the general philosophy that the group action is too strong so that the space has to be The space has to be like an ORB fault generally. Like, could you say something about this? Okay, so I suspect that other spaces are going to show up. I don't expect that everything would be an orbifold. You can already see, so there's this result that Fernando mentioned of myself with John Harvey and just looking at circle actions on four manifolds. And what was really Manifolds. And what was really hard there is that, you know, when you're looking at, yeah, well, so circle actions, non-informed manifolds on four-dimensional Alexandra spaces of positive curvature, the problem there is that your space of directions, you no longer have the kind of control that you have in the Romanian case, where you just have a unit sphere. Now you just have, you know, you know that the space of directions has to be a puzzle. A positively curved Alexandrov space. In this case, closed. And the fact is, already in dimension three, you know, it doesn't have to be constant curvature. Constant curvature, there are a lot of aspects of the Romanian case and then the Romanian order fold case that give you a lot of rigidity on the space of directions that you totally lose when you go to the Alexandrov case. You know, we have a conjecture in there of what we think should be happening. We think should be happening with the extents, but that would then give you the ability to kind of control what happens to the quotient space. But yeah, no, I would expect if you go beyond dimensions four, four is super special. So for a large number of reasons, right? I would assume if you go for dimensions higher and also if you're looking at, say, fixed point sets or even, you know, orbits that are small enough with resp, I mean that's Small enough with respect, I mean, that have larger normal spaces. Let's say, for example, OS work, right? Like circle actions on, like, say, five spaces. Yeah, so if you're looking at that, and it turns out that you had, say, just isolated fixed points, then you would be looking at acting on, you know, if you're in five dimensions, well, I would go up to six, I guess. If you had isolated fixed points, then you're looking at an action in the map. Looking at an action in the manifold case on a normal S5, but for an Alexandro space, you have, I mean, they're not even classified, right? Five-dimensional positively curved. So no, I don't expect to see just, I don't have an example in mind either, unfortunately. That's a really good question. But yeah, I would expect to see other spaces. Definitely, not just Romania and Orbuffolds. It's much too restricted. It's much too restrictive. Okay, thank you. Maybe somebody else has an example in mind. I don't know if Fernando or Vitali have an example in mind. I mean, you can take, for example, already in the mention five, like T2 action on CP2 and then take the suspension. Right. And that's. It's not going to be a Romanian orba fold, is it? Right. Yeah. Okay. So there you go. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah, that was. No, it's a good question. It's, I mean, but it also. No, it's a good question. It's, I mean, but it also, you know, the underlying point too is though that, you know, Alexandro spaces, you don't have as much control, I guess. And yeah, I think, you know, maybe there's some step in between Romani and Orbifolds and Alexandra spaces that we should be taking. Not really sure. What would be like kind of an intermediate class that would be reasonable to be looking at? But yeah, it's kind of like, yeah, you. like yeah you you lose all control on some level and you know which makes alexandra spaces you know certainly they're they're they're beautiful and you know there's they're they're an extremely rich class of space to to look at but um also very difficult so yeah i have a follow-up comment a bit related to what fernando said it's my impression that uh your results with fernando on co-homogeneity one alexandra spaces gives you a tool to just build You need a tool to just build Alexander spaces that can be as singular as you want. Yeah. Yeah, on some level with a fairly large group action. Yeah, so with that recipe, I think you can cook examples. Yeah. For example, the cone Fernando mentioned and then just glue, take the double. Yeah. And you can keep doing that too, right? And, you know, and certainly you can do that with a Poincare homology sphere, right? You take, you just keep doing it. Like you just keep doing it with that one, right? So same concept. Yeah, I think you any more comments, questions?
