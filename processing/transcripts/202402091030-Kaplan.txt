And thank you to all the organizers for the invitation to speak. This has been a really lovely week here. So today I'm going to be talking about some joint work with Philip Ehrlich, and he did a nice job of introducing the serial number system and the exponential function on that system earlier this week. But I just want to refresh us on some of the features that I'm going to be using. So the class, which I'll do NO or NO of Surreal. Or no of surreal numbers was constructed by Conway and it's generated as follows, just by this one sort of simple rule. If L and R are two sets of surreal numbers, and no member of L is greater than or equal to any member of R, then you can form a new surreal number, which I denote by L and then a line and then R. And as you can see, this is sort of like we start with nothing, we slowly generate more serials. With nothing. We slowly generate more surreal numbers following this rule. Of course, for this rule to make sense, we have to know what it means for one surreal number to be greater than or equal to another one. But the definition of that sort of gets constructed at the same time as we construct the numbers, right? So this new surreal number will lie in between of L and R. So at first we begin with nothing. So the empty set is a perfectly good set of surreal numbers that satisfies trivially this condition. So we can consider this. Condition, so we can consider this real number. We have nothing on the left and nothing on the right, and then the simplest thing in between those two things we call zero. And then after constructing this real number zero, we can use it to construct further serial numbers. So we could put it on the left. We're going to then construct a serial number which is greater than zero, which we'll call one. And we can also put it on the right. We'll construct a serial number less than zero, which we'll call negative one. And we use this notation. And we use this notation L line R to denote the simplest surreal number lying between L and R. So for example, now that we have 1 and minus 1, we could put 1 on the right and minus 1 on the left, consider the surreal number in between those two things. But we've already constructed a surreal number in between those two things, namely zero. So this minus one, one, we wouldn't consider this as a new surreal number, just a new name for something we've already constructed. Name for something we've already constructed, namely zero. But using our numbers zero, one, and minus one, we can construct a few new things. So for example, minus two, which will be less than minus one, minus a half will be between minus one and zero, one half between zero and one, and then two, which is bigger than one. And so the picture that I like to have in mind when I talk about these things, and Phil already presented this picture, is we can visualize the serial numbers as a tree. This real numbers as a tree where the levels correspond to the point in time where we construct these numbers. So, first we constructed zero, and then we used that to construct minus one and one. And then using those, we were able to construct minus two, minus one half, one half, and two. We can keep on going. Now we have things like three over two, we have things like three, we have one-fourth minus one-fourth, three-fourths. We can keep on going. As you can see, at the finite stages, there's sort of this dyadic behavior. We're constructing various dyadic rationals, that is to say, rational numbers whose denominator is a power of two. But of course, we can continue this construction going infinitely far. And if you sort of make the right approximations, put the right things in the left side and the right side, you can construct any sort of rational number, for example, two-thirds. Number, for example, two-thirds. And you can also construct irrational numbers in this way. You just sort of look at, I guess, the dyadic representation. This sort of tells you where to put things. And you end up with things like square root of 2, e, and pi. This is all happening sort of at the omega level of this tree. You can also construct infinite numbers like omega here. So this is what happens if you take all of the natural numbers that you've constructed so far, put them in the left side. So far, put them in the left side, put nothing in the right side, then you're going to construct a number which is bigger than all these natural numbers. So we'll call that omega. You can also play the same game putting all of the positive numbers on the right side, but 0 on the left side. You get something like 1 over omega. You can also play the game on the other side and get minus omega. And then from here, we can keep on going. So this is really a transfinite construction. This actually goes up through. Construction, this actually goes up through all of the ordinals. So after omega, we can use omega to construct things like omega plus 1, omega minus 1, so on and so forth. And then if you go far enough, you can actually define things like, say, the square root of omega, or omega to the omega, things like that. So in this tree, if you read this from left to right, we get a dense linear order where one surreal number is going to be bigger than another if it's further left in the tree. We're sort of ignoring the height. Tree. We're sort of ignoring the height here. We're just imagining projecting this tree down to this line. That gives us the dense linear order. And then going up the tree, we have a well-founded partial order. So any chain in this tree is going to be well-ordered. And we can actually make use of this tree structure, this partial order, to define a lot of interesting algebra. To define a lot of interesting algebraic operations. So, given a surreal number x, I'm going to use x superscript L to denote a typical element of the left options of x. So if x is the simplest thing between L and R, you let XL range over L, and you let XR range over R. And addition and multiplication can be defined recursively as follows. So for addition, X plus Y is, you look at a is you look at an arbitrary left option of x, add that to y, add to x an arbitrary left option of y, those are your left options of x plus y, and then do the same thing on the right. And of course, this is all sort of well defined because you can represent x and y using simpler things, and then all of these operations are in some sense, and you can make this precise, of simpler complexity than adding x and y. So you can assume that you already know what all of these things are. Know what all of these things are. And of course, the idea here is that a left option of x is less than x, so a left option of x plus y is going to be less than x plus y. If we want this to have an ordered group structure, this should hold. And it turns out that this is enough. This actually defines taking this addition, gives no the structure of a divisible ordered union here. x times y is a little bit more complicated. I'm going to maybe try to give some reason why these are the right operations. If you look at x minus a left option of x and a right option of y minus y, these are both bigger than 0. So if we want our multiplication to make no into an ordered ring, we should expect the product of these two positive things to also be positive. So x minus Also, be positive. So x minus xl and yr minus y, these are both positive. The product is positive. You can expand the product and then bring the term xy to the other side, and you get that xy is less than this other thing, which is defined using addition and subtraction and multiplication, but the multiplication only applies to things which are, in some sense, simpler. So this is once again a recursive definition you can use. And with this product, the serial numbers are not just an organization. Are not just an ordered ring, they're actually a real closed ordered field. Moreover, the surreals are an exponential field. Gonshore defined an exponential function on the surreal, so an ordered group isomorphism from the underlying additive group of null to the multiplicative group of positive elements. You can define this recursively. There is a recursive definition. It's a little long, and I'm not going to try to maybe justify all of this. I just want to point out that a lot of the terms that are appearing here are sort of partial Taylor sums. So you can see that this definition of exponentiation really sort of behaves the way that we might expect a real exponential to behave. And indeed, Vanerjes and Eric showed in 2001 that this real ordered exponential field is actually an elementary extension of the real ordered exponential field. Of the real ordered exponential field. This is a little bit maybe difficult to show just at the level of exponential fields. What they really do is they consider the real field with the exponential and restricted analytic functions, likewise for the surreals, and then using the Benji's McIntyre marker axiomatization, you're able to show that these are both elementarily equivalent. Okay, so the motivating question. A subclass of the serials is said to be initial if it's downward closed under this well-founded partial order. So in the tree picture, a subclass is initial if it basically fills up some part of the bottom of the tree. You can go down the tree and you're still in the subclass. And initial surreals, initial substructures of surreals, have a number of nice properties. Phil talked about some of them on Monday. There's a lot of sort of On Monday, there's a lot of sort of constructions you can do that become in some sense canonical once you're looking at initial substructures. Additionally, the operations: addition, multiplication, exponentiation. Once you're dealing with an initial substructure, these operations on no actually become the same. You can define the same operations on your substructure, and you can look at predecessors in the substructure, and everything sort of works out. So I guess initial substructures sort of inherit a lot of the nice. Substructures sort of inherit a lot of the nice recursive features that No enjoys. Sorry, just describe this being downward close. So does it mean that if I am at some point in the tree and I go down along a line or everywhere in the lower level? Yeah, sure. I'll go back to. So, for example, if two-thirds is in my initial set. Is in my initial set or my initial class. Everything below it, so 5 eighths, 3 fourths, 1 half, 1, 0, have to be there. But for example, 4 does not, even though it's at a lower level. Right. So I mean, just down every branch in this tree, everything below you. Yeah, everything that's comparable to you and simpler than you has to belong to this tree. And this projection on the density of your order, but it's not like for an initial case. That's a good question. I don't think that you can distinguish what's initial and what's not at the level of just looking at this projection. You might have lots of substructures of the serials which are not initial, but if you just look at their projection, you might not be able to tell so easily. So, really, it's this well-founded partial order that distinguishes the initial substructures from the other ones. Right, so for me, an ordered logarithmic field is going to be an ordered field with an ordered group embedding from the positive elements to the additive group of the field. So here I ask that the logarithm be defined on every positive element, but I do not ask that it be surjective. And if this embedding is surjective, then we'll call k an ordered exponent. Then we'll call k an ordered exponential field. And we denote the inverse of the logarithm by s. And this talk is about ordered exponential fields, but to sort of state precisely the main theorems, I'll need to talk about ordered logarithmic fields as well. So logarithm is defined on all the positive things. You might only have a partial exponential in that case, but if you can define the exponential everywhere, then it's an overvalued exponential. And in our paper, Serial Ordered Exponential Fields, Phil Ehrlich and I considered the following question. Which ordered exponential fields are isomorphic to initial exponential subfields of the surreals? So that is to say, of course, we want to know if something is isomorphic to an initial exponential subfield because then it inherits all of this nice structure. And also being isomorphic to an initial exponential subfield might impose some sort of Might impose some sort of restrictions on what these exponential fields look like, and that would be sort of interesting to see. So, before getting into the answer, I'm going to briefly discuss the analogous question for just ordered fields, which was answered by Ehrlich in 2001. And this will allow me to sort of also set up the notation that I'm going to be using. So, you already know that there are proper initial textures? Sure, yeah. For example, Sure, yeah. For example, even in the Van Entries-Ehrlich paper, you can see that the surreal numbers of height less than omega-1, so those are countable distance from the root, those form an exponential subfield. Yeah. And that's a classification of those initial? No, there are plenty more. So I'll talk about the work of Arrange and Mantics is not a characterization. Not a characterization. Not a characterization. They just present, I guess they give a full characterization of at which levels of the tree can you stop and get an exponential field. And these will all be initial. But for example, there might be initial fields which don't sort of fill out that part of the tree entirely. So there might be things which are a little bit thinner in some sense, a little bit sparser. Right, so to set up some notation, let gamma be an ordered abelian. Let gamma be an ordered abelian group, possibly a proper class. So the surreals are, of course, a proper class. And you can actually see this by this construction that I gave on the first page. I said if you have any two sets of surreals, then there has to be something in between them. So of course, the surreals themselves couldn't be a set. So gamma is an order-debeling group. And the Hahn field, for us, will consist of all of the transfinite series, sum of r beta, t to the gamma. Of r beta t to the gamma beta, which are indexed by some ordinal. The exponents have to form a decreasing sequence in gamma. They're going to be, I guess, reversed well-ordered in gamma. And each of these r betas will belong to r minus zero. So the parts where the real number, the real coefficient is zero, we can just sort of ignore those gammas and only count the gammas where the coefficients are non-zero. non-zero. So we denote this by R, double brackets t to the gamma, and then we have the subscript ON. The subscript on, which means ordinal, this is saying that all of these series have to be of some ordinal length, so some set size length. When you restrict to cases where gamma is just a set, this is just the normal definition of a Hahn field. But when gamma is a proper class, these are in some sense similar to the capital. These are in some sense similar to the kappa-bounded honeycombs, where you're restricting the support to be just set size. A truncation of an element in a Han field is just an element. So if I have my element r beta, t to the gamma beta, where beta ranges over ordinals less than alpha, I can take any ordinal alpha 0 less than or equal to alpha and just stop this process. And just stop this process at alpha zero. This will be a truncation of this element, so it's an initial segment of the element. And then the cross-section of Rt to the gamma is just the monomial group, so the multiplicative group t to the gamma. And there's a great theorem of Conway that says that we can actually view the surreals as one of these Han groups, where the Where the value group, this ordered abelian group gamma, actually turns out to be the surreals themselves. So you can view the surreals as a Han field where they are their own Han group. So Rt to the no is isomorphic to no via a map which sends t to this infinite element omega. And so we can, using this isomorphism, represent any surreal number as an infinite series. number has an infinite series like this, where instead of t I write omega to the gamma beta. And we'll sometimes write that no is equal to our omega to the no. So here we're just replacing t by this element omega. And this is just referring to this isomorphism here. Is there a relationship between the series and the path through the tree? There are some relationships. There are some relationships. For example, the truncation of a series is going to be a predecessor in the tree. And you can even do some things like if you mess with some of the coefficients, if you replace maybe the leading coefficient with something simpler, sometimes you can say something there. But it's not so clear-cut. So reading off, for example, what is initial doesn't, it's not just an easy thing where you sort of look at the series and say some things. Say something. Yeah, so there are a lot of connections and they're very useful, but it's not a sort of full character session. Okay, so yeah, I want to talk about this question that Phil gave an answer to about initial subfields of this reels. So let's let K be a subfield of this reels. And we're viewing K as a subfield now of this pond field where we've replaced T by omega. field where we've replaced t by omega. And what we can do is we can take the smallest group gamma, the smallest subgroup gamma of the serials, such that k is actually contained in the Hahn field with value group gamma. So you just look at all of the monomials which appear in the series expansion of any element of k, and you throw that in. So suppose that k is initial. Then as I just Then, as I just said, any truncation of anything in K is simpler. So, any truncation of anything in K has to belong to K. This tells us that K is truncation closed. Closed undertaking truncations. So let's take an element here in K, r beta, omega to the gamma beta, beta less than A. Let's take some beta zero less than alpha and consider the truncation up to beta. And consider the truncation up to beta zero. Well, that truncation belongs to k, and since k is a field, we can subtract that off. And what we get is sort of the tail of this element. So everything between beta zero and alpha. And then what you can show is that actually the leading monomial of this series, omega to the gamma beta zero, is simpler than this sort of tail. So we see that omega to the gamma beta zero also has to belong to k. Since we can do this for any material, Since we can do this for any monomial appearing in any series of any elements in k, we see that k is cross-sectional. So omega to the gamma is actually contained in k. And then it follows, if you do a bit of work, that omega to the gamma, or sorry, that gamma itself actually has to be an initial subgroup of k. So if k is an initial subfield, then its value group must be an initial subgroup. Sorry, this should say initial subgroup. Sorry, this should say initial subgroup of no. Yes. And actually this turns out to be enough, these three conditions that I listed here. So a subfield of the serials is initial if and only if it's truncation closed, cross-sectional as a subgroup of R omega to the gamma on for some initial subgroup gamma. So all you need to check is truncation closeness being cross-sectional and at the value Being cross-sectional, and that the value group itself is initial. And of course, you can use this theorem to not just say which subfields are initial, but which subfields are isomorphic to initial ones. So an ordered field K is isomorphic to an initial subfield of the serials, if and only if it's isomorphic to a truncation closed cross-sectional subfield of Rt to the gamma, where gamma is isomorphic to an initial ordered subgroup. Isomorphic to an initial ordered subgroup of the surials. So explicitly, if you have a subfield of this Han group and you have some initial ordered group embedding iota from gamma to no, then you can actually get an embedding of the Han field into no, which does sort of the obvious thing. It takes one of these series here, replaces t by omega, and replaces this exponent by its image. This exponent by its image in the surreals. So this sends our confield here into the surreals, and the image of k under this map is initial. So how can you use this? An initial map iota for the value group always exists if the value group is divisible. This takes a little bit of an argument, which is in Phil's 2001 paper, but it always works. But it always works. And from this, you can use the result of Moir Grosser, which tells you that any real closed-ordered field admits a truncation-closed embedding, which you can also take to be cross-sectional, into one of these Hahn fields to get that any real closed-ordered field initially embeds into the suitables. Yep? Yeah, so you need also that the residue field of K is an initial subfield of the reals, but any subfield of the reals is initial. For example, it contains Q, and then anything that's not in Q is just going to come at the omega level, so all of its predecessors will belong to Q. So, yeah, you don't need to assume anything about the residue field here. Yeah, that would work perfectly well if the residue yoga is kind of cool. Okay, so now that we've sort of given an answer to this ordered fields question, I want to return to exponential subfields. Of course, an ordered exponential subfield of the three os will be initial, just in case the underlying ordered field is initial. The underlying ordered field is initial. So you could use this previous result to say, okay, well, the initial exponential subfields are exactly those exponential subfields which are truncation closed, cross-sectional, and where the value group is an initial subgroup of the serials. Of course, this is not a very satisfying answer, right? This doesn't really tell us very much information. So really, the question becomes, well, which exponential fields are isomorphic to initial subfields? Initial subfields. So, is this motion preserved by automorphisms? Being initial. No, not unless you ask that the automorphisms preserve simplicity. Any automorphisms preserve means implicitly acceptable identity? Yeah, is it a sum like a child of the automorphism? The automorphism? Yeah, I find it hard to believe that there would be any automorphisms preserving simplicity except for the energy. That shouldn't be possible. So, yeah, this is, of course, the automorphisms just at the level of fields. This might totally mess with this partial order, and so simplicity or initiality might not be preserved. Probably, in general, it won't be. Sorry. So, can you just collect what's the difference between the characterization? What's the difference between the characterization of initial ordered subfields? Yeah, so that's, I guess, my point: that the initial exponential subfields are exactly those exponential subfields which are initialist fields. So this does not give a very satisfying answer. This is nothing more. So the real question becomes: well, which exponential subfields are isomorphic to initial ones? And can you answer this in a way more satisfying than just, you know? More satisfying than just something like this. Okay. So using this identification of no with the field of Han series, we can give a nicer description of the exponential function in terms of its restrictions. So I had this definition at the beginning, which is a little bit unwieldy, although it does at least sort of indicate that it's based somehow in this simplicity relation. But when you break it apart into different parts, it becomes much nicer. It becomes much nicer. So x maps the purely infinite elements, those are those elements whose exponents are all positive, onto the monomial group. So you take a purely infinite element, you plug it into the exponential, and you actually get a monomial. X restricts to the real exponential on R. And then for infinitesimal epsilon, you can say what X is just using this. Is just using this Taylor sum. And the fact that epsilon is infinitesimal, you can invoke Newman's lemma and get that this is actually a well-defined series which will live in 1 plus the infinitesimal elements of null. And of course, if you know these three parts, you can write any surreal number as a purely infinite thing plus a real number plus an infinitesimal. The exponential of a sum should be the product of exponentials, and so you get the exponential on all of the serials in this way. In this way. Right. Just as I said, you can break it apart into these three things. This completely determines the exponential. Okay, so here's an initial guess. You might consider, let's say, a logarithmic Hahn field, which is just a Hanfield equipped with an ordered group embedding log from the positive elements to the underlying additive group, which satisfies the following properties. Which satisfies the following properties. Log of x should be less than or equal to x minus 1 for all positive x. This is basically more or less equivalent under the other axioms to the growth axiom for the exponential. It says that the logarithm grows slowly enough. The logarithm should map the monomial group into the purely infinite elements. This is sort of the opposite of the exponential mapping. This is sort of the opposite of the exponential mapping of the period of infinite elements, punomials. Log should restrict to the real logarithm on the positive reals. And if epsilon is infinitesimal, then log of 1 plus epsilon should agree with the Taylor expansion. And so we might naively guess that an ordered exponential field is isomorphic to an initial exponential subfield of its reals, if and only if it's isomorphic to a truncation closed, cross-sectional exponential subfield. Cross-sectional exponential subfield of a logarithmic confield. And now there is sort of a notational thing I want to point out. For us, it's really useful to have that these Hahn fields are logarithmic, meaning that the exponential isn't defined on the entire additive group. And this is because, primarily, of this result of Kuhlmann-Kuhlmann's law, that unless gamma here is a proper class, Gamma here is a proper class, which in some cases we don't want to have, a Hahn field will not actually support an entire exponential. So it's convenient for us to only include this logarithm and have the exponential be only partially defined. That being said, when I talk about an exponential subfield of a logarithmic field, all I mean is a logarithmic subfield on which the induced logarithm is surjective onto the underlying additive group. So where you can define the additive group. So where you can define the exponential on the subfield, even if you can't define it on the entire onfield. You clear what I mean by that? Okay. So, like I said, this was a naive guess, so something's going to go wrong. Before I say what that is, let's see what goes right. So, we'll use the following approach, which was used by Rousser and later by Benju, McIntyre, and Marker. Higher marker. Let's suppose that we have a truncation-closed cross-sectional exponential subfield of a logarithmic confield. Let's let k0 be a truncation-closed logarithmic subfield of k. And let's assume that k0 is sort of relatively cross-sectional, by which I mean any time one of these monomials appears in the series expansion of something in k0, then the monomial itself is in k0. So relatively cross-sectional. So, relatively cross-sectional in this Hahn field. So, let's assume that we have an initial logarithmic field embedding from k0 to the surreals, which preserves monomials and infinite sums. So, what we're going to try to do, if we assume that our naive characterization is enough, is we're going to try to extend this embedding to all of K. Right? We want to keep on going, adding more things, and hopefully, we'll still get an embedding. And hopefully, we'll still get an initial logarithmic field embedding from k into these fields. Okay, so the first thing that we note is that if we have a series like this, which is indexed by a limit ordinal, and if every proper truncation of x is in k0, so I have something which is not in k0, but all of the proper truncations are, then I can actually extend this embedding to include x as well. X as well. So, in terms of evaluation theory, you would say that this is sort of the immediate extensions case. You can close off under passing two immediate extensions inside of K. That's no problem. Moreover, if you have some element in K and its logarithm belongs to this subfield K0, then you can extend this embedding to also include this element x. So, closing off under exponentials, that's also no problem. Dimensionals, that's also no problem. So, what's missing? So, assume that you play this game, you have your K0, and you assume that it's maximal with respect to the previous extension. So, if you have anything whose logarithm is in K0, then that thing is in K0. And K0 is sort of relatively spherically complete inside of K. So there's no immediate extensions inside of K that you can add to K0. So, let's take an element. So let's take an element, just an arbitrary element, which we might as well assume is a monomial in k, but not in k0. So you can define the sequence as follows, a sequence xn. So first of all, you start with your element x, t to the gamma. And then at the next stage, what you do is you take the logarithm. Since k0 is closed under taking exponentials, you know that this logarithm is actually not in k0. And since And since k0 is closed under sort of relative immediate extensions, you also know that there's actually a maximal truncation of this logarithm in k0, right? If there were no maximal truncation inside of k0, then you could find an immediate extension of k0 inside of k. So you take this maximal truncation, you take it away from the logarithm of x sub n, and you take its absolute value. sub n, and you take its absolute value. This gives you your next element xn plus 1. And so you keep on doing this. You get a sequence of elements which are in k but not in k0. I'm also of course using here my assumption that k and k0 are both truncation closed. Right. So the question is now we have this element x and we sort of have this tail that we built using x. Where are we going to send these things inside of the surreals? Send these things inside of the serials. Fortunately, because surreals have this nice structure, there's sort of a canonical way to fill cuts. If you have a cut in the surreals, you can just put everything on the left side of this cut to the left, everything on the right side of this cut to the right. And there's a canonical simplest element which realizes this cut. So we can do this. We can look at all the things less than x, look at their image in the serials, put that on the left. Same with all the things bigger than x. We just let y Go the next? We just let y be the simplest element which realizes this cut, and then we do the exact same thing to define a sequence for y. So y0 is y, yn plus 1, we just take the log of yn, we subtract off the image of this an, remember that an is in k0, so we know what its image is, and then take its absolute value. And we can show, this takes a little bit of work, but under fairly mild assumptions, which I'm not going to say what they are, that these elements yn, These elements yn, they actually all turn out to be monomials for each n. So, of course, y0, it makes sense that that's a monomial since we sort of start with a monomial. But it's an interesting fact that all of these actually turn out to be monomials. So, if we want to create an embedding from k to no, which preserves monomials, then we need to ensure that all of these x's are monomials as well. And the conception of a logarithmic confield does not give us enough to conclude. Field does not give us enough to conclude that. So, what we need to do, in order to conclude this, is make use of this definition of Schmelling from 2001 in his thesis of a trans-series field. So a trans-series field is a logarithmic Han field, as I defined before, but with this extra property sometimes called T4, which is maybe a little bit difficult to sort of wrap your head around, but it turns out to be exactly what we need. To be exactly what we need, it says that anytime we have a sequence in the value group and a sequence in k, this should actually be a sequence in here in this logarithmic confield. If we have that a n is a truncation of this log of t to the gamma n, and you subtract this off, this gamma n plus 1 should be the t to the gamma n plus 1 should be the leading term of this difference. So these are the conditions. Difference. So these are the conditions on these two sequences. And then the conclusion is that actually eventually this log of t to the gamma n minus this truncation is just equal to this monomial t to the gamma n plus 1, or perhaps it's negative, when n gets sufficiently large. So a bit of a strange definition, but it turns out to be just what we need because We need because if we take our trans-series field and we let xn be the sequence as above, meaning this sequence right here, then this tells us exactly that xn is actually in t to the gamma, xn is actually equal to a monomial for n sufficiently large. So then if we want to send it to a monomial over here, that's going to be no problem at all. And so our main theorem is that an ordered exponential field K. Is that an ordered exponential field K is isomorphic to an initial exponential subfield of this reals if and only if it's isomorphic to a truncation closed cross-sectional subfield of one of these trans series fields. Okay. So as I maybe sort of briefly mentioned, bandaging Sort of briefly mentioned, Ben and Jerus, McIntyre, and Marker showed that anytime you have a Hahn field, so I'm not recording this as a trans-series field now, just any Hahn field, this can be expanded to an elementary extension of the reals with restricted analytic functions just using Taylor expansion. So you already know what these restricted analytic functions do on the reals, and then you extend them to the infinitesimals just formally using Taylor expansion. And so we're able to. And so we're able to show that any elementary extension of R and X admits a truncation closed, cross-sectional exponential field embedding into a trans-series field, which preserves restricted analytic functions. So you can sort of take your model, just sort of work through piece by piece, and you'll get this embedding into here. And as a corollary, and this was actually first shown by Anton Julio back in 2013. Antangelio back in 2013, any elementary extension of R and X emits an initial elementary embedding into the surreals. So what we do is we just first embed it into this trans-series field and invoke our theorem. Antangilio embeds these elementary extensions directly to the surreals using o minimality and basically just filling cuts. Of course, you need to show that once you fill a cut and you sort of take the definable closure. And you sort of take the definable closure of this new thing that you add. This is still initial, and this takes a little bit of work, but it's doable. The same thing holds if you replace restricted analytic functions by any Virus-Draw system, which includes the restricted exponential. So we discussed Virus-Draw systems a couple of times during this workshop. I guess the idea is that a Virus-Draw system of restricted analytic functions gives you enough additional structure for our. Additional structure for our embedding theorem to go through. This brings us to our first open question, which somehow is more difficult than you might expect. Let's just take K, a model of the theory of Rxp. We don't know whether K admits an initial embedding into the serials. The thing is that we just don't know. Know whether the sort of restricted analytic functions, which are definable in here, give us enough structure to work through our embedding theorem into a trans series field. So this is somehow a little bit trickier than you might expect. Unsure. And then, of course, the obvious approach is to use the embedding result by Rousser in his 1993 extended abstract, which gives a truncation close. Which gives a truncation closed cross-sectional field embedding of any such model K into a Hahn field. What's the catch? The issue is that for epsilon infinitesimal, the way that this embedding is constructed, it might not actually happen that the image of the log of epsilon is given by this Taylor series in epsilon. And this is really the only obstruction is at the level of these infinitesimal elements. Of these infinitesimal elements. So, taking this Hahn field to be a trans series field, having everything work out well on the infinite elements, that's really no problem. All of the difficulty occurs for epsilon infinitesimal. So really, that is to say, if you know how to answer this question for R, models of R with restricted exponentiation, then you should be able to use this to handle models of R with the full exponential. It's really the sort of restricted part that's causing these problems. Problems. Okay. So, improving the main theorem, of course, you know, we know that the exponential fields which are isomorphic to initial subfields are also isomorphic to subfields of trans-series fields. The mean theorem is this one. This characterization. This one, this characterization of when an exponential ordered field is isomorphic to an initial exponential subfield. So we're able to give another proof of this result first shown by Berdici and Mantaba in 2018 that the surreals are a trans-series field. So showing that the serials are a logarithmic confield, this was essentially all done by Gonshore. It's really just this axiom T4. It's really just this axiom T4, this sort of axiom about taking logarithms and truncations that you need to check. Our proof sort of goes from the ground up. So we sort of build the largest initial trans-series subfield of the surreals and show that if it's not the entire surreals, then you can just extend it. They use different methods. So let's let rt to the gamma be a trans series field. Be a trans-series field. And let's call an embedding of this trans-series field into the serials trans-serial if it preserves logarithms, infinite sums, products, and monomials. And so the open question is which trans-series fields emit initial trans-serial embeddings into the surreals? And a sort of related question is: which logarithmic fields are? But if a related question is which logarithmic fields are isomorphic to an initial logarithmic subfields of this real? So we answered this for exponential fields. Of course, you could ask the same thing for logarithmic fields. And we don't have a full answer in this case. You could look at the main theorem a different way. And you can see, okay, so we said that any exponential field emits an initial embedding. If it's a truncation closed cross-sectional subfield. Truncation closed, cross-sectional subfield of a trans-series field, you could say, okay, well, any trans-series field which has a truncation closed, cross-sectional exponential subfield, emits an initial trans-serial embedding into this reals. So just sort of, instead of using the trans series field to embed the subfield, you use the fact that you know this about the subfield to embed the trans-series field. And you can use this to prove a nice corollary. Any trans-series field emits a truncation Field emits a truncation closed, not necessarily initial, trans serial embedding into the serial. So, how do you do this? You just use this fact of Schmelling, which shows that any trans-series field Rt to the gamma can be extended to a further trans-series field, Rt to the gamma star, which is actually closed under exponentiation. And now, due to this Kuhlman-Kuhlman-Schula result, this gamma star will actually have to be a proper class. And then any initial trans-serial embedding. And then any initial trans-serial embedding of this bigger thing into the serials induces an embedding on the smaller thing, which may not be initial, but which is at least truncation closed. So this answers a question raised by Gerarduchi and Mataba. I just want to note in connection with this last question, we have some sufficient conditions for this, which are used in doing this. So any sort of trans-series field with a chunk. Trans-series field with a truncation closed cross-sectional exponential subfield meets these sufficient conditions. One of these three conditions is necessary, the other two are not. So we have a counterexample that shows that those other two conditions are not necessary. So really the search for the, the answer to that last question is to find necessary and sufficient conditions. Okay. And then I want to end by a connection to trans series, which was already mentioned. Which was already mentioned by Phil in his talk on Monday. Let T be the field of logarithmic exponential trans series, which has been talked about several times by now. Then there is a canonical embedding from T into the serials, which sends this indeterminate x to omega. So, for example, there's a paper by Aschermanner, Van Andrees, and Van der Hooven that explicitly builds this embedding. But this has been full quote for some time. For some time. This is even an elementary embedding of differential fields where the derivation on the surreals is the one defined by Verdicci and Mantava. And so we show that the image of this canonical embedding is initial. The way that we show this, by the way, isn't by using our main theorem, it's actually by using this explicit description of what the image looks like due to Verde Chi Mantava and then sort of working through all the steps and showing. Of working through all the steps and showing that all of these steps preserve being initial. A very tempting open question is to ask: which ordered differential fields admit initial embeddings into the surreals? And this question is difficult. For one thing, there are many possible derivations on the surreals. And while the theory of the surreals as a differential field is understood thanks to work of Eschenbrenner-Veningers and Venderhuven, it's still quite complicated. It's still quite complicated. A lot of these discrepancies between the different possible derivations sort of arise maybe at higher levels of the tree when you're dealing with these sort of very infinite elements. So you could sort of relativize this question and ask something a bit more down-to-earth, like which Hardy fields admit initial embeddings into the serials? That might be a little bit more manageable. And in fact, we know that all Hardy fields actually admit embeddings into the Surreals, so you can maybe. So you can maybe just sort of play with that facts a little bit and hopefully get something out of it. But anyway, that's all I wanted to say. So thank you. Questions for Elliot? Yes, so on slide number 16, you talked about the results that Rousseau outlined in this famous 93 abstract. It's 93, absorb. And I guess it was about finding exponential integer paths, which meant that Rousseau was not really interested in the infinitesimal elements because he just wanted to round up and down. So my question is, how is that again an abstraction towards actually obtaining an initial embedding? How is this an abstraction? Right, so if you. I mean, if you want to have an embedding at all, Have an embedding at all? You would want that the image of the log of epsilon is equal to the log of the image of epsilon, but the log of the image of epsilon is this thing. So the image of the log of epsilon should also be given by this thing. So you sort of, when you're doing this for serendipity stuff, you're sort of playing a game. You could use some sort of like, by other arguments, for example, any model of R, say with restricted exponential, emits an embedding into a Embedding into a Hahn field where the restricted exponential agrees with its Taylor expansion, but this embedding might not be truncation closed. Rasir is able to get truncation closeness, which, as you say, is important for getting this integer part, but at the expense that this condition does not necessarily hold. And it seems to be, I mean, after working on it for a little while, it seems not easy to get both of these things to hold at once. But does a small does the smallest or minimal uh initial exponential field in these reals exist? A smallest or minimal or like a smallest or minimal or like something like that. Like what would a small version like what like prime is it? Yeah, so the prime model of the theory of Rx that admits an embedding into this real Inmits and embedding into this reels. Its image is actually contained in the reels, so it happens to be initial, yeah. So, really, the Archimedean models of this thing are no problem. It's really all about once you have infinite plus elements, that things get a little bit tricky. Michael, did you have a question? Yes, can you see? I'm a bit confused because this expansion that you require for the log. Oh, yeah, this is a typo, I guess. Yeah, this should be log of one plus epsilon. Thanks for the catch, yeah. I'll put you on the spot away, but in 2001, I asked the authors of one of these papers that you've been mentioning the full application of this broad Ravenna world that they were. Broad break new world that they were describing, and which I had to learn MDG set theory and not be model theory, and I had to learn what some real numbers are. 25 plus years later, is there any reason for me to learn this over just RNX? I mean, if you can just say hell, I mean, if you don't know one, I'm not, you know, just I it's been 25 years and I never got an answer. They refused to answer, actually. You refuse to answer, actually. Yeah, no, it's a great question. I mean, um, I think that there I could see there being applications of having this sort of canonical simplest thing, maybe to proving that certain things exist. But that's it, thank you. I'm interested in the last question. I'm interested in the last question, the differential fields and then do would you have ideas? Like how the field will just exponentially bound it. Would you have ideas of how the conditions are changed? I mean there is, I guess, uh There's certainly been things done about, like, you know, take some Hardy field or take some sort of embedding, maybe into just the trans series. And if you assume that your initial thing is, you know, truncation closed, then is the Leovo closure of this truncation closed? These seem like the right tools to be using, like to go through the sort of extension theory for H fields and check that, you know, under an appropriate transient embedding, they preserve truncation closed network. Transfer embedding, they preserve truncation closeness. But the actual details of this, I don't know. So there was the slide where you define the notion, where the gross action for the logarithm appeared. Out that every Han field is a local one, I proved that a long time ago, and that's where I use this observation to construct the E L series by starting by a logarithm that is not subjective. So, this is always the case for any Hungry model. So, any value group, you can define a logarithm that does these things. Okay, great. Thanks. can define an embedding of the value group in the infinitely in the ring of infinitely large elements and this one is not necessarily surjective so you are missing exponentials and then after that you do the countable construction to get the exponentials and is there one comment I want to tell you so you don't have to put any conditions on Conditions on, well, you have to work over the reals. Right, yeah, sure. But otherwise, you don't have to put any conditions. Any HAN field admits a logarithmic, what I call logarithmic cross-section. Okay. So this is what... And there were a couple of results of twenty twenty-one in particular on the truncation writing of exponential field. Feel no, not this one, the next one, that one? Yeah, this one. This one is also not new. I'm sorry, I'm not trying to be obnoxious. I'm trying to tell you that it's not new. In fact, I looked it up in Serum 516, page 87, in my 8000 monograph. Okay. By the way, so for these logarithmic, so take a Hanfield, turn it into a logarithmic Hanfield, is there any sort of characterization of when this satisfies the X and T4? No, I only looked at the gross axiom schemes at that time. There wasn't T4 yet. Okay. And the embedding result here, is that also into trans-series fields with this T4 or into just logarithmic fields? Just logarithmic fields. Just logarithmic fields. Okay. Like a a field of power series with obviously non-surjective logarithmic. Okay. No, not definable. Maybe that's the difference. Yeah, so I mean we do the sort of standard embedding checks, but at every stage we check that it also preserves this T form. Okay. Right, and that's what it's used to get this thing more. I don't know whether it's useful for you to know that every hundred. So for you to know that every one of it is operated across section by some of the authorities I don't know. Okay, yeah, thank you. I guess since this is the very end, maybe let's do a round of applause for the organizers. round of applause for the organizers who were
