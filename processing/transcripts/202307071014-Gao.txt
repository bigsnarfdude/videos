Oh, yeah, sorry, we can see you now, so yeah, please go ahead. Thank you very much. Okay, uh, uh, thanks for the introduction. Good morning, everyone. So, I was planning to come on site, but unfortunately, I haven't got my visa yet, although I submitted my application in January. So I don't know really what happens. know really what happened so i borrowed this picture uh from j's we chat uh page to pretend that i am here so today i will talk about quickly about our idea of an informatics framework for assembling human cell atlas as a digital life which is kind of my personal dream for building this as a digital life so so i i don't think i need to uh talk about the background since this is a the Since this is the last day, almost the last talk. So, I have been thinking about this question since I first learned about the single cell and cell atlas study. That is, how should we organize the cells? They are very different and there are so many. So, I have started to think about this question at least five years ago, but it turned out that till now, It turned out that till now, the community hasn't really come to a satisfactory solution yet. So let's look at the HCH data portal. We can see that these are just a huge archive of data files. They really collected a large data archive, but this is not what an assembled atlas like. And also, if we look at other And also, if we look at other portals like the one at Broad, it's a similar organization. So, all the data are archived as data files. So, let's compare with the human genome product. We know that in early days, so the sequence, the genome segments, they are deposited into the gene bank, which to me looks like a similar data archive, similar to the current data archive of the Archive of the cell analysis. But the final human genome is in the form of the kind of assembled genome like the one we see on the UCSC genome browser or maybe somewhere else. So this is the thing that I have been thinking: that is how we can really assemble the cell ati is probably also in the short gun manner. And another thing is that although the Is that although the large consortium like HCA and the other products, they are generating a large amount of data. But the data published in the public domain, the amount of data they increase is kind of faster than the data generated by the consortium. So I had another part of the question. Had another part of the question that is: can we assemble the cell atlas from those scattered data? So, this is the background questions. So, to think about this question for the assembly, we need a framework for which we assemble all the data too. And again, thinking about the genome, the genome has a natural backbone, this 1D chromosome or genome coordinate, and all the information. And all the information that can be organized along this one dimensional coordinate. Then, what is the proper framework to index or assemble all the cells of the atlas? So initially, I had thought that probably it's just a 3D coordinate system or 4D if we float time. But when we look deeper, it's Uh, when we look deeper, especially when we worked on building the heart atlas with the collaborators in the Fua hospital, we realized that the heterogeneity of the cells, the information heterogeneity, is much more complicated than the genome. There are multifaceted spatial or functional variations at different resolutions, and there are discrete or And there are discrete or continuous gradients. So we decided that it is not feasible to really build a single coordinate framework of whatever dimension to really index or assemble the cell atlas, at least for now. So then we what it should be a solution. So after trying many After trying many approaches, we proposed this idea of a unified information framework. That some necessary elements of the framework is that we need to have a big data repository for all the cells from different studies from different organs. And this repository should enable quick retrieval so that we can reorganize the cells at all angles or from all. All angles or from all wheels. As I said, there are multi-resolutional, spatial, temporal, and functional coordinates. So we should make a flexible rather than a fixed framework. And also, of course, as a basis, we need a unified ontology graph or knowledge graph for unified annotation of the cells. This is a proposal. And following this proposal, we developed a kind. Also, we developed a kind of a template system for this. We call it a Human Ensemble Cell Atlas as a solution for the, we call it cell-centric atlas assembly. So this is a cover we designed for our paper publishing these results. And we got idea from the from the Uh, from the movable types in printing. So, uh, the movable types is a we know it was a big invention by the Asian Chinese people. And the point is that there is not only a single fixed system to organize all the characters. And we make the character as a mobile types and we use. As a mobile types, and we use the characters to reorganize them in the ways we need to make the article, to make the book. And that is somehow the way we make our body, our organisation, our organs. Or if the body is mixed in one form and we have other, maybe we have other research interest for using the atlas, then we should reorganize for. Some particular reorganized for some particular research institute. So, this is the job. So, in other words, instead of trying to invent a single fixed coordinate system, we should design a system so that we can have as many coordinates as possible, and each of them can be used as an index. So, when we built this, the first channel turned out to be a Turn out to be a challenge for the computation technique. And that is that the information content of the cellular atlas is many attitudes, magnitudes higher than that of the human genome. So that's also one reason why those data portals archive the data from different studies as files. So I call it a file-level collection. So our dream. Level collection. So, our dream is a style-centric or style-level assembly, which we need really a big database that is big in both widths and depth. So, it turned out that the current database available is not suitable for that task. So, my colleague, Professor Ri Jiang, developed this UGT. We call it UGT unified giant table. UGT unified giant table for to contain all the cells. Currently, the capacity of this UGT on a single desktop server can support the storage of more than 100 million cells, each with more than 1 million features. So, this allows us to really assemble all the RN-seq or text-sec signal of millions of cells into Of millions of cells into one data repository. And the important thing is that all this data from different studies can be queried and retrieved within seconds. So this is the foundation. The other foundation, we designed a framework. We call it UNIHAF, U-HAF, that is Unified Hierarchical Annotation Framework. That is basically a knowledge graph for the anatomic structure. For the anatomic structure and knowledge graph, another linked knowledge graph for the cell ontology. And so, actually, we are currently updating this UHAF as we are trying to build this website for the community to make corrections and contributions. So, this upgraded version of U-Hub has not been published yet, but we are trying to publish. are trying to publish in this year and I hope all the community can work with us together to really define this you have. And that's another technique we developed with this HECA is a computer language we call e-court. That is we can send it as a digital interface to biology. We can use this language, we can write our query. Our queries on the cells, gene expression, on the metadata, on the cells annotation, or on the technique used using these kind of few lines of computer codes to search our database. So in this way, we are doing in data sales audienced. So that is actually what the story I want to make. So with these three techniques, we built this ECA. The first version of ECA. The first version of ESA contains slightly more than 1 million cells, human, all the healthy cells from 38 organs. So the data size is small in the first version. And we are trying to release the second version this year. And with this, we provided three functions. For the interest of time, I'll only introduce this, the first function. This is the first function that is the function. Uh, by the website, what is the website looks and this is the address? So, so, so the first function is that we based on the in data cell sorting. That's like we do in vivo or in virtual sorting, cell sorting. We define the conditions of our the criteria we want to use for We want to use for extracting the cells from the whole body using the E-COT language from the ECA. So now the ECA, the HECA becomes a kind of a virtual human body composed of data cells. And we use these few lines of codes to search through the whole body, the cells that we want to study. And this is much. want to study and this is much more powerful than the the the the the uh the the real cell sorting because the real sorting depends on that's on the availability of uh uh the biomarkers but now we can do uh the uh use all the features we have so that's why we have the flexible uh coordinate system so we have 100 dimension a different resolution uh or even higher Or even higher dimension of whatever, we can use all the metadata as also as the coordinate. So we can define these conditions. So the use of this is one straightforward use is that we can use this to construct sub-atalysis to our request for downstream analysis, whatever you want to do. So and a special example. A special example we did is that we call it in data drug experiment. That is, we have some drugs. Suppose we know the effects of the drug on the cells, on the genes of the cells, but we cannot apply the drug on the body, on the real human body, but we can apply it virtually on the virtual body. And we can use the E-code gene data cell sorting to extract all the cells. Extract all the cells that would be affected by this drug according to the mechanism of the drug. This is readily be done, especially for the current cell therapy, which is designed. We know the designing principle of the drug. And with this, we can recruit all the cells throughout the whole human body that could be affected by the drug. By the drug, and then some of them may be the real target of this drug, and the other is the off-target or side effect. So, we have conducted the experiment on the CAR T drug, on two CAR T drugs, and we can see that these are the cells, the upper panel are the cells that would predict to be the target of this CD19 plus party drug. 19 plus party drug. And from this marker, we know that they are the real, real targets. But only the cells that highly express this marker are the real design targets of the drug. The other cells are off-targets, and the off-targets compose about half of the screen cells. And we can analyze their organ origins, and we can analyze their cell types and produce. Cell types and predicts their effects on the phenotype. So, this is what we call the indata drug experiment. The idea sounds beautiful to me, but the big imperfectness is that 1 million cells is too small to really represent the human body. So, we cannot really treat. Really treat the version one of HEC as a virtual body. So, of course, we can depend on all kinds week for the creation of more data. But during this meeting, we thought that we may be able to do something with machine learning. That is, we developed one at one effort, we developed a unicored deep learning model that can be done for, it can be used for data of. For it can be used for data augmentation. So, the idea is that we can, I don't have time to go into details. I guess most of us are familiar with the neural network model of VAE, the variational auto-encoder. This is a slightly modified version of the VAE. The modification is that we added supervised signal at the embedding layer. At the embedding layer, and use this single node to learn the coordinates we already know or we are really interested in. And the coordinates can be the spatial information, cell type information, functional gradients, or can also be the technical, some technical batches. And use that, we pre-trained this model on the HECA data, and then we can use that to generate. And then we can use that to generate data, new data, along the axis of interest. So this explains the idea of the hybrid VAE. So I will skip the details. And we have done a series of experiments in data augmentation. For the interest of time, I don't go into details. The work has been put on the bioarchive for quite a while. Put on the by archive for quite a while, and we are adding more and more experiments, so it hasn't been submitted yet. So, so we can see, for example, we can convert cells, we can based on cells from different techniques, we can convert them all to the one unified technique. And we can also say using cells of other types. Cells of other types and converts them to augmented cells of the assigned cell type, specific assigned type. And we can learn the trajectory of the spatial actually, the functional gradients. And generate the data along these gradients. And we can also interpolate Interpolate cells along the developmental time. And so that we can really using this data augmentation, we can have the continuous valued time sampling of some trajectory. And of course, we can do this similar thing on the space. So I'm not sure. So, so I'm not sure about the time I have used. I think it's 15 minutes, it's quite quick. So, I let me give you the summary. So, I mentioned two things. One is the HECA we designed as a cell-centric assembly of the cell atlas, and we invented the in data experiment. And in the future, we predict or we believe that this in data experiment, if we incorporate the person. And if we incorporate the personalized data, we will become the cellular data tool for each individual. And we can do the in-data experiments for medical decisions to help medical decisions in the future with this cellular data. And we developed this unicorn for data representation and augmentation. And also, we are developing some large style models following the Following the inspired by the recent progress in the large language models, but I don't have time to tell. I hope I will be able to share with you the progress in the future. So these are the people behind the work I have to talk about. And I managed to get a picture of your meeting room. And so I welcome everyone to visit our and try. Visit our and try it, uh try our HEC and give us feedback. Thank you. Very good. Thank you. Any quick question for Shirku? Uh, yeah, we're talking about Shiku. This is a ULE from Guilla University. Uh, so uh you have done an impressive effort on collecting uh one hundred million cells. Uh I also read your paper on LET foundation and training foundational model into dark lung model. Model into a large lung model. I just want to know that what's the challenge you saw in plan to actually train another sort of large lung model using this impressive database and renew itself. You don't have a resource for PE use. So could you comment on how can that be achieved? Because obviously the drug intellectual experiments, everything will have to be done through this relear. You can enable that from the free-train model. A free-train model, but then that's not a serial task for someone without the GPU computing. I'm sorry, the voice is not that clear to me. So I'm not, what is the question? I got you are talking about the huge data sets and for the large models. So what is the question? Yeah, the question is, so not everyone have the resource for the training. Resource for the training to language the model. And then, you know, obviously, with this huge amount of information, it's very daunting for people to collaborate. Although you have an efficient query, but then for someone like us trying to actually innovate on the large language model side, can you comment on how can that be enabled for people without the GPU computing power? Okay, thanks for the question. So for the SE Foundation, we have The IC Foundation we have put on the by archive. So that was a collaboration with the IT company. They have provided, so during the experiment, we really used a huge computing resources. So that is a question that worried us, that we are worried about. But we are developing another model. model uh it it it is ongoing now within our lab which uses only four uh gpos and uh with a smaller uh uh training uh data size and we hope it can achieve uh a kind of a comparable performance in some of the applications it's not a it's not a a another version of the ice foundation it's a two for different It's for different two scenarios. But I think personally, I hope that more efforts should be put on the kind of the light models that require less computational resources and as well as less data. So, and also we have developed a heart atlas with Atlas with one million heart cells, and experiments show that with that one million heart cells, we already can do a lot. So, we don't, so of course, the more data the better, but we need to use more effort to try to kind of remove the redundancy and use smaller models to learn the underlying relationship. Underlying relations. I hope that's my kind of a personal thinking on this. All right. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Perhaps we can continue this discussion on Slack. Can I confirm, Professor Gaal, are you online? Are you on Zoom? So this is the last speaker who was moved from another day to today because of difficulty with meeting. Difficulty releases. So, Professor Gungao, are you here online? I don't hear a response. If not, then I assume you're not here. Okay, then this is the end of today's session. Thank you, everyone. This is it of the formal part of the talks. Do you have anything to say? I just want to thank everyone for saying to the end. I think I feel I feel quite inspired. I really enjoy the whole week, but also at this point, we feel that we're overwhelmed with a lot of information. So I would say, you know, the information is out there. I think quite a few of us probably smaller group conversation that we wish to have after classing one third. So I thank all. So, I thank all speakers or participants. So, a few things to announce is that number one, the Slack will be open. So, if you'd like to reach out for each other, you know, continue our conversation, please reach out to the Slack because it's not a paid site. That means messages will get lost after three months. But obviously, if you really have a good conversation, you will move it off somewhere else. But we will keep it on for. But we will keep it on for 11 feet. Number two, someone has suggested: so there's a career opportunity channel. If you are looking for jobs, you know, people looking for jobs, you're looking for postdocs, you have openings, two frequent posts there. So that's a communication way to actually meet groups. I encourage everyone, and I think we should post something of the general, that if any collaboration forms If any collaboration forms or come from this meeting, please acknowledge, maybe you write a sentence so that we can look at acknowledge. So, one, if you could acknowledge and you can let any of the co-organizer know you have acknowledged, just so that we can put onto part of the report for this, what is what I'm able to do is if you decide to come back again as group, then this gives an opportunity to organize. Organize. Melissa's suggestion, Melissa's suggestion. We have opened the channel. I make an announcement on the general side, like papers for the opportunity if you're interested in contributing to an opinion piece on data challenges for single cell class. I won't put everyone into that channel, but it's an open channel, so you can search on the channel and add. Search on the channel and add yourself to it. And I will post all that discussion we have at the end of yesterday onto that. And feel free to add your opinion to that channel. So you won't be forced to add to the channel. And any channel that you will add to, you want to be feel free. Most channels are open. Every channel are open in this, so you can join and leave as you wish. That's it from the organizer. That's it from the organizers. So, thank you, everyone. I think we should give a big shout out to Jean, who really pioneered and really get the whole thing started and getting this to happen. This is not easy because we actually started in 2019, but at that time, we didn't do 2020 because of the pandemic. We couldn't do it again. I think we should thank Jean for this ticket. Thank you, Jane, Runyu, and Joshua, and really miss you.   And then you find a network graph. But you're talking more about the big ones. So you find out that you have to buy transfer of the other. But as your number of transfers constants, but you could actually add like round and the whole species. Like a field, like I really want to have more sequence space. They are doing hard. You do impact, I think. But you have problems, right? So like you learn the right parts. learn the right concepts you could but you know this you can learn like how how many units like how many observes so the tool that we were using for now sorry not building our page Based on the sequence models of a line, of course, these kinds of land appears different based on the similarity. I don't understand that's what you can learn to. Right, but I bet you can learn the speech. Right, gotcha, yeah, but then I don't know. I mean, I feel like there should be more. Marty just or I want there. I want there to be more cool. Well, how cheaper is it's Marty? Okay. Yeah, yeah, I can look at sheets that we saw. I don't think the robot I need. I'm pretty much robot, I don't know. I won't carry on. I won't strip us. But that's what is something very interesting. Joshua, do you really target?  Sorry, I have to watch you get sound system to scribble. Scribbled. No.  Just no pad here. You have to look at a second part. Let's watch the video again. Let's watch the video again. All right, I'll just post it in random. Yeah, yeah. Well, yeah, they're gonna be the. How they do the yeah I would be surprised about that story Okay, so we're just gonna share this I don't know. Part of those things I argue. And the heart gosh, we were talking, they have to help me find a way to use one easily. Oh, gosh, you guys have to be there earlier than me. I'm not so set at this. I'm not so seven area.  Oh, so my youngest friend, which is how you can do it. One of my brothers tried hot meeting. That's how I use it. My brother with a lot of birds. We're looking for some of the courage. If you see anyone who's looking for disrespect, that's. I think more or less. Oh, I'll do it. Yeah, it's just yeah, so that it looks like this is just my body. So have you already got to talk? Oh no, I think I was my filter. So I was suddenly. So it was only three hours three hours. But you're all called hours. And then how can you? And then I fly how brief I've been full attention. Wow. Usually it makes each of the lines shorter and more for apart. That's worse. I left plenty of time, but I love the large okay. So, but the funnel and mountain was short periods. Yeah, otherwise. That's terrible. Oh, there are these time. Okay. How long did that take? Damn, but I think there's something in a meeting. It could be practical. Well, that hard must be told. Right. So, and you know, chat market. Yeah, actually, so where do you catch the bus to the bottom of the line town? There's a fridge. Yeah, so there's three bridges on the one and then six cars at the moment. 30 33 per hour. That's cheap. Sorry, it's probably like hanging out there and doing wow. Now I feel I have to go everything now because she becomes accessible. Yeah, I just talked somewhere. I don't believe that's what I'm saying. 12:30 lunch. Okay. Okay, be encouraged, be incredible. Yeah, we'll take that argument. I don't think I can get various. I had to decide small small disease. So, but it's not going to happen. Yeah, we're going to make some change. Love me more about here. I checked out in our practice. No, they didn't speak.  I just see it from the image, that's what you asked. Well, now I'm thinking maybe I'll just bike. Maybe I can bike somewhere. Could you? Could you buy it? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, I was not on the dollar stuff. Yeah, oh here's one point. No, no, no. In town, on like the main street, down to our next middle of the street, it's the patch that's on the bike and solid. They'll probably be able to get a lot. Thank you for having me.  Or February is like all parties. A larger framework. All right, see you guys. Oh, there's something up here. Yeah. Salton might be small for training lecture. I think the patient data is also typical. It's patient-sensitive, right? So sites should actually come should be a collaborative. I know if you want to check that and go off, I was trying to do one line checking. Yeah, because it's 20 years ago that, yeah, I was like, yeah. At the end of the day, that's what it's not about chicken, that you know people have been. You need somebody on the different side or your bugs. Yes, and then we're going to be here. We get more of the details from. I'm waiting for you to get sponsorship from. This is what I'm trying to timerize. What I'm trying to time arise. Oh, we can manage to talk to him, but I'm talking to my pen, possibly. So, Kenny is willing to sponsor a speaker. He's got it on board. In fact, this is quite easy to put. So, what do you just do with this sponsorship session? Because what I realised is that's actually easier if the registration can pay for food for the registration. For the registration, we have decision. All we need is money for invited speakers to speak and his name, right? So they can be for it. They're just contributing. And I mean, operationally that budget is very easy about it. So everyone treats it the way they want to treat it and to use this constant. That's easy actually. Invite me? Of course. Well, I hope they did it 24H. H24H is inviting me. Sincerely invited me to Hong Kong. I think it's important. But do we in a position now to at least advertise, go to get the website up? I think we are almost done. Almost done. We're looking at local. So, yeah, someone is trying to see if we can it's going to be a little bit complex, right? You want three local like Bio Sea Asia and then Hong Kong. What are you going to call Hong Kong information? Yeah, Hong Kong Biois in Chinese Medicine, and then you have two speakers. Well, I don't mind just having one. Well, I don't mind just having one making sure. I would notice really emphasizes, at least for this year. So, why do you want bio C and then put HK on the heat? Like that, so you can say Melbourne. Hong Kong, really, but it's not such a small Melbourne, make a big Hong Kong, and then that really highlights. Better down the bottom, you can really have like ICAR. Have like ICR might have group for Hong Kong. Oh, like small thing down. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. So, yeah, I think here every last Asian to a keypoint or Hong Baton basically. I'll see if they can do that. Great, we better. My flight is quite late, is that. Oh, we got a sort of a restaurant. Very important. Then we can, you know, rest here if you want to, and then we can check it to I have this one. Yeah, so I was going to try to. So I was going to try to make it like I stay up late, I'm more likely to sleep. I'm playing here. It's like I've got just gonna be really tired, like very early. That's like I'm on Keep Judy like moment through the house. So I've just gotta stay in bedtime. Like 10 months, three and six. Ten months old now is house renovations. I feel really sorry for being living this in my college. Next up, I have to actually learn about a slide and then we'll work in the long speaking. We're fortunate. And K function. So, what is the true value of K that is very strong estimate? Because everything is nice. Okay. If I said select that turn on the eyeway spices the movie. Probably only spikes in the movie symbols, but spikes just finally, I guess. Yeah, that's like if you were to draw like a square anywhere on the page. But this thing would be plus solar, you assume that. Myself would be more opportunity anywhere. That's quite the other. You've got to teach first. Does it also assume that cells can be quite additional? It is possible. So, what is that? Sort of like property distribution points, right? Is that the same thing here? Exactly the same point. But it can still be quite small. Okay, so then if you want to make it more realistic, can you add millers to the minimum distance? I don't think it's I don't think that's. I don't think that's a huge problem. Not with like reasonably large stuff. I thought it was all the sample. The main thing, like people are not buying a button, I've started doing that for a long time. So right still kind of controls the class. But is there a Okay, but is there still reasonable normal you don't need to start doing these life with it got an expectation where you know where the x expectations are new values But even that's not that right. Boom, that's not that one. We're not going to stick here. So we like to use the things for inference boss patients. So in that sense, point guests are theory. So in some sense, you only need a patient. Some people might forget about just one thing. That's the thing. I'm just doing it. I just think I think it's fine. Otherwise, you have to do something. Once actually people and let's have it behind the corner. Some of the people some of the people you do do have been much easier to get the functional skills and stuff. All they most people will do is. So it's what I mean in summarize what probably is like permutation gets a bit slow when you're doing it slowly but I think depending on what you can do so one thing is like you just carry on like you can use whatever someone I can use whatever some distribution is choosing. But I imagine that's without some of the words. That's the big question because I worry at the big market by one more student's goods. So they are going to start making pages. I'll be going over for lunch 12 code. Oh yeah. Is that the planetic or like the lunch 12 code? Okay, well something The next point will be probably further away, but that would make a little sense. That's when you push this up. So I'm working for the process of the same. And I think possibly. I think it's coming too close to the wall probably to scratch the surface. All of it's been translational. I've got a piece of. Translational. I'm a big fan of just like I am a fan of most things you can really just do, like the t-test. Logics normally come up with summary statistic, but I think there's a ton of room for things like that. Like, once you start looking at these high-dimensional relationships, I don't know, if you have some sort of virus, you want to see a relationship. Virus in T cells and B cells. Those are kind of things that just do this for you. Okay, that's the spice wingers. Plus, we had to have just some tea test compared to people. Oh, that's one line of yours. I have a channel quite hell. I'm flying through factory. So So you're kind of thankful and vanquished. That's still better than Vancouver's soul. Are you getting that? Because so we bought the flu and we bought the flight together with the transfer. I missed my first blind. You know, original and emailed, but this one is my further. I mean, I guess you should so you have to develop or you at least have five. I guess it's a little faster. Oh, wait, maybe that'll make any quotes. Again, I just heard that from the Scott buttons process in the very end. This is the very end. Okay. Oh, you missed one, speaker? Yeah, the very end I was asking for. Emailed us by saying he had difficulty with exercise. And sorry. Wow. Oh dear. So I think that actually that's the same lesson we could learn next time too. It just doesn't work for them. Oh, I think it's far well. Oh, I think it's far well. I have been told by Charlotte that for the mainland PE is somehow. So it looks like the other is to use the facing for Vroom. Vroom does definitely work for Christmas. There's an overseas version of it. So there's a mainland version of this one can't I use this for much STMA or if that was the afternoon that is a big challenge we are we are actually organizing a Yeah, we have time allowed some literature. Maybe actually there's a lot of freedom to decide what we want to do. We can round it up. I just showed the data everything, but I need someone to help me. That's also on each of these online. Yeah, all of this is separate size. This is part of recognition, actually. So, I mean, good enough to say goodbye. I mean, they should, because the power is completely fun. Actually, they just want to try it, don't they? I think both of them have shots in the name, so you can't be native for the last few years. It's been really the market. Australia has exist. And except for the year when it's virtual. I think in the US we see all this especially with the explicit aim of getting turned into the US. We could, I mean, legitimately could, right? That's very reasonable for us. Yes, maybe not every session, yes, and maybe not the key points. But I don't see mine. I mean, depending on one e-trip for conductor, apply to the one cluster to the portion of two margins. You don't RNC is too how long is this complex? Three days. Well, we'll say the range of three days. Guess why don't we tell you about this advanced version? The RNC workshop itself is the testing. I think we should try getting to the status. I think that's what it's going to and I think that's argument that I wanted to suggest well maybe. Like to suggest, well, maybe this can be sorry, so in addition to using again, and we are doing that for free basically, so it doesn't cost you. Uh he could yeah, you very much said what is career sounds good what is kid written for uh when uh somehow has a celebration that's okay that's again that's not too we in this I mean, even the stuff that Apple Dash goes, I mean, it's fancy because it takes me almost a microphone. But you see, those are bad things that cost more. But depends on how we really do this. If we do it very down to earth, we order our own pizza and it's it's just a bit cost, right? We can just do it with deliverable with uh one of those uh services, I guess. Services, I guess. Okay, we have to do a lot of actually putting things off there, filing up very surveillance, up very soon. But we can do that. So it's really the service. So again, we need the service in this case. So it's just a service then we need to focus on doing money. I don't think anybody. I don't think anyone just use it. No, we think the helpers will be on the same health care instead. Maybe the oil and then we give them a nice certificate so they feel that, oh, right, that's international meetings, which it is because it says. Yeah, I don't think it was but to be fair because we go for a good trip. Yeah, last thing we went to have remembered with the formal science department. So we were stuffed last few years but sort of semester presented. We're going to go into a food trip. Maybe it is, yeah, it's not a food trip, it is this experience from that contact, yes, going to be financial property that is. I couldn't I couldn't read one soldiers. And actually, I think you should use the microphone. So I'm just going to basically get that. Yes. Logistics or contacts. I mean, those are a chance to get track of things. And I think I'm good with the question. I think we should have. Do you add those to like your opportunities? What are you that you got? What are you? Anyone else have this community? Not really. I mean, I mean, no. So you see, even if this one is holding a killer, you only need to watch this again because it's. Oh 80 members, so they've got like 32. It's not a close close group. This is not a close group. So anyone could have they just So that we could say just something everyone could see this. I think we should also acting other faculty. I just think about large because it looks like. Because in spending our day four, it will be answered. Four affinities. So for biofuels, let's say it would be a strict effect in the four parameters. How many scurious microphones typical of our I think it's got two months around maybe two. Okay. What about Clara and those people? Yeah. Okay, so maybe the first one might be Clara. Yeah, I'm going to remember. The problem is that we are still. Taking the BMS students, chemistry students, or well, I mean, we could have choice. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I'm seeing that maybe that's a very short discussion now or just If we essentially each other year-off, but not only that, we still have academic advice. Because economic advice, this year we have each have like two. But next year, in addition to the one we have, we have another two each year and then. To look each year and accumulate, yeah. I don't know anything about it. If they come up interested, I want to talk to this. Yeah, there's an ongoing post from under the scope by medical sciences for a tenure track assistant with a star and they always have that has been there for years and years. It's an ongoing participant for the School of Biomedical Sciences. It reads like that, but so I'm actually. If everything else kind of like kids of biology and gross lights, but algorithmic has always been there is one teaching pretty expensive, but I don't know. I'm not yet an inclination to feel somewhat strong. Other lessons. Yes, that's what happens. Yes, any of these comments. Now I'm trying to hold pictures.  That's actually the norm basically. Um I mean I I think it might have been sent out find it like once and it was like there was no that one TV screen. The platform I have the use there. Regardless of the cost of                                         I don't pull out. If it's closed, can you go to sleep? It's like if she'd got her job, like you can start doing that kind of stuff. Like, I really think I really started another job, I really want to get ready. So my other job, I really want to get ready for the bottle. I mean, to be fair, like about saying, like, oh, you're so, can you recommend literature? Or like, course, yeah, sure, off you go. That was just one email. It doesn't take email four or five. Account 405 Twitter emailing Amber. Yeah, about that. Amber would be great. I received that workshop that you use in person but only communicating with people. This is part of the. This is kind of beyond, it's beyond copy. And then it's also beyond like neurodiverse, kind of like, like it is moving into no understand. Yeah, yeah. Next stage, she might actually be a real like she might be really supportive. I can really spoil it. I think it's quite good for really, really high backing shoot. Like, they can be a massive network of use. I think you interrupt the boots. It sounds like. It sounds like probably not going to have explained. What do they keep voting for labor? What's the word they keep using? I don't think she's going to be the more like I think you need to.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    So we're going to go to the colour finally covering.         I have to wait to. Yeah, I mean, there are some people there. Yeah, and I also went down. There's people presenting. There's also people up. Okay, sorry, just waiting as well. Yeah, just relax. Yeah, because at least from Maxwell, first floor. First of all, first of all, okay, and how to share this to you. Somebody's coming. I was alerted to the door because somebody's coming from the air. The people in the person in the basement. They are in the office, so I cannot ask things. I will check the interesting. No, no, it's good. The very bottom-up in place.   The end, how many months? Nine months. So, how do you eat that? How do you eat your finished? How do you eat yourself? Also, we need to sometimes like, yeah, you put the most cheap food, and then sometimes you have more. And then sometimes you have a cereal bar with chocolate and public energy stream system. They are the ones who want that in the question. Hard to say because they win some. Say because they yeah, they win some places, or they are losing other places. So it's like 50-50, it's not never gonna be like losing until the end. Yeah, because like for example, for the Russian side, they don't have more, they don't have the best equipment, or there are a lot of numbers, so there's a lot of yeah they have people still working. People still work and the Ukraine army, yeah, they have a lot of work in some new weapons, but they don't have all the ammunition to use it, and also they don't have all the people to use that weapons. You are able to say yeah, you're also. It's kind of funny because Miami we use the Galile, or is it called Galile? Yeah, yeah, we have that one. So then you know the weapon system is the same as. system is the same as the AK. So when I was writing over there, AK was very easy to use for you because I know kind of like Toshi a little bit. This is Albert and Armor again. So for the Americans, they don't know about it, but they try like them 4 and 60. There are 15, you know, more. Yeah, that's cool that. More, yeah, that's cool than weapons, but the thing is, they come more delicate, so they people like, oh, this is a fucking mental ship. You can kick it as it's tissue, you can shoot it in fucking mold, you can shoot it in the water. This is fucking awesome. So don't be kind with that. Because also they learn like a sometimes you remember like you broke it and put it back. Like you drop it and put it back there can just a bit there. So yeah, both let it go because if you go with the we have two kind of problems with that one. One is interesting from the last slide. Oh, surrounded. He's talking in Japan, Prostitutes. Oh, yeah. But now they are still in the so So yes square rod that they have but sometimes they use in the UCL easily so now the thing that coming that going to Russia was being I don't know what is the place there's thing over there. Well, not now really. Like a roads, like air. Like the rods, like rose, for example, like the ballads, they have to use the main are so heavy, so they can they go because of that it was kind of easy to tackle some in some way the rush and because they have to use the old hardware. I wouldn't know. No. And the workdrop, the leader of workdrop is already like, ah, yeah, so one million dollars. I hear that he's supposed to be having very positive. I would like that happen before my friend. Oh, yeah, one of your friends. Yeah. I don't know. So, what is the uh if you die there or not? Yeah, you're right. Yeah, it's like. Yeah, it's like 3,000. How much was 3,000? I remember it wasn't payment, so it's different money. Yes, they give you like around $40,000, $3,000. To the fun yeah and they create a part of the yeah so some way somehow it's not that bad but you know yeah Somebody is still by actually. I was thinking about friend. That's the thing. Yeah, it's more easy. I go there because we don't think more is eat, shed, sleep, and stay alive. What is the more style? Yeah, for me, being there, actually two snipers should have been. Yeah, there's like a little lecture. Yeah, yeah. But the next thing I would not, because before the next video, you can see what the children tell you. Fossil flash may keep the position, so they should kill everyone more in the night before they use drones. Yes, their teeth is kind of the most dangerous, but for me, even there, I was more scared of the grenade venture system. Like it's like grenade venture, so like what it is like, ooh, so I think it's you hear it one, it should go up here one. You know, I hear one, you hear on the line, or something. So like you hear it, it sounds like a NK, so it's like a different one. Yeah, but the tuna for example, you hear the even with a water also makes a sound nice. Yeah, everything makes a sound. I shouldn't make a sound. So you can shoot it and then you won't just run it. So yeah, I remember one of the whole states on side that removed was yeah I cannot please so it's just good things in the in the in the top I would have the floor and then I went on the floor and then I start shooting and like came back position like over there, five minutes over there, five minutes over there. And I was like, okay, oh, is it Mount Finn or something? I lay a cigar and it's like, yeah, just like, no, maybe finish. And then I check every all my men's are good. I don't know if they're good. So yeah, look at it. I was kind of outside. You know, like when you're not losing anybody, it's fine. You lose somebody, it's nobody. Yeah, but still, there's a lot of bloggers that yeah, well, at least for America, I'd say. Answer to say, or you really have probably a bit 60% of the people who have life problems or life or money problems. So if you could have unit only Unit only the master listing, or just yeah, they put well at least in the machine over there. Now there were like two or three are evil. So these two, they you have a contract for three years and the contract you can break it. The country you can break in anytime you want, but the running awards is like a lot of people come in, sign a contract, they say like two weeks, they left, like they go back in another month, another two weeks they left. So the guy said, if you're not gonna stay at least three months and go away, you're gonna lose money. Don't reply to Spanish. I wonder the image Ah no, he he would uh he stick around like. He's been around like three months under this. The most cannons that they have one of them goes from colours. The two last can I think that I have learned how machines are. I have learned how much money is a mandatory A four of us will undergo from high school to valleys. High school, you will undergo from your subject. And when you graduate in high school, and you go to college four years, plus two years. But even the number just more on the interest we have really spread four years four years course. Three or four years training, whatever you need to smoke, you know, party, maybe select this, like a house pool, and then you're police, they have police with their own Italian academy for police. Now, first, if I want to go like no mandatory, yeah, look at when what the when you see after and when also when something there is a problem. Something there's a lot of people going to volunteer, they call. And you can decide in the first case, like if you want to before solution. Oh, yeah, I've got a coffee set. Yeah. All right. Yeah, it's kind of the same. You have to scroll all the screen processes.  I think the like. The common brother is part of that is just I'll say how many counter you have. Yeah, I would call it most of Yeah, I'm the example, it's an example. I was there, not happening, I was very interested. I am another one, another one looks like. Speak and now we don't have this yeah, if when is your title? I have a problem with my screen, which is that mostly good version. Yeah, it's like I was talking actually with one of my friends that Kyle, what was his name? Medic, and we're talking about that, the thing in PTSD and problem with that. And they say, you don't have that because probably you have a like very traumatic life. It's like, oh, thanks. Thanks, they all have a very traumatic life. So this is my thanks. This is not everything. Yeah, it's kind of the because you have a car life. You can just drop motion. So when you are in this kind of situation, you're good affect the. Affect them particularly because you are children, but kind of but there are some people they have leaders they do all sweet in school with friends like having they have no problems they have probably had is like finished our relationship or their parents then they go on fucking war then explosion everybody screaming Yes, think of all of them reading. But there is another thing else like sorry, as to not revalues like that. As no values like that, still that people have like normal life and they go over there and have surprising because sometimes more like also the one of the things we have here is the mathematical. Nothing simply. John Muhita but the first one do you have fun? He has only three daughters and he has two sons. So all his daughters become really daddy. And they fight for and my friends keep on encouraging his ladies to talk. And I don't use okay people who identify like this doing potato. I don't know, they said they want you to know the beautiful part.    It's nice. Oh, I'm so excited to see the colours.   This might be fixed. It's already talked about in the be We have also thanks from the communities we have also and the sounds of the Yeah, so the I will say it's from the mother.   Yeah, we just have some progress with the colours. That kind of things. Now it's kind of worked up a little bit before there was. Grew it up a little bit before it was like just a little now. It's like come up of the region in the south. Also, we have a social riot who was working in the army. The jaccoon with the guns. No, not initially. Yeah, initially I lost a lot. Well, I'm not saying I lost, but I lost communication with a lot of friends because hey, you know me. The uniform is just a war, it's not what you are. Just a work, it's not what you are calling it. I mean, I'm not quite seeing Lana's side, but we'll see what's quite quite interesting. Oh, French, those are kind of a little bit of a fire. French opinions. I saw a few of them. French have a lot of problems, like how about social writer.         Uh UI was called Star Wars Town Tripper or Star Tripper with the one that                                                                                                                    Okay.
