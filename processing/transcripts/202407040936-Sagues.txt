Well, I will acknowledge the collaborators. Actually, what I will be presenting here is essentially the PHP work of Nina-Nelet, which is the friend meaning MAs, so close. Also, obviously, the combination of Jordan Estranthal, who has been with me for the last 25 years, maybe. Good luck. And Paul de Man, who I Who also always provides a nice ideas directory. Paul was the one who bravely started with these algorithmatics back in our group more than 10 years ago. And also I will mention some collaboration with numerics, numerical people, people doing numerical simulations. What I will be presenting here essentially is experimental things, but also some numerical stuff, and this is done by So stand by the groups of Marine Minister, Copenhagen, and Topico Cuel Missouri. Okay, so this is the line of my talk. The first part is a kind of introduction, but since already we have had some presentations on anti-formatic, I think I can largely skip this part. And then I will go to these two different Two different, let's say, sections, which both correspond, and this is important, both correspond to different formulations from the usual active mnemonic that was proposed by Toshi 10 minutes ago. And they correspond to different actually the both have some similarities. For example, both are controlled by light somehow, so light plays an important role. Like plays an important role, and both somehow also respond to our goal. And our goal was a little bit simply announced, is to try to control the flows. You have seen the flows of ideologies are. The idea is that when you see these flows, you see, oh, they are wonderful. But somehow, it's a pity because they seem to be useless. So the idea will be to try to harness this activity. To try to harness this activity for something. And this is the idea in both projects. But it turns out that in the second project, it's much more richer and actually provide us with a lot of possibilities to do things and to get some new information. So I will be very brief here and I will be a little bit more, I will extend a little bit more presentation in the second part. By the way, if someone is interested in these activism activism, That in these active magnetics and active colloidal active map activities. Okay, so introduction to the system is not necessary, except that since we will change a little bit the formulation, I just remember you. We will be referring to a microtubal kinester system. And essentially, the idea is you have microtubles which are more or less fixed on. Which more or less fits the length, 1.5 microns, more or less. Then you use motors, and these motors, you prepare dimers in the usual standard formulation. You prepare dimers of this pymosin by means of something that is called spectability. And now you bundle these microlubles with the pretty nation, and that's it. You have a gel. You have a gel. Now, this gel is further, and this is the gel, by the way, observed by Forens and Microscopy. This is prepared in 3D, in 3D, in a bulk, in an aqueous bulk phase. And then you degrade this to an interface. And when you do that, you prepare the usual alcohol, okay, which is Okay, which is shelter. By the way, I know that this may be a little bit far away from your expertise, so don't hesitate to ask me questions. I have the presentation is short, really. So we have time for questions. Okay, don't hesitate. I will try to be as much pedagogic as possible, but still, if you have questions, go ahead. Okay, no problem. No problem. Okay, so this is the acti-thematic, the usual actic. I just want to call your attention to the fact that, in despite of being quite turbulent, normal preparations, there is some length scale. Jordi mentioned that yesterday. This length scale, which is called active length scale, somehow measures, for example, the distance between effects, the typical work that size. The size. So many things that have to do with the scale, the length scale of the system, get somehow encoded by this active length scale. And this active length scale essentially is a measure of the ratio of the elasticity of the material and the activity of the material. The ratio of these two parameters, the square root to be precise, gives you an idea of the coherence of this active length. coherentness of this active lamp. Okay, good. So, first context, photosensitive active nomadic. The idea is the following. In the normal system, you cluster the kinescence and you make beamers of these kinescents, and this is the way you induce internal shear into room. Shear into your microglucula. Now, we changed the normal kinesins by two different kinds of kinesins, microkinesin and irid kinesin. Now, the funny thing is now you varize these two guys with light, with blue light. I have to make a comment here, which is important. is important. This is the way to control the dimerization of these students. But, and this is a big bad, these guys by themselves, they form homodimers. So you cannot avoid the formation of dimers of this microkinescent and dimers of this irid kinesin. And this means, as you can understand it easily, that even in absence of light, you will have motion. You will have motion. So, the system is not a perfect on-off system, but it's something, it's a system that permits you to increase at will activity. And this is what happened. So, this is the first my video. There are many videos here. So, here we illuminate half of the source point. Of the source point. As you can see, the increase of activity is very apparent. And then later you decide you eliminate everything. Now, we have to characterize the system. For example, here, we characterize the on-off, I mean the excitation, de-excitation of the system, and it turns out that it's not. And it turns out that it's not perfectly symmetric, so it gets excited in interval of less than one minute, more or less. But the excitation takes longer, of the order of a couple of minutes, something like that, or even more. Now, this is the first thing. By the way, this measure is a measure of the mean vorticity. It turns out that to analyze a system in terms of vorticity, system in terms of vorticities is better because in terms of velocities, the velocity shows a large fluctuation. So we decided to capture the activity of the system in terms of the vorticity, the mean vorticity. Actually, the mean vorticity gives you a time scale in the system. So it's measured in second number of time. So here it's a plot of this vorticity with versus time. With versus time, as in shipping degrees. Here, for example, is something that we can imagine. When you illuminate half of the system, the boundary is not sharp. But this is a moving system, I think. And you see that the boundary is quite diffuse, and you can understand it. I mean, it's simply this length scale is typically the product of the velocity of the flow and the excidation time, and this is practical. In time, and this is practical what we see. Now, this is another interesting thing, and it corresponds to the question of how large must be the minimum motive to excite the system. And it turns out that the minimum square motive illuminated to enhance the activity is of the order of 300 microns. And I want to say something here. Say something here. This hand microns is off the order, maybe a little bit classier, that this active letter scale. Okay, so to really get the system enhanced, you need to go a little bit above these minimal confidence lengths of the system. Okay, this is also interesting because as you can imagine, we can pattern numbers, especially and temp. Specially and temporally, you can patent activity. And here's an interesting setup. So you compare here a case of medium illumination, a little bit illumination, this gray, with these different patterns in such a way that the four patterns have the same average value of the vorticity. Of the vorticity when you consider the extended system. Okay, so you consider an extended system and you calibrate the intensity of light and the vorticity and invorticity. And then you take this calibration curve to prepare these four different polarizations with the same average observation. And what you see is very funny, you see that the mean morticity gets reduced when That's reduced when you button. So the system doesn't like to have this illumination button. It prefers to have the word illumination and not to distribute it. So somehow this tells us that maybe the system needs some sort of coherence and when you perturb your system at a smaller length scale, the system doesn't like it. The system doesn't like that. Okay, this is nice. Let's go further. So, the next is to try to do the same with a confinement. Why confinement? Well, yesterday we had a talk by there where he mentioned these confinement threats. And it's true that under confinement, the sort of textures and flows change dramatically. And flows change dramatically. For example, when you confine, when you put this active system in the channel, inside the channel, and you make the channel thin, that is narrow, then you can go from the turbulent behavior to some form of directed flow. So we said, well, since this depends, this kind of behavior depends on the balance between the Between the width of the channel and the active length of scale, and the active length of scale detention activity, and activity now is tuned with the light, so we decided to look at the same effect when you illuminate active fluids within a channel. And actually, here the result is that you enhance velocity, but nothing else. But nothing else. You don't change the regime. I mean, it's a kind of somehow between triple and undirected flow. Maybe you have realized that. Okay, you speed up, but nothing else. So it's a little bit frustrating. At that point, the project was a little bit frustrating. Actually, we didn't find nothing special here, no signature of either the stabilization into tool and behavior or change of colours, nothing. I mean, it's a little bit. Nothing. I mean, it's a little big. But, and this is a big back. There is something else here. If you remember the talk by Jordan yesterday, he mentioned a situation of aligned flows. And these aligned flows, for example, a way that we obtain them is just by interfacing the active pneumatic, not with a normal oil, but with a smet crystal, an oriental cosmetic crystal. Now, if you remember, Now, if you remember from this thought, the nice thing, the nice feature of these scenarios that the flows get the line equipes. And there is a wavelength. And this wavelength, I don't even know how Javi mentioned that, but this wavelength depends on the scales. Again, so one could think that by illuminating the system, maybe you will change the width of the system. You will change the width of, I mean, the wavelength of this straight button. Okay, let's do it. And we did it actually in a way, for example, as you see here, that we illuminate half of the system. For example, here we will illuminate the top and he will illuminate the right half, trying to see if this creates some sort of frustration in the system. No, because you say, okay, this part. because you say, okay, this part here, the sprites will be thinner, so there will be some conflict here. Or here the same, I mean here that the sprites will be thinner, and what will happen? New strikes will be created there, what will happen? And actually, nothing happened. So I don't show videos, so nothing important happened here. But there is an important fact here. An important fact here, and it's the following. When you work with a very small activity, this alignment effect is very hard to see. I mean, it's difficult to see these aligned flows. These aligned flows appear when you have some sort of activity, some level of activity. So, we decided to test that just by eliminating half of the system, in this case by right half, and you really see. And you really see here in terms of vorticities or velocities, that is true. I mean, in the left, practically this alignment is very, you know, it's very faint. But in the illuminated vision, when you activate the system with light, then they get much more aligned. So, okay, with this, I conclude this part. So, the conclusion is the multiplicable Kinesian active kinematic system at me. Active phonematic system admits when you formulate it the system in a slightly different way, they admit very simple strategies of special temporal control of ejectivity and you can think of many many different scenarios now with this. And also the role of active land escape somehow shows up here in a very different way, not only controlling, for example, the typical vortex signs or the typical disconflict defects or whatever, but Dipping these from flipping defects or whatever, but controlling somehow the range where this effect can be more visible, more intense. Okay, and now I go to the second part, which is a little bit more elaborated. Here I use another version, which corresponds to the following. We mix the normal logic, let's say, system, with monoliths. monomers and and these monomers are able to be polymerized with light with UV light okay this is the idea you mix both the normal system more the normal micro tub cognition and everything and some monomers and then you polymerize the monomers with a brand this is the kind of system we use in that case the system is upside down so the active Is upside down, so the active layer is, let's say, in a flow cell, the active layer in the bottom, and you illuminate with UE. Now, I will present two scenarios. The first correspond to an extended illumination. So, you illuminate all the field people. The second one will be just illuminating motives. Now, in the first case, what happens is really What happens is really very dramatic, and I will show you the video and you will see what happens. This is a normal thing, and then you illuminate. This is what happened. So, that diplomatic has completely been dismantled. It's really funny. I mean, the first time we saw that, we said, what's going on here? I mean, so we have lost an extra. We have lost, and it's true, we have lost active pneumatic. Activist active pneumatic has been worked. I wouldn't dare to qualify it as an active animatic, but I prefer to qualify it as a kind of biphasic active tooling. Biphasic in the sense that you recognize two phases somehow, and in the microdool phase which is full of sense reliable, and you see that right, and then a lot. And then a lot of this dark region, the void of the microdoogle. So these are two phases to our understanding. It's active because it still moves, but you have a completely different thing. Now, we have studied the very, very in depth and we have seen in the video probably you didn't you didn't see much, but if you are interested we have much That we have massive years over and over and over, no problem. We have seen that this evolution corresponds to two phases, two stage evolution. In the first stage, for example, here we calculate the correlation length of the Q tensor. It is a kind of see how much this pneumatic coherence is preserved in length. Is preserved in length. And you see that it goes down, obviously, but in a very funny way. So it goes down first very, very dramatically, and then there is somehow an increase, a slight increase, and then back again. And to our understanding, these first states correspond to a cascade of folding, self-folding into itself, and then the second. And then the second phase corresponds to an elongation of these domains up to this occupied phasing point. And actually, here simulators were very much interested in that model. So they simulated that in terms of a modified vegetable model, active vegetables model. So they use a kind of phase. Use a kind of phase field model. So there is a phase variable coupled to the very set words. In a sense, it's a way to model a lyotropic active flow, because definitely we recognize here isotropic parts and nematic parts. And in doing that, they were really very smart and they were able to. And they were able to really show that you will see that that is pneumatic collapse and they get first this kind of cascades of self-folding. I will accelerate a little bit because otherwise it's oh, oh, okay. That's what I do. Well Well, it doesn't matter. I mean, it's essentially reproduced the experiments. Actually, here you see some snapshots. The first stages correspond to these. I just want to understand the simulation picture, the nice fine lines that so nicely resemble the. That so nicely resemble the experiments is: are they representing very fine density variations or are those streamlined in a directed field? As far as I understand, they correspond to the directed field. Okay, these are maybe. Yeah, it's a different measure, it's a different representation of the product. Okay. And was there a conserved total concentration field? With the, exactly. Exactly. Exactly. With the contribution of the concentration field. Exactly. Now, they propose new ingredients to be considered just to explain this kind of Just to explain this kind of evolution. And actually, they consider two effects here. First, friction, which obviously is there, because the idea we have is that when you illuminate the system, the atmosphere gets jellified somehow. So you get only a very thin layer of fluid in contact with the aqueous. Of fluid in contact with the active matter. So, actually, the idea we have is that the active matter now is evolving in contact with a kind of very rigid substrain. So, friction is quite unavoidable then. But the nice new ingredient that these guys propose is the use of a quadrupolar activity, which is something that's not in the normal models. In the normal models for this kind of extensive system, I didn't mention them. Extension system, I didn't mention, but this is a kind of extension system, a pusher in the language of swimmers. For this kind of system, the activity is typical. But these guys propose the use of a higher order in the extension of this activity, and they propose to use a quadrupolar activity. And this quadrupolar activity turns out to be important. This is the way you introduce a quadrupolar activity. You influence the buttonfall and heavy thing. So, this is the normal magnet stock, and this is the normal stress exon. Now, normally, this is the friction, and this is this quadruple activity, which comes into play in terms of the Q tensor, derivative of the Q tensor. This is a proposal of the theoreticians, and apparently, it works because first you consider First, you consider a band of this animatic as subject to a band stability. You contact with some neotropic isotropic phase. And you see, you expect for an extension of system to have this bent instability. Now, when you put friction, it's a kind of artificial way to see the role of these ingredients. You put first friction and then you prevent the ingredients. And then you prevent this sort of instability. Now, if you put only the quadrupolar activity without friction, you get this kind of folding, of kind of hierarchical folding into the span. And when you put friction on the polar, you have this kind of hierarchical buckling of the system that finally gets leads to this kind of very To this kind of very, let's say, disentangle, whatever, dismantle active memory. Okay, I will go a little bit further. I conclude here. The microtovokinesian system is dramatically affected by a substrate. Yesterday we heard that the active matic system is largely affected by the cryologic. Affected by the cryological buttoning the interface, for example, let me use a SNET, but it turns out that it's also very much affected by the soup spray with the water. The friction apparently screens the normal dipolar activity and induces a kind of trade-off with some quadrupolar effects. And friction was quadrupolar activity, at least from Proactivity, at least from a simulation point of view, this might not completely design. And then I go to the second and last part, which is creating modifies. So now we don't eliminate completely the system, we just pattern the information. And you can do a lot of things. First, you can create objects, columnar objects. Column nerve objects, so they go up from there. Remember, below is the active layer, on top is the bounded plate, so that is a column with different possibilities. For example, non-rigid boundaries. There, you can create rigid boundaries that depends on essentially the time of illumination, the Illumination, the strength of the power of illumination, and the footprint of the lumination. And then you can get a lot of possibilities. You can combine Brigitte with multi-off inclusions and you can study, for example, how the active members behave when they are confined, when they are unconfined, and obviously you can take whatever kind of confinement you want. Of confined if you want. You can prepare kind of mesh. You can direct your active flow wherever you want. You can slightly change and you can create a system of triangles. And with system of triangles, I think you recognize that you are directing the flow. The flow. So these flows show some kind of self-bumping, just rectifying the flow. It's a little bit like Claire showed yesterday with the ratchet, but feeling a little bit, maybe we'll skip that way. I will not have time to go into this particular case, but here again we have the collaboration of some simulations and the simulations also And the simulations also, these are results of simulation, these are experiments. And you see that this kind of vector flows come from a very nice organization of the vortices. So apparently, these triangles organise this pair of vortices, and this pair of vortices is what organized the and direct the flows, fill the flows. Direct the flows, fill the flows. And it's very nice. You can study, for example, different outputs, I mean, even efficiency or reviation in terms of the size of the motif that we prepare. And actually, natural pricing, the best motif here, this length, corresponds essentially to the active length scale. So again, you really can. You really control the best rectification when you choose your length scale of your inclusions somehow to be congruent with active length scale, which makes sense. Okay, here it's many, many different things. Also, something that is not here, but I would like to comment to you because it's nice. We have also computed, well, in simulations, the simulation you can compute the p-lap. Can compute the buildup of a pressure. So these active flows get pressurized along the circulation, let's say, along the flows. And this is nice because this is completely contrary to normally drows. In normal dramatics, if you want to have a flow this way, you have to put the higher pressure here. But in our case, it's just the contrary. That lower pressures here and that higher pressures here. And this means that there is something special in these active pumps. It's not a normal drow lips here. It's a different neural lips. Anyway, I don't have time to go into that. I prefer to go to the I prefer to go to the final scenario. And the final decision I would make, I stop because I want to make a very important remark. Acinematics is a sexy. It's a sexy field. Maybe not in this audience, but it's a sexy field. You can be sure about that. And there are many theoreticians both on Microsoft. And they use very nice models. Very nice models, especially variants of the change headworks, putting some active stress. But then I will also mention that in these models, there are a lot of phenomenological parameters and the efficiency and simulators and experimentalists. We do not know nothing, nothing about. nothing about these processes. So you can find hundreds of papers. So up to you last week I was looking at the prepping in Archives saying that in the last 10 years they have appeared more than 150 radius of active pneumatics. You can imagine 150 radius. Readiness. So you can imagine the amount of papers devoted to anti-ematics. And most of them, they have many. And most of them, they use parameters that nobody knew nothing about. Neither the order of magnitude. So we decided to struggle and start. We decided to have numbers put in. Have numbers put in our coefficients, put in our alphas, in our kabbas, in our days, in our dumbas. And we fetch it. The way we did is the following. We put some pillars, just single pillars in our lab of the market, and we decided to look And we decided to look at deflection, just the deflection of these pillars with our active moment. It's very simple, extremely simple. And this is what you get. You have your pillars, you have your perform pillars, and then you prescribe some very simple equations. equations, just a balance of the deflection of this pillar versus the forces acting on these pillars. And the forces, to a good approximation, correspond to a viscous part and an active part. We forget a little bit about the last difference, which is probably quite reasonable in most of the cases. And when you do that, you get up. You finally get up with something. We finally get up with some equations. I don't want to go into depth. Maybe in this case would be a triviate to go into the details. But anyway, I just explained. This is the deflection force, which comes from engineers in terms of the young models, the length of your pillar, the radius of your pillar, whatever. This is the active force, and in the active force loop, it appears. Look, it appears alpha, the famous alpha parameter, which is the parameter that enters into the Peris-Edwards model for the active kinematic. Okay, and this is the part of the viscous form. The viscous form is a little bit funny because first we wanted to get it from the measure, from the direct measure of the strain-drag tensor, but it's very complicated to do an experiment, so we resort to time. We resort to kind of Lance equation, which is a variant of the stock's track equation, let's say, and you get the value for that. So then you get expression for data force in terms of alpha and expression for the viscous force in terms of theta, which is the viscosity. Not even the viscosity of this material was never calculated. Never. Okay, with that. Okay, with that, please. Are you assuming any flow boundary conditions at the surface of the pillar? Zero. No sweep? No sweep. It's exactly time number starts. Start track. Yes. More questions, please. Okay, and this is the figure we are more proud of. This is the figure giving alpha. Alpha has units in 2D, in 2D, has units of Pascal meta. Normally in 3D will be Pascals. In 2D has additional meta. So these are measures of alpha in blue and these are measures of These are measures of viscosity, pastal second measure. And this is plotted, these results are plotted against the speed of target light. So now you have orders of magnitude. Orders of magnitude of both alpha and eta. And by the way, it's nice to see that alpha changed. That alpha changes not very much, but the viscosity reduces with the speed. So it's some kind of shear thinning effect here. This is fine. Now, this is another prediction that was tested in our experiment, well, in our measures actually. Alpha versus eta, if you look at the dimensions, gives you a kind of time scale, segment minus one. And what's predicted. one and was predicted and the theory by Johnny and other people that this time scale or this rich ratio by the way should go proportional to the border physique and we have we can test that and it's true and this it's an i it's a nice linear relation between this time of scale and this time of scale. There are two time scales that have a related with a simple proportionality factor. Input proportionality is magnetic. Now, more interesting, the fact that the plot was prepared in terms of the speed maybe is something that is not the direct control permit at the speed, because the direct control permit experiments the ATP. So, what you want to have actually is a plot of this value alpha and eta in terms of ATP, which is the thing you control within your experiment. So, first, we plot, we have We plot, we have calibrated the speed in terms of ATP, and then we can translate the previous curve to a curve for alpha and for eta in terms of APP. So now, a therapist, therapist, a simulator can come here, and when he models, he can use these values because now he has values in terms of. In terms of APP, values of other. Even more, even more. This I mentioned is the scaling of an active landscape in terms of elasticity, the stiffness of the microtool, and the PDPR. This I mentioned at the beginning. Now, this L alpha can be calculated, as I mentioned, for example, contrasting births, a square root of the density of effects. So now, since we have alpha and we can extract alpha, you can calculate the p. So indirectly, now we have a measure of the stiffness, of the elastic constant of this material, in terms of the end of the APV, for example. And you see that slightly the stiffness increases with the APV. Maybe it makes sense. So as a second, maybe it makes sense because when in this activity of motors and these motors really stick to the micro tool. So this maybe gives some sort of stiffer nature to the microphoos. Please. I think somebody answered my question. It was just something. I can ask you. Any more questions? Okay, I finish. I finish. Now you have alpha, eta. So you can compute forces everywhere. You don't need to put pillars. And if you can compute forces, then you can map these forces around, for example, a plus one-half we can. We have. We have seen this feature many times in simulations, but now you've seen experiments, the forces. Actually, you can split the forces into active part and viscous force. In real, you can do the same for the negative defect, negative defect, everybody for. Okay, the force compensate, force compensate. That's true. That's true. You can also trace dynamics of defects. For example, defects unbinding. A pair of defects, plus one half and minus one half separate. How this translates into a force field you have here. Actually, you even can prepare a video of that. You can do the same for the defect binding. for the defect binding plus 1000 minus 1000 and anyway okay you can trace the force field for these events and you can do whatever you want so it's wonderful okay i think i'm on my time so in situ an on time fabricated elastic markets disprosing artist with for me to do what we have to do to think of microphonic kind of application to strip important material from with us and whatever Because and whatever, and general conclusions. I will say the main conclusion is not automatically systems and that you but they are very versatile and they can do a lot. And we can and use the option and help a lot of us because they are members. Thank you. Questions? So, your elastic constants are apparently in units for two-dimensional systems. If you would convert them to frame
