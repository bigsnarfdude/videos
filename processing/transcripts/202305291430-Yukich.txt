Today's talk is based on joint work with Pierre Kolke. I'm speaking about fluctuations of random convex hulls. It goes as follows. We start off with a smooth body in D dimensions. We always call it K. It's a body which hosts sample points. In this case, I'm considering IID uniform sample points in the convex body. Convex body by Know by Kn I mean the convex hull of the IID point set. So this is the smallest convex set containing the points. When the body hosting the point set is the unit disk, when n is 500, a simulation shows the following picture. This gives the convex hull of This gives the convex hull of 500 points on the unit disk. We're interested in fluctuations of the boundary of the convex hull. How does the boundary fluctuate for large n? Obviously, when n gets larger and larger, the convex hull fills out the entire body and it approaches, in this case, the circumference. Okay, so as you ask. Okay, so as you add new points to the picture, new faces appear, provided that the new points fall outside the existing convex hull. If a point appears here, then it kills off existing faces and creates new ones. Otherwise, if the point lies inside the existing context, nothing changes. Okay, so we have a few goals in today's talk. We have a few goals in today's talk. One of them is to find the limit distribution as the number of points goes to infinity. It's to find the limit distribution of the area of a facet chosen at random from the convex hull boundary. So, in dimension two, the area of a facet is just the length of an edge. A second object of interest is defined. Object of interest is to find the limit distribution of the distance between the boundary of the hosting body, K, and a facet chosen at random. We also want to find the limit distribution of the maximal facet distance to the boundary of the mother body and also the maximal facet area. So, in dimension two, the maximal facet area is just the maximal edge length. Area is just the maximal edge length. Higher dimensions. Maximal facet area is a d minus one-dimensional volume. We also are interested in a process convergence, so a distributional convergence of the process of heights. I will define a height functional and show that the process of heights converges to some limit process. And finally, I And finally, I will speak about the convergence of the process of heights for a dynamic two-parameter process, where there's a time parameter involved. Okay, so just to set up the notation, K is our smooth convex body in D dimensions. We assume it has a C3 boundary. If it has a flat If it has a flat or piece to the boundary, this changes everything, and the behavior of the convex all changes dramatically. We're going to rule this out and just speak about cases where the curvature to the boundary is strictly positive. So we will assume that the Gauss curvature, which we're denoting by kappa, is strictly positive. The surface is always curved. The facets The facets of the convex hull, these are just simplicies with D vertices. By script Fn, I mean a facet chosen at random from the convex hole. And by DIST, I mean the distance between the hyperplane containing the facet FN and the nearest supporting hyperplane. Supporting hyperplane to the facet. So a supporting hyperplane is a hyperplane which is tangent to the mother body and parallel to the hyperplane containing the facet. A picture goes like this. Here's a facet, here's a supporting hyperplane, and this is the distance. When the mother body k, or the hosting body k, is the unit ball, we can define a height function. The height function is just 1 minus the distance. Okay, so it turns out that this distance here, when you have end points, this distance on the average looks like the average looks like n to the power of minus 2 over d plus 1. So after scaling up by n to the 2 over d plus 1, you get a random variable which converges, and the distribution function converges to a limit distribution function, which I'm denoting as CH. This stands for convex hope of K. It's a limit distribution which has a closed form. Has a closed form, rather not so pretty, but it is a closed form. Double integral here, kappa is the curvature. We're integrating over the boundary. Kappa of d minus 1 is the volume of the d minus 1 dimensional unit ball. When K, the hosting body, is the unit b b b b b b b b b b Body is the unit disk in dimension 2. This double integral simplifies, and for a large t, this double integral looks like and is asymptotically equivalent to this expression. So it looks remarkably like Tracy Widam, save for the power of t in front. We can likewise find the limit distribution for the rescaled volume of a typical phase. This also converges to an explicit double integral, looking even uglier than this one. When it's evaluated for the unit disk, when you take k to be the unit disk in dimension two. In dimension two, the asymptotics involve a power t to the power of three. Okay. Now what about process convergence? I want to define a height function for the convex hull. Delta of Kn, this is the convex hull boundary. This is the convex hull boundary. That's this orange piece. The height function in a direction x, where x belongs to the unit sphere, is just the distance between the origin and the boundary of the convex in the direction x. For arbitrary x in Rd, we can define a rescaled height function. It's just the normal. Rescaled height function is just the norm of x times the height function in the direction of x. Okay, so what can we say about this height function? For every point x on the unit sphere, we get a height. What does the process of heights look like? Here's the theorem. I want to regard the process of heights as a process. Of heights as a process on the tangent plane to the ball at the North Pole. So I take points in the tangent plane at the North Pole, map them down through the exponential map to the sphere of radius n to the power 1 over d plus 1. Evaluate the height function at this point scaled up by n to the d over d plus 1. n to the d over d plus 1, center around n scale, and we get convergence of this as a process indexed by points in the tangent plane. We get convergence of this to a process which I'm calling a Burger's festoon. I'll say what it is in a second. When d is equal to 2, notice we have To 2. Notice we have 1/3 and 2 thirds scalar. Okay, so what is the limit process? The limit process looks like this. Let me say a few words about this picture. We start off with points in the unit disk. The unit disk. We take the convex hole, and I claim that there is a transformation which maps this picture to this picture asymptotically as n goes to infinity. In other words, the points inside the convex hull in the large n limit get mapped to a Poisson point process in the upper half plane. Plane. So this is the Poisson point processed in the upper half plane of intensity one. The edges of the convex hull get mapped to the arcs of these down parabolas, the asymptotic limit. These down parabolas are just parabolas that are suspended on points x0, y, x0, h0. And the festoon process here is given by the supremum of all parabolas having the property that the down paraboloid underneath contains no points of the rate one Poisson point process. So there are no points under this parabola or this one or that one. This is This is what I'm calling a festoon process. It looks like a festoon of paraboloids and paraboloids in higher dimensions. Sorry, what does the word festoon? A festoon? Yeah. It means a concatenation of arts. It's of often it's used for in in the context of hanging curtains. Yeah, something like this. Okay. Okay, so we have this limit process and okay, we have some one-third, two-thirds scaling. One-third, two-thirds scaling. There's no area process contained here. The marginal radial fluctuations converge to some limit distribution, which we just saw has right-hand side Tracy-Widham-like tails, save for this factor T in front. And obviously, there's no time coordinate in this picture. We'll come back to this. Your scanning reminds me of this model that was studied by Gander and Smart Onion Peter. Yeah, I did. Yeah, IID lambda variables, you take the convex hole and peel off the lambda and you continue this. Is this accidental or is this the correct? It's not accidental. There should be a relationship between these two. No, they use the same scale then. Right, but you know, there's no time. For them, there was a time. I'm going to introduce time. Is it the same thing on your kiding or is it? Yeah. Is it the same thing, onion peeling or is it? Okay, I have not I've not spoken about onion peeling. It means that take the convex hull, remove the convex hull, remove all the points in the convex hole. This gives you the points inside. Now take the convex hole of that. You get a second, you get the first peel. Remove that. peel remove that you get a third a second peel okay okay so the maximal radial fluctuation what is it this is just the maximal distance between a facet and the boundary this this model This model of the convex hole, it's one of the few models that I'm aware of. Maybe you can tell me some others, but it's one of the few models where we can find the limiting distributions of the maximal radial fluctuations and the maximal longitudinal fluctuations. So the maximal radial fluctuation follows the Gumbel law, meaning that if we take the right threshold involving log-log terms, then the probability that the maximum Then, the probability that the maximum radial fluctuation is less than this critical threshold, calibrated in the right way, converges to the double exponential. This was actually proved in dimension two by Grey Kirksing and Bingham. Dimension two is much easier because you can convert it into a one-dimensional problem by indexing along the points of the circumference. Take the maximal facet volume of facets in the convex hole. So it's just the maximal edge length in dimension 2, or the maximal longitudinal fluctuation. Again, if you take the right threshold and calibrate these constants in the right way, the probability, the maximal longitudinal fluctuation or the maximal facet volume in higher dimensions, Facet volume in higher dimension is less than this critical threshold, converges to the double exponential. Can you say something about where it is? Good, thank you. You're welcome. Yeah. Exactly. So we're not always in the case of the unit oh, this is this is true for any convex body, K. Convex body K that has a smooth C3 boundary. For example, this one. The maximal longitudinal fluctuation or the maximal facet should or will occur where the curvature is small. So one has a picture of it. Well, something like this. And then a long edge here. And something like this. So the maximal longitudinal fluctuation will occur when the curvature is relatively small. The maximal radial fluctuation will occur, it's not clear in this picture, but... It's not clear in this picture, but it'll occur when the temperature is as high. No, almost surely. In other words, more precisely, the choice of these constants, particularly the choice of the leading constant V0, depends upon the maximal curvature, the point, the amount of the maximal curvature. Okay. Okay, so just as a simple corollary, when we're back in the case of the unit ball, we can find the growth of these fluctuations with log precision, meaning that in dimension two, at least, the maximal radial fluctuation grows like the maximum radial fluctuation of the unit. The maximal radial fluctuation of the unit of the convex hull scaled up by n grows like a power of n to the 1 third with the log correction. The maximal facet volume, that's to say the maximal edge length in dimension 2, grows like n to the 2 thirds with the log correction. And I'm paraphrasing Alan Tammond, who would say that the convex whole boundary therefore belongs to some. Therefore, belongs to some maybe KPZ class. We don't have any local Brownian fluctuations. In higher dimensions, the maximal radial fluctuation scales pointing this way, and the maximal facet diameter has this scaling, where we observe that the exponents chi and xi are related. In this fashion. Okay. That's all I want to say about the convex hull model directly. There is a two-parameter space-time process related to the convex alt model, which goes as follows. We don't have any time in this. Have any time in this picture? And it's what we call the dynamic flower, and it goes as follows. So I'm just doing a picture in the simplest possible case. So we have points in the unit disk, D2, XI, or IID uniform in the unit disk. Around every sample point, we construct. We construct a ball centered at one half that sample point with radius equal to one half the distance of that sample point to the origin. So these red petals are exactly these balls. The union of these red petals forms a flower. The outermost boundary of the red petals, that's to say this piece here. This outermost boundary coincides with the support function of the convex hull. The convex hull is depicted in the orange font. And the support function of the convex hull, that's to say, that the max To say that the max, if you pick a point on the circle, the maximal projection of the convex hull in the direction of a given point is given by the support function. So the support function of the convex hull coincides with the boundary of this flower. The boundary of the flower can be written this way. And now I'm going to do a rescaling. I scale up the whole picture by n so that I'm on a scale of, a linear scale of n, and I scale longitudinally by 1 over root t. In other words, when you do that, you end up with this height function when When T is small, one has petals which have a very thin thickness to them. As T gets larger and larger, when T is 1, you end up with this picture, and when T is bigger than 1, the petals are expanding, and for T equals infinity, the pedal at a point just calls. The petal at a point just coincides with the circle, with radius equal to the magnitude of that point. So we have this rescaled flower. You can check easily that for large tea, these petals have a slope-dependent growth. Okay. So you go, let's go back to this. You go, let's go back to this. We're going to rescale space by n to the two-thirds, rescale time by n, and that gives us this formula for our rescaled flower. And now let's look at the difference between the perimeter or the height of this re-scaled flower. The height of this rescaled flower, scaled by n to the one-third. This defines a process in theta, in the space variable, and as a process in the space variable, this converges also to a festoon for a fixed time. So fix a time t. The limit process is given by this following variational formula. Formula. Here is the supremum of parabolas, which are suspended on points of the Poisson point process. In other words, the picture looks like this. So we're looking at now points, Poisson point process of rate one in the lower F. In the lower half plane here they are and then we consider all parabolas suspended on such points. And we take the supremum of these parabolas. This gives us the limit process. The parabolas have aperture controlled by T. So when T gets larger and larger, these parabolas are coming, are opening up. Up and eventually for T large, enough for they're they approach the a line again, what was theta sub xi? What was the notation? Theta xi is just the angle made by the point xi. Yep, you could do a trend. Yeah, you you could do a time dynamic by treating the arrival of points in the if you take it to be a ball, you know, it could be occurring according to a cross-on process in space-time. So you could then look at a snapshot of that and study the boundary and solve. Yep. Indeed. Okay. Okay, so I'm repeating the theorem here. The one-dimensional, so if you look at the height process of the flower in a fixed direction, theta naught, so at the fixed angle, this converges to the exponential s to the three-halves. This shape profile here is a pattern of corresponding probability. Pattern of coarsening paraboloids. So as T gets larger and larger, the paraboloids are opening up. And finally, I'm just remarking that here we have an example of a process which satisfies 1, 2, 3 scaling, but doesn't belong to the KPZ fixed point universality class. It has the marginals which have some tracy-whidden-like right-hand tail behavior. Right hand tail behavior. What do you precisely mean when we say it satisfies 123 scaling? What I precisely meant, thank you, is that we're scaling time by n, we're scaling space by n to the two-thirds, and we're And we're centering around n right but what you get because you have many parameters you get a non-scaling variance limit. If instead of taking the unit ball we take a ball of radius r and put down endpoints in a ball of radius r, that would introduce an endpoint. That would introduce an extra parameter R in this variational formula. Okay. I don't think I have time for the proof. Just want to summarize by saying that. Summarize by saying that in this short talk, I've tried to give you some results on the limit distribution of the height function of the convex hull boundary. That's to say that the limit distribution of the height function for the typical facet height has some right-sided Tracy Widum-like tails. We were able to find limit distributions for the mass. Find limit distributions for the maximal radial fluctuations and maximal longitudinal fluctuations. These are of Gumbol type. The height process of the convex hull boundary when the mother body is a disk converges to this Berger's festoon. And finally, we introduce this dynamic two-parameter flower, which converges to a dynamic stun process. A student process where one sees the time parameter tape. Okay, so thank you very much for your time. I was wondering to meet those three natural to look at the spaces left. I have it filled up with a comment. I haven't filled up with a convex hole yet? Maybe that's classical? So the spaces left is in the case of the flower, it's this space. Well, in that picture, you also have the outside. There's also some scaling for that, I guess, and some limiting distribution. Right? The space that is left here. Remember, we had a fiscal processor. Look at the supremum of all down paraboloids which don't contain Poisson points in the upper F plane. The space that's left converges to this space underneath the down graveloids. But there's no close thing, because this is localized, that is. This is local, at least. When you zoom in locally, check something for the volume to come back to the microphone. You can speak about the volume of a typical faster. This space here has the property that after the right centering of this space that's left over here, you can show that it behaves like nearly the sum of IID random variables, and it converges to a limiting normal of inconfusion. Exactly.
