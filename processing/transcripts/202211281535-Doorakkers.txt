So I will talk today about a project that I'm working on as a second year PhD student together with Daniela of Utabla and Jan Babel van der Bereg at the Freijer Universit√§t of Amsterdam. And the goal of this project is to set up tools to rigorously analyze relaxation oscillations and nights in floods. And in floods, in a fast slow equations of vulnerable fields. And the current state of the project is that we're busy to develop a functional analytic approach to fast flow systems of differential equations on Banach base. And I will spend today to talk about to try to sketch this approach and why this is. Approach and why this is of relevance for minimal field E equations. So, first of all, what is a minimal field Equation? The most simple one is given by the following integral differential equation. And this variable U is a infinity variable, and it is the Frame ball and it is defined by the achieve domain in the Rn and the W and the F models the activation threshold, so it's often a sigmoid function, and W is a synaptic kernel in these types of models. And the integral term, it term it it shows it is it models how two different points in the field interact with each other when abated by the synaptic kernel. And for the analysis of these models you need to make certain assumptions on boundedness and integrability, etcetera, of these functions, which I won't uh mention. Which I won't mention explicitly, but I of course assume. So a lot of times in models on neural fields, there are also stronger slowly varying variables or parameters. And one example of such a model is the following. So this is a model for ADAP Asian and the facilitation process. Processes in the brain on a macroscopic level. And yeah, this macroscopic aspect, you see this here on these integral terms. So the evolution of V1 and V2 is determined by the activity of the whole fields. And a couple of years ago, it was shown with NUMA. Uh uh uh uh anarcho uh uh ethics by Dan Roland and uh uh others that for suitable values of this A B and gamma that you can have arts in this system. So we see this here in this picture. So blue are the orbit is over Areotic orbit is overlaid with the bifurcation diagram of the false system, which is purple. And you see at this full point and this full point that there are the Gaanara segments. And from a neuroscientific perspective, the jumping between different points of this critical manifold reflects the itching in the Itching in the brain between different modes of behavior. And as many people have said already, singular perturbation theory is a medical tool to study the switching in fast-flow systems. So a lot of people have worked on singular perturbation theory for spatially extended systems, and for later importance, I will mention one. I will mention one, and that is the work of Bates who extended to the geometric approach of Finnish shell to the semi-flows on Banner space. But there still seem to be some big open problems in this context. And one of them is how to combine fast fast slow analysis with functional with functional methods for spatially extended systems. And partly motivated by this, we have gone on to attempt to set up a functional anaphytic approach to fast-slow dynamics in neural field patients. patients. So I will later show some aspects of this approach, but to make clear how this is of relevance to normal field equations, I will first spend some words on explaining how you can formulate normal field equations as ODEs on Badax space. So this formulation is in terms of this following equation 2, where now this capital U lives in some Capital U lives in some Banach space X, and X is typically a space of either continuous or square integrable functions of D, which was the super-hial domain. And this W and F are now some suitable operators on X, which replace the the role of the activation threshold, the synaptic kernel and the the integral. The integral. So, of course, now in this formulation, you can make a setup to analyze the step of stationary solutions. And this goes as you would typically do in dynamical systems theory. So, in the linearization, this right-hand side is now the composition of W. Is now the composition of W with the frisette derivative of F and U star. And I will, and this can be written down as minus A plus K of U star, this operator, where now this K star is a compact linear operator. And because it is compact, it means that it has some nice spectral Some nice spectral. And because k is compact, it means that minus i plus k has some nice actual properties. So, for example, there are finite dimensional unstable and center aces in this equation. But the difficult, so really the difficulty in the analysis here comes from the Comes from the non-local aspect of the system, which is due to this WDF representing some integral operator. So now to illustrate this functional analytic approach, I've been talking about we look at the following general setup. So we have a system of fast load ODEs on banner spaces where FMGRCK in the F N G R C K in the sense of Frichette, and we take K to be two or bigger. So these are just some technical conditions. And the critical manifold can be defined as usual. And I will for here focus on normally hyperbolic SNOTs. And one of the reasons for that is that a center manifold reduction near fold and hook points has been shown. Well, it Been shown, well, it has been shown that you can do a center manifold reduction near these points for fossil neural field equations in an article from two years ago by Danny Yeyler and Tom McCo and others. Okay, so the focus is now going on normally hyperbolic as not. And to do this analysis, I make three assumptions. So the first assumption is I So the first assumption is a super actual gap assumption. So this assumption it guarantees indeed that this is a normally hyperbolic manifold. And the second condition is the uniform roundedness of the linearization in the fast directions. And the third condition, And the third condition is a condition on the slow flow, so that's the flow on the critical manifold. And this condition intuitively tells you that trajectories that start close, that they diverge from each other at an exponential rate of at most some omega. And a formal definition of this condition would go via extra anti-debated spaces. And to save time, I'm not going into the And to save time, I'm not going into the details here of this space, but for later reference, this space is denoted as C1 omega. So now as an example, as a toy system to keep the amount of rotation in check, I'm going. Of rotation in check, I'm going to consider the following system where this so this one x, for example, on the space of continuous functions on D, it would be the function that sends each point in D to a one. So it's yeah. And now U is in some Banach space X, but we assume V to be in R. So V is just somewhere U, some finite-dimensional variable now, and I denote X and Y. And I denote x and y and x and i will now denote some initial conditions in the critical manifold, and t epsilon is the solution operator of the system in a low t time scale. Yeah. So uh yeah, so so uh this gives you one orbit of the system for any initial condition. Uh initial condition uh C absolutely. And now I want to treat how with the functional analytic approach that we are working on you can show the following claim and this claim is basically just the persistence of the critical manifold. But this claim is now formulated in a suitable way. So what this says is that for each initial condition in the critical manifold Condition in the critical manifold and a small hand of epsilon, there exists a unique C prime, such that your trajectory in the critical manifold that starts in C eta, it stays in the C one norm, it stays order epsilon close to the trajectory at eta. to the trajectory at eta that starts in C prime eta and C prime depends C k on C and eta and it depends say D minus one on epsilon and from these last two conditions you can derive that for each epsilon your critical uh n uh uh uh anifold it uh Manifold, it resists. It's a CK manifold and they with a cyborg CK minus one smooth. So now in the last part of the talk, I will try to show I will try to show how to prove our functional an analytic approach. Analytic approach works now. So we are going to look at the system of T V stations where capital W and capital Z are the deviations of some trajectory that lies in the critical anaphaz, and and it is also in this exponentially dated space. In this exponentially dated space, see omega 1. And if gamma is now a trajectory of the slow flow, so it satisfies the system at the critical case, then you can derive the following differential equation for capital W and capital Z, where now this term R is also. Now this term R is of order U in W, so it's a purely nonpured term in W. And I'm now going to define an abstract A term on certain function spaces that maps the left-hand side of this system. Now, that maps any element of these function spaces basically to the left-hand side of the system minus the right-hand side. So yeah, so we you see that on the next uh slide. Next slide. So we're now going to be in D node by W with tilde, the combination of W and Z. And this alpha will be some function space. It will be the space of C1 solutions or well C1 ejectories such that the trajectory is bounded and the first if a DF is also bounded. If at if is also bounded, and we restrict the initial condition of z to be zero. And now I define the following operator. So the domain. Oh yeah, so this basically means that you start in the same fast fiber at epsilon instance zero at that. And now the operator is defined on the product of this A with R and this exponentially weighted space. And the target space is by the bounded continuous solution. are the bounded continuous solutions from R, so this is the time to this C prime, so it's X prime, so it's X times R. And the operator is the, right, so if you go back, it's the left hand side of that and minus the right hand side. And so these are classic, so yeah, so if you now fill in for gamma a trajectory of the slow flow, then then w tilde is zero and epsilon is zero is the zero of this operator equation. And to have it so and you would actually like that these that if we that for small epsilon this zero resists and for that we apply Exists, and for that, we want to apply some version of the implicit function theory, and therefore we're going to look at this system at such points. So, for any gamma in the C omega1 space, the linearization at tilde of w is zero and that sine is zero is given. Is zero and that sine is zero is given by the following equation. And if you want to look at it, and if you now want to study the kernel of the system, we basically just have to look at the bounded solutions of this system such that the initial condition of z is zero. And the reason for that is that we want the the the w tilde to lie in this space A that we defined. Space A that we defined before. And the boundedness now means that z must be zero because that is the only yeah, because that is the only solution now that can satisfy this because at the time the derivative of z is zero. So it must be aha. Aha but we all but we already required setting zero to be zero, so it must be zero functions, and then from the assumptions on the spectrum of TF, we can now conclude that also w must be zero, so the kernel is trivial, which means we can apply some a paraspace version of the implicit function that And now, well, initially this might seem now very far removed from the statement, but actually if we now set gamma to be a trajectory of the slow flow that starts at Xi Lta, we now retrieve our statement. If we also set Xi prime to be the following, and the reason for this is that. And the reason for this is that this implicit function t the implicit phi is now basically the deviation between this trajectory of the slow flow and this trajectory at the epsilon. And then for instance and because we know uh that this and because we know that this phi is a Because we know that this phi is a CK function, it must be the case, and also that this is zero. It now must be the case that this is order epsilon in the C one more. So this actually proves the persistence of the vertical endophilt. So I have skipped some details, of course, but Of course, but I hope that, yeah, that is catches the idea that by looking at the system of TV and using a balanced phase version of the presence function theorem, you can retrieve these statements, which, for example, by Fangy Shell, have been proven bit more with the graph transforms. So this method can also be extended to also derive the existence of getting variables. Derive the existence of the invariant center and stable stations of phase space around the slope and the volts. And we hope to use this in the future to vary to connect dynamics near normally hyperbolic parts of critical manifolds in a field the equation. Field the equations to those near four points in a really way. And hopefully, this should bring us much more near actable ringwork for relaxation oscillations and Oscillations and art in normal field equations with slow bones. Other questions? Yes? You mentioned Fennis Oli's graph transform, so this fraction copy that's a function space. Approach as opposed to the reason is that, for example, for double field equations, that a lot of the methods that have been used to analyze them are based on functional analysis. And now if you want to combine these methods with uh the work of Bay, so that's the work that uh that lifts the work of Fing Shell to the Lifts the work of things shell to the Binax base case, then it really takes a lot of time and thought to think about how we should connect these functional and bitter approaches to these more ways of thinking about it. And of course, it can be done, I think. I think, but yeah, I think that to make the analysis somewhat doable or retractable, that it would be in some ways a bit nicer if you start to retrieve agriculture from these functional analytic perspectives, so that you don't have to think the whole time about how does this functional analytic approach compliance with this geometry. Yeah, well the camera is going to be one of the time.
