Inviting me to this very interesting conference. And also, as the final speaker, I would like to thank the organizers on behalf of all the participants because it's really been a very wonderful experience for all of us. And so this meeting is being recorded. So I'm going to be so David. I'm going to be. So, David talked about geodesic complexity this morning for spaces which are geodesic, spaces that have paths, that have geodesics between all points. But there are many spaces that we would be interested in where you don't always have geodesics between the points. And so I want to talk about how we deal with some of those and a new way of thinking about those. About those. Oh, what's happening? There we go. Right. Okay, so remind you the definitions that David introduced this morning, that this is for metric spaces. And if we have a subset of x cross x, then we talk about a geodesic motion planning rule. Geodesic motion planning rule on that subset to be a continuous choice of geodesics, and I always mean minimal geodesics between the two points in the ordered pair there. And then the geodesic complexity of the space is the smallest integer such that x cross x can be decomposed into that many plus ones. So here I'm using unreal. one so here I'm using unreduced GC with a geodesic motion planning rule on each of them. David talked about a number of examples where these were always for geodesic spaces. A space is geodesic if there's for every pair of points there's a geodesic between them. But as I say many spaces are not that way and David Are not that way. And David talked, so David talked about spaces where you had to introduce the epsilon approximation. And so, for example, the ordered configuration space of two points. And so one space that I considered earlier this year was the Earlier this year, was the ordered configuration space of two points in Rn, and this is not geodesic because, well, the geodesics would be the linear path from the first point to the first point and the second component to the second component, but these might collide, meaning that they intersect for the same value of t. The linear path is passing through a point of the form C, C. This will be This will be coming up a lot later in the talk, so I want to point out that these things collide if and only if the vector from A to A prime and the vector from B to B prime are anti-parallel, parallel in the opposite direction. And so what I did in a paper earlier this year was to Was to approximate this space by all the points where the distance is equal to or greater than epsilon. And so this space has geodesics between any two points. It has the same homotopy type as the space, the actual configuration space we were interested in. And so I found explicit geodesics between any pairs of points. And this was really quite. And this was really quite complicated. And I showed, not surprisingly, I'd say, that in this case, the geodesic complexity equaled the topological complexity. So the next space that I wanted to think about was ordered configuration space of two points in Rn minus a point. And there are two types of non-geodes. Two types of non-geodesics. You could have where the segments collide, or you could have where one of the segments passes through the omitted point. And that was getting to be very, very complicated to think about the geodesics. And so that led me to the approach of near geodesics that I'm going to be introducing here today. So the sketch of my talk is that I'm going to introduce Is that I'm going to introduce the notion of near geodesics and use it to define the geodesic complexity for non-geodesic spaces and then compute it for a number of spaces, many of which have the GC equal the Tc, but sort of the hardest and most interesting, I suppose, is one where the GC exceeds the Tc. So I'll be needing to work with the completion of the metric space. And so there's Af-Rinau theorem, which guarantees you that under certain conditions, the completion of a metric space is geodesic. But just in general, I'll be talking about spaces where the completion is geodesic. And so here's my new definition: the definition of a near geodesic. So we're working in a metric space where the completion is geodesic, and then I say that the set of points in x cross x where there is no geodesic between them, I call that the no geo set of x. And for a pair of points in the no-geo set, Points in the no geo set, I say that a near geodesic from one to the other is a homotopy of paths in the completion between them, such that at parameter value zero, it is a geodesic in the completion, and that for all other parameter values, the paths are in the space itself. Itself. And finally, that as the parameter value approaches zero, the length of the paths in this homotopy approach the length of the geodesic in the completion. And so this is justified to be called a near geodesic, I would say, because for small parameter values, you have paths which are arbitrary. Paths which are arbitrarily close to being what was the geodesic in the completion. And so then from this, we can make a rather obvious definition of a near geodesic motion planning rule that it's a continuous choice of near geodesics on a subset of Subset of the no geo set. And then I extend David's definition of geodesic complexity to spaces which have near geodesic motion planning rules. And this will be the smallest integer such that there is that many plus one ENRs on each of which. On each of which we have either a geodesic motion planning rule or a near-geodesic motion planning rule. And I also allow these to be combined if the two sets are topologically disjoint, which means, of course, that there's no sequence of points in one converging to a point of the other. This is what is used oftentimes. Is used oftentimes to make efficient geodesic or topological complexity kinds of things. And so I point out that the geodesic complex, the Tc will be equal to or less than the GC for all these spaces because if you restrict to a fixed parameter value, restrict the near geostationary. Value restrict the near-geodesic motion planning rule to a fixed parameter value that will give you an ordinary motion planning rule and so we can use the same domains so I consider a number of spaces which are not geodesic and in these cases I compute, I determine explicitly I determine explicit near-geodesic motion planning rules and show that the GC equals the Tc. And so one of them, which I will be discussing in some detail here in a few minutes, is the complement of a finite number of points in Euclidean space. Another one, the space that I mentioned before, is Before is the ordered configuration space of two points in Rn. The one that motivated me to this definition: ordered configuration space of two points in the Rn minus a point, and then the unordered configuration space of two points in Rn minus a point, and then one of the spaces. One of the spaces that David talked about today, where you needed the epsilon thing, ordered configuration space of two points in the Y graph. For the Y graph, the considerations are somewhat different. And if I have time at the end of the talk, I'm going to, my last slide will be about the Y graph, if I have time for that. And then the most interesting. The most interesting one where the GC exceeds the TC. This is the ordered configuration space of two points in Rn minus four or more points. So to get the, I need n even in order to say that the G C equals five. I haven't gone through all the details when n is odd. The GC might be greater than 5 in that case. I'm not sure. And then to know for sure that the GC is equal to or greater than 5, I need to have this subset be such that there are four points such that. There are four points such that the segment between two of them and the segment between two others intersect. And there are no other omitted points that can get in the way of that. I think that for some other arrangements of the subsets, maybe the GC might be less than that. So I will be talking about the proof of this theorem in some detail, but first. Detail. But first of all, I'd like to do a simpler case just to get you used to the idea. So this is going to be the one where I have Rn minus two or more points. And I'm going to show that the GC equals the Tc, which is well known to be two. So three, that there are three domains. And I'll just do the proof here when proof here when n is even the difference being that here we have a vector field on s n minus one but i can modify the proof when n is odd so my three domains are going to be these sets e0 e1 and e2 e0 is the geoset this is the ones where so we're talking about pairs of points of r About pairs of points of Rn. This is x cross x. And this is where the pairs where the segment between the two points does not intersect Q. And then you can just take the linear geodesic, and that will be a continuous geodesic motion planning rule. And then we take as our another set the ones where the points where the points where the segment passes where the segment intersects Q in exactly one point and then where the other set will be where the segment intersects Q in two or more points and so here's my near geodesic motion planning rule it's the same rule on both sets but I'll say in a minute why we have to separate it minute why we have to separate it out. So here, so A and B are my point in point of x cross x, S is the homotopy parameter, and T is the path parameter. And so here is the linear path from A to B, and then I am going to modify it by curves which are in a direction away from A. In a direction away from the line from A to B. So I have here a unit vector field on Sn minus 1, perpendicular to the segment AB. And so my G of T is like the curve that's going to be going away from the linear path. I use I sine of pi times T, but any curve. Any curve which is zero at the end points and positive in between will be fine. S is the homotopy parameter, and then delta is some function which is less than the distance from the segment to the other points of q. And so this is continuous on e1 and it's continuous on e2, but it's not. But it's not continuous on their union. And here's a picture to explain why it's not continuous on the union. So the horizontal line here is, so the A and B are like the end points of this horizontal line. And so this is a segment pass in E2. It's passing through two points of Q. And the delta, and so I've got these three points of Q. I've got these three points of Q here, and the delta here is rather large for this one. But now, here the diagonal lines are in E1. They're passing through one point of Q. And as they approach the horizontal line here, their delta is small. And so that shows you that this function is not continuous on E1 union E2. On E1 union E2. And so this shows you that the GC is, I've got this thing's blocking my view here. The GC is equal to or, there it's gone, equal to or less than two, because I've got the three domains, GC is always. Three domains GC is always equal to or greater than Tc, and Tc is known to be two for this space by cup products. I suppose that's one of Michael's original results. So now we move to the harder case, and so I'm going to do the upper bound first. So here I'm assuming that n is e. I'm assuming that n is even and I have any set of four or more points which are excluded from Rn. I'm doing ordered configuration space of these. So the points are of this form. A and A prime is my initial point, and B comma B prime is my final point. And I'm going Final point. And I'm going to divide x up into 18 subsets with a geodesic motion planning rule or an NGMPR on each of them. And so here are the 18 sets. First of all, there are six of them denoted by E with subscripts. These are the ones where the segments A to B and A prime to B prime don't collide. Prime don't collide. They might intersect, but they don't collide at the same value of t. And the subscripts indicate the number of points of Q on them, with 2 meaning 2 or more, because two points determine a line. The extra points don't really affect things very much. And so, for example, this E2 here is a set of pairs where they don't collide. Where they don't collide, and one of the segments has two points of Q on it, and the other has no points of Q. And then there are six other subsets subscripted similarly where the segments collide, but they do not collide at a point of Q. And we also exclude from this the collinear cases where A, B, A prime, and B prime are all in the same. B, A prime, and B prime are all in the same line. Then there are segments where they collide at a point of Q, and so they've got at least one point of Q on them, and so then we just care whether they have whether the segments have other points of Q on them and have a single subscript for that. And then for the collinear configurations where the things are in the opposite orientation, so they collide. Orientation so they collide. Also, we care about how many points of Q are on them. So, on each of these 18 subsets, it's not, well, on E0, there's the geodesic motion planning rule. On all the others, there's an NGMPR of the sort that I showed you in the previous example. And so, then it's not difficult to see that I can group these into six batches. Into six batches of mutually topologically disjoint subsets. And so that means that we can do this job with six domains. And so the GC is equal to or less than five. So now we move on to move on to the lower bound argument. bound argument. So here n can be even or odd. I'm not saying anything about vector fields on Sn minus one anymore. But I need it to be that there are four of these points arranged so that the two segments intersect and no other points get in the way. And so the briefest sketch of what I'm going to do here. Sketch of what I'm going to do here is: I'm going to say, okay, first of all, you have the set E0 where you have the geodesic motion planning rule, and it's easy to see that any element in the no geo set can be approached by points in E0, and so it cannot be combined. It cannot be combined with any of the non-geo sets. And then I'm going to show that the no-geo sets cannot be partitioned into four subsets with an NGMPR on each. I'm just going to be working with points in the C sets, points where they collide, but that really is not playing a very important role. Not playing a very important role. So here we go. So first of all, the two intersecting lines determine a plane. And so I'm going to be working in that plane and I'm going to call it R2. And then it's easy to see from the argument that I'll be giving here: the angle between the points affects nothing. Nothing and the relative distances of the four excluded points from the point of intersection doesn't affect anything. And so for simplicity, I'm going to assume that these four excluded points are plus or minus one, plus or minus one. And then I'm going to take as a starting point to consider here, I'm going to take the Here, I'm going to take the initial points are going to be at 2, 2 and minus 2, 2, and the final points are going to be down here at level minus 2. And so this is a point in C2, 2, although that's really not all that important. And so it's in, so I'm assuming I've got this decomposition into four sets. Decomposition into four sets. And so this is in one of them. And so let's say that this one's in S1. And so that means that I have a near geodesic motion, I have a near geodesic associated to this. This point is called X. And so near geodesic motion planning rule on S1. And so phi1 of So phi one of x is and so phi one of x has a curve for associated to the a b and one associated to the a prime b prime. But at this point, I only care about the projection on the first component, this one here. And then the one here is the parameter value one. So this is. So this is a curve, this at parameter value one, this is a curve from A to B. And most likely, it's probably all on one side of the line, but it doesn't have to be, so I've drawn it in a way where it's not. And so this curve does not pass through any of the excluded points. Through any of the excluded points. And so it's going to pass this point this point minus one minus one. Oh crap. Shoot. These should say minus these should say minus one, minus one. I corrected that. I corrected that. I must have a mixture of versions here. So, all these places on this slide should say minus one, minus one. This curve passes this on, I'm saying on the right side. And so then what I want to do is I want to take a sequence of points in C1, two, points which pass. comma two points which pass through through through this point and they're they still have the this other line I'm not varying that one yet and they're they're they're lines such that the segment passes the point minus one minus one on the left side and they're approaching the AB. Approaching the AB. So if these are in S1, then they have the rule phi1 on them. And because they approach the point X, and the continuity of Phi1 says that these curves approach that, so this red curve here. So, this red curve here is the phi1 of a n bn. And that it those curves approach this curve uniformly. And so that means that they will eventually pass the point minus one, minus one on the right side. And so the phi one is a homotopy. Is a homotopy from the zero parameter to the one parameter, and this homotopy is not allowed to pass through the point minus one minus one here. And so that is a contradiction to these xns being in the set S1. Now I can choose because there's only four possibilities for these four possibilities. These four possible sets for these to be in, infinitely many of them will have to be in some sj and it's not one. So let's say that it's they're in two, s2. So now I have all these points, these points here, xn, and they're all in s2. So I'm going to just be doing arguments like this over and over. Over and over. So now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a sequence approaching each one of these x. So I call it xn1. That was my sequence where they were all in the same set. And so I'm saying they're in S2. And so then they had the phi2 on them. Had the phi2 on them, and so I'm drawing here a hypothetical phi2. And so I'm saying that it passes this point 1,1 on the left side in the picture. There's no relationship between phi2 and phi1. And well, they're not even defined on the same points. But so now I take a sequence. So now I take a sequence of points xn1 n2 of this form. I'm still keeping the second component the same, but they do have curves going off there. I just don't care about them. And these are parallel to this segment here, and they're approaching it. And so I can choose my subject. Choose my subscripts so that they're all in the same SJ. And I'm going to show you that J cannot be 2 and cannot be 1. And therefore, they're all going to be in S3. So here's why they are not in S2. I have chosen them so that they pass the point 1, 1 on the side opposite to what that curve does if they're in S2. If they're in S2, then they've got the phi2 defined on them, and these points are converging to the point Xn, and phi2 is continuous. So these curves are converging uniformly to this curve. So I didn't draw the curve in here, but so there's a curve that's passing on the left side here, and it's Side here, and it's got to be homotopic to the zero level of the homotopy. And the homotopy has to pass through this point, but it's not allowed to. And so, therefore, they can't be in S2. And they can't be in S1 either. And if they were in S1, then the phi1 is defined on them. And I'm moving back here. moving back here that they would be they will be very close to this a n b n segment and so they too will be passing on this side of of the point minus one minus one and we would get the same contradiction about the homotopy from at from parameter zero to parameter one so now So now we introduce the action on the second component. So now I have these points that I just talked about that are in S3, the points, the subscript N1, N2. And I am going to take points where the component over here is approaching. Here is approaching, they're approaching the points A prime and b prime. Now, so I'm saying that the point x n1 n2 was in S3, and so phi3 is defined on it. And I'm interested now in the projection onto the second component of phi 3. And so the point With the N1, N2 itself was the one where it's in black here. It had the segment at level zero, it was the black segment here. And so the phi 3 of it passes this point on one side or the other. I'm saying it's. One side or the other, I'm saying it's the right side, and then these points with the m and the m prime are convert, no, just m with the m are converging to that point. So their curves have to approach this curve uniformly. So eventually they will pass this point on the right side, but they were chosen. They were chosen, maybe I didn't say that, but they were chosen so that they passed at parameter value zero, they passed on the left side. And so get the same contradiction as before, that the homotopy, they're homotopic, but they homotopy can't pass through that point. And then if this was in S2, then by Then by letting the second and third, doing a diagonal argument on the second and third subscripts, these are going to approach the point XN1, which we had back before that was in S2. And we will get a similar contradiction in the first component. In the first component, well, maybe doubt it a little back there, that they're going to, that their first components are going to be approaching this first component here. No, wait, their first components are going to be the same as this. And so we'll get the same contradiction on the homotopy for the phi2 of them. Two of them. And similarly, if they were in S1, there will be a contradiction for the phi1 of them all the way back in the first picture using the projection. And so they can't be in S1, S2, or S3, these points here. So they have to be in S4. Now, I'm sure you don't want to. Now, I'm sure you don't want to see me go through all that again, but by similar methods, approximate using parallel lines on the second component, I can get a sequence which has contradictions for being in any of the sets. And therefore, I have points which I have a contradiction from these four sets. covering x cross or covering the neat no geo set of x cross x. I might say that this kind of argument is reminiscent of the argument that David alluded to in his talk where he shows for the Klein bottle that a certain number of domains do not suffice. He did things sort of like this. Did things sort of like this. All right, so yeah, I have time to talk a little bit about the Y graph. In fact, a good bit of time. So there is a different aspect to the near geodesics on the configuration space of two points on the Y graph. In all those other cases, In all those other cases, the completion, you know, they were either you had omitted points or you had a configuration space of two points. And the completion was just you include the omitted points or you allow the points to collide. So it was just like Rn. So it was just like Rn cross Rn were the completions in those cases. And in those cases, the completions had geodesics. Remember, the hypothesis of all of this was X is a metric space whose completion has geodesics between all the points. Between all the points. Well, in this case, so ordered configuration of two points on the y graph, the completion, so we're using, I'm using the L2 metric, just the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances between the points. So the completion here is just y cross y, and this is geodesic. Oh, but the difference is, yeah, the difference is that The difference is that in those other cases, the geodesics could be approximated by paths in the space, by near geodesics. But in the case here of two points on the Y graph, that some of the geodesics in the completion cannot be approximated by paths in X. So here's an example of that. So suppose I want to move from the point A, A prime here to the point B, B prime. So the geodesic in Y cross Y is just the linear path. You go from A to B. From A to A prime and B to B prime linearly simultaneously, that's fine in y cross y. Well, it's not, it collides, so it's not in f of y, 2, but moreover, it cannot be approximated by a geodesic, or no, cannot be approximated by any path in the space X. The space X itself, because any path near to that one is going to collide too. So I have to change the metric. So I'm going to use a different metric. This is what's called the intrinsic metric, and that is defined as the infemum of the lengths of paths between the points. So this makes it. This is makes it with this metric, it makes it what's called a length space. A length space is a metric space in which the distance between points is the infimum of the distance of paths between them. And the Hawk-Rinau theorem deals with length spaces and says that they're, well, in some cases that their completions are. Cases that their completions are geodesic. Anyway, so using the intrinsic metric, it gives you the same topology that for points which are sufficiently close together, if the distance in the original metric, the distance from b comma b prime to a comma a prime is less than the Less than the distance from A to A prime divided by the square root of 2. In this case, anyway, the epsilon balls are the same. So they have for sufficiently small epsilon, the epsilon ball around points are the same in the two metrics. And so that means their topologies are the same and the path lengths are the same. the same. But now the geodesic from in under this metric, the geodesic from AB to A prime, no, from AA prime to B B prime is that you move A and A prime up to V so that they both hit V at the same time. same time and you're allowed to you're allowed to do that in the you know the in the completion of of this space in the intrinsic metric you move them up to there and then you move them back to b comma b prime letting a get ahead and so that is the geodesic in Geodesic in this space in the intrinsic metric, and it can be approximated by paths which just go up slightly beyond the V. And so we have near geodesics. And so then the near geodesics that I would construct in this case are really just adaptations. Just adaptations of what David and Mike and I did in the epsilon graph, epsilon version of this space. So I guess my time is up practically, and so I say thank you. Thanks, Don. Thanks, Don. Let's open it up for questions. No questions, people are tired. Okay. Okay. Hello? Yeah. Okay. You can probably see me and hear me. I have a more general question, maybe, I mean, but it's related to this. So I'm always wondering when you consider those spaces, I mean, instead of points which are equal or not, you consider points. not you consider points which are at some epsilon distance or if you consider small disks and so on so uh in some space x okay so two points three points um what can be said about invariance properties of those i mean uh of course it's easy to say they are not uh um invariant to say homeomorphism or uh or homotopy equivalence clearly i mean if you have Equivalence clearly. I mean, if you have obstructions, you cannot move material points around. But I mean, are there theorems saying something positive? It's invariant, and of course it's invariant to isometry, but something in between. Are there theorems like this? I guess I don't know what kind of invariance you might have in mind. Okay, I mean, just the case that you consider. The case that you consider. You consider some space X and two points, I mean, configuration space of two points there. But I mean, those points, when you say they are at least, they are not only different, they are at a distance at least some fixed number between them. This is a bit like considering small disks going around. Yes. Yes. So now my question is: if I deform the ambient space. Okay. I mean, then the configuration space changes. Now I would like to have some results saying, okay, for something which is less stringent than isometry, but is, of course, it cannot be homotopy equivalence. So is there anything that guarantees that they get the same say the same topological complexity? Or if you want, what is the, I mean, geodesic complexity is invariant with respect to what? David, what you say? Yeah, I'm also not sure. Yeah, I'm also not sure what invariants are. Yeah, maybe we can discuss this after the talk. At first, I thought maybe you were wondering about invariance with respect to changing the value of epsilon. Okay, for example, yes, because I mean that means considering bigger disks going around. So, like on the graphs, the epsilon has to be small relative to the lengths of the edges. Yeah, so okay, so if you were talking about, right, if you're talking about Rn minus several points and you wanted to do And you wanted to do epsilon and you wanted to do an epsilon version of that, then certainly the epsilon would have to have something to do with the distances between points. I mean, that's sort of like the graph thing, I guess. So epsilon has to be moderately small compared to other things that are going on. But in terms of like In terms of like topologic, some topological thing about how the some topological property between spaces that they're or metric property between spaces that their geodesic complex, that the geodesics are, yeah, that the GC is preserved. That would be an interesting concept if we could come up with one. Up with one. So maybe, I don't know, Matthew Kale, I think is his name, studied like disks moving on a disk. Maybe that's similar to what you're asking. I mean, if you're in Rn, it doesn't matter what epsilon is, because Rn is very big. So for any epsilon, it's the same. But if you're in a in a constrained disk, then the epsilons do matter. And on the graphs, they also matter because uh the the homotopy type changes if epsilon is too big. Be type changes if epsilon is too big. Okay, thank you. Any more questions? If not, let's thank Don and all the speakers from all the days again.
