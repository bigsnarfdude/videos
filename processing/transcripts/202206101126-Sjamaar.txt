And Brent for providing us with a week's worth of entertainment in italic surroundings. So, thank you guys. This is a report on some work in progress with these three people. I'll start by writing the results, and then most of my time I'll just spend explaining what it means. A transversely symplectic Riemannian flobiation Riemannian fogation That's that the leaf closure space. The leaf closure space is compact. And next, we have the algebra of Morphism in action. Let's first look at the proton. Isometric action of compactly algebraic G compactly algebraic G we have an oval map Map of M, two or two B algebra, and a pre-quantum bundle D cross F equivariant pre-quantum album. I bought this, and the Bush unis one times m transversely symplectic Riemannian fungi and the quantization is a module for the Lie algebra. For that Lie algebra, and that's a completely reducible model. And the isotypical types, certain irreducibles of the Lie algebra occur with multiplicities. And this statement is kind of a geometric formula for a small. Formula for those multiplicities. Isotypical decomposition of a decomposable Lie algebra module, particularly if you look at the zero multiplicity, the fixed part. That corresponds to the isotopic part of the multiplicity zero. Pick out quantization of a space called F zero. M0 over the forerunnation, F0, and the transverse is affected for almost as far. This formula tolls on this just by taking invariant, but in practice the way the proof goes, first you establish this. First, you establish this and then you boost that up to prove this full decomposition formula. So, what does all of this mean? Well, first, let me say very broad brush strokes. This theorem is kind of a blast from the past. It's an extension to a foliated context of results of Uh results of Jordan and Sternberg in the eighties and early nineties and uh Eckhart Beinberg. To a foliated context. Context. But form omega, you should broadly or roughly think of a selected form on the leaf space. And this action, this homomorphism, you should think of as a G-action all that leaf space. Q Is the quantization of the leaf space added to spaces that occur in the decomposition formula of the so-called reduced bases. With respect to this Lie algebra action. Now the foliations we can deal with are only very special foliations, they're remanion foliations, and the Lie algebras we can deal with are only compact Lie algebras. Compactly algebra. Most of the definitions make sense for arbitrary Lie algebras, but you can only establish the formula if you impose a compactness condition. So let me just proceed to explain step by step. To explain step by step the ingredients in the statement which I've just erased. Compact Lie algebra that it means that G is the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group. Of a compact leg group. Or in other words, G has a positive definite invariant in a previous. G is the sum of an abelian part, center and compact, semi-simple signs that you never So that can never re ask that the group itself acts or it doesn't. It doesn't. It doesn't have to. G hat is the set of irreducibles. Parameters by highest weights. V lambda is just the irreducible module. Good highest weight lambda. That's as far as the algebra goes. Riemannian foliation of the body came up several times. So, F is a regular variation of codimension q. State q and the tangent distribution normal model and G, the transverse metric is a metric on the normal model. Are both a thing you can differentiate along tangent vectors to the formulation, and I want that to be constant on the floor. Vector fields tangential volumes are the sections of the tangent of tangent distribution. These are very special variations, just to highlight one very special thing. In any leaf, the closure of a leaf is always in the most sub-manifold. Due to mainly to Marino and a few others. Closure on each leaf. Is a numerous manifold? And the decomposition into leaf clusters is a foliation of M, although now it's a singular foliation. Well, it's already a remarkable fact that if you look at all the leaf closures, those form a decomposition. Two leaf closures intersect, then they must be the same. It's a singular proposition. Which I'll call F bar. In the statement of the theorem, I was asking that if you take the leaf closure space, that's why you have this leaf space of this closure formulation, then that should be compatible. The next thing we want is a kind of a symplectic structure. It has to also be half storage. It will automatically be half-storied. Yes, that's also a fact established by Mollyman. In fact, he had a very explicit. In fact, he had a very explicit description of it. I'll get back to it briefly, maybe, at the end. So the French symplectic structure is perhaps most easily described as a pre-symplective two-form of constant rank and whose null foliation is exactly the given foliation. Form, closed such that the kernel is exactly a tangent distribution. So this two-form will descend to a two-form on the normal bundle and a normal, maybe a normal bundle disinformation factor. I won't have time to go extensively into examples, but let me at least give one little boy example. Let's fix some positive numbers. Let A be the factor of numbers. The vector of those numbers and then we form the ellipsoid with those eccentricities. Ellipsoid is C A. It's a real hypersurface poison topic CN with its kind of symplectic structure. And you let if TM gets a plexic form and you restrict it. And you let F with a null formulation. This is a Riemannian formulation. Why is that? But certainly not true that the null foliation of an arbitrary coisotopic manifold could be Riemannian, but this one is. Why is that? Because the null foliation is actually the orbits of a subgroup of the standard torus standard n torus. T M which acts in the standard way of Cn and which preserves that just by spinning the complex variables, which obviously preserves that ellipsoid. Which has a Lie algebra Rn and inside Rn you have the one-dimensional subspace spanned by that vector A that generates a one-dimensional immersed subgroup of this torus and whose orbits are exactly the leaves of this nulliformation. And by the vector A and these. The leaves of A are in orbits of G. And this standard Thomas acts isometrically and preserves the metric, which implies that this foliation is a remembrance of If these numbers are rational, then these orbits will close up. And then you can form a quotient space, which is a weighted projective space. And so we're looking at this example as kind of a weighted projective space, but with irrational weights, like a badly battered projective space. Next, we have transverse vector fields. So, we have this normal model which has sections, which of course just is we identify it with vectors. We identify it with vector fields, modular vector fields tangent to the foliation. This is a Lie algebra, and this is a Lie sub-algebra. The quotient is not a Lie algebra, but of course it's a module for this Lie sub-algebra. So we can take invariants under this action of this Li sub-algebra, I'll denote by a sub-super. I'll denote it by a superscript F. And this is a Lie algebra. Like that. It was really just a normalizing of the vector fields tangent of foliation inside the full Lie algebra vector fields. No worries about that subject. So this is a Lie algebra. Elements of that Lie algebra are called transverse vectors. Lie algebra I'll call transverse vector fields by x of m. So a transverse vector field is not a vector field, it's an equivalence class of vector fields. You can represent it by an element here. The flow of a vector field in here maps is a folius mode, maps leaves to leaves. So a transverse vector field. So a transverse vector field has a well-defined float that leaves to leaves, well-defined up to float along the leaves. And if the leaf space of the manifold of the foliation is a manifold, then this is just a vector field on the leaf space. The transverse action of a Lyardo homomorphation is just a Li Ardua homomorphism. Into the transistors. Again, if the leaf space is a manifold, this just means an ordinary uh Lie algebra action on the leaf space. And Lie algebra actions have action algebraids. Well, you don't Is formed by taking the product. But in our case, there is no anchor, because elements in G, they don't define vector fields. They define vector fields, only up to vector fields tangent with the fogation. Still, you could form a what we call a transverse action we have for it. Take this trivial bundle. I'll denote it by G semi-direct product F. Take this trivial bundle, as in the usual Leon case. Uh you form a Fragment product. This has a map not to the tangent model but to the normal model. I take Fragment product over the normal number with the tangent model. So that means all triples sine of Lie algebra x m. X M V times space and so the value of the section A of Ïˆ at point X should equal this mobile vector V. Modular vectors tangential for each early article. Its orbits are well the orbits you should think of them as G orbits of leaves of F.  Next is the Hamiltonian correspondence and overlap. Our form is a degenerate two-form, so not to every. We don't have a bijection between tangent vectors and cotangent vectors, but you still can do the following. If you have a function which is constant along the leaves, basic or f-in-variant functions, function, then you can take its derivative. That will be a basic one-form. And because the null foliation is exactly the foliation F, we can write that as the product with some vector field, but that vector field won't be unique, it will only be unique up to a vector field standard to the function. In other words, a basic function. A basic function has a Hamiltonian vector field, which is well defined as a transverse vector field. And now you can ask for the standard Loblack condition. This is a Lya Bromomorphism with respect to the obvious Poisson bracket. We have an action and we ask for this. We call it the dual moment map. Call that to be a Lie algebra homomorphism and then you get the moment map typically dual atom. And you get the moment maptor for dual editing. Psi is a Lie algebra element. X is an element of m. You take the function, psi, reevaluate x. This is a Fouvet map, or well, it's uh the mobile map is constant over the leaders of Fouve. Um Two more things I have to define. Spread organization. By that, I just mean the usual thing complex line bubble. Um But adapted to the situation, of course. I want the connection to be a basic form mission connection. Curvature is this recent black form and I want the action of the Lie algebra to lift action and I want it to be incovariant. I want the Lie algebra action to lift. Next, we have the symplectic quotient of the symplectic reduction. Symplectic reduction is maybe the only thing that's easier in this category than it is in general. Usually you think of symplectic reduction as a two-step process. You take a fiber hema map and then you divide out by the group. Here we are in a slightly different context. A slightly different context, we're in a context where we have a foliation with a transverse symplectic structure. And I'm going to adapt the reduction process. Instead of dividing the fiber of the mobile map by a group, I'm going to enlarge the foliation. The ambient foliation restricts to the fiber. Then on that, we have the Lie algebra action. I'm going to add those directly. I'm going to add those directions to the foliation on the fiber, and I get a bigger foliation. And that foliation is transversely subtracted. And that I'll call the reduced space. So, here's the statement. Well, first of all, the zero fiber is a unit of orbits for the transverse action we are working. So it restricts the boy what's our call. Which I'll call A naught over 5, which I'll call N naught. The restricted Lie algebra, because of the regularity condition, is injective anchor, so it defines its obligations. Regular foliation and that foliation is transverse symplectic with the restriction of the presymplectic form.  Reduced space and you can uh reduce it other levels as well. At a non-zero level, you take images of coveted orbits. And you can play a symbol again with restricting the foliation and the form. So, for instance, that contact that contact ellipsoid is itself. Is itself a reduction? Is it a reduction at some non-zero level? Level one, I think, of the standards. We end with the trivial zero-dimensional foliation understands of what respect. With respect to action, I one-dimensional the object spanned by the factor of these weights. Quantization quantization means what I like to call format quantization. It's not geometric quantization, it's not deformation quantization, it's something very simple-minded, which Minded, which in some cases is a reasonable approximation to geometric quantization. We replace geometric quantization by the index of an operator which use of a normal, non-compatible, almost complex structure. Of course, it's a complex structure. And once you have a complex structure and a syplectron, you get Perform, you get a Spincy Direct operator. You get a Clifford module and a Dirac operator. That operator, having made this a complex vector bundle, we can take its complex exterior power and I take the zero one byte size and I dualize. And a dual S. This is a Clifford module for the Clifford algebra of the normal bundle, which remember is equipped with the Riemannian network. I take that bundle. I twist it by the pre-quantum line bundle. And then on this thing, on sections of this thing, I have this operator, which is cobbled together out of different multiplications. With the multiplication and the connection. First order differential operator. So the metric here is not the metric original metric. It is the metric. Yes, it is. It is the metric of the normal bundle. I have another one coming from the choice of compatible complexity. Okay. Uh okay. Uh okay, yes, okay. I may have to replace it to make it compatible. Yes. Yes, that's true. But that won't affect the index. And we call it the transverse because you couldn't see the art operator. And these sections can be differentiated along the flavoration, and the operator plays nicely with the flobiation. So you get a restricted operator, an F-invariance. On the F invariance, we can have the operator. And this operator is G invariant. And this is a Fednome operator kernel, a code kernel, the operator on F invariants, I should say. I have an engine on and they are coherencalizable, com completely, what do you call it? Completely decomposable, semi-simple modules for the Leonardo. We could take the index, and that's what I mean by quantization. There are reasonable cases that index will be approximately equal to what you call the geometric quantity. Very X kernel by code kernel element. Element, virtual representation, an element of the representation ring of semi-simple finite-dimensional GG models. So that's just the integers of the outfit. What are 12:15? Yeah, okay. You have. We started 53. But you have. We started by making service by us. Oh yes, we did. Sorry. Well, I've explained all of the ingredients of the theorem. I could end here. Let me just finish then by stating what the composition is of that ellipsoid. This ellipsoid is like a messed up toric variety. There's a Delson theorem that goes with this. This was developed by Elise Prato. Elise Prato noticed that you could take any simple polytope and do a Delzan construction without any rationality conditions and yet Rationality conditions, and you end up with one of these things, transversely syntactic vocation. Okay, so one of our goals is to quantize these things. And this is the answer for the ellipsoid. Well, this thing has a Darzin polytope. What is it? You just look at its moment image, the reaction of the full torus. That's the convex hole. Convex hole. Under the pulp of you rescale the standard basis vectors by the eccentricities of the ellipsoid and you get this simplex, complex all of these vectors in Rn or Rn dual. Moment map image for the standard N-tours of platform. Now we can apply a theorem to this example in two different ways. In two different ways. First, by regarding this as a reduction of Cn, this is a reduced space. So we take the according isotypical component of the quantization of Cn. That is this. Well, this is some funny simplex with irrational vertices, but it might still have some lattice points in it. And that's exactly what you pick out. Victorus still. Big torus still acts on this thing, so that this quantization is actually a module for that big torus. And this take G is R n acting on MK and we get this. We get well we realize that each of these lattice points carries a representation of that torus. The torus. So that's the sum of these one-dimensional irreducibles over all these lattice points. And there's a similar formula for arbitrary so-called toric quasifolds. Spaces obtained or stacky zerosymplectic or varieties, if you like. Okay, thank you. Thank you. This was an excellent way of closing the conference, but if someone wants to ask a couple of questions or things that we want to please feel free. And those who have to leave, just leave. Those who have to leave just leave: is there a chance for a killer version? Right, so this messed up, this irrational weighted projective stack is by no means an algebraic stack, but it is a holomorphic stack. Uh the transverse symplectic structure is actually transverse scalar. Expert is actually transverse KLO. And there's certainly a possibility of doing a K-Lo quantization. Yeah, haven't done that yet. Try to take some deformations of this foliation as because if we use like sperm A in this case, or even if we have something like clean foliations, then we have good deformations of them. I mean, you can deform this foliation, change A, but there are changes essentially in the algebra. Then how this whole process, I mean, can expect some. You don't have any kind of stability then? Um no, no, change very specific rates. All these simple all these simple activist spaces deformed into each other. I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on the necessity of the for the Riemannian and if you have a can do something if it is non-Riemannian problem. We have no results in the non-Riemannian case. But what is the problem? What important is the properties of the foliation, not really the remaining structures. The remaining metric in itself is not important, but what is important is the structural results for these foliations, the Molino theory, which basically tells you that you have a generalized morphism from the holonomic group point of a Riemannian valuation to an action group point for a compact legal. Legal. This generalized morphism is not an isomorphism, it's not an equivalence, but it's nearly an equivalence. And that's enough to control the situation. The holinomic report may not be proper, but it's very nearly proper that enables us to handle it. Um we need to be dashed. Need to be done. The action of G doesn't have to integrate to a Lie group action. On the other hand, if you do the Molino construction, you will foliation up to the orthogonal transverse frame model, and then you form the Molino manifold, then the Lie algebra action will transform through an isometric action of the Okay, if there are no more questions, let's thank Ryan. Thank you all for coming. Maybe I'd like to see the cats are not a matter of tests. I was assuming also that he actually preserved this isomer.
