Pleasure to have Amy and Meyer tell us about two new quantum information measures at APS2 speed. Yeah, thanks a lot. Thanks to the organizers for putting things together. So I have this rather generic title because I will try to cover two more or less unrelated topics of our recent work. So the first topic will be symmetry resolved in human entropy in ADS CFT and in particular in ADS3 CFT2. So what is symmetry? So, what is symmetry solved entanglement entropy? If you've never heard about this term before, it's basically the entanglement entropy that's left over in your quantum many body system after you fixed your sub-region charge, at fixed sub-region charge. So basically, there is, I'm going to explain how this comes about, there is a way to decompose your ordinary entanglement entropy into a weight sum of these symmetry-solved entanglement entropies. These are the probabilities that you measure in your sub-region charge Q. And in a classical Gibbs piece here, which basically is the entropy in this probability distribution. Okay, so you measure some conserved quantity and then you can decompose your entanglement between your sub-region and the outside. And so in a series of recent works, we have... You can always write it this way or just under some circumstances we can? I think this is pretty general here. I think this is pretty general here. I mean, you can always write it this way. I will come to that later. So if you have a non-abelian symmetry, then this Q gets replaced by something labeling irreducible representation. Yeah, so over the last three years, in particular during the pandemic, we have written a couple of papers on this topic. And so the people involved were my PhD students, Zu Tian Zhao, a postdoc, Christian Malter, who is now in. A postdoc, Christian Malter, who is now in Dasheva in Israel. A master's student, Konstantin Weisenberger, and a further postdoc in principle, Giuseppe Giulio, who will be on the job board this year. So keep your eyes open. And another master's student of mine, Henry Shepherd, and so I will go through the results today. Good. Yeah. So th this is this was the first this is the first topic. The second topic is going to be concerned with bary phases in ADS CFT and maybe beyond, depending on time. So basically we wrote these two papers here involving people from Dresden, Slavia Naguera and Guerra and Jerome van der Brink, and a senior postdoc of ours, Shubik Bernardi, a PhD student, Movitz Dorband, and Johanna Latninger was also involved, and another PhD student, Anna Leonard Weiger. And so basically what we did in these papers is that we uncovered a very similar structure of baryphases in simple quantum systems, so like an EPR pair of spins, and in, for example, your warm. You know, the L Dias and Rosenbridge, the warm hole that comes up in ADS CFT and global black holes. And so, in particular, we showed that this bary phase probes the non-factorization of the Hilbert phase that's associated with this Wormhole structure. And so, I guess I will mostly cover this first work here, and I will only focus on the Wormhole story or on the Blackball story. And so I will explain the structure in general. So I will explain the structure in general, and then I will explain a little bit how this works out in J graphically, which is what we looked at here. Yeah. And the second paper is doing a similar analysis in ADS3, but I don't think I'll have time to talk about this. Good. Yeah. So let's get started. Fortunately, Bautek has already done a lot of work for me. So just to remind you, I mean, we've You, I mean, why are we interested in quantum information and ADS CFT in general? Well, we believe that the holographic space-time in the correspondence actually emerges from the quantum information content of the dual quantum field theory. And this has been put forward in this essay by von Warmstrong a long time ago. And so, as Bortek already reviewed, the simplest example is basically the collection of these Leo-Tag and Nagi geodesic. Collection of these Lio-Taka-Nagi geodesics on a time slice of ADS3, for example. So basically, we can think of the entanglement entropy as calculated by this RT geodesics here to probe the geometry of this spatial slice of radius 3 or deformation thereof like a BTC black hole. So this is our motivation. So we want to understand better how this relation between geometry and quantum information actually works. Transformation actually works. Good. So now let me come to the first part of the talk. So I first have to explain to you what symmetry results entanglement is. So it's the entanglement entropy in each charge sector, or if your symmetry is non-abelian, then in each irreducible representation. So let's look at U1 for simplicity. So if you have E1 symmetry around, you have a charge operator Q, and this charge operator Q is P. And this charge operator Q splits into a sub-region charge operator QA in your interval and another sub-region charge operator QB in a complement D. And if you now look at an eigenstate of Q with density matrix rho, then these two must commute, and so you can quickly show that the subregion, the reduced density matrix also commutes with the sub region George operate, okay. This means that the subre uh the reduced density matrix um decomposes into blocks labelled by eigenvalues of QA. Labeled by eigenvalues of QA. And the symmetry-resolved radiant entanglement entropies are now just the radiant entanglement entropies that you associate with one of these blocks, rho A of Q. So these blocks don't need to be normalized, they don't need to have trace 1 in general. So this probability that I mentioned before to measure charge Q here is basically the normalization factor. So this is the trace of one of these blocks. One of these blocks. Okay? Good. So far, so good. So, what we set out to do is we wanted to see how this symmetry solved entanglement entropy can be calculated in ADS-CT. And so, since this assumes an additional structure, namely symmetry, it is kind of model-dependent. So, you first have to fix a model. And the simplest thing you can think about maybe is a two-dimensional conformal field theory with Katzmuth. Dimensional conformity field theory with Katzmudi symmetry that has E21 symmetry characterized by this Katzmudi level K. And so the holographic dual to that is actually known for a long time. So this is described in this paper here by Perkaus, for example. So you basically start out with Einstein-Hilbert gravity. This gives you the dual to a lot, you know, a two-dimensional relativistic conformal field theory with large-central charge. And then you add Sherman-Simon's terms. And then you add Chern-Simons terms, and the gauge field, you know, this Chern-Simons gauge field is dual to conserve one curve. And the Chern-Simons level is the Katzmudi level in your dual CFT. This can be seen by the usual asymptotic symmetry analysis. Good. So this is what we started out working with in this first paper here in 2020. And so And so there are two things to do. The first thing we did is we basically followed an idea of Seller and Goldstein to calculate the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy in these Katzmudi CFTs directly. The idea of Seller and Goldstein is that in order to project the entanglement entropy down to a single charge subsector, what you need to do is you need to give your twist operators actually a Actually, basically a charge by itself. And this charged twist operator then introduces an Avaron of Bohm flux as you take a charged operator around one of these entangling endpoints. So this can be done. And so what's the task to do here? You basically have to characterize these charged twist operators. You have to calculate what are their dimensions and what are their charge. We did this and This and we calculated the associated symmetry solved entanglement entropy, and this is the result here. So, this is the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy at GHQ. The first piece here is simply the normal or the ordinary Caudi color place piece. And the second piece here is mu, that's the symmetry resolved piece. And so you see it's a log-log contribution in the UV cutoff exponent. So it's sublimated. In the unique color phase function, so it's sub-leading to this to the cardiac color of recipes here. Furthermore, it only depends on the transceience level K and not at the sub-region charge at all. So this is called equipartition of entanglement, and this basically tells you that in each charge sector in the cutsmoody CFDs, there is the same amount of entanglement. So this is the first result of this paper here. This equipartition was actually known in three field theories before, for example. Field theories before, for example, in this paper showed up in this paper by Xavier et al. in 2018. The second question to answer is: if you want to build up this ABS-CFD correspondence for this symmetry-solved entanglement, is what is the holographic blow to the entropy? And so, starting from this idea that you have to induce a Bohr flux around the entangling endpoint, we came up with this idea that you should actually. Idea that you should actually add a Wilson line that's charged under this term Simons gauge field and that follows the RT geodesic in the bulb. A Wilson line surely will induce some kind of magnetic flux, which is the Savoy Bolt flux at the boundary. Why does it have to follow the RT geodesic? Well, if you go to the replica picture, if it doesn't follow the RT, the RT geodesic will break replicas of symmetry. Okay. But so this was our idea. And then you can go ahead and calculate the same result. And calculate the same result from this Wilson line. I will not go into details how to do this, technically, has to do with the fact that the Wilson line sources the transients page field, and it induces a sub-region charge on this interval, and from the sub-region charge you can calculate the charged moments, and from the charged moments, then you can calculate the symmetry of solved radiant entanglement entropies. But I will not go into detail here. The radius symmetry, Wilson line is also replaced. Wilson line is also replaced by a surface spring. Well, this is a bulk space. Yeah, this is a bulk Wilson line. Oh, that's one of the bulk Wilson line. So basically, the RT geodesic becomes charged under this transient sphere as well. You can add a charge. Any further questions? How much time do you have? About 15 minutes. 15 minutes, okay, good. 15 minutes, okay, good. Alright, so obviously the results match, otherwise, we wouldn't have published this paper. So you indeed get the same result from this Wilson-Lein prescription. So then we had, you know, so basically we had a further paper with my most student Constantine, where we did a couple of further checks of this Wilson-Lein prescription. So first we looked at a single interval in the same system with In the same system with both uncharged and charged heavy primary insertions. So these are these sort of heavy primary operators with a dimension of order central charge. And as you know, if you put one of these uncharged heavy primaries in your boundary field theory, then you end up with these conical singular space-times in 3D gravity. And if you additionally want to give these heavy primaries a charge, then you have to run another Wilson line along the conical defect. Conical defect. And so what happens is that this additional Wilson line induces additional sub-region charge in your interval, which is basically responsible for an additional contribution of the symmetry resulting entanglement entropy. Another thing we looked at were two intervals in the ground state, and there again we can show that, you know, we showed on the calculated on the CFT side the four-point function of these charge crisp operators, and on the gravity side, we showed that the this. We showed that the Wilson line together with the RT geodesic basically undergoes this phase transition from disconnected to the connected contribution as you bring these intervals closer to each other, what basically Bartic was already talking about earlier today. So in all cases, of course, the results match. And in all these cases, we also find equipartition of entanglement. So this equipartition property actually is not a property of the state, but it turns out to be a property. But it turns out to be a property of the Hertzmakers symmetry algebra. Yeah. So now let me just briefly explain this recent work with Henry. So the twist operator approach to the entanglement entropy actually only gives you these leading orders here in the Unique Cutoff expansion. It doesn't give you exactly so. And so if And so, if there is a way to get exact results, as it turns out, and we describe this in this paper here, and this uses boundary conformal field theory techniques. So the idea is the following. If you really, really want to basically define the cutting procedure that's necessary to define a factorized Hilbert space associated with the sub-region A and its complement. region A and its complement, then what you actually need to do is you basically need to prescribe boundary states at the endpoints of the engineering intervals. So this corresponds to a particular UV regularization of your conformal field theory, let's say. And basically after taking a couple of conformal transformations and in the replica picture you can transform this UV regularized picture here. UV regularized a picture here where you cut out, let's say, little disks of order, you know, of radius of dv cut of order into the cylinder picture here. So you basically look at the CFT on a cylinder of length W and you prescribe boundary states on the endpoints of the cylinder. So this is the CFT picture. And the boundary states or the boundary conditions that you typically choose are ones that preserve a lot of symmetry. So for the Katsmoudi case, we So, for the Katzmoudi case, you choose controllable boundary conditions t equals to t bar, as you would do in open string theory, for example. And then you have a choice of Dirichlet or Neumann conditions on the cat's movement recurrence. So you can either choose J equals to minus J bar, which I think is Neumann in this case, and J equals to J Bohr, which is Dirichlet. And the upshot of these choices here is that actually these boundary conditions literally define your factorized Hilbert space. Factorized Hilbert space, they define the sub-region partition function, which depends on this on the choice of boundary conditions, and then they will in turn define your reduced density matrix. So now you can go ahead and this is the trick that we developed in this paper. You can go ahead and basically Take the partition function, you know, the sub-region partition function at fixed charge here, q, which depends on the boundary conditions alpha and meter, and expound it into characters of irreducible representations of the sub-region symmetry algebra that's left over after this whole procedure. So basically, your choice of boundary conditions starts breaking part of your Katzmudi symmetry, but some sub-algebra is left over, and you can expound this partition function in characters. Expo this partition function in characters and multiplicities of this sub-region symmetry algebra. And if you do that, you see each of these characters basically is a partition function by itself in that particular charge vector. So you can directly, yes, thank you. You can directly read off the charged partition functions that you need to calculate the symmetry soft radiant and electricity. Fortunate enough, Fortunate enough, these characters and these multiplicities are known for quite some symmetries, and in particular they are known for Juan Katzmoody. And so if you look those up, let's say in the big yellow book on CFT, for the free boson, you can actually directly calculate the symmetries of entanglement entropy without going through these basically without going through the charged moments that are calculated by this Wilson-Line description that I By this Wilson-Line prescription that I talked about earlier here. And so we did this and this exercise. So, and in this way, we were actually able to prove that for the free boson and for Neumann-Neumann and Dirichlet-Dirichle boundary conditions, this equipartition behavior actually holds exactly to all orders in the EU B cutoff. So, basically, what's happening is that if you look at the replica part, the The Ready partition functions, basically the charge dependence of these characters completely drops out. So basically, the upshot here is that using these BCFT techniques, you can obtain exact statements in the UV turnoff expansion. Okay? Good. Now you might ask the question, like, you know, when does this equipartition behavior break down? Well, there are known words by Calabre at all. There are known works by Calabrese et al. that it breaks down, for example, invested in Mino-Witten models. We found another instance in this paper here where breakdown of equipartition happens. So if you look at W3 symmetric higher spin CFTs, so for the non-experts, these are the two-dimensional low-trust CFTs with energy-momentum tensor and the spin-3 current. So the spin 3 current is like a Carroll primary with dimension 3 and an associated conserved charge. And an associated conserved charge. We were basically able to use known results for the, so we calculated the charged moments in this case. And the charged moments are basically the partition files. So basically what we did is like, you know, you want to calculate the symmetry of soft entanglement entropy for a single interval. In this case, it's not possible to go through a twist operator for technical reasons, but what you can do. For technical reasons, but what you can do is you can do a conformal transformation that takes this single interval picture into a, you know, basically into a topological black hole picture where the black hole is charged by itself under the gauge field rule to this spin-3 current. And then you calculate the grand canonical partition function of this topological black hole. And these results existed in the literature. They are perturbative in the associated chemical potential. And so we could use. Potential. And so we could use these results. Fourier transform this basically this partition function in μ here to calculate the associated symmetry soft rainy entropies, then take the replica limit n going to 1 and show that the symmetry soft entanglement entropy for these CFTs in the large central charge limit is actually not equipartition anymore, not even to a leading order in large C. Okay, so there it is, you're basically going to pick up a Basically, going to pick up a charge dependence from these non-linearities in U here at this point. So, this is another instance where this breakdown of equipartition happens. Yeah. So, how much time do I have left? It's close to five minutes. Five minutes, okay. Well, I guess I will need much more than five minutes, so I think I will not talk about the second one, but take questions instead. Well, you know, you can say like an overview. It's a little technical. Okay, so let me try to give you some overview. Okay, so the second part of my talk is concerned with berry phases and warm holes. And basically the idea is the following. So we know already from this EPR equals to ER conjecture from a long time ago that wormholes in black hole space tension ADS CFD, for example. In ADS CFD, for example, relate entanglement as stored in the EPR correlations in the dual boundary state with geometric features in the bulk, namely design channel Rosen bridges. And so basically in 21, there has been a paper, two papers by Verlinde, that basically show that similar wormhole-like structures also appear in quantum mechanical systems. Systems. And what these two setups have in common is basically that if you look at the sympathetic form in the phase space that underlies these quantum mechanical systems and basically the asymptotic symmetries of, let's say, black holton ADS. So both of these phase spaces actually admit a closed but non-exact symphactic form. And whenever you have Okay? And whenever you have a closed but non-exact symplectic form, you might be able to write down a baryphase for the movement of your wave function in this phase space. And this bary phase is then going to pick up contributions from the one-hole present here and also from these basically onehol like structures in these quantum mechanical systems. Is that discrete particle mechanical system? These are discrete systems, yeah. Okay, I mean I would have to go through. Okay, I would have to go through the next couple of slides to explain second. Right, but so basically, this is so basically what we showed in these two papers here is that the very phases for, for example, entangled two-qubit system and for wormholes in JT gravity in this first paper share exactly this similar structure that comes from this non-exactness of the symbolic form in the phase space. And so basically what's happening is that you can have state What's happening is that you can have states with the same entanglement entropy. So, for example, the warm holes in JT gravity have, you know, there is a freedom to redefine them in some way, such that the entanglement entropy stays the same for the TFT state, but they differ in this variable phase. Yeah, so this is basically the upshot of our second paper. Ask me in private. Yeah, sorry. Okay, so you have time maybe like for two minutes longer if you want, or we can just start opening for questions and have. Or we can just start opening for questions and yeah, yeah, I mean, I mean, it's really just the story is too long to go on. Okay, so how about we open it up? Let's see, I think a comment, I mean, a question, that this one exactly like the form, the discrete version of it is what we were seeing, and it was too manifold to my kind of quality. It's just yeah, I made it myself. Yeah. I made a point about these secondary. So not exactness, but it is the fact that it's I see, I see, I see. Yeah, maybe we can discuss this more later. Yeah. It's fine. Anyone have other questions? When you say ER equal to EPR, you're also mean teleportation. Well, the one holes we were looking at are the usual non-traversible wormholes. So So, yeah. It's a good question whether a similar structure exists for traversable ones. I don't know, right? Further questions? Okay, in that case we we end a little early, so if you want to say something. I mean I mean it it's it there's really at least another ten minutes that I would I I don't want to take 10 minutes that I would. I don't want to keep people from their cofactor. Let's recap me at 3.30, please. So, okay, but in your case, this is like just cross the side. That's coming.
