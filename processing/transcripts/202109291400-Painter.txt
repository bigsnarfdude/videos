Thank you very much for the introduction. And thank you for the invite. It's been such a splendid set of talks so far, actually. It's been really enlightening. I feel a bit embarrassed because I do do a lot of work in collective cell movement, but today I'm going to actually be the outlier in this conference and talk about modeling collective movement. Modeling collective movement, but work that is a little bit more inspired by animal collective cell movement. So, to compensate for this, I've got the title of my talk to be the closest to that of the conference. So, I've just changed one single word there, actually. But I think the models, anyway that I'm going to present, even as I say, they are kind of inspired by problems in animal movement, they should be also relevant and hopefully useful. Also, relevant and hopefully useful for thinking about cell movement processes. Thomas just mentioned the dart player, Kevin Paint. And that kind of brings me to my second slide. And it's really kind of sad news, actually, because, and I hope this hasn't kind of confused people reading kind of the news over recent sort of weeks, because my namesake has actually recently retired his professional career in darts and from a purely And from a purely selfish perspective, anybody that's heard me speak over the last 10 years basically means that this means that my overly exploited, long-running opening joke is now also facing retirement as well, actually. So I'm going to have to find a new joke anyway to start off with my talks. But so anyway, so I was actually quite really quite upset when Kevin Painter did finally decide to kind of stop playing professionally. Playing professionally. So, I'm going to talk, as I say, today, more about animal migration. And this is a problem that has fascinated for, well, you know, not just centuries, but for millennia. Aristotle wrote about the phenomenon that certain animals would disappear at certain times of year. He came up with various theories for that, including migration and hibernation, but he also Hibernation, but he also came up with theories like certain birds would transmute between different forms. The robin would transmute to the red start, and the red start would transmute back to the robin across different seasons. Over the following centuries, people did look at other kind of theories. I think in the 17th century, Charles Morton proposed that birds actually wintered on the moon and then came back from the moon. So there were various sort of theories for There were various sorts of theories for what was going on, and it wasn't really until the 19th century that the first real kind of more detailed understanding of migration came about. And that was through the discovery of what was called the Feil stork. And that was this unfortunate stalk that was found in northern Germany. It was alive and it had managed to fly with a spear sticking through. Spear sticking through its neck, and obviously, that spear hadn't kind of pierced anything major, so it was out able to carry on the journey. And this was found in northern Germany, but they identified the spear as one that was thrown by tribes in Central Africa who were kind of throwing these spears in order to capture these for food. And that kind of gave the first, this and similar discoveries that gave the kind of the first kind of understanding of. Kind of understanding of migration routes. And of course, over the years, our kind of ability to track animals has changed. We don't need to now kind of put spears through them to work out their routes. We can use GPS as a way to do that. And that has led to a decent understanding of the very complex and very long-distance migration routes that are conducted by a lot of. That are conducted by a lot of animals across the world. So, how do animals migrate? Well, their kind of migration routes have been kind of conveniently divided into three main components, a long distance phase when they're still a long way from their eventual target. Then, what's called a homing phase where they kind of near on the target, and finally a pin pointing target where maybe they actually find if a bird, a specific If a bird, a specific nest hole. And it's believed that various and often different cues are being used by the animals along this route, basically, that they maybe at a long distance phase, they use one type of cue and then they switch to another one as they get closer to the goal. And they can sense a whole variety according to different animals, can sense a whole variety of different pieces of information. Visual information is obviously very important. Visual information is obviously very important, auditory information, olfactory information, but also certain animals are able to detect things like the geomagnetic field, they're able to detect gravity, temperature, and various other sort of components as well. And we kind of describe all of these various cues that animals can use to navigate as what we call the information landscape. Information landscape or the inherent information landscape. And this basically, we kind of represent that in a model as basically some navigational field that for an animal in some position will provide a certain degree of information according to the target. And the strength of that could obviously vary according to distance from that target and so forth. And of course, as I say, this is for animal migration, but of course. This for animal migration, but of course, cells do very similar things in terms of what the cues that they are picking up from the environment. So the question, one of the first question that we're going to be looking at today is a question that we've been recently looking at, and that's the question of how animals, or indeed cells, navigate in poor information environments. And I'm very much a mathematician by training, but in order to By training, but in order to try and get a better handle on this, I decided to do a little bit of personal empirical research just to see how this would do. And I've got the great fortune to be able to spend my summer down in southern Sicily, where my in-laws have a house very near to the sea. And this gives me a nice opportunity to go swimming in the sea during the summer. And of course, that's a nice turbulent. Of course, that's a nice turbulent environment which will kind of mix up your path. So, my kind of experiments were to try and kind of go into the sea and kind of basically try and navigate between two objects. And I chose two boys that happened to be out in the sea. So, that was kind of my this was my kind of empirical research. I needed to find a way to track my migration route. I didn't stick a I didn't stick a spear through my neck. I'm not quite that dedicated to science because, of course, I don't need to do that now. I've got a mobile phone, and if I find a suitably waterproof cover, I can put that, you know, put hold that under me as I kind of swim between the targets. And so I did my kind of first experiments, but I kind of ran into my first problem here and that. First problem here, and that's that the information that I was getting from my route was actually jumping about a lot. It was very patchy GPS. And this is a problem that ecologists studying animal movements have when they're following aquatic organisms. It's basically because the moment your GPS receiver goes underwater, that kind of interferes with the That kind of interferes with the GPS localization. So, what they do in kind of field studies is they put the transmitter on, but then they have an antenna that will at least kind of try and get that signal above water for a certain amount of time. I didn't quite do that, but the way I did solve this problem was basically to destroy a beach hat and then tie that to my head and tie my mobile. That to my head and tie my mobile phone to the top of the head so that it would stay above water while I'm doing my swim. So, that was kind of my solution to that problem. But then this raised another one because in Sicily in the summer, the beaches are very, very crowded on the whole. You've got a lot of people there, a lot of people swimming in the water. And moreover, you know, because this is the seaside town of my in-laws. Seaside town of my in-laws. A lot of the people on that beach know my in-laws very, very well, and I didn't want them to be then bombarded by many questions about why I was swimming in the water in a beach hat with my mobile phone on the head. So my solution to this was to then swim early in the morning while everyone was sleeping, basically. So if you go out at six o'clock in the morning, then you can pretty well guarantee you're going to have a You can pretty well guarantee you're going to have a deserted beach for yourself. I then had to ask the question of how to impair information. And the only way I could think about doing this was to basically kind of, you know, use strong willpower and only open my eyes very briefly every 40 seconds. So to swim out in the sea, closing my eyes for the most time. So I didn't have visual information of the target. Visual information of the target. So I did this, and I wanted to choose a nice long route. So I kind of chose a route, and this was my kind of first attempt. And I got to the end of that kind of end of that route. And it was about 330 meters that I had swung, you know, in terms of that route. And I realized, well, okay, this is kind of one reasonable data set, but I'm going to need to do it four or five times. And that's going to mean three. Four or five times, and that's going to mean three kilometers of swimming, which I wasn't really feeling up to early in the morning without any breakfast. And even more disturbingly, as I kind of got close to the boy, I suddenly found myself swimming amongst a shoal of stinging jellyfish actually along the route as well. Actually, so kind of swimming with your eyes closed in deep, in strong currents, deep water and jellyfish-infested water early in the Infested water early in the morning without anybody around. I was rightly told often by my family for being an idiot, basically. So I decided to be a little bit less ambitious with my route, choose something closer to the shore. And this was my controlled swim. So I kept my eyes open the whole way. And naturally, as you would expect, I was able to keep plot a relatively straight course. There was inevitably some pushing off over this through the The kind of currents, etc. But effectively, it was very, very straight towards the target. The moment I closed my eyes, though, things got a lot worse. My first one was about took me 114 meters and several times I was completely pushed off the right direction. And I was trying to kind of recall the direction, but you can clearly see it was very far off. I did another one. Far off. I did another one, and similarly, I was a long way off. And I did another one, I got a little bit better. But however many tries I tried, my best attempt was still around 15%, was at best 15% worse than my optical performance. So my bit, the moment I took away that navigation information, as you would expect, my navigating performance dropped a lot. So how could I have done better? And well, Better. And well, if I'd had somebody on the land telling me which way to swim, then I think I could have done a lot better. But my wife wasn't prepared to get up at seven o'clock in order to direct me in this sort of endeavor. But I think it's fair to say that if I had kind of more information from other individuals trying to get to the same target, whether or not those are kind of other animals, or in the case of cells, then Case of cells, then you can potentially get the benefits of the group. Okay, so for the rest of the talk, I'm going to talk about models. And I'm actually not going to get through all of these, actually. So, but potentially, we've been looking at kind of models with three levels of population structuring, uniform population. So, that's where the population is completely homogeneous. And that's what I'm going to look at. Completely homogeneous, and that's what I'm going to look at first using a fully discrete approach. Binary populations where you have a division into leaders and followers, and that's what I call part two. And there we kind of use the mixed, discrete, and continuous approach. And finally, of course, you could actually have a completely continuous structuring of your population where they're kind of spread out across a whole spectrum of phenotypes. And that's potentially part three. Potentially part three. But as I say, these are all kind of slightly different amounts. I don't think I'm going to get through all three of them. So I'm going to do half of the talk to start with on the uniform case. And then I'll probably just do either two or three as the second part of today's course, today's talk. But those are to say the kind of three types of models that we're kind of looking at in this sort of case. So the first part, as I say, is the benefits that we're The benefits that we're looking at the benefits of collective navigation in heterogeneous information landscapes, and here we're going to consider a completely homogeneous population. So basically here, the kind of the theory here is that the navigation is improved through what we call the many wrong principles. So, you know, you know, just by simply you get better certainty by kind of looking at what you're At what your kind of fellow navigators are trying to do. And this is work with Stuart Johnston. And in fact, actually, the paper has actually just appeared today, actually. So it's in Royal Society interface and came out earlier today. So what's our kind of modeling approach here? Well, we're using a completely discrete model and we're describing movement as a velocity jump random walk. A lot of people here. Jump random walk, and a lot of people here will be talking about similar sort of models, and they're very well known in the community. They basically describe your movement path as a sequence of runs and tumbles. And we're going to set it up in a very simple way where we kind of just assume that the tumbling probability is Poisson with some constant turning rate mu. The tumbling is quasi-instantaneous, the speed is constant, and the new direction is independent of the previous direction. Is independent of the previous direction. And these are all obviously, you know, quite major simplifications, and they can all be relaxed, though, if you really want. But the reason for restricting it in that way is it basically allows us to just encode all of the navigational information in the new directional choice you make when you make a turn. And basically, we assume that at a turn, your individual selects a Selects a new direction according to a von Mises distribution. And the von Mises distribution is effectively a normal type distribution on a circle. So it's characterized by two key parameters, a concentration parameter, which is this certainty of choosing a particular direction encoded in the location parameter. So that's kind of the, so then the key question is, is how do we choose that kappa and Choose that kappa and phi, those parameters for this von Mises distribution. Well, we're looking at collective navigation, but we're also assuming that the individuals have some access to some inherent information, the navigating cues that they're following. So we assume an individual at some position X senses the inherent information. And you could actually put in specific data for that if you wanted. Specific data for that, if you wanted, you could kind of have them navigating according to the magnetic field. We're going to do something a little bit more generic here and just assume that there's some background navigation field that I said earlier, which is pointing towards the target, but could be varying in strength. So effectively, the kind of the degree of certainty that the individual will have across that sort of spatial field. And that gives kind of, you know, kind of two parameters, call them Capricorn. Kind of two parameters, call them Kappa inherent and phi inherent according to the kind of the strength that they get from this sort of inherent information. That's kind of the inherent part, but then they're also sensing the group as well. We want our individuals to perceive and or communicate with neighbours across some perceptual range R. So basically, in this sort of case here, the individual. In this sort of case, here the individual kind of either looks around or senses from its surrounding space other individuals. It's able to somehow perceive the direction in which they're moving. And based on that, that kind of gives it a navigation based on this sort of group information by kind of looking at this, looking at the headings of its neighbours. Neighbors. So, how do we do that precisely? Well, it's logical to suppose that the kind of the certainty of that group or the uncertainty of that group information is going to vary with various factors. And it would be quite natural to suppose that if you look around and you see all of your individuals kind of pointing in different direction, that's going to make. Different direction, that's going to make you quite uncertain. You know, if nobody's okay, if nobody looks like they know which way to go, then that's not going to improve your certainty at all. On the other hand, if everybody is kind of going in a common direction, then that's going to make you quite certain of a directional choice. So you can kind of view this as being, you know, as being basically kind of taking those sort of directions and kind of taking a von Mises. Are taking a von Mises distribution corresponding to that, and that kind of case where they've got a broad range of headings is going to give you a lot of uncertainty. That case where you have tightly clustered headings is going to give you a lot of certainty. So we would expect commonality of headings to reduce the uncertainty in your collective, your group information. But you would also expect the number of observations also to reduce the uncertainty. If you only rely on one or two If you only rely on one or two individuals, as in this sort of case here, then that's not going to give you a lot of certainty. Whereas if you've got a lot of neighbours to base your information off, then that should give you a reasonably strong certainty. So effectively, what we do in order to calculate what we call the Kappa collective and the Phi collective, the von Mises distributions corresponding to collective information, is To collective information, is we take all of the headings in some surrounding region and then we infer these parameters by maximum likelihood estimation. And we don't really say that these kind of animals are actually doing the maximum likelihood estimation. It's really just a way of kind of trying to take this uncertainty in terms of the group behavior and translate that into the model. Model. So the model, as I say, is kind of composed of it's kind of basically kind of involves creating this von Mises distribution for a directional choice. And two pieces come into that, the inherent information and the group information. And of course, you can weight them in different sort of ways, but we generally choose alpha is equal to a half just to weight those equally. That's the kind of the basis of the model. And as a kind of a as a kind of a basic sort of setting here, we kind of looked at the Sort of setting here, we kind of looked at the problem of just simply hitting a target, setting a certain number of individuals in some region some distance from the target and basically allowing them to navigate through a variety of different inherent information sort of fields and then also use different amounts of group information through changing the perceptual range, this kind of this region over space over. Region over space over which they are perceiving their fellow group navigators. So we basically vary those two sort of parameters. And I won't go through all of the results. I'll just go through a few key ones. And the first one was that we noticed that there was actually a bimodal behavior. And this is kind of echoing sort of similar results by Codeling and others a few years ago. A few years ago, in the sense that when you get the kind of black dotted line here, shows the kind of navigational performance of effectively individual navigation. We've set R to be equal to zero, so we effectively remove any possibility of collective navigation there. When you choose a small range, you actually get worse navigational performance and And navigation only starts to improve as the perception range goes above some critical value. And this is effectively down to this kind of uncertainty issues, is that when you have too few neighbors, it actually has the effect of increasing the uncertainty. Because those individuals may be choosing a slightly different course, you become slightly less certain of the route and your navigation actually gets. And your navigation actually gets worse, and you need a kind of a certain number of neighbors to actually get better navigation as a result. And we found this phenomenon across quite a wide variety of fields. So for kind of decreasing fields, increasing fields, constant information fields of different strengths. Sometimes it will be slightly stronger as an effect, sometimes worse, but it always seemed to be there. So our kind of first kind of sort of observation was this kind of bimodal behavior. Of bimodal behavior. Now, the type of field where we didn't find that, though, was for trying to get through a void. And this kind of relates back to my kind of problem earlier of seeing what happens, how you can kind of improve your navigation when your the information you have available is massively reduced. We kind of set up a kind of case there where our kind of individuals had to find their way through some sort of dark patch. Sort of dark patch of very negligible navigation information. And in that situation, any amount of collective navigation was found to be beneficial to performance. And we found that also for other sort of void fields when the void region was relatively large compared to the perceptual range. So as I say, when in a kind of a lot of fields, then you have this. Fields, then you have this kind of bimodal phenomena where the group, the benefits of the group, actually only really kind of start to appear once you have sufficient numbers of neighbors to kind of rely on. But when it kind of comes to navigating through a void, then any amount of group navigation appears to be beneficial. And we investigated this phenomenon further. We kind of investigated for kind of different signs. Investigated for kind of different size void spaces and you know different amounts of ranges, and even when the perceptual range was much much smaller than the void region, you were still getting improved navigation through the group communication. And the reason for this is really quite sort of logical, because if you have a kind of a set of individuals trying to get to the goal, and some of them have gone into this sort of void space. Gone into this sort of void space. Well, if we have this kind of individual here, then it kind of looks around and it can kind of pick out an individual that is in a good region where there's good navigational information. And that, of course, allows it to, that kind of individual passes information to that one, that allows it to kind of get towards the target. So that kind of information is passed to that individual. Parts of that individual. But even if you are right in the middle of the void and the only individuals that you can see are also in the void, you still get a benefit because, of course, even though you're not seeing any individuals that are outside the void, some of those individuals will be doing so. So in that case, you're seeing other individuals and you get a kind of a relay of information from outside the void into the deepest sort of region. Into the deepest sort of regions. And this kind of put me a bit into mind, this kind of childhood game of passing a message across a group. And of course, that message gets kind of degraded the further along the line you get. But there is always still a little bit of that information within that. So information still gets really relayed deep into the void as a result. So those are kind of the more theoretical. So, those are kind of the more theoretical study. But where did we want to kind of take this? Well, where we're kind of now applying this is to look at the impact of human noise pollution on navigation in marine environments. And the marine environment has never been a quiet place. So, if you kind of put some sort of sound meter into the wind, you hear a lot of noise. Meter into the wind, you hear a lot of noise, and that's because sound propagates a lot in the inner water environment. You get kind of the sound from wind, from rain, kind of is heard in the water. The sound of seismic activity propagates through ice breaking. And of course, a lot of marine animals also make a lot of noise. But this kind of noisy environment of the ocean has been hugely compounded over the last decades due to basically. Due to basically ship traffic, drilling, construction projects, et cetera, et cetera. And that's contributed to a large rise in the amount of noise pollution. And it's not uncommon to find sort of regions where the noise has risen by 20 decibels or more over the kind of the so-called pristine marine environment level. Marine environment level. And 20 decibels is kind of like going from something like the sound of a kind of an air conditioner to a lawnmower. So it's a huge increase in noise. And as you can probably expect, a lot of this has poses a lot of problems for animals that rely on sound communication. And marine animals, because sound propagates in water very, very well. In water, very, very well. Marine animals have, in particular, developed very sophisticated means of auditory communication. And whales are, of course, a very well-known example of that. A lot of whales use complex whale song to transmit information. And at the very extreme end of this, the blue whales are estimated to be audible to each other at a distance of around a thousand. A distance of around a thousand to two thousand kilometers apart, and a lot of you will know that I used to be in Edinburgh. I recently moved to Turin, but to give you a sense of that scale, I could still speak to my former colleagues and students from Turin to Edinburgh if I had that sort of length of communication. But when you add in a lot of the noise pollution, that can lead to a That can lead to a massively reduced communication range. And 500 kilometers may still sound a lot, but if you're a blue whale of, which are fairly, there's not many blue whales around, and they live out in a very, very large, wide open space. And for example, you're trying to find a mate, then a drop of a thousand to two thousand kilometers just down to a few hundred kilometers is really going to limit your ability. Is it really going to limit your ability to find that mate? So, we're trying to look at this sort of problem. And in particular, we're focusing on the mink whales, which are the smallest of the bleen whales. And we're focusing on those because they are the most common whale in the waters around the North Sea and Northeast Atlantic. And that happens to be a particularly noisy environment because across that region, you have a huge amount of shipping traffic and you have a huge amount of... And you have a huge amount of drilling and construction. So it's a severely degraded noise environment. And studies have been done on the impact of noise on mink well communication. And in a kind of a relatively pristine environment, they have 115 kilometers, an estimated 115 kilometers of an audible range. But when you have a 20 decibel rise, it's estimated to reduce just down. It's estimated to reduce just down to around 19 kilometers. So, again, to give you a sense of the scale of these sort of figures, 115 kilometers, a population of just 15 or 16 could pretty well remain in communication across this entire large track of the North Sea here. But if you take that down to 19 kilometers, it just covers a very small area. And moreover, I should also say, it's not just about that they have less of a range, the information. Of a range, the information as well tends to be poorer as a result. So, we've kind of been started to kind of do some studies then looking at kind of whale migration in these sort of environments and just seeing the effect that noise is having on their ability to do kind of migrations. And, you know, as they say, we've kind of got these doing these kind of same sort of studies as before, and as you would expect. As before. And as you would expect, what happens is that when you kind of go into a polluted environment, you have an increase in your migration time. And it turns out to be around kind of 15, you know, 10, 15% for our experiments, which may not sound too much. But of course, this has potentially very vast energetic costs. You know, whales need to consume a huge amount of plankton or whatever their diet is. Or whatever their diet is, and any increase in the efforts that they are spent on migrating, of course, reduces the amount of time that they have to look for food sources. And of course, it also means that they then need to replenish more. So we're now kind of taking this and now starting to kind of build this into a more sophisticated model, bringing in things like ocean currents, sound maps, behavioural response. Sound maps, behavioural responses, et cetera. And the eventual target here is to see whether or not potentially there are kind of more optimal shipping routes, for example, that could be chosen that may have a lower impact on the migration sort of paths. That was kind of the first part of the talk. And as I say, I'll probably only have time for the second part, which is looking at now a kind of a Looking at now, a kind of a binary population system where we have followers and leaders. And this is work with Sara Bernardi from the Politecnico de Tirino and Veluca Ftimi, so from Université di Frangecomte. And when I kind of say work with, what this actually means is that actually Sara has been the one that's done all of the hard work here and Veluka and myself have really just been kind of putting it together. Really, just been kind of putting it together, actually. So, it's very much down to the work that Sara has been doing on this project. So, we're now going to kind of look at kind of a follower leader system where you've got where your population is divided into sub-populations with access to different amounts of root information. And we're particularly going to look at kind of an extreme case where we have naive followers and knowledgeable leaders. And a nice example of this is where I was in. Example of this is where I was in, kind of, I was visiting kind of southern Tuscany, the area around Orbatello last sort of January, and it's the wintering area for a reintroduction project where they are trying to reintroduce the northern bald ibis, also known as the waldra ibis. And it used to be, it used to be, it used to be a kind of a regular population in Europe. Regular population in Europe, but has disappeared for the last three or four hundred years, basically. So it's being reintroduced after a 300-year gaps. And the ball dibris does a migration and their kind of traditional routes was to kind of migrate from southern regions to regions here up in sort of southern Germany for their breeding sort of area. And of course, the problem is that there's not many 300 or 400-year-old ibises around. 400-year-old ibises around that know the path. So, how do they teach these ibises where to go? So, here's a short video of the project, and the ibises are here. They use microlights effectively, and the microlights take off. The birds have been trained to follow the microlights. To follow the microlite, and in this way, they are hoping to reteach these migration paths to this population so they can re-establish these migration routes that haven't been followed for now three or 400 years. And of course, here we've got kind of a very sort of we've got kind of completely naive birds that know nothing about the migration path and individuals, the micro. Path and individuals, the microlight effectively that has complete information. And another nice example of this, which is particularly our motivation, is in bee swarming. So when bee swarms need to find a new nest site, there's a kind of a democratic process where a certain sub-population of bees, what are called scout bees, will start scouring the environment to find the environment. The environment to find a new potential nest site. Through this democratic process, they kind of come to a consensus on the eventual target, and then they take the rest of the swarm, including the crucial queen bee, to the new nest site. Here you've got, again, a case of a kind of a bimodal system where you only have a small sub-population, some 5% or so of the population. Some 5% or so of the population that knows the target. And they have to find some way to guide the others to that target and critically not lose the queen bee on the way. So the question is, therefore, how are these knowledgeable scouts able to herd the naive followers to the target? So when you look at sort of bee swarms, you can kind of get some potential ideas for how that may happen. Because if you look sort of side on, well, this has been known for sort of several decades, it turns out For sort of several decades, it turns out that there's certain individuals that are flying over the top of the swarm in a very sort of fast way. This kind of streaking behavior. You see them kind of flying at the top fast, and it is target direct. They're target directed streaks. They're fast and they're also conspicuous because the bees below can sort of potentially see these fast streaks above them. And these are believed. Them. These are believed to be the scout bees that are passing on this information. So, the question is: whether or not these kinds of target-directed, fast, and conspicuous beaks can be sufficient for guidance. We've set up a continuous model to do this, and it's continuous non-local hyperbolic PDE model, which has basically been developed from one of Luca's earlier models in this sort of area, where we've extended it to two populations, the followers and the leaders. Populations, the followers and the leaders, and they're further subdivided into right and left directed move components. They're either moving right or left, and the followers are moving with speed gamma right or left. And they can also change directions. They can switch from right to left or from left to right. And the equations for this are in the form of a hyperbolic PDE, some sort of movement term, and the switching in terms of from right to left or left to right. Terms are from right to left or left to right are in these right-hand terms. And we say we assume a similar set of equations for the leaders, but we allow them also to potentially have different speeds. But again, they have potentially different speeds, but they can move in a right or left direction, and there's some sort of switching between those two. And the key modeling here is then how to choose these kind of turning rates, this kind of swishing sort of behaviour. And that's where we bring in group interactions. Bringing group interactions. We assume those have the form of kind of basically some smooth function that goes from a low turning rate to a high turning rate, but it depends on a control area that builds in propulsion, attraction, and alignment interactions. And basically, this is a kind of a common sort of assumption in models for collective animal movement, where a kind of an individual will basically look over kind of a short region. Of a short region, and over a short region, it tends to move away from those kind of neighbors that are located nearby. There's your kind of repulsion sort of response over a short range. In the middle range, it chooses a kind of an alignment. So in that range, it will kind of tend to align. And then over a longer range, it has a kind of an attraction sort of response. So it's attracted to those that are kind of long-waisted. And as I say, this kind of this kind of And as I say, this kind of splitting into splitting into kind of attraction, alignment, and repulsion over different sort of ranges has been used in a lot of models for collective animal movement. So we kind of put we're putting this into the model. But of course, there's a lot of ways that we could do this. So we're going to try and keep it, keep the kind of the number of variations as simple as possible. And for the attraction and repulsion, we assume they're really there just to kind of keep contact. So there's the attraction. Keep contact, so there's the attraction, and to avoid collisions. And we are going to assume those are identical for both leaders and followers. And I probably won't have time to go through the details of actually the equations that we do this, but we choose kind of non-local interaction terms that basically kind of look over the surrounding region and describe this either attraction over a longer range or repulsion over a short range type behavior. And that's kind of informs then this, that then substitutes. Then, this that then subsequently informs the switching behavior. The attraction and repulsion we keep the same for leaders and followers, and it's alignment where we allow things to differ. And there's two potential alignment information sources. You have the information provided by your neighbours. That's kind of going back to the pre like in the previous model where you where you kind of look around you and you look at what direction your neighbours are going in and you use that information. And you use that information. Or, of course, there's the information of the target direction as well. So you've got those two potential sources. And we assume that the followers, well, we're taking our kind of inspiration from the bees, but they have no idea where the target is. They can only rely on their neighbor directions. And they just kind of look around them and look at their, you know, they could be other kind of, they could be other followers or they could be other leaders, but they simply align towards their, according to their neighbor behaviour. According to their neighbour behaviour. We set up kind of an appropriate way to model that. Leaders, on the other hand, we assume they know the target and therefore they completely ignore the neighbour directions and just align biased in the direction of the target. So that's kind of what we kind of assume in the model. And we then try to look at the effect of different types of bias, different ways that the leaders could try and Ways that the leaders could try and influence the followers. And one was to assume that the leaders simply biased their movement towards the target. So I said those streaks were target directed. So we kind of have a parameter epsilon here that kind of describes the strength of this kind of tendency to move towards the target. We have what we call a conspicuousness bias, which is basically just how kind of obvious the followers, sorry. Yes, the followers, sorry, the leaders are to the followers. So potentially, the leaders could have a much stronger influence on the alignment of the followers. And that's, as I say, for the bees, when they're, you know, because they're doing this on the top of the swarm, they are potentially more conspicuous by choosing that location. And we could also have a speed bias as well, that leaders are faster when moving towards the target. The target. So we have those three types of bias. And when you kind of start to run the model, well, our first case was just to see what happens when you exclude all biases and actually start your population completely uniformly distributed. So followers and leaders are completely uniformly dispersed. And you can get a pattern formation phenomena where it forms into a kind of a collective structure composed. Structure composed of leaders and followers. But here, leaders are leaders only in name because there's no bias in there. So those remain completely stationary in space. There's no movement of those because there's no bias towards the target in this instance. So that's kind of when you exclude any biases. The moment you kind of put in a bias, then you again get the group formation. And now, well, as you would probably hope, the Um, probably hope the group starts to move in the direction of the target, but it does it according to the various biases and the parameters, it does it with different sort of strengths. So, we wanted to investigate this more carefully, because in particular, we found some situations which were quite ambiguous as to whether or not it was providing coherent information towards the target. So, we kind of consider kind of more kind of where we kind of clustered them all to start with. Of clustered them all to start with and look to see sort of what sort of behavior it is. And indeed, for quite large regions of parameter space, you get swarms that form and move towards the target. But moreover, you actually get kind of different types of structuring of your population. In certain cases, for certain parameter regimes, you get a kind of a lead from the front where the leaders adopt the position at the front of the swarm. Adopt the position at the front of the swarm and pull the followers towards the target. In other cases, it may be reversed. The leaders actually take a position at the back of the group with the followers at the front, a kind of a lead from the rear type situation. So you could get different sorts of structuring of your leaders and followers according to where you were positioned in the parameter space. And moreover, we also found that even when we were including biases towards Biases towards the target, you could get failed coherent movement. And one example of this happens here when you have a large variation in speeds. You start to get something that's happening, but after a while, the leaders are too fast and they split away from the followers and accelerate off. We've done these simulations on periodic domains. So, actually, the leaders eventually. So, actually, the leaders eventually re-catch up with the group and kind of then pull it further. But if this is on a large infinite domain, effectively it would lose those followers behind. And that would, of course, be disastrous for something like the bees, because that could lead to the queen being lost. And you also, and I don't yet have a really coherent explanation for this, you can even get, when you include a bias towards the target, you can Bias towards the target, you can get a counterintuitive result of a swarm that actually moves in the wrong direction. It moves away from the target, even though you're including biases towards the target. And we think that this is very much down to the fact that you've not just got this kind of alignment sort of thing, you've also got this kind of attraction and repulsion behaviour going in there. And the kind of the interaction between those can lead to this kind of wrong movement. Movement. So for the follower leader systems, we, as I say, we get regions of the parameter space where successful swarms, but various types of unsuccessful swarms as well. And a kind of a next stage here would be naturally to try and kind of more coherently understand that. To summarize this, and this is really pretty well my last slide, in these follower leader systems, you know, we've kind of looked and looking at kind of Looked and you know, looking at kind of the you know, we've shown that kind of speed and influence modulation or simply moving towards target can all generate successful guidance in these kind of by these follower leader systems, but only to a point. And certain parameter regions can lead to certain failure scenarios. We've found actually that according to the parameters, again, you can either get kind of push or pull type forms where the leaders are either at the front leading or kind of leading from the rear, as it were, or something. Were or something, and what we would really like to do, I think, here now is kind of much better characterization of the successful parameter regime, but also kind of take this towards other applications. And in particular, you know, I think it's actually natural kind of framework also for looking at follower-lead behavior in cellular systems. And that kind of puts me in mind the neural crest sort of type behavior talked about by Philip and Paul earlier this sort of week. So, I won't, as I say, I won't be able to kind of I won't, as I say, I won't be able to kind of talk about kind of part three of the talk. I didn't expect to be able to get through that. That's kind of work with Tommaso Lorenzo, where we're now looking at kind of a whole continuous phenotypes and kind of looking at kind of movements in those sort of cases. So I just kind of go to my kind of summary sort of slide here, but it's really just saying everything that I've said there. So I'll just simply go to the say thanks to everybody for listening and kind of point out these kind of two. And kind of point out these kind of two things that I've talked about today: this kind of work with Stuart Johnston that just appeared today in the Royal Society of Influence, and this work with Sara Bernardi and Veluka Eftimi that was in Bulletin Mathematical Biology earlier this year. So thank you very much for your time. Thank you very much, Kevin. Very, very nice. Very interesting talk. Would have been fun to continue our experiments on the beaches of Mexico. On the beaches of Mexico. So we should try to do that at some point. Yeah, I'd want to check what sort of point, what sort of poisonous jellyfish were there before doing that. Another comment, you're leading from the back. This reminded me of what Hans told me many years ago when we talked about supervising students and postdocs. So he told me that he likes to supervise from the back. So let them go ahead, explore, and then just be a little bit in the background. Just be a little bit in the background and steer them to success. Really cool. So I invite questions, comments. Maybe Hans, you want to respond? I have a comment on your comment. I think the precise thing that I said was that I like to watch students from the rear, but that some of them have to be led. Anyway, a question for Kevin. So is the failure of choosing the right direction a function? You're of choosing the right direction, a function of the initial data. I mean, if you choose to know data, no, we have checked that actually. So it's because, you know, whether or not you kind of, you know, we tried sort of setting up them first as a kind of a, you know, a kind of a kind of already coordinated sort of group like that, put them in different positions within that, but they still kind of reconfigure into a form that then kind of goes against it. So it simply seems Of goes against it, so it simply seems to be the particular balance of the various interactions of the model at that point. So, and I don't yet have a really coherent explanation for how this is happening. But of course, even though the leaders are being biased towards the target and they're not following the alignment of the followers or the other individuals, they are still influenced by the attraction and repulsion behaviors. So I think, you know, those must be kind of coming into play in those sort of scenarios. But I don't yet really have kind of a full understanding of that. I'd like to do a kind of a more coherent understanding of the parameter space where that happens too. Now, in regard to the bee swarms, you said at the outset that the leaders are going much faster, but then your computations showed that if they go too fast, they lose the flock. I mean, how. Who's the fuck? I mean, where is the balance? Yeah, so I mean, again, I mean, that one I think is kind of much more logical sort of assumption because, of course, we don't give any individual individuals any capacity to change their sort of velocities in this sort of case here. And effectively, in this situation, they just kind of pull themselves too far away from the group in order for that kind of. From the group, in order for that kind of attraction to re-exert its sort of effect, basically. So I think, you know, there's a kind of a slightly more logical explanation for why that sort of behaviour is going on. So modulating the leader's speed according to the followers could correctly. Yeah, so if they were, if they were, I mean, so I think, you know, as I say, as they kind of get towards the front of the group, they're going to start, they start to perceive that they're at that sort of leading edge. That they're at that sort of leading edge at that point, and they could then change their behavior accordingly. But I mean, I don't know. I mean, nobody's really kind of gone into a beast swarm and labelled particular individuals. So it's not, you know, it's not clear whether or not some of the scouts do end up getting lost in this sort of process that they just move too far away from the swarm and don't find their way back. So thanks. Other questions for Kevin? Other questions for Kevin? So, Kevin, I was wondering this morning in Helen's and Thomas's talk, we heard about
