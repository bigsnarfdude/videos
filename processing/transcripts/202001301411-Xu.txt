Okay, I want to thank the organizers for uh uh inviting me here to this beautiful place and actually uh no they said the recording in progress. Okay, so again it's gonna yeah. So normally in a conference I probably will be the one that gives the uh most theoretical talk, but actually I feel in this conference though I mean it's the other way around. So I mean, it's the other way around. So, I will mention some experimental systems, some systems which realize something called value chain insulator. That's also, well, I mean, after that, I will talk about something more theoretical, avoidable quantum critical points. So, actually, a lot of this talk is based on some understanding of interacting topological insulator and how the interaction affects the classification of topological insulator. Of top loading insulator. Then, after that, I will introduce what do I mean by avoidable quantum critical point. And then I will talk about the interacting body chain insulator realizing normal array systems and also some three-dimensional examples. So here are my collaborators, Chao Ming, who was a KIDB and Sketching Q postdoctor. Now he's going to join a Cornell as faculty position. And also Xiao Chuan and Yi Chen are my students. Okay, so this is a very simple classical. So, this is a very simple classical phase diagram. This is the icing system, it's a system with a Z2 symmetry. So, we have a high-temperature disorder phase and a low-temperature order phase. So, this pointer is not working. Yeah, wait. Well, anyway, so the high temperature disorder phase and low temperature order phase, they are always separated by a phase transition. So normally actually there is a second order phase transition, which is the 3D Ising, Wilson-Fischer kind of phase transition. But actually by tuning the system, tuning the lattice model, for example, we can actually drive the phase transition into a first order phase transition. It corresponds to turning this 5-4 term to be negative. But actually, then there's a multi-code equivalent in between. Marta could equal in between. But actually, the point I want to make is that there's no way to actually avoid this phase transition between disordered phase and ordered phase. So it means that there will always be some singularity in the free energy and other thermodynamical quantities if I want to drive the system from this end to this end. There's no way to avoid it. The best we can do is to drive a second-order transition into a first-order phase transition. But actually, we know that in quantum system, a lot of That in quantum system, a lot of this integration in a classical phase diagram actually are no longer true, since actually in quantum phase diagram, we have a direct product disorder state, and we also have a topological disorder state. We have certain different kinds of order phases. So all of them can have some generic second-order phase transition between them. But only this red line, only this red line is a principal anal kind of for semi-classical phase transition. So all the other lines. Semi-classical phase transition. So all the other lines must be beyond Gene-Spadanda kind of phase transition. So for example, topological to direct polar phase transition can be described by the transients matter field, which condenses a matter field coupled to a gauge field with transients terms, and means that it turns out we hick the gauge field, we destroy the problematic order, then we go to a trivial disordered phase. And then the order order state to disorder, I mean sorry, the direct phase transition between the two order phase can be this deconfection. Can be the deconfinal criticality, which Faker talked about. And also, top lord state to order state, this transition also has to be non-trivial. So only it's a red line is a transport lambda kind of phase transition. Actually, there's something which actually was not paid much attention to, but later it was pointed out that in quantum system there could be another kind of situation, which actually in classical system does not happen, is that there's an avoidable quantum group point, which means that Which means that A and B, these are two points in the phase diagram, and they are separated by a phase transition. But around this phase transition, all the perturbations are not asymmetry. They are actually irrelevant. So it means that all the RG flow will flow towards this critical point. But suppose we deviate the system far enough, we're going to see that actually A and B can be adiabatically connected through a large enough deformation of the Hamiltonian without Deformation of the Hamiltonian without closing the gap, without any singularity in the ground state energy, without any singularity of any kind of thermodynamic quantities. Okay, so this will point out. I mean, this actually also cannot happen in the classical system. So actually, I want to... What's the argument that cannot happen from lessons? Well, it's an argument based on what Jinson. I mean, basically, we understand Jinx-Lana theory. You know, we cannot think of it like that. Yeah, so usually I want to make an analogy with this kind of warm hole kind of picture. So that means that without warm hole, actually A and B, they have to separate by, I mean, they have to go through a very, very long route, which means that they have to separate by a phase transition. But once we have warm hole, actually they can tunnel with each other, okay, without closing the gap, without closing any gap. Okay, so actually, so well, I mean, this example, actually, well, I shouldn't have Well, I mean, this example actually, well, I shouldn't say this example is actually new because actually it was known, but actually was not paid attention to. So this actually, this example, I mean, this kind of quantum critical example was actually closely related to another feature phenomenon, which is called an interaction-reduced or interaction-collapse classification of topological integrator. So, let me briefly review that. So, let's first consider a one-dimensional kit half-chain. We say Dimensional Kinap chain with a time reversal symmetry. So we know that based on the renowned tenfold wave classification, we know that this kind of Kinap chain has a Z classification. So the easiest way to understand the Z classification is that actually we can see the N copies of the Kitab chain with time-inversal symmetry. Then at the boundary of each chain is a Marina Fermi zero mode. And Tami and Brussels symmetry act on the Kitab chain like this. So as the boundary zero mode, time-inversal will take like a Marina zero mode to it. We'll take like a minor zero mode to itself. Okay, so the minor format zero mode operator does not change at all. But actually, then you can realize that any Hermitian operator you can construct based on this Marona zero mode, actually, so any of this Hermitian operator must break time-inversal symmetry. So this means that suppose I want to preserve time-inversal symmetry, there's no Hamiltonian I can write down, which actually is a free format, which means that it's actually quadratic in terms of my own format zero law. In terms of my Roman zero law. So, if I want to make sure there's a free formula Hamiltonian and I preserve the time and Bristol symmetry, there's no Hamiltonian I can write down, which preserves the time and brittle symmetry as the boundary of the system. So, this means that no matter how many copies of the ketaph chain I stack together, the boundary will always be a non-trivial. We'll always have a merriment zero mode, which will give us a degenerated ground state. For example, this Hamiltonian will break time and brush the symmetry because time and brussels will rotate i to minus i. i to minus i. But actually, as supposed to be allowed to turn on interaction, the situation will be very different. So for example, if I consider, I mean, if we allow turning on a four-ferm interaction, the situation is different in the sense that for four kidap chain, as the boundary, there is an interaction term, which we can write out, which looks like this. Okay, it's a gamma 1, gamma 2, gamma 3, gamma 4. This is a term allowed by time-inversal symmetry. It's a Hermitian, but the ground state is still non-trivial in the sense that actually we can just, you know. sense that actually we can just you know we can do the group this is 1 2 3 4 into two groups so i gamma 1 gamma 2 is the qubit i gamma 3 gamma 4 is another qubit and actually in the end the harmonic just become this actually so now we can see that no matter what what sign we take k the ground state will always be two-fold generate so for example suppose k is positive the ground state will be either sorry sorry ground state will be up up or down down okay suppose k is actually negative the ground state will be up down or And the ground state will be up, down, or down, up, okay, depending on the sign of this sigma matrix. Okay, so the ground state will still be two-fold degenerate, so it means that we still have a non-dead about, but the boundary is degenerate. Okay, so this is n equals 4. But for n equals 8, it turns out the situation is actually completely different because actually for n equals 8, naively we can just regroup the system into 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, 6, 7, 8. And as I said before, if I turn on the four-fermint interaction, I can give interaction I can give, so I can make these four my zero node a doublet, and I can make these four my zero node a doublet, and then we turn on a new term which is s1 dot s2. So now this actually this Hamiltonian will give us a fully gapped and a non-generate ground state. So it means that now with eight copies of K dots chain, I can design a Hamiltonian. Okay, I can design a Hamiltonian, make the boundary symmetric, non-degenerate, and also gap. So this means that now Yeah, so this means that now, for eight copies, the kickoff chain, the system becomes trivialized by interaction. Okay, become trivialized by interaction. So this is the first example given by Finikovsky and also Kenaev, which shows that interaction can indeed change the classification of topologic insulator or topological superconductor. It reduces classification from Z to Z8. Okay. So then after that, So then after that, many more examples were actually explored. So for example, this is the fermious example in 3 plus 1 dimension. It's called a helium 3, helium 3 B phase. It's a reduction of the classification from Z to actually Z16, from Z to Z16. The argument is as follows. So actually, the three-dimensional tabloid superconductor of helium-3B in the bulb is described by a 3 plus 1 dimension massive Marina formula. The boundary is described by Fermium. The boundary rate is described by two plus one-dimensional mass list, Mai-Wano formula. And actually, the mass term is forbidden by the time and brush symmetry. But here is a different time symmetry to go t squared equal to minus one. Okay, so actually, so here, actually, the way to, I mean, there are many different ways. Okay, so first of all, strongly interacting direct format or marina format in two plus one dimension or three plus one dimension is very difficult. So actually, I mean, we can only rely on some argument how this works. So basically, How this works. So basically, the argument goes like this. So basically, we can, first of all, we can partially break some of the symmetries. We consider like two copies of a hidden 3B, and then the boundary will be two copies of the Hidden, I mean, will be two copies of two plus one-dimensional variant formula. Then there's an O2 symmetry. There's an emergent O2 symmetry. Then we can spontaneously break the O2 symmetry by condensing a Cooper pair, by condensing an O2 vector phi. Okay, then we can show that actually. Okay, then we can show that actually there's a residue time inversal symmetry T, which corresponds to an ordinary time inversal T and also a pi rotation within this O2. Then actually there's a residue time inverse symmetry which actually the T square equals to 1 and one can show that as the vortex core there will be a Marina zero mode and this Marina zero mode will transform in the same way as the boundary state of the ketime chain under the residue time reversal symmetry. Okay, so this means that suppose we have 16 copies of a system. If you have 16 16 copies of the system. If you have 16 copies of the system, then as the vortex core, there will be 8 copies of a minor 0 mode. And because this minor 0 mode transforms in the same way as the boundary of the Kitab chain, then we know that there is a symmetry allowed for Format interaction term, which actually make the vortex core completely gapped and non-generate. So this means that in this case, suppose I condense the vortex to restore all the symmetries, I can, in general, I mean I can. Symmetries, I can, in general, I mean, I can, in principle, get a free gap and a non-general boundary state without breaking any symmetry. Okay, so this is the argument, one of the arguments, there are many other arguments, but this is one of the arguments why the boundary of the 16 column, the K and 3B, can be driven into a fully gap and a non-general boundary state without breaking any symmetry by interaction. Okay, so knowing this, this means that actually for 16 carbon helium 3B, for 16 carbon helium 3B, the topological Topahelian 3B, the topological trivial phase and actually topological non-trivial phase, mean without any interaction, they are different phases. Okay, there are different topological phases. So that means that we have to, by tuning some parameter in the bulk, there must be a phase transition between the helium 3B phase and the trivial topological superconducting phase and also trivial superconducting phase. However, we know that short-range interaction is actually irrelevant perturbation. It's an irrelevant perturbation. Perturbation is an irrelevant perturbation perturbation of the three plus one dimensional massless Marina formula or mass direct formula. So this means that short-range interaction will only flow to zero around this critical point, okay, around this critical point. But we also know that under strong enough interaction, these two ends actually belong to the same phase. So this means that with a strong enough perturbation, with strong enough deformation of the Hamiltonian, we can actually connect this side and this side without a phase transition. Okay, so that means that this phase. Double phase transition. Okay, so that means that this phase, I mean, this critical point is actually a generic phase transition because it's stable against the weak perturbation, but it's also avoidable. We can avoid it with a strong enough deformation. Okay, we can avoid it with a strong enough deformation. But actually, all the previously known examples, the classification of in I mean the classification of topological insulator, topological superconductor on the interaction is always reduced to Z8 or Z16 or Z32, depending on what dimension you are. Depending on what dimension you are. So, all the previously known examples of avoidable coordinate components will necessarily involve 8 minor Fermi N, 8 direct Fermi N, or 16 minor from 16 direct form, depending on the dimension. Okay, depending on the dimension, depending on the symmetry of the system. Okay, so this is the review. Okay, so let me switch here to some of the experimental relevant stuff, okay, more ray systems. Okay, so I will make a connection to what I want to talk about theoretically. Theoretically. So, this actually is, I mean, these are a subset of the known model systems. Actually, a moderator system generally means that it's a system with a very long wavelength modulation of the potential which give us a very large unit cell of the system. So, the first modern system is the twisted bilayer graphene. Basically, we have like two monolith graphene. We twisted one of them by a small angle around one degree. Okay, this angle here is actually exaggerated, but it's much smaller than this. But it's much smaller than this angle. So you can see that it forms a very large unit cell. And then the second example is the trilayer graphene, the ABC trilayer graphene on top of boron nitride. So this system does not need any twisting angle at all. There's no twisting angle in this system at all. The reason the system form a moire pattern is because there's a slight, small lattice mismatch between the boron nitrite and also the graphene sheet. So actually, so the naturally form a moire, super lattice. form AMORA superlattice structure as well. And also there's a twisted double bilayer graphene, bilayer, bilayer, then we twist them, okay, bilayer, bilayer, we twist them. So compared with the first Moray system, so this system has some advantage. So for example, this system has some artificial symmetry, which are not there in these two systems. And also this system, actually, the angle does not have to be so magic because actually the band itself already more or less flat. Okay, so how do you understand? Okay, so how do we understand the Moray system? Okay, how do we understand the Moray system in general? So this big hexagon is the original brain zone of the honey honatis. It's a big hexagon. But actually under small twisting, because actually now the union cell is actually very, very large, much larger than the original union cell. So it means that the brain zone will be much smaller. Brain zone will be much, much smaller compared with the original brain zone. So it turns out that Regional Briand Dawn. So it turns out that actually the Briand Dawn of the Moray system was twisted by the agorafra in just this very small hexagon. This very small hexagon. It's very tiny hexagon. And also each valley, each direct valley will form its own Briandzone. Each direct valley will form its own Briandzone. So before we know that in Graph V, the two valleys, they are connected. They are connected in the UV at the bottom or the top of the band. But in this situation, it's no longer true. In this situation, it's No longer true. In this situation, it's no longer true. Because we are folding the band many, many times. Every time we fold it as a boundary of the folded zone, there could be a gap opening. There could be a gap opening. So it means that the band from each valley actually can be separated from the rest of the band. It can be separated from the rest of the band. So it means that the band from each valley now becomes a well-defined band itself. It doesn't have to be connected with the rest of the band structure at all. So these have to give us. Okay, so this gave us some very interesting phenomena. So for example, we know that actually the bary curvature, we can define a bary curvature anywhere in the band structure, but the chain number has to be defined as the bary curvature integrated over the entire Brill dome. So this means that without twisting, without twisting, we cannot define a chain number for every value because this value is connected with the other value through top or bottom of the band, so they are not independent bands. Are not independent bands, but with this twisting, the situation can be very different. Okay, because with this twisting, then the band at each value becomes a separate, can be separated from the rest of the band. So that means that we can define a chain number for each value independently. We can assign and calculate a chain number for each value separately. And they are guaranteed to be an integer value. Sorry, they are guaranteed to be an integer value. They are guaranteed to be an integer value because actually now every value has its own. Now every value has its own, has its own band, has its own band and has its own chain number. So for example, this band actually is a separated band after folding of the Brilliant lawn, but before that this actually will be connected with the rest of the band structure. Indeed, a lot of first principle calculation or quasi-first principle calculation has been performed in many of this kind of Moray systems. So for example, this is the calculation by the Harvard group. By the Harvard group for the twisted bilayer bilayer graphene system. Okay, so they take a two bilayer graphene, they twist a little bit. Okay, so this is a calculation of the value chain number, value chain number, depending on the twisting angle and also displacement field. Displacement field means that it's an electric field, I mean, perpendicular to the system, E field perpendicular to the system. So you can see that the chain number can be any integer, the minus 1, 0, 1. Integer, the minus 1, 0, 1, 2, 3. It's a phase diagram with a very broad range of chain number in the phase diagram. And also, by the way, because of the reflection symmetry, we know that the chain number from value 1 must be opposite from the chain number from value 2. So it means that the total chain number of system will still be 0, unless there's a value polarization. But we can still define the chain number from every value. And here's a different calculation from a different group. Calculation from a different group, you know, I mean, for the two-state barrier, sorry, for the two-step double-barrier graph, you can see that chain number is also can take a different value, it can take a different value. Although the details of the calculation will depend on the detail of the models you choose, but actually, so it means that the phase boundary of this calculation may not be totally agree with each other, but actually, you can see that the bottom line is that the chain number can be non-zero and it can take different values. Okay, okay. So, what is the most simple? What is the simplest feature? The most simple, what is simplest physical picture? What is the simplest physical picture of this value chain insulator? Okay, turns out the picture is very simple. It's just like a quantum spin Hall insulator. So we know that for a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator as the boundary, the spin up is flowing to the right and the spin down is flowing to the left, or the spin up is flowing counterclockwise, and the spin down is flowing clockwise. Okay, so here it's actually very similar. Okay, it's very similar because actually now one value, like the right value, will carry the number. Like the right value will carry check number equals to one, the left valley will carry check number minus one, so that means the right value will flow counterclockwise, and the left value will flow clockwise. Okay, the counter propagating value filtering edge state. And what is the symmetry? And what is the symmetry of this valley insulator, of the valley chain insulator? So of course, it's a U1 charge conservation symmetry, okay? And there's a Z3 symmetry. The reason is there's Z3 symmetry. Symmetry, the reason it says Z3 symmetry is because the value quantum number is only conserved on mod 3, only conserved mod 3, so Z3 symmetry. And also, they said effective time inversal symmetry. Time inversal just means that we actually flip these two values times a spin flipping, times spin flipping. So this is total symmetry. And Z3 just means that we rotate each value by an angle 2π over 3, but opposite angle, but opposite angle. Okay, so actually you can easily convince yourself by checking some simple algebra that without any interaction, okay, without any interaction, this value change relator with the U1 cross-time inversal with a Z3 symmetry has a Z classification. You can easily check that yourself. You cannot turn on any mastermind no matter how many copy of system you are considering. So it's a Z classification without any without any interaction. Okay, this is something you can check very easily. Okay, this is something you can check very easily. But under interaction, the situation can be very different. So it turns out that actually for the edge state of a two plus one dimensional topology insulator or for a two plus one dimensional SPT, we have some very well developed formalism to analyze the edge state of the interacting edge state of the 2 plus 1 dimensional X P T, the Kyro boson theory. So actually it's a little bit technical, but you can trust me that actually Technical, but you can trust me that actually by turning all interaction, okay, this is our interaction term. So phi1, phi2 that corresponds to left-moving chiral boson, right-moving chiral boss. So actually, by turning those on interaction term, you can see that one can show that the edge state can be fully gapped and also symmetric, preserve all the symmetry I said, can be gapped by this kind of interaction term. For C equals to 3. Or we can say that for 3. We can say that for three copies of the fundamental or elementary value change ratio. So this means that actually without interaction, the value change reader has a Z classification, but under interaction become a Z3 classification. But one thing we have to notice is that this interaction has to have a six-body interaction or three-body interaction, depending on what you mean. So this term sum from one to three. This term means that we have to get backscattering three. By scattering three fermions from the left body to the three fermions to the right body. Okay, so I will explain how this term emerge later. But with this kind of interaction, we can show that actually the interaction will reduce the classification from Z to Z3, under interaction. So this actually means that this also means something else. So for example, this also means that for the value change relator, Therefore, the value change relator is always equivalent to a local boson symmetry prototype topological state. Okay, so what does this mean? So this means that actually we can turn our interaction to gap out all the fermion excitation as the boundary, but actually we leave only gapless symmetry protected boson excitation as the boundary. And the bosonic excitation is always going to be a local with the Fermi, which means that the local, the boson will be a bilinear of the Fermi. Of the Fermi excitation. So, how do we know that? Actually, we know that actually for two copies of the corner spin hot insulator, for two copy corners behind, we can actually get out all the Fermi excitation, but actually we can leave the Boson excitation gapless for two copies of the corner spin hot. It's only having a two-copy corner spin-haul. And actually, the Boson excitation will be charge density wave, and also the speedness rate as the boundary of the two-copy corners behind. And here, the magic is that because we have a The magic is that because we have a Z3 classification, so for one copy of the value translator, will equals to four copies of a value translator. And the four equals to two plus two, and every two will become a one bosonic SPT. Okay, will become one bosonic SPT. Okay, the one equals to one plus three equals to one plus one. Okay, so that's the very simple, that's the very simple way of understanding. But actually, one can also write down some chiropractic theory to show that indeed interaction can triple. That indeed, interaction can trivialize, sorry, interaction can actually drive the boundary of the value translator into a bosonic bosonic state, into a bosonic complete state. Okay. So another conclusion one can make is that this probability trivial phase transition of three copy value translator becomes avoidable. Okay, becomes avoidable. Because actually, now we say that the interduction will actually reduce the Interaction will actually reduce the classification of the value transcript from Z to Z3. It's not like Z4 or Z8, so it means that for three copies of the value transcript, the phase transition become avoidable. We can actually turn on strong enough interaction to actually avoid the phase transition between a topological state and a trivial state. Okay, so actually, how do we understand the trivialization? Sorry, how do we understand this? Trivialization. Sorry, how do we understand this avoidable quantum phase transition? So, simple picture is this old choker-Codington picture. So, normally, actually, we can understand the tribute to topological phase transition by understanding it by percolating the domain wall state. It means that we can start with the trivial state, we can grow the bubbles of the topological state, okay? Then, at some point, actually, this domain wall will percolate and drive a phase transition. So, suppose we want to show that this phase transition between trivial and topological state can be avoided. Between trivial and topological state can be avoided, the only thing we need to show is that the boundary state actually can be trivialized. Okay, so this actually was what we showed before by using the Kiriro-Boson theory. Okay, by using the Kairi-Boson theory. Turns out that the same conclusion can be generalized to two-dimensional tabula insulator with Zn symmetry as long as n is odd. As long as n is odd, we can always show that actually the classification is reduced from z to Reduce from Z to Zn. It's reduced from Z to Zn. For N even, it turns out that this reduction becomes more complicated, but for NR, the reduction is always very simple. Just reduce from Z to Zn interaction. Okay, so now let me talk about how do we realize this necessary three-body interaction in this Moray system. Okay, so as I said, I mean, this Moray system actually, we need the three-body interaction, which actually a backscatter. So it has three electrons from. Scatter, there has three electrons from one valley to another valley. Okay, this has to be a high-order process. This has to be a high-order process. Okay, so how does a high-order process happen? So, translate momentum conservation will allow two electrons to scatter from this valley to this valley and another electron to the gamma point. This is just governed by the momentum conservation because the momentum is conserved on model 3. So, I can actually scatter two electrons from this value. Scatter two electrons from this body to minus Q and this and the center of the brain though. And then there's another process which actually maps gamma and Q to 2 minus Q. So if I combine these two processes together, I will get this process. I will get this process. So it means that this three-body interaction can be a second-order process of the Cooler interaction. But you may think that second-order process is actually very weak. But it turns out that in a Morai system, because the interaction is actually race system because the interaction is actually very very strong is actually very strong this second order effect is actually also quite noticeable so for example we can prove that a three body interaction obtained through the second order effect will decay as one over L to the power four where L is the size of the Moray unit cell okay the size of the Moray unit cell and actually if we put in the real number we can show that this this effect is about one Kelvin or one point something Kelvin okay so it's actually quite noticeable quite Okay, so it's actually quite noticeable, quite observable in a real environment. So this actually is the story of the body chain insulator. But then now we can go one dimension further. We can go to like a one higher dimension. So for example, we can consider a three-dimensional topology insulator with U1 cross Zn symmetry. N can be odd integer cross reflection symmetry. So this is the X state. This is the edge state. And the U1 symmetry. State and the U1 symmetry and also reflection symmetry and Zn symmetry. Okay, I don't have much time, so let me go a little bit faster. So, actually, again, one can verify that with this kind of S state and this kind of symmetry transformation, you can convince yourself that by checking all the algebra that this topological insulator has a Z classification, which means that with this symmetry, there's no mass term you can turn on. There's no mass term you can turn on as the boundary of this topological insulator at all. Okay, so it has a z. At all. Okay, so it has a Z classification, behind the Z classification, no matter how many cognitive orders you are considering. Okay, so now, how do we consider interaction effect? So for the 2 plus 1 dimensional edge state, we no longer have the powerful tool of the chiral boson anymore. So what we can do, and actually the only thing we can do, is to try to reduce the dimension from 2 plus 1 dimension to 1 plus 1 dimension. So it turns out we can actually do this wire construction, we can coupled wire construction. So it turns out that wire construction. So it turns out that this two-dimensional Hamiltonian can be reduced to this kind of coupled one-dimensional Hamiltonian and every wire, every wire of the one-dimensional Hamiltonian is precisely the Hamiltonian of the edge state of the value chain sweater. Okay, of the edge state of the value chain sweater. So now we can use the same game. So we know that every wire will have a Z3 classification now. Every wire will have a Z3 classification. So we can give every wire an index. give every wire an index. Okay, so for example, this wire has index plus one, this wire has index minus one, plus one, minus one, plus one. So because every wire, because every wire has a Z3 classification, so it means that the index minus one can be converted into an index plus two. Okay, it can be converted into the index plus two. So we can convert the minus one into plus two, minus one into plus two, okay, through interaction without going through any phase transition. Through any phase transition. Then we can regroup the boundary wire. Okay, we can regroup the boundary wire to gap out the entire boundary, to gap out the entire boundary at all, mean completely, without breaking any symmetry. So you can see that this preserve all the symmetry, preserve the reflection symmetry, it also preserves translation symmetry as well. So it means that actually at this top log insulator, U1 cross Z3 cross reflection, under interaction turns out to be completely trivial. Only intact turns out to be completely trivialized. To be completely trivialized. Even without the interaction and concentration Z, only the interaction becomes completely trivialized. So the same situation can be generalized to U1 cross Z and odd, cross reflective symmetry. As long as n is odd, we can always do the same trick. So we can start with a wire construction. We convert a minus one index into a plus four index, for example, for n equals five. Then we can regroup them and gap out the entire boundary without breaking any symmetry reflection. without breaking any symmetry reflection or translation or any symmetry at all. Okay, so that means that with a u1 cross zn cross p, as long as n is actually our integer, without interaction is always going to be a z classification, but on the interaction always going to be trivialized. So this actually means that this bulk phase transition between trivial state and the topological state, the phase transition, actually was described by two mass list direct formula in three plus one dimension, but actually now it becomes avoidable. Okay, become avoidable. Avoidable, okay, become avoidable. We can turn away a strong enough deformation to get around this phase transition, but now this phase transition only involves like a two-direct formula instead of eight direct formula or 16-direct formula. Okay, so it's actually much simpler, much simpler degree of freedom, much simpler example of the avoidable quantum phase transition. Much simpler example of avoidable quantum quantum volume. Okay, there's another perspective, another perspective we can take. As I said before, Can take is that as I said before, every value change layer can be bosonized. Okay, every value change can be bosonized. We can actually drive it into a bosonic symmetry protein topologic state. It's the same story here. We can try to bosonize this 3 plus 1 dimensional, this 3 plus 1 dimensional topologic insulator, and actually we can actually do it as a try to do it as a bosonic symmetry project topologic state. But then in this situation, actually, we can, I mean, because I don't. Actually, we can, I mean, because a lot of bosonic topological symmetry parallel state can be understood as a decorating vortex classification. So, for example, a lot of the symmetry parallel topology can be understood as decorating the U1 vortex by a Hodan phase. Okay, U1 vortex with a Hodan phase. But here, we are breaking the U1 to Zn and N is the odd integer. But now, actually, the problem will actually solve because actually you can see that when we decorate the U1 for When we decorate the U1 vortex with the hot N phase, this phase will be non-trivial. But once we decorate the Zn vortex with the Hodan phase, actually depending on the classification of the Zn vortex, because for N is odd, then the Zn vortex line will have a Zn classification. It means, for example, for Z3, then three copies of the vortex line will be a trivial configuration, but the three copies of the whole N phase will still be a non-trivial one-dimensional SPD phase. So that means that this kind of a vortex line declaration. This kind of a vortex line declaration will be incompatible once we break the u1 to zn with odd integer n. Okay, so this also means that this symmetry product topologic state actually will be trivialized under under interaction. Okay, so eventually we come back to this phase diagram. Okay, so we have two different states. Actually, they are separated by a genetic phase transition, but actually this phase transition can be avoided by a strong enough deformation in the phase diagram. In the phase diagram under integration. Okay, so I'm out of time. It's actually trying to tell you that there's something interesting about the chain-value chain spread, which can be realized in more resistance, and you motivate us to explore the avoidable quantum grid points with any small number of degrees of freedom. Actually, eventually, we have another example which only involves one direct formula instead of two direct formulas. So that's a smallest number, smallest example we can find for the avoidable corner picture point. Okay, thank you for your. Okay, thank you for your attention. Can you have avoided all the critical points without terminal? That's a very good question. Right now, we don't have a very good example yet. Yeah, I may have one. I just don't remember. I cannot think of one. Yeah, we thought about this a lot in the past, but actually now I don't have an example in my head right now. There a void one curve point is just like a CFP which has only one relevant operator, right? And it just happens that you apply that relevant operator, it doesn't give you the same thing which direction. So I mean kind of techniques you use to get it necessary, or can you just like think about what kind of CFTs could you explain? Yeah, you can start with CFT. Yeah, you can start with CFD. You can just start with CFD and do bootstrap, for example. So, all I can say is that this was not known in classical, I mean, in classical kind of face diagram, I mean, yeah, I don't know examples like that. You don't know, I mean, it has to be a generic phase range, which means I only have one symmetry about the relevant perturbation. Yeah, sorry, sorry, sorry, that's that's that's not, I mean, that's not uh that's not uh sufficient because we also have. That's not uh sufficient because we also have to show that actually we destroy enough information we are connected. So the local study of the critical point is not sufficient. It's not sufficient. We also have to show that this. I don't think that's true because you should be able to, if you know everything about the CFT, that means you should be able to understand everything. No, no, no, like the Isin transition. The Ising transition example I gave at the beginning, right? So we know everything about Isin transition, right? We know everything about Isin transition. We know everything about Isin transition. We know everything about the IC transition, but actually, how do we say anything about me? Suppose I just start from the ICE critical point, the IC Wilson feature. So, how do we argue that I cannot avoid it with a strong enough information? Because that field theory knows that it flows to one phase that doesn't spontaneously break symmetry in another phase. Yeah, that's a general argument. I'm saying that we need some extra information, which is a symmetry breaking this kind of argument. But for generic, But for generic quantum points without any symmetry involved, for example, just like a topological phase transition, how do we argue that? No, no, but I think that information is there in any proper formulation of what the CFT is, right? Okay, fine, but then the CFT with the UV completion, you have that information there, absolutely. No, I mean, not maybe. I mean, I think it's very controversial to say that you don't have it, right? That's like a radical statement. It's just a question of tracking how easy it is to jump at that. Yeah, if you can analyze it, it's hard to tell sometimes. You can show me how you do that, but given the information of the concern of CFD, you can show me how you do that, and it works great. But actually, as I said, I mean, whether one direct formula is avoided or not, kind of depends on the symmetry. It's not something, for example, one direct formula, if you impose like a time inversal and some Time inversal and some symmetry is not avoided. It's not avoidable. But if you turn on some other, if you give some Z3 symmetry, then it becomes avoidable. So it means that symmetry is actually very important. So it means that what kind of uranium perturbation is allowed, but the symmetry is important. So it means that you have to know a lot about CFD. You not only need to know about the relevant perturbation, you also need to know about all the symmetrical numbers. You also need to know about all the symmetry of a lot of irrelevant perturbations. You need to know about it. And knowing about irrigal perturbation is like knowing lattice. It's like knowing lattice because you have to know about uranium perturbations. It's about knowing lattice. So it's really dependent on what you mean by knowing everything about CFT. So you'll need to be sending the t squared to minus one. So yeah, you write asymmetry for that earlier. You write minus a line is canverse. That's t squared is minus one. For the KN3B, yes. For, I mean, that's the A3 class of total value squared. So T squared equal to minus 1. Also for the valence transport. For the body translator, it's actually a t square equals to. T squared equals to one, because I don't have spin. Yeah, because actually I I oh okay. I mean you can you yeah, you can have a t squared minus one time inversal, but you can also have t squared to one time inversal. Because actually you don't have I mean you don't need spin, but without spinning, so you just you just have t squared equals to one time inversal symmetry. Yeah, t square to minus one comes from spin. I think uh Alright, I think uh it's time for the break. Um I think we're coming back at twenty plus. Uh let's thank the speakers from the session here. And then I can use it firstly to compare your um diagrams. More or less you can figure out what's going on.
