For not coming in person while being in Canada. So I'll talk a little bit about transcriptomic trajectories in blood development. I switched from talking about tumors to this, given there was a lot of interest in blood and transcriptomics. So I thought I'll talk about this. So the general question, I guess, is, you know, sort of self-fate dynamics. Sort of self-fate dynamics, right? And this is sort of the overused picture where you have some naive cells which can go in. So at the phenotype level, you can basically have only a few cell types which can interx change. During development, we understand they sort of go from some kind of floripotent cell to some differentiated cells. Now, with reprogramming, we have an understanding that they can go back. And we have been sort of looking at various And we have been sort of looking at various aspects of things here using lineage analysis. So I'll quickly advertise some of the past things we did and then jump into the transcriptomics because it relates to a lot of the themes which people have talked about. And the first one was sort of cellular reprogramming, where we basically were thinking about, you know, what kind of clonal distribution you see when cells actually reprogram from Program from genetically isogenic population, for example, is there diversity and whatnot? And this was sort of again lineage tracking type idea. Related ideas of clonal distribution and whatnot, we recently worked on cancer. And I should tell a story, you know, the model of what we use in this paper came from discussion with Andreas Meyer in the last in-person conference I attended in a bar in Oaxaca. In a bar in Oaxaca. So, I do remember that. You don't remember that. So, no, so you know, there is some reason to still have in-person conferences, I think. But today, I'll sort of talk a little bit on a different angle, not about lineages and clones that much, but really about self-fate dynamics, which we recently been thinking using transcriptomics with a good. With a good friend, Madhav Mani, at Northwestern, and his postdoc, Simon. And you know, working with Madhav is always fun. Working with friends is great. So I've enjoyed that project. So I'll tell a little bit more about that. So coming back, cellular reprogramming, the idea was very simple. The question was, you know, can skin cells reprogram into pluripotent cells? Are there, you know, if you want to think in some high-dimensional transcriptomic dimensions of genes and whatnot, there are various tragedies. Of genes and whatnot, there are various trajectories these cells are taking, right? And the question was: Are there some trajectories that are special, right? And it turns out there are. Actually, some clones are really dominant. They really reprogram thousand times faster, if not more, than the other cells, right? And this has led to sort of lots of questions, really, you know, what is the difference between these, what we call elite trajectories and non-elite trajectories. And is there really a reprogramming level? And is there really a reprogramming landscape, much like development, which one doesn't quite imagine it should be because it's happening in vitro and whatnot? But now we have more and more examples. So this is something we are pursuing now. Tumor heterogeneity, briefly on that problem, we were curious, you know, this is sort of the canonical view of tumors of, you know, slowly growing up, you know, fighting the immune system and early phases, immune system is winning. And then, you know, sort of, I'm calling the escape phase for the tumor where really. Escape phase for the tumor where really tumor diversity establishes. You know, lots of different types of cells are there in tumors. And the question our collaborators were asking were, you know, what happens to this tumor heterogeneity after treatment, right? So you can treat them, tumor regresses, and you can stop the treatment and the tumor relapses. And then the question was basically, is the tumor diversity strongly reduced? It turns out, and in these It turns out in these experiments that, and what's the nature of this sort of regressed state, if you will, right? And it turns out in this colorectal sample that the tumor diversity doesn't quite reduce at all, actually, even after going through this crazy bottleneck of very few cells left. And then pursuing the biology of these cells, you know, sitting at the regress state, they sort of found that they are these drug-tolerant persister states, much like, you know, bacterial persister, as we imagine, but they're using. Imagine. But the amusing thing is, sort of, all lineages can give rise to these persister cells. And this they were tracking through clonal analysis. And, you know, we were seeing various patterns in it, which we could sort of understand better with, you know, Andres' suggestion. So I want to talk about blood. And, you know, there were some great talks on blood already, particularly by Leila, where she sort of laid out these numbers and different. She sort of laid out these numbers and different cell types and whatnot. And it's still interesting that, you know, all this is happening in our flat bones, right? And also, if you're young in femors, you know, as you grow older, basically the blood production reduces in terms of which bones are producing blood, and eventually, sort of only the flat bones do, and so on and so forth. So it's all downhill from there. So, and a couple of questions we were interested in earlier, in an earlier work, was basically talking about stem cell production of blood. But here I want to talk about genes and dynamics. So let me pose the question, right? So we know there are various cell fates here, you know, going in different directions. And the question we wanted to, we're interested in, as many of us are, what are the genes which define cell phates, right? Which define cell phates, right? And the canonical picture we have had from various works in small gene networks is you could have two, three gene network, you could have bistable states and whatnot, and you can have sort of one fate or the other fate and things like that, right? And it's great when you're working with Bacillus subtilis and you know the genes and you know the two states and you're great, right? But what happens when you don't know what genes are important, you know? Don't know what genes are important. You can see the cell fate transitions now in the blood system. And let's say you do not actually know what genes are important. But now we can measure everything, right? We can have the whole transcriptome, you know, and the different cell types and they arranged nicely on these UMAPs. So in principle, we are measuring everything, right? We know every gene, how its level is changing. We have temporal data and whatnot. Temporal data and whatnot. Can we now go and ask: are there only some genes important for cell fate dynamics? In this, again, a classical Waddington underbelly of the Waddington landscape, where you have these molecules and genes pulling the landscape and deciding things. Is everything important in this self-determination, or are they a few actors, right? And if there are few actors, can we pull them out without really having Without really having a knowledge base, right? Clearly, we know a lot about biology of blood system. But the question we wanted to ask was in a different way, that if we throw away for a bit all the biology and we just look at these high-dimensional data, can we learn something? And again, we want to think of it as a model-free assessment, but nothing is model-free. So I'll take an example of blood because here we found. Of blood, because here we found lots of cells and lots of genes measured in an experiment which was done in Elon Klein's group recently. And so this is basically your UMAP, if you will, of hematopoiesis, right? So you start with these undifferentiated cells and you get all these major lineages and so on and so forth. And here, sort of, I'm going to highlight. And here, sort of, I'm going to highlight something which we're thinking about more is this neutrophil lineage. I'm going to stick to one. We worked on the other ones as well, but as an example, I'll just talk about this undifferentiated to neutrophil lineages, right? And again, if you do the classic sort of transcriptomic analysis of looking at differentially expressed genes, you know, how many genes are expressed differently in this blue cell than yellow cell? It's still hundreds of genes, right? Many more than, you know. Right, many more than you know, our little idea of two or three nodes, you know, driving by stability or some kind of dynamical system type view of it. Um, so the question we wanted to ask was, well, you know, we actually have time trajectories of these things. You know, we don't just have two cell types to look at differentiate differential expression. This UMAP, if you buy it, if you, you know, if you believe it, again, there's caveats into it, and we can come back and talk about it. If you really believe that, you know, you really have this. Really, believe that you know, you really have this time course. Uh, you know, you can call it pseudo-time in the sense where cells at different fates can actually be observed, right? They're all sort of at different intermediate states from a progenitor, in this case, the myeloid progenitor, to your neutrophil, right? And you can again look at gene expression on along this pseudotriny. You know, nobody stops you from doing that now that you have assigned time. Now that you have assigned a timestamp to each cell, but still there. So, for example, this black line is associated with this first transition from undifferentiated to neutrophils as given by your clustering analysis, for example. You still see hundreds of genes, if not, you know, two, three hundred genes changing, right? So, this still doesn't tell you if there is a few genes which you can pull out where things are really doing things. And is it really And is it really a dynamical system type view as we have? And in this initial cartoon where you had two genes bistable network, we really have a strong prejudice there, right? The prejudice is it's a dynamical system undergoing a dynamical bifurcation, right? So we really have a very strong notion of what we are imagining these self-aid distributions to look like. And, you know, again, this is a schematic of the same thing where you're saying, you know, Schematic of the same thing, where you're saying, you know, the system is monostable here, it becomes bistable, it becomes multi-stable, and there are these important points in the trajectories of the cell types where they're actually undergoing dynamical bifurcation, right? So if you imagine all these molecules really working as a dynamical system, there's a bifurcation somewhere there, right? We don't know the network. All we know is these genes, right? So it turns out that actually we can So it turns out that actually we can use something if we know trajectories of cells to think about these dynamical systems, right? So I'll spend a couple of minutes on like the theoretical idea. And this is old ideas, you know, sort of linear bifurcation theory, if you will, right? So what you have from the data is a covariance matrix, right? So you have a matrix of cells and genes, right? That's what you measure. And you have pseudo. And you have pseudo-time in the sense you have sort of assigned a time stamp to each cell now, right? Imagine this one, two, two, m is basically a time stamp, right? So you have a very nice covariance matrix of gene-gene variation, right? If you imagine a dynamical system which is running on genes, right? So of course, we're ignoring lots of other molecules and we can talk about it. On the other hand, if you really wanted to think of a generative model, what you want is this, you know, gene. What you want is this, you know, g is representing here your gene vector or, you know, larger molecule vector in this f of g, right? You really want to know what this f of g is because that's what controls the landscape, right? But that's completely non-linear function. You can say, well, maybe around special points, you can linearize it, right? So around a bifurcation, you can say, well, there's a special place in time where things are happening. Maybe I'll linearize it there and I get a Jacobian. Great. Right? So if I know the Jacobian, So, if I know the Jacobian, I'm in business, I can go and ask, Jacobian tells me which genes are interacting with which genes, and I can go and ask whether there's a bifurcation. But what you have is actually the covariance is not Jacobian. But akin to fluctuation dissipation, actually Jacobians and covariance matrices are related to each other, right? From old theory. Although it's still, given a covariance, you cannot compute Jacobians, sadly. You cannot compute Jacobian, sadly, because covariance is a symmetric matrix, and Jacobian has no symmetry a prior, right? So, it's an under sort of inference problem where you don't have all the data. But we're still not interested in the whole Jacobian. We're interested for now, we're interested in the bifurcation. Is there any bifurcation happening? And there, basically, it turns out that if a Jacobian somewhere has a zero eigenvalue, you actually have a covariance matrix which has. Have a covariance matrix which has eigenvalue, which is shooting through the roof. So it sort of goes as one over lambda in some ways. I'm not going to go into the math for a bit, but we can talk about it. And this is old math, it's nothing that we discover. And again, this is the simple idea as a schematic. Again, one has to think in high dimension, but in low dimension, the idea is if you're going through a bifurcation, somewhere in the middle, your covariance goes up along some directions, right? Along some directions, right? So these are these directions along which covariance goes up, and you get these huge eigenvalues if you actually have a dynamical system undergoing a bifurcation. Again, to be clear, right, during development, it doesn't have to be that there is a bifurcation. You can actually just have a shifting minimum, right? You can have a shifting state of shifting attractor state because you have lots of signaling, right? Again, again, sort of. Right again, again, sort of mentioning the title of the conference. But we were curious, we really, if we see this signature for a bifurcation. And again, going back to the UMAP, I'm going to focus on this undifferent progenitors, myeloid progenitors to neutrophil trajectory. And this is sort of the time stamp. And we compute. So now what we're doing is we go to every time point, collect the small cells in the neighborhood, compute. Small cells in the neighborhood, compute the covariance matrix, find its eigenvalue, right? It's very, very simple analysis. And you actually see a very prominent spike in this eigenvalue somewhere, right? But you also see two. So there are two points where you see some structure, right? So the first point where this eigenvalue peels off from really being, you know, close to, you know, and these are all the eigenvalues, if you will, right? So we're just plotting the maximum eigenvalue, not plotting everything. The maximum eigenvalue. Plotting everything. The maximum eigenvalue is pinned near zero. And around the point where people expect these sort of two clusters to start diverging, we really see sort of, you know, this eigenvalue peeling off. But really the peak in the eigenvalue, the spike, you really see at much later time. And I'll come and talk about the biology of it. And this is expected that there is some transition there where neutrophils really mature rather than sort of so the idea is if you have a neutrophil somewhere. So, the idea is if you have a neutrophil somewhere here and you take out the signal, it might run back. But after a while, it matures and really becomes a mature neutrophil. And that's supposed to happen at much later time. And we sort of see it. And you can, it's not obvious whether you see that as an independent cluster. Again, if you zoom down, as Thomas was showing, that if you take only neutrophils, I'm sure you can sort of pull out smaller clusters of different types. So, to some ways, this was exciting that you actually have a significant. Exciting that you actually have a signature of a bifurcation, right? So, this idea that there's a dynamical system lurking inside is not complete, is not just an analogy, right? It looks to have some bearings in it, right? But the question still remains, you know, what is driving it? Are there some small set of genes? Is the whole system bifurcating? Not that we have any theory for high-dimensional bifurcations, we only have theory for, you know. We only have theory for two, three, four dimensions in which natural dimensions in which all the bifurcations are supposed to happen. But you can again go look at this particular new point, which we now are saying, well, the bifurcation is really happening. And the bifurcation, by the way, this kind of signature is very clear for a cell node bifurcation. Again, some of the details you can read in the preprint. But you still see some set of 200. Some set of 200 genes still changing drastically around this point, right? So, is there something significant in terms of how do we discover these important genes here? Again, the linear theory really comes to rescue because what it tells you is that, so right now I did a covariance analysis, right? What is amusing is if you look at gene-gene correlation, which is different from covariance, actually some genes are very highly. Actually, some genes are very highly correlated near a bifurcation, right? And so, this is a heat map, if you will, of the distribution of correlation coefficients now, gene gene correlation coefficients away from the bifurcation. This is the black line where they approach bifurcation, and then you go away. And you can clearly see that there's some genes. So, each point here is some pair of genes, right? So, there's clearly. Of gene, right? So there's clearly a cluster of genes at top and bottom, which basically separate out from the background distribution. They correlate, they become highly correlated. Again, the theory is basically coming from linear bifurcation theory that the important genes which might be driving the bifurcation are actually much more highly correlated. You can think of them also as in the covariance analysis, you not only get the eigenvalues, but you also get eigenvector. So in the eigenvector, the loadings of the eigenvectors. Eigenvector, the loadings of the eigenvector tell you something. The genes which have high loadings there are the ones which actually have high correlations. So it's going, it's talking about which direction are these sort of slow modes developing. And so now you can actually, without really having an unprincipled way, in a very principled way, you can find out which pairs of genes are basically separating out from this background distribution when things are. Background distribution when things are away from bifurcation. And again, you know, we can talk about what these genes are, and there's lots of literature in blood development where many of them have been known to be important. But what was interesting was that while this analysis is just pairs of genes, we actually find clusters of genes which are, so if you find gene one and gene two to be highly correlated and gene one and gene three to be highly correlated. Gene one and gene three to be highly correlated. Of course, it's not surprising that gene three would also be highly correlated with the other one. But you have these little clusters of different types, if you will. And again, you have a signaling cluster where you can find these small set of genes now, right? So going from thousands to now we have 20 odd genes, which we think are somehow responsible of playing a big dominant role in this bifurcation at this point. Bifurcation at this point. Again, this is distinct from the differentially expressed genes. The genes which are differentially expressed at the two sites can actually be quite different from these sets of 20. And I'll quickly show you that. And this is now phenomenology, if you will, dynamics. So we can look at these 20 odd genes, how their dynamics look around this point. And you can see actually many of them rise and then fall off. Right? And so it And so it's not clear if these are, some do persist. So, you know, I'm not arguing for that. They have nothing to do with the determination of the cell type later, but many of them might actually just really play a role near the bifurcation and then go away. They might have nothing to do with what defines neutrophil function and what are the genes really important for neutrophil. So again, so the idea is, you know, really, Know really applying linear theory can maybe teach us a little bit about what is the underlying mechanics. It doesn't tell you the Jacobian, it doesn't give you the landscape, it doesn't give you any of these things. So it's actually quite distinct in some ways. And I would want to learn more about the talk we heard yesterday, where the idea was to have a large network and then understand the parameters which give you a certain phenotype, right? So, in some ways, it's quite distinct from that, but it'll be interesting to think if we can. From that, but it'll be interesting to think if we can sort of merge them in some, you know, intelligent way. Um, so where are we going with this? We sort of want to think along the lines of, you know, having a full map of bifurcation across the whole system, right? So now you have, you know, and this is not just one data set, there's plenty of data set across tissues, across organisms. So, you know, can we go and So, you know, can we go and find these bifurcation points? And now, you know, we can also think of them as whether they are saddle node bifurcations or pitchfork bifurcations or they are sort of cascades of saddle node bifurcations and so on and so forth, and really categorize what is happening dynamically as these cell fates are determined. And it also has a benefit of giving you at least an in into what might be the underlying important control genes, if you will. Important control genes, if you will. So, yeah, we're trying to think about: can we do this across tissues, across organisms, and ask, you know, when a new cell type develops, for example, in the blood system across evolutionary, you know, time scale of different organisms, does it sort of recycle some bifurcation from the past? So this is again the idea of using the same gene to do something else, the same idea of using the same dynamical system to do something else now. Does that kind of Else now, does that kind of pan out in this way? And Malav had a brilliant idea. He said, Look, linear theory could be doing only in time. Why don't we do it in space as well? You can now do dispersion relations and you can quickly go and ask if tissue patterning that you see in some situations has signatures of these bifurcations. If you just look at phenotypic data, basically just looking at how things are being expressed in different parts of the space. Expressed in different parts of the space, and these spatial patterns are also being available now more and more. Okay, with that, I should thank, you know, again, this was part of my group, but most of this work was done with Madhav and Simon. And Matt Smart, who's standing here, had also helped a lot in sort of early discussions with this. So I should stop here. So, I should I should stop here.
