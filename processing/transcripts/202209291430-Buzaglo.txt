Here. I'm very happy to be here in this such a beautiful place. Yeah, so I'm going to be talking about Krishna Renobokov algebras, which are just some infinite-dimensional algebras which generalize the bit algebra. So yeah, the rough plan for the talk is that first I'll give some motivation. Then I'll talk about this. Then I'll talk about this result that's going to be quite useful for the later part of the talk, but it might just be of independent interest. So it concerns these sub-algebras of finite codimension. And then I'll talk about these quitternical algebra. And their developing algebras. And then if there's time, I guess some further directions. Okay. So yeah, the motivation. So if we have some Lie algebra G, if it's If it's finite dimensional, then u of g is very well behaved. So just as an example, any uh enveloping algebra of any infinite any finite dimensional Lie algebra is in the theory. But yeah. But yeah, they are really, I mean, they satisfy all sorts of other very nice properties. On the other hand, if we have an infinite dimensionally algebra, then its enveloping algebra can be very mysterious. And yeah, just some, I'm just gonna for Gonna, for simplicity, or for to so I don't have to keep saying enveloping algebra of infinite-dimensional Lie algebra, I'm gonna call this a big enveloping algebra. So the fundamental question I'm interested in Is are these ever nice? Are big enveloping algebras ever nice in some sense? And in this talk, I'm going to focus on nice in the Netherian sense. So the particular The particular question I'm going to be focusing on in this talk is a question that first appeared in print in Amaya and Stewart's book on infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. So I think from 1974. It's sometime in the 70s anyway. So yeah, in Amaya Stewart's book on infinite dimensional Leaders, they ask, They ask: can big enveloping algebras ever be Ethereum? And oh, I should have mentioned this, but when I say Ethereum, I always mean left and right Ethereum. And because in when we're talking about enveloping algebra, it doesn't matter whether we're talking about left or right in Ethereumity, because Rhythm Ethereum because they're building. Okay, so that's the question that I'm interested in. Okay. So it's widely believed that the answer to this question is no. So this is a conjecture of my supervisor, Ceciera, and Cierra and Chelsea from their 2013 paper. So they conjecture that is an Ethereum if and only if g is finite-dimensional. So I'm not going. So, I'm not going to attempt to prove this conjecture in full generality because that's way too difficult. So, instead, I'm just going to look at some examples. So, the easiest example is when we have some infinite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra. So, just when the Lie bracket is zero, then u of A. U of A is a polynomial ring in infinitely many variables. So it's not my theory. So that's nice and easy, just as a bit of a warm-up. Of a warm-up, but yeah, now the particular examples I'm going to be looking at are going to be these quaternological algebras. But before I talk about, I'm going to look at, I'm going to mention this useful results on some algorithms that I could have mentioned. So Okay. So, in their 2013 paper, Sue and Chelsea proved this very useful result. So, yeah, just to clarify, in this result, we don't assume anything about the, so we have two of the algebras h and g, and I'm not assuming that h has finite co-dimension in g for now. That's going to come either. So yeah, the result says that if u of g is an Ethereum, then u of h is an ethereal. U of H is also an Ethereum. So, this is really useful because if we have some Lie algebra G and we want to show that its involving algebra is not Netherian, then we can just find some sub-algebra which potentially might be much easier to work with and show that that is not Ethereum. So, I guess as an immediate corollary, if our Our infinite-dimensional abelian Lie algebra is contained in G, then U of G is non-Metherian. So this gives us lots and lots of examples of non-Metherian begin developing algebras. So for example, I find catsman D. Yeah, so those are easy in this situation. So, anyway, the question I want to answer now is, what about the converse? So if we have two Lie algebra's H and G, where H is contained in G, when can we say that the Netherian idea of U of G is equivalent to the Netherlands of U of H? And this is where the finite codimension comes in. So, yeah, this is something I proved. So if H has final codimension in G, then U of G is Metherium if and only if U of H is Metherium. Okay, yeah, just to give you an idea of how the proof goes. So, just a very rough sketch. Well, U of G looks like, yeah, and I'll put this in quotation. Yeah, and I'll put this in quotation marks because I'm not being very precise. It looks like u, where we have joined finitely many variables. So by Hilbert spaces theorem, if u of h if if we assume that u of h is an ethereal, then u of g is also an etherean. UFG is also an Ethereum. Okay. Great. Alright. Now I'm going to move on to the main characters of this talk, which are going to be these cane algebras. So I'll start with a definition. If we have, so if C is some affine curve, then the Kirchhoff-Veronovikov Algebra on C is denoted by curly L of C. It's the Lie algebra of vector field on C. And in this talk, when I say vector field, I will always mean a derivation of the coordinate ring. And um for simplicity, I'm just going to be taking my field to be the the complex numbers. But uh pretty much everything I say in this talk should work for any field with characteristic zero. Work for any field with characteristic zero. So, yeah, this is a quitternological algebra. So, let me give you some examples. So, the Witt algebra is a criterionomical algebra. It's the criterionomical algebra on the function affine line. Affine line, which we can explicitly describe as the Laurent polynomial ring times del, where del is just my shorthand for d by dt. So any derivation of the Laurent polynomial ring consists of first differentiating with respect to t and then multiplying by some Laurent polynomial ring. Then we have this algebra we talk called W1. It's the algebra of Carton type. So it's going to be the criterion of algebra on the affine line, which again we can explicitly describe as the polynomial ring times del. Again, very easy to Very easy to describe. And we can view it as a sub-algebra of the big algebra. But we can come up with much more complicated examples if our curve is more complicated. So I'll define this elliptic curve E, which I'll define as y squared equals x times x squared minus 1. And now it's not clear what L of E should be. Not clear what L of E should be. So it's much harder to describe explicitly like the first two. So for example, d by dx is not a well-defined derivation of the coordinate ring of B. So it's, yeah, so basically it's just a little harder. It's, I mean, it's, it's still possible. It's, I mean, it's still possible to describe LV explicitly, but the point is, it's not as easy as the first two examples. Okay. So why am I interested in these Lie algebras? Well, in 1990, Dean and Small Got interested in the VIT algebra in the context of metherianity of big enveloping algebras. So they asked, is you of the wid algebra an ethereal? And until 2013, this was unknown. So Known. So this was proved by Sue and Chelsea. And the answer is no. So both u of w and u of w one are not met. One are not methane. So, my goal was to generalize this to arbitrary quaternion alphabets. So, indeed, this is what I did. So, if C So if C is some affine curve, then U of L C is not Ethereum. Okay, and so I'll spend most of the rest of the talk just trying to give you an idea of how the proof works. So, the main difficulty in proving this theorem is that for a general cryptophonomical algebra, we don't really know what it looks like. So, we could have some really complicated curve, and this cryptographical algebra might be really complicated. But thankfully, we have this really useful lemma from the beginning of the talk. So, it's enough. So it's enough to find a subalgebra G of L of C such that U of G is non-Ethereum. And so that's what we're going to do. But how do we find this subalgebra? Well, it's going to come from Well, it's going to come from uh so um it's going to come come from a uh dominant morphism from C to the affine line, which which will allow us to. To pull back vector fields from the affine line to C. And we know what vector fields on the affine line look like, so that's going to give us our sub-algebra, our very explicit sub-algebra. Algebra. Okay, so let's go back to our elliptic curve from before. So the elliptic curve is going to look something like this. And we have a very obvious dominant morphism. So, this is our little curve E, this is the alpha line. And we have a very obvious dominant morphism like that. So, let's look at a vector field on the affine line. Just a really simple one, just del. So, this is just going to look like this. Look like this. But the problem is, when we try to pull this back, we run into problems. What is the pullback of this vector field going to look like here, here, and here? So there's problems at these points here. So let's just, let's not consider all vector fields on A1. Let's just consider the ones that vanish at these three points. So this. At these three points. So this is 0 minus 1 and 1. So let's, okay, so let's make this vanish. t times t squared minus 1 times del and now the vector field is going to look something like this. Okay, and now it's perfectly reasonable to pull this back. Right. Okay, so that's the idea. So we just don't consider all vector fields in A1, we just consider the ones that vanish at these problematic points. And these problematic points are precisely the ramification points of the dominant morphism. So, indeed, if we have some dominant morphism from x to y, where these are curves. Affline curves, then there exists an injective map from this sub-algebra, which I've denoted by L pi of y, which is just the vector fields on y, which vanish at the ramification point of pi. And yeah, this is injective. And yeah, this is injective. Great. So, what does it give us here? It just gives us that we have an injective map from what I'll denote by w1 of t squared minus 1, which consists of vector fields of this form, t t squared minus 1. Fourth, t t squared minus one f del one where f is n equal to no real. So we have an injective map from w1 of t times t squared minus 1 into L B. And so that's how the proof of that theorem goes. Of that theorem goes. This subalgebra of W1 has finite codimension in W1. So since we know that the enveloping algebra of W1 is not Metherian, and this has finite codimension in W1, we know that the enveloping algebra of this thing is not Metherian. And now we've shown that it's the sub-algebra of L of V, so the enveloping algebra of L of V is not Metherian. So we can do that for any curve. And that's our proof. And that's how the proof of this theorem is. So, in my last few minutes, I want to talk a bit about some further directions. So the nice thing about big enveloping algebras is that pretty much any question you ask is going to be open. Ask is going to be open. So one question we can ask is: well, what about higher-dimensional varieties? And actually, in this case, it turns out this question. In this case, it turns out this question is much easier than the curve case. So anyway, for any For any affine variety x, the enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of variations of the corner ring of x is not metal. And so I've just shown you, I've just sketched the proof when x is a curve and when x is something of higher dimension, this result follows from the following observation. So we have some any Lie algebra G if the derives of algebra of G has infinite codimension in G In G, then U of G is non-Ethereal. And so why is this the case? Well, because we have a surjective map from U of G to the abelianization, to yeah, from the enveloping algebra of G to the enveloping algebra of the abelianization. abelianization. And since this is infinite-dimensional and abelian, so it's non-metherian, so therefore U of G is non-metherian. And now this theorem, when X has dimension greater than or equal to 2, well, we can always find a sub-algebra of derivations of the coordinate ring of X, which satisfies this. And so that's Satisfies this, and so that's how that's how this theorem follows. The other direction I want to talk about before I finish is what about two-sided ideals, two-sided ideas. Two-sided ideals, two-sided occurrenity. As in, what about ACC on two-sided ideals? Well, this, much less is known about this. So we don't even know if the enveloping algebra of the WIT algebra is two-sided Ethereum. So, for example, for the Witt algebra, the For example, for the Witt algebra, the way that we know that the Witt algebra has a non-ethery enveloping algebra is that there's a map from u of w to some ring b, which I'm not going to define, and its image and b, where b is not left or right Ethereum. Or left or right Ethereum. However, it is two-sided Ethereum. So we don't know what what U of W uh whether U of W is too sat in Ethereum. So yeah, this question is pretty much wide open. Yeah. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for your attention. Any questions? Just to think about, say instead of affluent digitalized and projected, and just assume that the global sections to the tangent vinyl is increased dimensional value, and that should be finalization. No, I haven't, but that's a good question. Yeah, I mean, as I said, any question you ask is pretty much going to be an open question. But yeah, that's a good question. It's not something I've thought of at all. Any questions? I have one more. I think I've asked you this before. Maybe you've learned something in the meantime. I'll ask it again. Is anything at all known about the global dimension of these? Anything at all known about global dimension of these big enveloping algebra? That you're one? Not that I'm aware of, but yeah, I don't know. Okay, well let's take a look at this again. Now we've got coffee for the next
