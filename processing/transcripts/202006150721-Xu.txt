It's a pre-recorded presentation, so I just play. As you heard from previous talks, sickfish and single-cell iron sequencing are two approaches to study gene expression in single-cell level. Integrating these two approaches could give us a powerful tool which projects rich transcription topic information from single-cell levels Atomic information from single-cell RNSIG onto spatial coordinates that are provided by SIGFISH. So, the question I'm going to discuss today is what's the minimum number of genes needed for data integration. To integrate the two omics data, the key information we need to know is what type of cells are there and which spatial coordinates do they map to. So, I think the question could translate. So I think the question could translate to what's the minimum number of genes needed to distinguish cell types in both data sets. In Chen's paper, they used only 43 genes that allowed them to distinguish eight major cell types in single-cell RNA-seq and sick fish. We can see from the figure the expression of the norm marker genes of each cell types correlates. Of each cell types correlate well. So here, this figure is from the paper, Figure 1 CND. So you can see for each cell type, there are a couple genes that have similar expression patterns. And we can see the similar pattern between these two data sets. So I and the actual corresponding And they actually correlate really well here. So I want to see if we can use less number of genes to do the same task. So the first thing I did is to identify the genes that have highly variable expression in single-cell RN-SIG. That's because these highly variable genes can best represent the cell types. So I started from the raw single-cell anti-sective data. I used the pattern. I used the package Scampi and followed a standard recipe for filtering, filtering cells and genes and do normalization and then annotate the highly variable genes. So in this figure, the dots that have a darker color are the five highly variable genes selected. So in the two data sets, The two data sets, so there are only 113 genes overlapped between the two data sets. So when I compare the highly variable genes to these genes, I found that only 46 genes are annotated as high variable genes and shared between these two data sets. So I'll focus on these 46 genes afterwards. So the first thing So, the first thing I want to see is: is there a relationship among these 46 genes? So, using the normalized single-cell analysis data, I checked the collinear relationship using the Palton correlation score. So, in this figure, you can see the darker, the red color means a higher correlation, the blue means the net paper correlation. Blue means the net paper correlation. And so we can easily see there are some clusters of genes that are highly correlated. So which means we may can reduce some number of genes and do the same task. So in Chen's paper, they trained a SVEM classification model on single-cell RNA sector data using the 43 genes. Using the 43 genes they selected. And then they used this model to predict cell types in sick fish data. So here I'm going to follow their strategy, but I'm going to try different number of genes. To do that, I used a method called recursive feature elimination, RFE. So RFE is a feature. RFE is a feature selection method used in machine learning. It will require a specific number of features to keep. So for example, if I only want to keep 10 features in a model, so RFE will recursively first fit a model and then it will learn the importance of every feature and remove the least important feature. least important feature in model and then to see if if 10 features reached if it's not if more than 10 features there it will again fit the model learn the importance of a feature remove the least important feature again and until they reach the desired number of features but because I don't know how many features I don't know how many features I should keep in abounds. So to find the optimal number of features, I tried all different number. Starting from 1 to all 46 features. And then I use cross-validation to score the different feature subsets to see what's the best one. Also, I want to mention that the SVM classification model. VM classification model requires parameter C which really affects the model. So I selected three values for the C just to select the best one. And here is a result. This figure shows the result when the parameter C set to The parameter C set to 1e minus 6. And the X axis shows the number of features selected. And the Y axis shows the F1 score, which represents overall accuracy here for the model. And we can see the curve jumps from zero or zero to actually a relative high. Actually, a relative high accuracy when seven features are captured. And then it decreased in accuracy. That may be because some non-informative features are added to the model. But eventually, the accuracy gradually increased as we add more features. And it reached its optimal score at 44 features. The shaded area Shaded area represents the variability of cross-validation. So when we set C to 1E minus 3, the model generally have a higher accuracy compared to the previous one. We can see it already reached a high accuracy when it selected two features here. And the accuracy didn't change much. Accuracy didn't change much afterwards, but it reached its optimal F1 score when 45 features selected. Here is the curve when I set the C to 1. So we see a gradually increasing curve. It reached the optimal accuracy quite early at 32 features. So, from the figure, it looks like we could already reach a high accuracy when using as less as about 10 features. Like here, like 12 features here and 7 features here. So, I'm going to use these two models. One is using 12 features, one is using 7 features to predict the cell types in SIGFISH data to see how it is going. To see how it is going. And here is the result for the curve features model. I plotted the gene expression heat map here, and we can see each cell type have a similar gene expression pattern. Like for each cell type, some genes are highly expressed and And some genes are kind of low-expressed. They have a similar pattern for these search genes among the two cell type data sets. And here is a pie chart of the proportion of cell types that predicted. And compared with these two, it looks like the two neuron genes, neuron cells have the most occupation. The most occupying most of the cells. And here's the result when I choose seven number, seven features. Again, from the heat maps, we can see a similar pattern of the gene expression in each different cell types and also a similar cell proportion predicted in sick faith. Predicted in the sick fish compared to the single-cell ion sick. So, I guess this kind of answers the question that use as less as about 10 genes, we can classify the cell types in single-cell RNASIG and sick fish data. So that's the answer. Thank you. And questions? And questions? Thank you so much, Hong. I know how much work it is to do a pre-recorded talk. That was beautiful. So we'll open it up to questions. So GC asked, can you use robustness measures to help select additional features in addition to CV? Yeah, I guess so. I guess so. But I haven't tried it. I think there's some other method to increase accuracy by adding the features to the importance of other features there. And then GC, as a follow-up, do you have guidance about how to pick C? Well, I just did a great search. So I did a So I didn't, I think because the C is kind of the softer margin for the hyperplan for the linear SBC model. So I think for the single-cell ISIC data, because there's probably no clear catalog of the genes for two different cell types, maybe a lower C will better. Or C will benefit to have a better model. So, yeah. And Ashwara has a question of, did you compare feature importance metrics? And did one metric perform better than any others? Yeah, so in the RFE model method, it kind of selects, compare the feature importance in every step. importance in every step and then remove the least important ones there. So it does to compare which feature is important in that step and selected the best ones in different subsets. And the final result is based on the strongest features selected. Are there any other questions from anyone else in the audience? From anyone else in the audience? So, could you talk a little bit more about the metric that was used in your evaluation? The evaluation? Which one? So, could you talk a little bit? So could you talk a little bit more about which metrics specifically, like which norms you selected and how that, you know, how you thought about that? Well, for, you mean the parameters there? I actually didn't really try to select, but instead I tried to use to compare all kinds of combinations in the parameter. Kinds of combinations in the parameters to see which one is the best. And Adeen has a question. With regard to accuracy, she noticed more glia cells in the SC fish. Is this because the glia are lost in the single-cell RNA? Do you think? Or do you notice any imbalances between different cell types and the different data modalities? Yeah, so there are, you know, Yeah, so there are in the single cell RNA segue, I noticed that there are like the two neuron cell types occupy the most of the cell cell. And for the other cell types, there's only some of them only have like six or you know, a couple cells have that cell type. So that may limit the ability to train the model. So that's maybe also the reason that in Maybe also the reason that when I predict in the sick fish data, the model didn't do that well for the cell types, didn't, you know, the less cell types there. So I do see a bias there, but I'm not sure if, you know, how biased it is. It's kind of hard to benchmark. Do you have a feeling about how biases impact your A feeling about how biases impact your model? Well, I think so from the peak map from the expression data compared between the two data sets, those genes did show a pattern, like similar patterns. So I think it captures the key features there. So because also because of the lack of the ground truth, I don't know exactly what is how it can look. But one thing I didn't do is to compare the genes I selected to the normal and biological data to see what are they doing there, what's the genes functions. Maybe that could give me more information about how the Information about how the model is working, how BIOS it is. Great. Are there any further questions from the audience? Okay, if there's no further questions, thank you so much, Hang. And we can move forward to setting up Daria's talk. Thank you. Thank you.
