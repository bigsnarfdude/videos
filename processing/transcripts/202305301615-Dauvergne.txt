You can go more friendly, I'm sure. Sometimes you see both. I think when my great-grandfather was born from France, they took away. From France. Because the angle of Stranger. We're just wondering what the hell's happening. So, being a Canadian with a French friend, are you French speaking? I'm not French-speaking, and I'm not French-canadian. Do people ever you know, kinda be French-speaking? In English Canada, they don't expect any French from there's some people overseas with the expectation of their speakers. It's really, I'm mostly not French. I'm 180. Okay. All right. Welcome back. We have. Welcome back. We have Duncan De Ver and he's going to tell us about geodesic networks in the directed legacy. Thank you. And thank you for the introduction. So I was speaking to a team for him and he said he doesn't want happy birthday for a compliment. So maybe I'll say, okay. My first ever talk. First ever talk outside of U of T was at Madison. This was before I started working on KPZ. And I went, and that's where I met Timo. And I was struck by the fact that he was the best-looking probabilist that I had ever met. And it was this that caused me to wrap up the work that I had been doing at the time. Work that I had been doing at the time, and then transitioned to a new research area, following in his footsteps and started working on KP Institution. So that's the story. So I'm going to talk about geodesic networks in the directed landscape. So we've seen a couple talks out of the directed landscape. I'll say a little bit at the start, maybe to set some notation and give a bit of my perspective and the perspective for the talk. Generally, I think of the directed landscape, it's like a random, you know, you can imagine it as sort of a random rough terrain. So it's a bit like finding your way through the mountains. So it's just like finding your way through the mountains in banff. Geodesics in the directed landscape can be like the rivers here. So that's the idea. So it's a little bit, you know, you can, when you're in banff, you can think a little bit about the directed landscape. The golf course. Think a little bit about the director landscape. The golf course is possibly something you don't see in the IID random settings. All right, so let me say something a bit more precise. So I won't give a precise theorem stating how you get the directed landscape for the prelimit, but I think it's maybe a little bit easier to start with a prelimiting model. So the one that So, the one that I like is Poisson last passage percolation. So, in Poisson, last passage percolation, you can do it like this. You can assign a distance or a last passage value between any pair of points in the space-time plane. So you specify that the points be ordered in their time coordinates. So, s here should be less than t here. And the last passage value between these two points is just the maximum. Is just the maximum number of points you can pick up on a path moving forward in time going from P to Q. And the background set of points is just a Poisson process. And you restrict your paths to be one Lipschitz. Because if they weren't one Lipschitz, you could just move back and forth arbitrarily, collect as many points as you want. So this is Poisson-Las Passes circulation. So the basic idea is that you're defining a metric-like structure. Defining a metric-like structure, so it's not quite a metric, but you should really view it as such by maximizing over paths where paths are given weight, where the weight is coming from some IID noise. In this case, it's a plus one plus noise. Okay? You know, it's a very nice model. It's integrable. You can take a scaling limit to get the directed landscape. So you can get a scaling limit of this whole metric-like structure. And so you can kind of think of the directed landscape in this. And so you can kind of think of the directed landscape in the same way, except you don't have a nice discrete point field which is giving you the noise. And in fact, what you recover in the directed landscape is you don't actually get a noise here, but you get a scaling limit of the distances in Plus All Mass passage. Okay, so what do we need? So more formally, so the directed landscape is a random continuous function. Continuous function which assigns values to pairs of points in R4 whose time coordinates are in the right order. Okay, I'm gonna, hopefully I stop doing this. Think of it as a directed metric. Okay, so again, it's not a metric, it's not symmetric, it satisfies the triangle inequality backwards. This goes back to, you can think, this goes back to the plus or last passive description, where you're maximizing over. Where you're maximizing over paths rather than minimizing over paths. Kind of the other thing that I'll highlight is it has some nice continuity properties, and it looks quite a bit different in the spatial coordinates x and y than in the time coordinates s and t. So in the spatial coordinates, it's a rather familiar process. So if you fix three of your coordinates and just vary Three of your coordinates and just vary one spatial coordinate, say one, you get a parabolic vary two process. Okay, so in particular, it's holder almost a half, it's sort of locally absolutely continuous with a spectral Brownian motion. It's rougher in time, so it's holder only almost one-third. Okay, so good numbers to keep in mind for later in the talk. And these are manifestations of this KBZ scaling. So it's a scaling limit. We've seen you expect it to be universal. You expect it to be universal. Lots of things you scale to it. It satisfies scale invariance. And it has these kind of characteristic 1, 2, 3 scaling that you see throughout. Okay. So I want to get to talking about geodesics. So we should define paths and lengths of paths in this object. So in Poisson's last passage, the length of a path from, say, P to Q To Q is just the number of Poisson points you pick up along the path. Here we don't have a background noise, so instead we define path length in the following way. You basically take finer and finer partitions of your path and estimate the length just by adding up the distances in the landscape between consecutive points. Just take finer and finer partitions. Final partitions. So this is like a piecewise linear approximation of the Ri minus one or Ri plus one of them? Yeah, I think this first one should be Ri minus one here and then Ri Ri. Okay, so then what is a geodesic? So a geodesic is just a path whose length is the distance between its endpoints. That's our geodesic. And this landscape is a geodesic space, so between every pair of points, you'll see at least one geodesic. So, morally, you can think that this distance is defined by taking a supremum or a maximum over lengths of all paths. So, there are geodesics between every pair of points. And for a fixed pair of points, pair of points. So say if I fix p equal to 0, 0 and q equal to 0, 1, then almost surely there's a unique geodesic. So this is, for example, what Melind was talking about. He was talking about the, one of the things he was talking about is the unique geodesic between 0, 0 to 0, 1, and looking at how this geodesic looks when you condition its length to be very large. Okay, so the story of this talk is going to be understanding what happens at all points. So it's not true, you cannot switch the Forni and the almost sure here. So there will be exceptional points where you see multiple geodesics. And the goal of the talk is just to describe what happens at these exceptional points. What happens at these exceptional pairs of points? Just let's try and understand what's going on here. And can I ask the existence of this geodesic? That's not a trivial thing. Yeah, none of these things are. Yeah, it's not trivial, but it's not too difficult to get the existence of geodesic somehow. Not from the properties I've put up so far, but it's not. So if you just have these properties, like these almost metrics. Properties like these are almost metric and stuff, then it's not in continuity. Yeah, so the main property which, I think that the main thing which you need is if you look at like L going from T to Q. So say I'm going to write this as XS, YT, and I'll let R be strictly between S and T, then we have this metric composition law, so this is equal to the maximum over Z. over z of L going from Xs to Zr plus L going from Zr to Yt. So in other words, if I want to look at the distance between any two points P and Q, then this is always achieved at some interior point at time R here. And you just keep subdividing, then you create a geosnip this way. Dividing, then you create a GIS. And you can do this. You can do this, and because of nice regularity properties, the result will be continuous. Okay, so what happens at the exceptional pair? So let's just give a few examples of what you can get, which is not without, this is not going to be proof, but maybe something believable. So the first option is the generic case. So almost every Case, so at almost every pair of points in R4, or almost every pair of points in R2, you'll see a unique geodesic. But you can get more interesting things. So here's an example. So say I'm looking at, say I first look at the geodesic from 0, 0 to 0, 1, and also the geodesic from 0, 0 to 1. What you expect is, I think that these will be a bit like the rivers going through the mountains, right? Rivers going through the mountains, right? So they'll stay together for a while and then they'll split apart. So, how do we go from this picture to the second picture there? So, now let me take some point R in between 0, 1 and 1, 1. Now, what's going to happen with the geodesic from 0, 0 to this point here? Okay, so it's either going to join up with this side, or it's going to join up. Or it's going to join up with this side. So what happens is when we're close to this side, when we're close to this point, we'll join up on the left. When we're close to this point, we'll join up on the right. And there's going to be some threshold in the middle where threshold, maybe I'll call this threshold P star, where to the left of P star we join to Where to the left of p star we join to the left, and to the right of p star we join to the right, and at p star we create this second configuration here. So it's not a proof, but it's not too difficult to turn this into a proof if you understand some things about how coalescence works in the landscape. So you have things that look like this. You also have things that look like this. Well, how do we get something that looks like this? Well, this is just this guy, except rather than my base point being at the bottom, Rather than my base point being at the bottom, I put my base point up in the middle. And finally, if you believe in my sketchy argument for getting this guy, you should believe that we can get this guy. So this is like a canoe paddle. This is the kayak paddle. So the canoe paddle, we get a bubble on the top by playing this wiggle game at the top. The kayak paddle, we wiggle the top and the bottom. Okay. Okay, so you believe in these points. I'm going to do that throughout the talk, I'm sure. Okay, so I'm going to call the set of all geodesics between two points, the geodesic network from P to Q. And let's try and classify all the geodesic networks that we'll see in the directed landscape. And it turns out you get 27 of them, and they look like this. So four of them should be familiar. That's one, two. That's one, two, three, and four. Maybe, because this is like the slide with most pictures on it. I'll stay here for a while. So you can also refine this, you can get versions of this theorem, say, where you fix a particular point. So if I want to ask what sort of configurations can I get when I force my base point to be 0, 0 rather than allowing this base point to run freely, I can just get configurations 1, 2, and 3. One, two, and three. Somehow my base point, kind of the environment of the base point, always needs to look just like a single rod, maybe not. Another thing you could do would be, say, fix two times. So I could fix one of my times at time zero and the other time at time one, and just ask what kind of structures can I get between these two times? Two times. And there you get this guy, you get this guy, you get this guy, you get this guy, and you get this guy. So you get five guys, and you fix the two times. Different options will appear with different frequencies. Some of these are countable, some of them appear on sort of lower-dimensional sets, and I'll elaborate a little bit on that as we go. What I'm missing is that the top point is still straight, or is it. What do you mean the top one? It's still strange. Well, so let's say it goes like this, and then there's a bump, and then it goes on. Is it somehow already captured? This option, yes, never happens. So this is a... This is, so you never have an interior bubble on a geodesic in the directed landscape. So this is somehow Somehow, I'll get to this a little bit. It's probably better that I talk about it now because I won't say much about it later. But this sort of thing never happens. So somehow, all of the splitting, the only way you can split and then rejoin is if you split at the start and rejoin at the end. Okay, and so you never see something like this. Also, these points are somehow avoided once they split. You cannot go from the top to them. Yeah, maybe a good way to think about this is if you believe in the philosophy of coalescence. If you have something like this, what you could do would be take your favorite sequence of rational points that converge to here and to here. And when the rational guys are close enough over here and close enough over here, what they'll want to do is the geodesic between the rationales. Is the geodesic between the rationals will coalesce with the main geodesic over here? But then it would have two options, and we know that for rational points, rational points are generic, you'll only ever see geodesic. So that's why you don't see something like this. You need a little bit more, but that's okay. Okay, so this classification, are you using more than what we stated already? Or more than what I stated in what sense? The properties you mentioned, the regularity. Oh, yeah, I'm using much more than. Then can you say a little bit what is meaning for this content for that content? Yeah, but that's probably more. I think that will come later. I'll say a little bit. I can't say every, it'll be hard to say everything, but I'll definitely try and say some of the key things that come up. Well, Dancer, maybe I want to ask about your very first picture there. When you found the P star, the P star would connect to the place where the orc is. Like this. Like this. Yeah. Yes. So again, this is maybe this is the kind of time when I would like a sleepier audience. This sort of thing never happens. But it's somehow the branching of geodesics in the landscape is always binary. This is somehow, you can imagine, you'll only ever have countably many branch points, and this should somehow happen on a lower dimensional set than this, but what's lower dimensional set. Dimensional set than this, but what's lower-dimensional and countable? Well, this sort of thing never happened. It's not obvious. It's not obvious, it's not clear. There's a calculation that goes into that, which I've very much not spoken about anymore. Okay. So let me say, so in this classification, there has to be some notion of isomorphism for geodesic networks. So it's It's not too difficult to kind of construct this yourself. So, I'm going to associate to each geodesic network, so just a collection of geodesics between two points. Just turn this network into a directed graph. So, branch points become vertices, and then connections between branch points become directed edges. So, as a directed graph, you're going to flow from the source vertex down here up to the sink vertex. So, we'll say two networks are isomorphic, or two networks are the same if they're Two networks are the same if their directed graphs are the same. I'm also going to say that two networks are isomorphic if their graphs are the same after I reverse the direction of all of the edges. So somehow reversing the direction of all the edges is not a very interesting operation from the point of view of the landscape because the landscape has this symmetry under reversing time, which corresponds to reversing the edges in the floor. So this So this, for example, and this we're considering as isomorphic. And indeed, if you think about the argument I gave over here, I could have done the same argument, you know, standing on my head, and we would have gotten this guy instead. The other thing I'll mention is we're not distinguishing between the planar structure of the network. So these two guys have a different planar structure. So you'll notice the small bump here. You'll notice the small bump here is on opposite sides, and here the small bump is on the same side. So, this is like if I were teaching a high school chemistry class, these are like cis and trans isomers of the same molecule. But we don't care about that. We're going to just consider these as the same thing. If you wanted, you could also add in a classification which takes into account planarity. The proofs go through in the same way. Okay, so there are five rules that specify this set of 27. That specify this set of 27. Let's go over them. Okay, the first two are pretty clear. So you're going to have, for these directed graphs, you'll have one source and one sink. Okay, everything is flowing up. This next one is also fairly clear. So In my network, I'm obviously not going to have any loops. This doesn't make sense. The directed landscape is built in the plane, so my graphs will be planar. It's not a priori clear that these networks will always be finite, but hopefully you believe that. It's, again, not obvious, but turns out to be true. The next three points contain a bit more content. So this is this node. This node geodesic bubbles point. So, if you take your network and chop off the head and chop off the tail, then you don't see any undirected cycles. You'll never see something like this. Does not happen for this rational approximation argument. The next point was also anticipated. So, if you look at the degree Look at the degree of any of these interior vertices, these always have degree 3. So it'll either be 1 in, 2 out, or 2 in, 1 out. So in other words, it's like a binary branching rule. You never have anything looking like this. You never have anything looking like this. You never have more exotic branching possibilities. And we're almost there. The only thing left is a restriction on the degree of the source in the sink. On the degree of the source in the sink, these need to be degree at most three. And that's it. That gives you, these conditions together give you the set of 27, which, I don't know, if you have a if you have either some spare time or a spare undergraduate graph degree student, you could ask them to check them out. So you didn't show that they actually have one or did we do. I do. That's. That's maybe that it is harder to show that they happen than that they don't happen. So, getting that these five things hold is not so bad. Showing that all of these, showing that anything satisfying these five exists is an easy way of exploring. Okay. So then something I looked at really, you want to, you know, it's one thing to classify what you see, but you also want to say how frequently do you see it. So this is like a So this is like a understanding how endangered your different species are or something, if you're trying to understand like the biome of the directed landscape. Okay, so we're going to define a distance with which to take house dark dimensions. So often if you're trying to understand something in a metric space, you would look at house dark dimensions defined using the metric. And here we want to think of the directed landscape more. To think of the directed landscape morally as a metric, but because it's not a metric, you can't exactly define house store dimensions. So we introduce this sort of KPZ scaling-based metric, which is kind of a proxy, which will give us a proxy for house store dimensions defined using PAL. So we use a 1 third power on the time coordinates and a 1 half power on the space coordinates. So I'm turning R4 into a 10-dimensional space. That's the idea. But it's very natural. But it's very natural. R4 becomes 10-dimensional, and with this metric, the directed landscape becomes holder 1 minus epsilon for every epsilon. What are the 10 dimensions? 3 plus 3 plus 2 plus 2. So how is it weird? 10 dimensions in the sense of how it starts. Yeah. Not 10 degrees of freedom. It's not 10 degrees of freedom or anything like that. Okay, so we have a so this is kind of a follow-up to the previous theorem. If you have a graph satisfying the five rules above that we listed, let n L of G be the set of points in our parameter space, R4 with the time coordinate ordering, whose network graph is given by G. Okay, so then you have a nice formula for the Hausdorff. For the Hausdorff dimension in this funny 1, 2, 3 metric. We can do an exercise. Let's check that this works for the network that we understand best. So this is the trivial network. Going from P to Q. So here I have two vertices. The degree of P is 1, and the degree of Q is 1. So you can check then, I get. So you can check, then I get 2 plus 1 plus 1 over 2, so this is a 2, so I get that that should have dimension 10, which is good because we're in a 10-dimensional space. Yes, sorry. Well, you have the minimum numbers there, right? 211 are the minimum numbers. 211 are the minimum numbers. Everything else is smaller than 10. Exactly. And you can check also, maybe let me fly. The tradition is to take the power of x1 and then take the power of t verture x. Because people have done that for pyrobolic means and what time yes, you could do that as well. Yeah, so there's a choice. This is the natural choice from trying to think of the metric, from trying to think of this as like how circumvention is defined with respect to the metric, which is maybe some other people in direct. People say that count the time. People say that count the time double. That's how they um if you do that then you have to use power one for one and uh double whatever it takes for so presumably if you use the usual notion of house turf dimension you get some formula just not as pretty. If you use the usual notion of house turf dimension then the result is open. I mean you know I could I mean it's not natural. Yes, one, it's not natural. Yes, one, it's not natural. Two, it's, you know, two, I'm not, I would have upper and lower balance, but they don't map. So that's a project for someone to think about if they want to. I think, I mean, this is the more natural choices. You can check also another exercise for your undergraduate graph theory students, check that this is always non-negative. Sometimes it will be zero for certain choices. So if I Choices. So if I have a theorem saying that a set has dimension zero, we should give a bit more content to that. So any time that this right-hand side is zero, this set turns out to be countable. And moment. Sorry? Moment. Non-empty and countable. So countable infinite. Yes. I mean, this is a little bit against my intuition. I mean, I thought if the degree, if the odds of dimension is zero, that means instead of power, we need maybe law. I think the topological dimension is different, but if you talk about Hausa dimension, zero dimension doesn't mean that this means triple step Yeah, okay, so I mean of course you need you need a different argument to establish like once you establish whether the Hausser dimension is zero You need a different argument to establish that it's countable some of it what happens with the with the networks that are countable is there are topological constraints in the space coming from basically coalescence Coming from basically coalescence and planarity, which prevent you from fitting more than counting many options. I think this last sentence is part of the theorem. It's not explaining that if it's zero, it's countable. Because the theorem says when it's zero, it happens to be. That's fine. Okay, that's okay. This is a full. All right. No bins, I guess. No, no, six of the twelve. No. No. Six of the twenty-seven are dense. Oh, five of them. Really? Yeah. Wow. But you have translation men. Wait, but are they dense within themselves? All of them? Or are there some that are like completely? I think so. If you take one, like among the ones that are not yes, if you take one, is there like accumulation near it of the same type? Or are there some that are completely? I think there are some that are completely isolated, but this I need to think a little bit more about. This is a subtler question, but I think there are some that are not done some of themselves. All right, so I want to. I have five minutes, so I'll, and obviously the proof parts are the less interesting stuff. But I want to say, I can't really say too much about the proofs, but I want to give a little bit of a flavor for what goes into this. For what goes into this. So, there's kind of two sides. There's a side which comes from the exact solvable nature of the landscape, where you're going to use some sub-watt RSK combinatorics and some Gibbs resampling ideas. And this side I'm going to ignore, and I'm just going to focus on topological intuition coming from coalescence, just to try and explain a little bit about this formula. So remember. So, remember, in the landscape, we expect geodesics to coalesce. So, we've kind of discussed this earlier. This is a simulation of first-passage percolations. I mean, all of these models we expect geodesics will coalesce. So, in other words, there are not too many good highways for your geodesics to follow. So, morally, what should happen with geodesics between two points is maybe they do some funny stuff at the start. Maybe they do some funny stuff at the start, very close to the points, but quickly they should get onto one of these geodesic highways. And so what that says is the following. So say I take my favorite network that I want to understand. The ends of the network can be special, okay, because P and Q are completely arbitrary, but the interior should be generic. So the interior of this network should basically just follow geodesics between. Should basically just follow geodesics between rational points. So, if I want to understand the Hausdorff dimension of something like this, what I should really try and understand are the rarity of the endpoint configurations, these called geodesic stars. A point P is a geodesic K star if there are K disjoint geodesics that start at P, okay, or end at P. Okay, so that star K. Or NDP. So let's star K be the set of GDS explorers over L. So then how big should the set of networks that look like this be? Well, here's an upper bound. An upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of pairs where you'll get this network is just the Hausdorff dimension of two stars plus the Hausdorff dimension of three stars. But additionally, it's not just enough to put some stars here and connect them with, you know. Connect them with generic rational geodesics. When you do this, you also get certain constraints. So I'm going to get constraints because all of the lengths of these paths need to be the same, because they're all geodesics, they need to all have the same length. And so that gives me constraints on the length. So the lengths around this face need to be the same, the lengths around this face need to be the same, and the lengths around this face need to be the same. And each of those length constraints, if you sort of maybe think. Sort of maybe think about it for long enough, or just trust me, each of those length constraints costs you one in terms of the dimension. So, this is what the Hausdorff dimension of our set here should be. So, in general, you should get a formula like this. So, if I have a geodesic network whose graph is G, source and sync vertices have degree K and L. The house of dimension should be the dimension of the K stars. Be the dimension of the K stars plus the dimension of L stars minus the number of interior faces in this network. So hopefully this is a little bit believable. Okay, so then this maybe we can, so there are a couple of ways to so now hopefully if we believe that we If we believe that we can compute the dimension of these star sets, then we should be able to compute the Hausort dimension of arbitrary networks. Everything is very heuristic. There's nothing proven for this. So this turns out to be something you can do. And then you arrive at, after a little bit of simplification, you arrive at the formula we have. Okay, so because I'm out of time, I'll stop there. No time on all the stuff there. Could you explain this formula again? I mean, the interior faces, what are they? I think you had the previous picture of like. Yeah, maybe, like, here's a. I can say it in a bit more detail. Okay. So say I just want to say I just want to understand how common is it to see this simple GIDSF network. So what I should do is I pay a cost for putting two star at the source vertex. At the source vertex, I pay a cost for putting a two-star at the same vertex. What you should imagine is because there aren't very many highways to follow, that more or less these two lines in the center are going to be fixed. Say they're fixed and they both have length zero. Then what that tells me is if I call this length A, this length B, this length C, and this length D, then I need to have that A plus C. A plus C equals B plus C. So, in addition to just having these two stars, I also am getting a linear constraint. And so I don't get the full space of all pairs of stars. I get the space of all pairs of stars whose weights satisfy one linear constraint and that reduces the dimension by one. That's the idea. And you get one for every interior face. Does the Bow River and Dam look like one of these 27? No, I don't. I think the problem with the Bow River is it does not in the picture that I showed, but it does things like this. Also, it's not really a geodesic in the right sense, but you know, we're gonna close our eyes and just enjoy being in the mountains and bringing. Our eyes and just enjoy being in the mountains and pretend that that's the case. But so these k squared and L squared, that's just because you only have three options in the phi, four, two, the in? Pretty much. That's nice. Yeah, you get a nice formula. Yeah, so this is, but the formula simplifies because of because you only have 542, so you can write it as a clipping number. The number of geodesics can range from one to nine, right? The number of total. The number of total G addresses between two points can range from one to nine. You can pick your favorite statistic. You can compute it with a zero if you want. Why do you have a fixed dial? Why do they exist? Yes, why do they exist? Okay, there's actually a good example of this in the let me try and explain this. It's really topological why well It's really topological why all of these things exist. But you can imagine the following thing. Let me give an example, not from the landscape, but from the Rocky Mountains. So if you... This is Canada, and then you've got the US under here. Okay. This is Mexico, I guess. This is Mexico. So at every point, every, if you, I think this is called like water basins or something like that. If you pick like a point in Canada, water will flow to one of three oceans. It will either flow to the Arctic Ocean, it will flow to the Atlantic, or it will flow to the Pacific. And then you can draw the regions where these things flow. And so they look like maybe this. Well, and so they look like, you know, maybe this part flows to the this part flows to the Pacific. Maybe this part flows to the Atlantic and this part flows to the Arctic. And you will have a point where these three faces meet, where you can flow to any one of these three locations. This is on the Ice Fields Parkway in the Rocky Mountains. You can drive there to go to this point. Rocky Mountains, you can drive there to get to this point if you want to. And there's your three-star in the Rockies, and they exist for similar reasons in the directive landscape. You can turn this. I won't say you can turn this into a proof, but the proof doesn't look too far off, actually. And maybe I'll say on these guys, these would all be two stars here, these sorts of things. Yes? So if you consider. Yes. So so if you consider the the dual along with this one, does it give any interesting question or this says everything about the maybe maybe it does. I haven't thought to uh um I haven't thought about what questions about the dual would be. I mean, okay. I guess you're thinking about like take one I guess you're thinking about take one infinite tree of geodesics and look at the dual tree. So it's a little bit of a, you're somehow not seeing, you're not seeing all the behavior because you're just restricting to one tree, but you can also look at the duals of all trees sometimes. Maybe there's something there. I haven't thought in this direction. Now I'm not sure what I asked. Okay. Yeah. I have a stupid question and we have a fun feature. Those are the best types of. And the other future? That's the question. So, I like the river example, the ball river, because it starts off as a geodesic, but then it starts forming the landscape itself. Is anybody aware of a model which can do that? We're already into the time for Ivan's talk, so why don't we take a couple minute break now and come back at five for
