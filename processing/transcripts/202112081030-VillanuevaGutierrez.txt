Okay, many graces for the presentation and for the invitation. Subaru an update and contract in the university in October. So, it is not software. But I don't know how. Okay. So this platform is about a book that scribes a postdoc in Heidelberg, where a co legacy that Michael Futerer and well is. Well, it's oriented so that Chavos de Latin America, Spanish Atlantes. When I was there and professed a little in the treatment, but also the lectures that want to be in materials, you are to continue. To continue. What is the relations between objects, the functions, and the paid functions? This is explicit that. Interaction that is the conjecture of principles that are a tool that we are working for more and for vials. So, we first have functions in complex function. Emily and the code. We have considered We consider a series of things that are expression of this form, a series of complexities, about the essence. And then, well, existing regions in the complex planet where this can converge and define its analytic functions. And the series satisfaction the coefficients of the series satisfaction the multiplicative relation of the series multiplicative. Multiplicative relationship, so the idea has an expression of this form. It is a product of Euler, as Elia, and when we continue the analytical analysis to a very complex planet, we have a function. So, this is how the example is more sensitive. For example, how we do, if you consider the function. Y concided the function for the expression that riba is that converges to all the numbers complex with real que one and with the equation functionality one can continue to allow complex with a simple one. Here Here obviously, well, the coefficients complete the multiplicative condition, and one of the things interesting because there are the trivials that are medium. But also, you are interested. Bastant interests and one of these for example is the values in the negative standards for the numeros of the obvious negatives. Y the nominos of the parents are also ya ten seros that are the seros trivial, if yaman, but well for the other rational numbers, and that is not because the functions are transcendent and well, the patron is. This is a patron supreme. So, a first connection, we have a analytic, with a conflict with the algorithm, and that is the tips of the numerous tips. We have the series of vigilts. And we can extend a function of all natural functions. Function of all natural functions put in great relatives and the society of Rigled as here. So, for example, in the case of the Riglet, the Functions Arima de la City of Rigled Association. And obviously, well, the coefficients are a nomorphism, the character, the multiplicative approach, and we have a product of Europe, and if the character is trivial, we converge to all the complex numbers with reality that. And not only characters, not only the continuation continues and also morphs all complex. And the part of this interest is new: the palores of these functions in the negative standards for the numbers of generalized numbers. The numbers will generate, and In general, the generalized general and what we have a form of contraries is a formula, calculating the idea. And their numbers algebraic numbers, and well, one of the numbers algebraic, their numbers algebraic numbers that depend on the characters, but they are not going to be there. Mucho pero. The important thing or the election, Chido is that numbers. Chido is that number. All right. We have this context of the functions of their functions definitive in the complexity. In the private numbers, first Um this variable rationale the potential of P and a prime, a potential of P is. Another potential of Porciona who denominated and denominated a top of this definition practices where a rational society, the potential of P for what the factorizam and y. So with this, well, Well, definitely the valuation is infinite if only if the number 0, it is infinitely divisible by P and the valuation have the valuation of the product is the sum of the valuations, and the valuation of the sum is more like the minimum of the valuation of caden loses. Cadeno los humans. So, using this evaluation can induced a definitive like this here, it is the priority and with this metric we define a campo, which is the priority that implementes the completed cup with respect to this metric. In this campo, there structure. Structuras subscriptions important, like the terrorists that replicate the numbers priorities in the circular or unitary disk, ideal maximal ideas, which are restricted in the unitary discount and the residual queue the enterprise for the idea maximal queen is the campo definitely compete. The campo definitely comped elements. All right. Lo queamos sera ahora es que vamoso superner que pennos y valados, because all the things that the sounds parapelados unico primo que espar hace el las cosasas muchísimos complicadas. So So, those are what different two. So, what do you say? It's the idea, aimed at the congregations of Cumberland. We have a view that one is a calculation for P. If ML satisfaction is not congruent to one, where the function of Euler Euler, number of divisors of Nonces are congruencia, no, it is a congruencia great, but what really is what is or what is decide for all epsilon, existor that this pattern is what is that the function of. But of the PSA. Analytica, but in the priority. And like the conjugate in especially in the past, you can extend this function, continue in all the priorities in the world, and we can define this function, this is how the FDS between a name. FDEC between them. Well, one of the proprietors, obviously, así is that function evaluated in one where a multiple of one. Un multiple of its own interpol the values of the function setting a factor of Euler, but it is normal because we are having the world. It is here the chist that is interpolating the values in the negative para toddler, which is. In here that is faggot, this multiplied. So, also what are the equivalence one can define functions that are interpolating the values of the functions? So, functions prior to functions that interpolate these values. And in general, one can have functions. So, ramas and functions that are definites of the numbers of generalized numbers, and with a character there act on some terminals, which have the character of tax mull character of taximulars una implemented a section of the projection of the invertible elements in the numeros in the private. Pericles to the invertible elements in the finite elements. It is a experience like a map that compures with the prediction of the identity. So, we have a function that is or functions that are extrapolating as. The negatives of the center, and of the other standards like the functions. So, that's very complicated, and the words that when. And the words that when expressions are very complex, the synthetic strategy, and the technology, what just allows this manner as conceptual and how we can do it.  This infinitesimals and consideramos the infinite extension on the society that this group is isomorphic to the invertible practice and the character cyclotomic characteristics where the cyclotomic character is gustamente. This morphism is more elementary, because the vase associated where this or X are races. Well, we have this morphism and whatever can be. And what I can see is that every character of this group is the form of the character of Taj Müller, which is what we interiorly pour a potential of the cyclotomic. So here, because the character is a very good. Character type of laminos unless the character is okay. So we have what character is the product of these two with their respect with a potential. It is what demonstrating Leopold and Cubota is that existing continua function.  One of the functions, so the palor in a las functions that we have visto and obviously, well, what we want is gustamente que satisfaga esta forma de interpolación. So, the valid function in this character, esjustamente, este expression. This expression que espueno valor de funcion of diriglet in one of the negatives. And well here that character of the definite character in this case is in the group of Galu. The group of Galois of the Campos and Plutómic. So, what is the moraleja that well functions that apiri, well, the conclusions of cumber congruence, defining a functions that are spacious the formula of interpolation with the formula. Interpretation with the functions and if you have complicated things, but it changes the domino, like do not more clear what natural nature is natural to mend with. So we know that the group of this extension of raises of the unity about the campus of the rational cosa tremendous. But that group factorized or component in 2010 where And γ, where γ is the group of Galois groups of this extension infinite extension about the cyclotomic. And so, we definitely find the algebra of Guo limit inverse groups, where their groups normal groups construct. Algebraic standard that basically, like what great constructs, known as their normal group. And well, a character of the group, the enteros to the paddocks, the album the paid non-nulls. No, in 2009, of the Iguasagua Jebraca de Cupe. And then para element in the chat, we can define how their valor in a character evaluated in the element. You are good here, it's like. So, your aquarium, it's like, but it's a definition standard and that you can see the idea because it is the same. There, but that, but we have a divorce. An element of the fines of the group of characters of this group of galaxies the private numerous private, So, we hear like the groups of intermediates of this extension that we are considering and defining, and you have the elements of this verse of the era. So, definitely these elements and Elements and summas that are basically in this group and limited inverse tambie of the good manera because well there have been cued because we are grabbing coefficients in two and then an element. Obtain their element in this algebra, and it gave a encapsion and encapsulated one. And so this mud one practically preguntas que es y bueno es un elemento de cupe er. But what is the check of Yuazaba? And the result that gustamentes are one, it is an element of the model, which is Hm. Well, pass with these four results that we. And we demonstrate that a character of infinite characters and in my valor of a valid character is an interpolation of the function of digital function. Of the function of society to the character of the first location and the academic congruence of cumber, like one to the functions like. How context, perhaps implemente interpolar, and the change in domino, but the interpretation of Rome and the others and good functions. Functions is an element of infinite group formada about the campus numerals that are good, so extension cyclotomics. So, extension cyclotomic extensions of coup, and this is Chile. And well, the children are functioning, and how we can define the function in the group characters, right? So, there is the functions complex function, it relations with the functions of the priorities. But if the numerous first or peep, however, explicitly originally unidentified that for me, we are objects together, but also arithmetic, you see. So, what the subjects are important on what we want. So, record that this group is the group of infinite cyclotomic cycles, about two, and isomorphism the The piano invertible practice. And these priorities component as the model for a copy of all the priorities. So intuitively, but So definitely like subcampo dextension infinity by delta. So the delta that we have definitely is what results that the group of galaxies of cusses. The group of galaxies of course are cues and groups topologically to the group of private numbers, of the private sector. So, thereby, like the campo debates that are the rational areas, consider an extension infinite of the total raises. And then we are a part, like a part of the torsion, and what we do is an extension that is a group of gallo groups, is just like paradigms. How some practicals are impressionants. And definitely, like the heir, as the unicorn of campo, that grado press on the campo basically for two, but to numerous queer campo numeros a infinite extension of the rationales. Of the rational podemos to be the same construction and simplement to the extension, we la set up extensions asylum of the rationales, and also we generate a setup extensions. And well, all the campuses in the All the campuses in number one of these extensions and infinite extensions. That's your chid, like no, that special case, this aveces space. No, it's still a decas, and there are camps of numbers that have more, and that depends on the grado of the campus on the general and. And well, for a setup extension, we are here to relic their campo de la setup extension, so that their group of groups is more than the group of the enterprise. Are classical students a number of extensions, and so have the group of classes of cadaver of the finites of your extension. And for the result that I Describir, how crece the part of the group of classes of the campos finitos, of the campos in the extension. And you work this formula, so the exponent of the order in the group is. This number more Lambda porre mas nú. Lambda are in the discernment and goods to errors integrated because there is ramifications, because well, when there are like ramification. Ligamos mala en algún sentido algunas propidades, no pieces inro, no severe apriori como quales el comportamiento. But resuciente integrange, no. Um And we have considering the algebra of Guasagua on the result that the algebra of Guasagua in this case is. And the result that modules of algebra has a theorem. A theorem, how the groups finitely generated, like a part of the book, and have a part of the torsion, and this is what this term modulo and its morphism. That well, when they are technical, but Technical, but in general, as the pencil is that all group modulo, lambda modulo infinite mode of general models, a modulo, more factors and these factors are two forms. Formas, our factors are coccients of Lambda modulo una potential P and other son coconutes of Lambda modulo, where people are polynomials in the world. And however, how do we also part of the mathematics important? Of mathematics, the important characteristic polynomials in this case the idea of characteristic in the check of Iguasaba generated by the product of all product of all polynomials. And just Lambda that standards for these expressions. Ah, well, but this is for verse es como una spoiler, but But here the chist is that limited parts of the group of classes of cadence, the finites of your extension, and not limit inverse of these parts, these parts of classes, and result that. Result that resulted is a lambda modulo of torsion mode. You decided that this part is not parents, and then in circles, can be with arguments of sense to calculate what recovery of the parties the group of classes. People parties in the group of classes, with sense. So, this chido because we have the arithmetic here to the classes and what is dividend los groups of classes. Practically the groups of classes, which is midiendo, is a queen. Here, the fundamental arithmetic in a campus numbers. So, central groups are more than the fundamental arithmetic. The group of classes of rational classes, etc., well, it's trivial, and well, what And well, what I know is like that passing that are rapidly the group of classes. In this part, well, the idea is that only with us the part, but well, we have to go information and. And so we have what is the relationship between arithmetic and functions LPA and here that the arithmetic groups of classes, but many more important things that the group of classes object, this object in the This limit that results in a modulo of torsion models, like my construction, and that allows us to do things. That is the arithmetic. What is the relationship between that object? This class of objects with the functions. With the functions of the paid podcast, because also we grabbed it, the podium las functions in the paid functions, like the Gozagua. And just here, there is like patrones and all the investigations in the area, and not finalize the challenge that more. Massive as the demonstration of the news because I would say like other congress to be here the important things like the principle. So, one modulus relations. Modulos over the air of Iguaza, definemos, the super space where the complex actuation permenos one and the principle, because we have the ideal in this sub algebra or submodulo of iguas agua que lambda g element. That's lambda here. So characteristic of this object arithmetic, especially the idea generated or basically the function for. The denominator that you have to read, it is like all cuadra and all the elements of the wow as well and if you have no como y Yes, for example, one voyage of two consequences that explain because the time first and the first is the criteria of Cumberland. So what criteria of Cumberland are.  This chido porque justamente, well podría es que proves that it ramificated, but have consequences or chidas. So that impression, because. This is tengo functions set the function set of ribbon function and how it has to see with matrices aleatoria. So, yes, like the function set, but insisting a function. On the function complex, transcendental transcendence, it general with something that unidate the more aesthetic, the more symmetrical that you can. Well, for the fact that I can see that if you live in classes. So So, y result that also codified not all these arithmetic and simple parts where the complex concept. And the result that. If one of these components like a potential so this order, if only if one of these  Permenos are not a model of finites or trivial finances, and can use this proprietary to see if they have a character of this form. So the value of the games of the function paid in the character. In the character, it is a number of invertible. If only if this factor and zero and also that one can see that if the character cyclotomic character and Cyclotomic, like this functional character cyclotomic character has been terminated or. Mino, or correspondent, and potential to this factors, and we can regard the summary to summarize, a part, and describe if we characterize a potential cyclotomic character with this. With this conjugate, like in our congruence, it is a multiple. So, we have the form of the interpolation that the value of the function in this character is the function set in one. Unovenos factor of bueno. It's a list. So we have the how. And we have the terminal, one, the porcelain, that valor of the function set, this in the past and invertible. So, we know that it is a number. So, we are traditional, but now we want to know that they are the consequences of the concept principle that also. Um si um Yes and many. Your tienel extension has the campo enumerus what campaigns. When the extension set up cyclotomic in the case of the numeros rational races, we know that the igual serum. So, that is That in group of classes do not create super exponential superpower or whatever, as recordamos que esa la formula tenás como es factor como exponential factor, but that formula as the exponent of the order, no. So And we were a tool that the extension cyclotomic extension associated with the extension cyclotomic extension is a modulo model very So we paraito, but just Ferrari Washington, like in the 2000s, the great demonstration that extension of Europe is too serious. That also demonstrates complicated demonstrations, but you. Complicated, but justamente use the principle and the voyage of jar, no several percentage, percentage of no because we don't know how to. Just a little cortos and time. But it was a great presentation, and that is the most logic. Well, I mean, that is the first thing. We launched discussions during the past and cafe, a question in the public. In the public in this moment, when the chat, like the salad, if not this here, we can see the power and all the presents of video and platform a little.
