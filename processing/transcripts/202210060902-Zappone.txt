Okay, good. So today I'm going to show some experimental work done on phase frustration and the appearance of what we believe is an intermediate state in thin semantic films. So no, it's early, so let's start with the easy things. You all know what pneumatic is, and so I will just point out something very I would just point out something very fundamental: is that in animatic, you have this director, molecular director, and you can describe the deformation using these three fundamental modes, splay, twist, and bend. But when you try to superpose a molecular density modulation, so to create a symmetric phase, let's say the cymetic A phase, then Then the twist and bend mode forbidden. Let's say they cost a lot of energy. And the reason for that can be easily understood if you consider the usual description of the seismic order parameter as a complex number rho. Here I write it as psi times e to the i phi. Psi is the amplitude of the density modulation and phi is the phase. Phi is the phase, and see in the ground state of the symmetric A phase, the gradient of the phase is parallel to n with a constant proportionality factor. And so if you try to take the rotor of n that appears in twist and bend, and you rely, you try to do it on this expression, you realize that. That you cannot have this expression and the rotor of n different from zero. So, in order to have twist and bend, you should either have a non-uniform spacing between the symmetric layers, the maxima and the density modulation, or you need to have the director tilted with respect to the phase phi. And so you can say that twist and bend distortion frustrate the magnetic phase. The bismetic phase. They are inherently conflicting with the phase structure. And so, whenever you have bend and twist in a liquid crystal and you enter the temperature range where the cymatic phase should appear, this bend and twist should be expelled from the liquid crystal. And this, I know it's a common knowledge in liquid crystal, but it takes Liquid crystal, but it takes a very interesting turn when you consider the transition from the nematic to the semantic phase. Because in the nematic, the bend and twist phase can exist without any problem. And then when you reach the dysmetric phase, the cymatic phase inherits these distortions and has to decide what to do with them. So the obvious The obvious, I mean, the common answer to this problem is to consider confocal domains, right? So these are a solution to the problem where the symmetric layers are all equally spaced. And if they're flat, they're just like here, like the trivial flat stack. If they're curved, they can take one of these other forms. There are other confocal shapes. Are other confocal shapes that I have not shown in this slide, but let's say the most common are what they call the rolls or the concentric cylinders and the focal codic domains, where the semantic layers are curved, I mean the centers of curvature of the semantic layers lie on two different lines, the ellipse and the hyperbola. So, this is all well known, but But I would like to stress that these shapes do not fill space uniformly. And in particular, when you try to put these shapes so as to keep the layer spacing constant, and so you try to pack these confocal shapes, confocal domains in a semectic, you inevitably create defects at the domain boundary between two Domain boundary between two neighboring confocal domains. And you can also appreciate that in these confocal stacks or confocal sets, you cannot have a plane where the director is normal to the plane over the entire plane. And this has consequences when you try to confine semantic lipid crystals in a film geometry, where you have, for instance, a surface, a plane surface that induces a A plain surface that induces homotropic anchoring. So, what happens when you confine, when you do confine semantics in a film is that you tend to get dense arrays of this confocal domains. And this has been known for a very long time. In fact, this year marks a century since Friedel. Inferred the structure of the semantic phase by just looking at confocal domains. So, happy birthday to that, a century-old idea that went a very long way. But more recently, this confocal domain has been studied for their ability to create this very regular arrays or very large surface areas. And here you have two. And here you have two not so recent examples where you can see each domain as a symmetric circular shape. These domains have been obtained, the interface between a substrate that induces degenerate planar anchoring and an interface with air or with a glass slide that induces somatropic anchoring. And so no surprise, these domains have a these domains these domains have a toroidal focalconic domains with a symmetry of revolution around the hyperbola that it degenerates into a straight vertical line and then they they self-assemble into this close-packed arrays that are they have a they have a honeycomb appearance and when the top surface is actually the interface with air you can study the depression The depression at the free interface. So, this hexagonal arrays have been used many applications in the last, I would say, 10, 15 years. You have microlens arrays, arrays of singular lenses, let's say, to create optical vortices, or patterned surfaces for soft lithography. Soft lithography. And you can also control the structure of the interface by sublimating and condensating liquid crystal molecules at the interface. But the focus of my topic is not on this toroidal focal coin domain, but rather is what happens when you confine a smatic look. You confine a symmetric liquid crystal between a surface that induces unidirectional or non-degenerate planar anchoring and another interface that induces normal anchoring. So there is one obvious, sorry. So experimentally, this was done for the first time, I guess, in this paper here. And you see that you still have an hexagonal, more or less. Hexagonal, more or less, array, but each element of this array is not symmetric anymore. So the in-plane isotropy in the surface breaks in the direction of the planar easy axis. And so we tried this also many times using HCB and the interface between air and Interface between air and a rubbed polymer. And again, you can see, you can appreciate how the shape of these domains is not toroidal anymore. Because in fact, what you get is a complex structure that we call a square focal conic domain. It has more or less this shape. And if you're interested, you can look at this paper from 2012. From 2012. But what's really interesting for me, and this is really the point of this talk, is that there is another way of building, let's say, of filling asymptotic film with confocal domains. And it consists in creating this oil strict pattern where you have half rolls like this. Like this, joined by these grain boundaries B. With us at the center, you have this disclination blue lines C. So this OLI pattern, OLI street pattern, it's a linear one-dimensional pattern, so has been observed relatively recently compared to focal conic domains and for the first time. Uh, domains and for the first time in Emmanuel Lacaz group, but then they have been observed at the interface between air and various substrate inducing planar anchoring, such as MOS2, mica, also rubbed polymers, and also the And also, they have been observed for a variety of different semantics. I'm talking about semantic A liquid crystal here. Here you see OCB that is related very closely to HCB, but also these two compounds that have a very different molecular structure. And you can obtain this linear 1D patterns even in closed cells. Cells, as we did a few years ago. This is, for example, HCB sandwiched between a glass slide coated with rubbed polymer and another slide coated with a monolayer of silane that induces some atropic anchoring. So, oh, and recently by using a photo-aligning polymer, Chinese group was able to. The Chinese group was able to guide the direction of this 1D pattern and actually write on a substrate in a very controlled way. There are some very general results about the formation of this 1D pattern. And so they always appear when the film thickness. Appear when the film thickness is relatively small and the anchoring, the planar anchoring, is non-degenerate. Whereas for thicker films, we usually get focal conic domain patterns, 2D patterns. Also, in both the 1D and the 2D pattern, the period of the pattern decreases as the film thickness decreases. As you can see it here for eight OCB. It here for eight OCB with this substrate surfaces here, or this is another example where the homeotropic interface was just the interface with air. So these really are general observations about the formation of 1D patterns that so far have been observed in every time you have. In every time you have both 2D and 1D patterns. And so, for a long time, especially with Emmanuel Lacaz, we tried to understand what was inside this 1D pattern, what was the internal structure, and over the time, she first proposed some models, and then we proposed together Proposed together models that were increasingly more complicated until at some point we realized that it was not a single model of internal structure. In fact, it depends a lot on the surfaces you're considering. For instance, if you consider an open film with an air interface of molybdenite, you get a slightly different internal structure compared to a mica substrate. Substrate. And you consider, if you consider a polymer substrate, it's yet another structure. And if you consider closed films with two glass boundaries, it's yet another structure. So I will not talk very much about that also because Emmanuel talked about it in conjunction with nanoparticle confinement. So I will just go straight to the point. Sorry, no, no. Uh, straight to the point. Sorry, I don't know what is this doing here. This is just a repetition. Um, so my point here is that in the study of 1D pattern, there may be something that is very deeply related to the structure of the semantic phase and the behavior of liquid crystal of the transition from the semantic to the From seismectic to the nematic phase. So, as you, I mean, I guess most of you know, it was Dejen in 1972 who proposed this brilliant analogy between the transition between the symmetric phase and the pneumatic phase, and the transition between the normal state of a metal and the superconductor. Of a metal and the superconductor state of a metal. The analogy was based on a formal analogy between the Landau Ginspur free energy expansion in the two cases. And just to be more specific, this is considered during the case where the liquid crystal is confined between two flat interfaces. One induces omotropic anchoring and the other one induces... Omotropic anchoring and the other one induces planar anchoring. And so you have a splay-band distortion here in the nematic phase, but no twist. Okay, this is simplifies a bit the discussion. So you can write down a frank elastic energy like that in the hematic phase, and then you go into semantic phase. And you have these other terms that are due to the gen describing the symmetic order parameter. And in particular, this. And in particular, this third term that couples the semantic order parameter to the pneumatic director. So, Dejen said, based on this expression, we can draw an analogy with superconductors where the director n is analog to magnetic vector field, the rotor of n is analog to the magnetic field, psi, the amplitude of the density. The amplitude of the density modulation in the symmetric phase is analog to the density of Cooper pairs in a superconductor. And you can imagine that the phase diagram of a metal that has a normal and superconductive state somehow resembles the phase diagram of a liquid crystal. Liquid crystal undergoing the transition from the hematic to the matic phase. To be more precise, in this phase diagram, you have here on the x-axis is the temperature and T0 in the pneumatic semantic transition temperature for an undistort bulk symptom. And here you have the magnetic field. So, in the analogy with liquid crystals, the normal state is necessary. The normal state is the pneumatic state where you have no say the value of this psi is zero, so the superconductor or the density modulation is zero. The analogous of the superconductor phase is the symmetric phase. And in between, you have this mixed phase where all the interesting stuff happens. So, what actually happens here depends on the type of superconductor. For instance, in a type 2 superconductor, you create a phase that contains a lot of... Oh, I'm running out of time. Yes. Okay. So it contains this abricos of lattice and And the gen analogy was led to the conclusion that there must have been a similar phase in liquid crystal, and this phase turned out to be the twist-grain boundary phase. But in fact, the twist-grain boundary phase is for what they call, what we can call type 2 liquid crystal. Liquid crystal, whereas you know, most liquid crystals should be of type one. So, let me show you what happens in a superconductor where you have type one superconductor. When you apply a magnetic field, there is a spontaneous formation of this mesh structure. Sometimes they are polygonal structures. Some other times they have this linear meandering appearance. Appearance. And so the question that we ask ourselves is: why don't we see that? Why don't we see the intermediate state in, for instance, in HCB or 8OCB, all these small molecule liquid crystal compounds that we've been using for a very long time. And to test, I mean, it was DeGen itself that proposed how to test it. He said, just put a liquid crystal between two plates that induce different anchoring direction. Anchoring direction and the so you induce a splate band deformation, and then you can equate the band amplitude that is more or less proportional to one over the thickness of the film. The band amplitude should act on the liquid crystal in much the same way as the magnetic fields acts on a metal at the transition to the superconductive state. So, we can read this diagram exactly as a liquid crystal diagram where you place pneumatic here. Diagram where you place pneumatic here, semantic here. This, the field is now the band field that is inversely proportional to the film thickness. And here you expect some kind of mixed state that should be the equivalent of what is formed in a type 1 superconductor or an intermediate state. So, what we did, we did exactly that. So, we prepared films with different thickness and we studied how the transition depended on the bend of the film. Transition depended on the band deformation. So, in particular, what we did is we prepared film with two levels, two thicknesses, by creating a step in the film. And so this is a film with hybrid anchoring condition, and the darker region corresponds to a thinner part. And you see that as you cool down from the pneumatic phase, the pneumatic phase first appears untextures, and as you cool down, The thick part evolves into a focalconic texture, and the thin part evolves into something else. That's the 1D pattern that I was talking about. We call it P or P texture. And you can even cross two steps in a sample and have four different thicknesses in a sample, and you invariably see that this trend, that thick regions produce chronic domains. Thick regions produce conic domains, thin regions produce 1D patterns, and the thickness, sorry, the period of the 1D pattern decreases as the film thickness decreases. So since there is this analogy, this formal analogy, we can try to see what the where we should have a transition from a From a normal pneumatic state into the intermediate state. And so we made the hypothesis that the 1D pattern was nothing else than the intermediate state. And so we tried to relate the temperature where we see the appearance of the 1D pattern to the thickness of the The thickness of the film where the pattern appears, and we were very pleased to see that, in fact, you can draw a theoretic line using all the material parameters for HCB that are known. And they allow you to calculate, for instance, the correlation length, the band penetration length, and the condensation condition. The condensation condition translates into directly into this one. And so, in the end, the conclusion. And so, in the end, the conclusion was that the phase diagram of HCD, that what we studied in more detail, is very similar to that of a superconductor. You have an hematic phase here for high temperature and high values of the band distortion. Then you have the symmetric phase for small temperatures and small values of the band. And in between, you have something, this p-phase or intermediate state. Phase or intermediate state that is analogous to the intermediate state of a superconductor. Although in a liquid crystal, you see somehow sometimes a coexistence between these p-state clusters of the semantic phase. And so, if we want to describe this in terms of layers and internal structure, we are, I mean, we're not very far. Very far into the understanding of the detailed understanding of what's going on. But you can imagine something like this. You have a confocal domains, for instance, a large roll here with a discrimination. This is a cut, a vertical cut through the semantic. And so the planar anchoring is along this direction. Okay, my time is over. And you see, you have defects in the director. For instance, you can imagine that there is a plus one-half defect here and a minus one-half defect here. And around the minus one-half defect and below where you have the two roles touching each other, this is a region with a lot of band distortion. And we believe that the intermediate state or this one department. Immediate state or this 1D pattern that we form is a phase where you have symptic confocal domain that are intercalated with domains of undercooled nematic. That's the pink region. We're not 100% sure where this nematic is, but all the analysis points to the fact that the appearance of the 1D path. The appearance of the 1D pattern is strictly related to the appearance of this intermediate phase. So I just want to say briefly that you can induce the same transition by applying an electric field to a hybrid cell. More specifically, if you have hybrid alignment like this without applied field and you cool in the semantic phase, you obtain. In the symmetric phase, you obtain focal domains. Whereas, if you apply a field and you cool in the symmetric phase, you obtain this 1D pattern. And the reason is that when you apply an electric field, you're confining the display band distortion in a narrow region, narrow layer close to the planar surface with a thickness comparable to the electric coherence length. The electric coherence length that goes as one over the electric field magnitude. So you can control whether you have a 2D structure or a 1D pattern by simply increasing the electric field intensity. And in fact, I was very happy to the idea of presenting new results, but I ran out of time and I'm just flushing it here. So we're now. Here. So we're now able to produce switching from 2D patterns to 1D pattern in planar cells. So HCB cells or symmetric liquid crystal cell where you have planar anchoring on both surfaces. And you can also make a twist, twisted surface, a twisted anchoring surface. Surface, a twisted anchoring surface, so where the anchoring direction are crossed on 90 degrees of the two boundaries. And you see that the 1D pattern forms in this case, and it follows the direction of dictated by the planar anchoring, the planar easy axis. So this pattern really is located at the surface and is due to the fact that you squeeze display band distortion close to the planar surface. What we do not understand, though, this is why this is not. Though, this is why this has not been published yet, although the measurements are more than three years old, is that we don't understand what happens when you cool from the symmetric phase, you cross the undistorted bulk pneumatic transition temperature, because you have a sort of transient thing where transient behavior here is in the transmittance of the film, where the film remains apparently nematic. Apparently pneumatic and untextured, textured, until at some critical or threshold temperature, you have the appearance of this 1D domain. So we've started doing some really beginner theory, but we're nowhere near a solution. So just to conclude, I think I think it's interesting to point out that the dynamic phase transition has been studied a lot. Like Jonathan Seninger was saying yesterday, I guess, or two days ago. The transition has been studied a lot in the 70s and the 80s, but by looking at thermodynamic fluctuations and critical phenomena in samples that were. Examples that were uniform, okay, with a uniform director. Whereas in these studies, we are testing the response of the material to applied surface anchoring interactions and electric fields as the material undergoes the phase transition. And this is, I think, interesting for the theory in general, but for application. In general, but for application is interesting because it helps understand where nematic regions may be and how they could possibly interact with stuff that we put in this magic liquid crystal, like Emmanuel was showing yesterday. Because these magic patterns can be used to organize nanoparticles. I have to say, just to conclude, that many of the To conclude, that many of the theoretical questions are still open in the work that I'm trying to develop is to understand what happens when you have in presence of defects, because it is pretty simple to imagine what happens when you have a defect with a, let's say, at this. With a let's say a dislocation in the nematic phase, sorry, disclination in the nephematic phase with a strength one-half, and then you go in the semantic phase, you kind of grow these layers around the disclination without changing topology or anything. You just continuously deform the director to do that. But when you have something like that and you try to go in the aesthetic phase, then this creates a problem. And I think this is a very, this is at the core of the problem. The core of the problem that we are tackling in studying 1D patterns. Just to give a few acknowledgements, this work was developed mainly by Atila Mamouk, who is now in Turkey, and Irina Green, who is also in Turkey. And with the support of Roberto Bartolino, who is the head of our Libyan Crystal Lab, who was is now retired, and Emmanuel. Retired and Emmanuel has been around a lot for discussion, stimulating discussion. And if you're wondering where I'm from, this is the map of Italy drawn using just food. And we're from here, so from the spassy part. Thank you for your attention. Thanks very much, John, really interesting data. There are about five minutes for questions. There are about five minutes for questions. All right, I'll get started. Do you know what happens at the boundary between this 2D and 1D regions? What do you mean the boundary? So we have these steps, this sells you the step, and then you can have these areas with a two-dimensional pattern and the one-dimensional pattern. What happens at the boundary? What happens at the boundary? There is a sharp boundary. So this makes me think that it's a 1D transition when you go. Sorry, not 1D. It's not a continuous evolution from 1D to 2D. So you have a sharp boundary. And there's also some kind of, I don't know if it's a pre-transitional phenomena or some different phenomena, where instead of having Where instead of having these 1D patterns perpendicular to the anchoring direction, for a very small temperature interval, you have the lines forming parallel to the anchoring direction. So you have to imagine this. You're pulling from the nematic phase, and then in the semantic phase, you either create 2D foca coinic domain patterns or 1D OI street patterns. And when you go into the one, And when you go into the 1D pattern, before having the 21D in this direction, you first have some kind of striation in the perpendicular direction. Okay. And so this is all I can say about boundaries and pre-transitional phenomena that we observe. You can also see sometimes Sometimes, especially in the absence of a film, actually, only in the absence of a film, when you use the 2D, 1D confinement by just reducing the thickness of the film, you can clearly see that focal conic, I mean, pieces of focal conic array, it's like if they became trapped in the 1D pattern. So you have this lines with Lines with spots or patches of focal cloning domains. So they somehow stay at equilibrium, but I cannot tell you if this is like a nucleo of a phase staying in another phase or if the patches are just stuck there because there is some impurity or imperfection on the surfaces. Why are you calling it type one? What are you calling it type one? Are you calling it type one because it doesn't have any topological defects? Yeah, I'm calling it type one because it's the only missing thing in the only missing phase in the story. We don't see anything that resembles an ordered array of elementary defects, like in the abricoso phase or the teeth brain boundary phase. The test-brain boundary phase. We don't see that. We see, and most of all, I mean, it's, we call it type one because the liquid crystal is supposed to be type one. Because if you look at the, you know, there is this parameter, the Landau-Ginsburg parameter that tells you whether the transition from one state to another, but for say, state to another fact for say the high temperature nematic phase to the low temperatures mixed phase is going to give you a Brikosov pattern or not. It's called K or Ginsburg parameter and the Ginsburg parameter for HCB is type one. How small is it? I have to say also most of the theoretical work has been done by Work has been done by quite a few years ago by Chuck Rosenblatt and Rolf Pechek, where they studied the type 1 behavior of ACB. They also have evidence of this phase. Basically, there are two papers. I mean, our paper and their paper claiming that we have a type 1 phase. So it's, I'm open to other suggestions of what it could be, especially we don't, because we don't have a very detailed reconstruction of the internal structure. We don't have X-ray data, for instance, yet. So in superconductors, sorry? No, go ahead. What's the value of the Ginsburg parameter in 8 CB? Oh, I. It's that there is a threshold value that I don't remember now in the theory. Yeah, that's it. And so if you calculate it for HCV, it's in the down in the region where it should be type 1. Or type 1 superconductors don't have mixed phases, right? Yeah. I know the theory is a lot more complicated. Exactly. I know. Right, exactly. I know. I know. But that's, don't you think that's because in the superconductor, the gauge field can go to zero and there doesn't have to be any periodicity. If the gauge field goes to zero, then the periodicity of the superconductor goes away. You can just have a constant value of the phase. But smectics can't do that. And that's because N is not a gate. Because N is not a gauge field and N is a unit vector. And so, well, so the analogy is imprecise. Let's say a mathematician would be afraid to call it mapping. It's not a morphism. We can call it a different name. No, no, analogy, analogy is perfect. I have to say, we are. I have to say, we are doing experiments and finding things that are hard to explain by just considering by just avoiding considering the fact that it's a complicated transition. And some of the things, I mean, we believe can be, let's say, captured more or less with the gen theory because it's simple, right? But I'm not a theoretician at all. I'm not a theoretician at all. Just try to understand what the theory is. But part of the reason why I'm talking to you and to this conference is because I really would like to share thoughts with people who know the story better than me. I mean, this goes very far, can go very far into the theory of pneumatic transition, and we're not equipped at all. And we're not equipped at all from the point of view of theory to deal with all the fine points. So I called it type one. I think everybody understands it's not type two. It doesn't perhaps be something in between, but it's something new that has not been studied and found before in thermotropic liquid crystal such as HCB, except perhaps in this paper by Chuck Rosenblatt from basically 15 years ago. Basically, 15 years ago. Thanks very much, Bruno, again. So now we have the second speaker. Jessica, start the recording. Yes.
