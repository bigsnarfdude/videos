I'm a first-time traveller here, so I'm really enjoying visiting the area. And of course, I'm also very much enjoying the talk through this week. Okay, so the talk I'm going to give today is about propagation and shifting environments. And so we actually had a talk about shifting environments earlier this week by Professor Alzaro. So this is more or less the same type of issues. Although in this case, it was in a more abstract dynamical systems framework. In my case, we just look at this in the context of a So, look at this in the context of a reverection diffusion equation. Okay, so this is my relevance diffusion equation, so with both diffusion and reaction part, of course. And so, the shifting, the meaning of shifting environments or force speed, there are some different ways to call it, is that in either diffusion or reaction, I'm adding some heterogeneity, but so it's in both time and space, but it has a very special form, which is that both diffusion and reaction, but it depends on the moving variable. So, C hat. Variable. So C hat is a parameter, it's fixed. So I call it C hat because the speed of a heterogeneity. And a sovereignty is a diffusion or reaction. So it only depends on its moving variable x minus C het T. So in basically that you have a heterogeneity which is moving at a constant speed as the time progresses. Okay, so this is a slide maybe a bit misleading, so I should already clarify it. So I think there will be two parts in this talk, or maybe one part in the half, I don't know how much time I will have. But just to say that I will. But just to say that I will consider separately the two cases. So I will consider first the case where diffusion is constant and reaction is heterogeneous. And then if I have time, I will talk about the case where reaction is constant, I mean spatially constant, and diffusion is in heterogeneous. So I won't be looking at the combined effects of the two. We will just look at these two questions separately. Okay, so to give some motivation about this, About this. So, as many people here often consider this equation in the context of population dynamics. And so, as far as I know, the first type of problem where this kind of crystalline was considered was to model some kind of a climate change, as a simple model for climate change. So, basically, so of course you equal to the population, density of some population, and basically, so population should not, I'm oversimplifying, of course, but it should live at some average temperature, so of course depends on the temperature. means at some average temperature, so of course it depends on the species. So if the temperature is too cold, the species is dying. And if the temperature is too hot, the species is dying also. So this means that you have, in terms of latitude, you have a bound in the tabal where the species can survive. If you are too far to the south, the species die, and too far to the north, the species die also. And of course, with the effect of climate change, this good zone has a tendency to shift as time progresses. So that's why you have a shifting phetogeny. So of course it's a simple model. So, of course, it's a simple model because we may imagine that climate change doesn't necessarily have a constant speed, but still it gives some qualitative insight about these kind of models. So, yeah, I'm detaining it a bit, but it's consistent with what I was saying. So, I am taking some reactions. So, I have some verticality, something discontinuous, but let's not worry about it too much. So, I have a bounded interval around C times T where the equation is logistic, and outside it's some negative growth. On the outside, it's some negative growth. So, again, it's consistent with what I was seeing a few seconds ago. So, this is one example of a problem with shifting environments. And so, here you may see that I put constant diffusion, because actually, as far as I know, most of the literature and these kind of problems are mostly concerned with constant diffusion. Some some things have been done in also with rectangles diffusion. And I think that if we have that framework that we had by Professor Joe Gabriel, probably it also applies for these kind of situations. Applies for this kind of situation. Oops, the other way. Okay, I want to give also another motivation, which is about from pre-pay data open of your prep data systems. So basically, so you may imagine a general prep data system with a full coupling. So I'm putting some coupling with the diffusion also because I was also talking about some kind of heterogeneity diffusion. And so, of course, these kind of systems are quite. And so of course these kind of systems are quite difficult to understand in general, especially so on one side interaction because you don't have comparison principles. And of course you put some kind of cross diffusion that's even harder. But so let's not worry about this. Just the point that I want to say is that as a simplification of this kind of system, you may recover some kind of shifting environment problem. So basically what I'm saying is that you may, again it's an oversimplification, but assume that you break a coupling. Assume that you break the coupling in some sense. So assume that V actually does not depend on u, for instance. So v is going to satisfy some kind of linear equation here, some kind of KPP equation, something like this. So v is going to converge to some kind of traveling wave. And so then you can put this traveling wave into the U equation. So of course the actual equation you have copy from both sides, so it does not work like this, but as a first step, you may want to look at this kind of problems. And the reason I'm talking about this, that he gives you quite different That it gives you quite different heterogeneities compared to the climate change problem. And the reason is that, so the charming front for V is a monotonic function, usually, of course. And so, if you put this font in a V U equation, then you expect that this Retroge diffusion and this Retouch interaction are also going to be heterogeneous in this moving variable. So, it's completely different from the climate change case. So, for instance, here you may think that reaction term for U, so F of X minus. For u, so f of x minus c at t u is going to be negative behind the phone because there are predators, and it's going to be positive ahead of the front because you have no predators. So, in this case, you have an unbounded power button. Okay, so before I give any result about shifting environments, I want to give a brief reminder about the Homo's equations. So, I know that most people here already know those kinds of stuff, but still, I want to make a few points that I will be relevant later. Still, I want to make a few points that will be relevant later. And so, of course, even in the homeless equation, depending on the type of F you choose, a wide variety of behavior. So, I won't do. And of course, if you put this in the shifting environment, it gets even richer. So, I'm just going to focus about some specific kind of nominalities. And that will be monostable equations. So, either KPP, but not necessarily KPP. So, I'm recording what this means, although I know that probably everyone here knows about it. Here knows about it. So here I'm writing this kind of Roman equation. So I call the reaction G just to distinguish it from the F of my Point's problem. And so this is monostable if G of 0 and G and G of 1 are 0, and G is positive between the two. And of course it's called monostable because, at least in the OD, 0 is going to be unstable and 1 is going to be stable. And so again, I'm not too. Specify uh some sub cases. Again, I know what you are familiar with this, but I want to distinguish between KPP case and monostable case. There are different uh kind of definitions for KPP, but uh the usual features that KPP means that you are below the tangent channel line are zero. And monostable, if I don't specify it, it may be partly above the tangent channel line. So it may have a more complicated graph, of course, maybe below, then above, then below. Does not really matter, but at least monostable means it non-stable. Matter, but at least monostable means that it's not necessarily KPV. Okay, so for very classical theorem for this kind of monostable equations. And so, okay, maybe I should specify something because this theorem is the one that I wrote it. So in all the, when I will say monostable, actually I will also say that the this is on the zero interchange, but I did not say it. So I will always assume, I don't think it's in this circle but for simplicity at least, I will always assume that the derivative. For simplicity at least, we'll always assume that the derivative at zero is also positive. So, by some kind of non-degeneracy assumption. Because the theorem that I wrote here, if the derivative is zero, it may actually be wrong. Okay, anyway, so typically there exists some speed C star such that for any compactly spot initial data, regardless of how small it is, then the solutions produce speed C star, and you know what that means. If you take a ball ring that produces less than C star, the solution converts. Less than C star, the solution converges uniformly to one invisible ball. And if you take the outside of the ball going at speed larger than C star, then you see the solution goes to zero. So the level set are basically located at C star T plus small O of T. And of course, the important part of, I mean, several parts of Passive C 1, but of course an important feature is that this C star does not even depend on the initial data. So some kind of some people call it Hertinger effects. No matter how small the initial data, you always matter how small the initial datum, you always spread, and you always spread with the same speed system. So again, at least if a derivative at zero of a monostable equation is a monostable reaction, is a positive. And so I'm still going on with the things that most people know, but anyway. So if the equation is also KPP, so below the tangential line at zero, then we know that the speed C star is the linear speed 2 square root of dg prime of 0. Of DG' of 0. And so we had a talk also about linear selection of speed by Yamolin and Joe on Monday. So he talked about systems of code that you did, also some introduction about position in the case of a single equation. So of course we have to keep in mind that it's not the purpose of this talk today, but I want to point it out. But it's not an equivalence, right? If it's KPP, then the speed is lynch-selective. But the speed may be lynamislective even if the reaction does not KPP. And so the famous example of this is a And so the famous example of this is again Morlin gave this example. If you take this kind of fraction, and it's easy to check that this is KPD if A is less than one, but actually the speed is linearly selected. So here the derivative is one. The speed is linearly selected as long as A is less than two. Okay, so we have sometimes three cases. You have a KPP pulled, not KPP but still pulled, and not KPP pushed. And um, okay, again, still classical stuff. Uh, also, Maseko talked about this just a few minutes ago. So, one easy way to see where this speed comes from, so I was talking about linear speed, because it is indeed the speed of a linearized equation, and Masaiko just talked about it, but just before mine. So, you talked about how by taking an ex finding for looking for an exponential answer, you can. For looking for an exponential and that we can recover the speed C. Here I'm showing some alternative arguments, which is that actually when you linerize the equation, and then you can have an explicit form for the solution using a convolution with the heat canal. And it's also not so hard to compute using this equation that the level sets are going to be located around two uh square root of d d prime zero times t. So it's another way to recover a linear um the fact that this is linear speed. Um, the fact that this is lunar speed. And okay, so after all that, maybe this the main point that I want to remember is that uh again, so in some cases, in the monostable case, in particular in the KPP case, the speed may be the linear speed, so the speed may be determined by small density of the population in some sense. While in some cases, sister is going to be strictly higher than the linear speed, and in this first cases, the spinning speed is rather determined by large. The spinning speed is rather determined by large populations in a very rough sense. So it's a linear versus non-linear, but also in some sense small population versus large population. So this is a distinction that I want to make for the next few slides. Okay, so now about the return reaction case. So as I was mentioning, I'm considering these two situations, diffusion or action separately. So here diffusion is going to be constant, and they have this thing. Be constant, and they have this retouch reaction. So, there are many results about these kind of problems. Again, we had a thought by Professor Jao Tuesday, I think. And of course, there's a wide variety of phenomena because depending on what kind of function f you take, if it's monostable, if it's pivotal stable or whatever, it's going to be two different phenomena. And of course, depending on what kind of dependence it is with respect to x minus CLT, you may also expect a wide range of phenomena. So, of course, I'm not saying that I will give a general result that tells you at any point General result tells you at any time what's going to happen. It's a very hard issue in general. But I'm just going to give a few results in some specific cases. And okay, the first result I'm going to give this one, because I think it's the first result of these kind of issues. So it's a result by Ber S Diki, Dickmann, and some of her co-authors. And so this is the time of reaction that they considered. So I should also make a remark here that in this slide and the next few ones, I will give some examples. Next few ones, I will give some examples of F, but the results that I'm giving are till marginal products. So, here I'm taking some entropy, which is actually the same as what I wrote in the first couple of slides. So, on a bounded interval, this function is exactly KPP, so some kind of homogenous function in this bounded interval, and also this interval, some uh linear negative function. So, again you may imagine multinar situations like a moo smooth transition from negative to positive, then back to negative. To positive, then back to negative. You may even imagine that there are several bounded good zones separated by bad zone. So, the results are much more general than this, but to give a clear picture in this talk, I just give some kind of specific examples. And so, one of their results was that, so for this kind of equation, they found if U0 is compactly spotted, they found a critical speed, which does not depend on U0 actually, so it's some here or sister of L because it depends. Here I wrote this stuff L because it depends on the width of this bond. Of course, it actually also depends on G and other stuff. But anyway, so there is a critical speed, so that if the speed of the heterogeneity or the speed of climate change is less than this critical speed, then the population is going to persist. So of course it only persists in the moving frame of the heterogeneity, right? Because outside of this moving frame, the graph rate is negative, so it cannot persist outside. But if you follow the mo the But if you follow the climate change, or if you follow the heterogeneity, you see the lossolution persists as long as the speed of this heterogeneity is less than this critical speed. And on the other hand, as soon as the speed of heterogeneity exceeds this critical speed, then the solution is going to uniformly extent in lifetime. So it's quite intuitive. If the climate change is not too strong, the population survives. If the climate change is too fast, the population dies. Changes too fast, the population dies out very intuitively. Although, again, the point that you may, one more thing that you may notice is that it's related to the fact that it's KPP in some sense, is that this speed, again, it does not depend on the initial data. So I'm not going to go into the proof, although I gave a slide about this. But basically, they use some kind of generalized principal eigenvalue in promoting frame. And if this linear eigenvalue, the principal eigenvalue is positive. The principal eigenvalue is positive, zero is unstable, population survival, if eigenvalue is negative, population dies out. So it's a bit similar to curls for a few days ago. And also, also maybe I should mention, because we're crazy here, but I mentioned this first paper by Andre, but you did also, we found here a lot of papers about this kind of issues and even more narrowly about principal element. In particular, in higher dimension, because also all this talk isn't specified at first, so I wrote the equation in one dimension. First, so I wrote the equation in one dimension, otherwise the assumption that in one dimension, but that you have lots of extensions. In higher dimensional, it works more or less the same. Okay, a second result, so I'm still staying in the KPP case, but now I'm taking an unbounded further button. So here, F is negative on the left half line and the K P P type on the right half line. So again I'm I'm having some kind of sharp transition between negative to positive. You may expect mortal situations or something like this. Situation or something like this. I should make it point on because when I think that you can do more null stuff, maybe mislead you. So, an important feature of all in this result and others I'm going to say is that typically you want the retinity to be monotonic. So, you want f of x minus z of z u, let's say z u. You want this f to be monotonic with respect to z. If it's not monotonic, you may have some issues. So, you can do model but more general than this, but you still need some kind of monotonicity. But you still need some kind of monotonicity. Okay, and then they found a very similar result, and actually, it's simpler to get invalid in this case, I think. So they found the same thing, which is that there is a critical speed below which a population survives and above which population dies out. And the difference is that this critical speed is precisely 2 square root of gg prime of 0. So basically, in the first case, in the previous case, because the variable zone is bounded, you could not benefit from the whole favorable equations. Favorable equation in some sense. You have concept of penalty due to bondedness of the favorable zone. But here, because the favorable zone is no longer bonded, you no longer have this penalty and then this critical speed is just two scrolls of digital. And actually, so in this case, you could compute the system of L goes to two scrolls of digital zero when L goes to plus infinity. So in some sense, this result is kind of a limiting result from the other one by a Belastic and Lisco of course. Your Elastic and Discover. And the third result I'm going to give, so it was obtained in the collaboration with Julien Bourru. And now I'm still considering unbounded favorable zone, but now this function G of U is no longer KPP, but it's monostable. So it includes KPP, but not necessarily a KPP. And then the picture becomes a bit different. And basically, we found three intervals of the speed. So before there was one interval where the species survived, one interval was. Where the species arrives, one interval of the species dies out, and patrols out. Here I found three intervals, and also basically when C of the ratio is less than the linear speed, then the population always survives. When C is larger than the non-linear speed, so again you have to distinguish now those two speeds. In some cases, they have the same, but not the same. So this is linear speed, this is non-linear speed. So this is the speed of the vector vector is larger than the non-linear speed, then the population dies out. Then the population dies out, and there is some intermediate intervals between the two where the outcome may actually depend on the initial data. So, a few remarks. So, first remark is, of course, in the KPP case. So, those two speeds are the same, so in some sense we will cover the previous results. Although I excluded the critical speed cases, but actually we handle this in the paper, so we truly will cover the KPP case. So, do both cases always occur in the last specifics. So, yeah, so that's what I told you to specify. So, we have a few results, a range of results. I don't want to write everything. But basically, in this middle result, we have this kind of sharp threshold dynamics. So, as you did under Yi Rong, and under Hi Yoshi also, and many people, Andrej, I don't know if Professor Lattice is on Zoom right now. So, many people worked on sharp facial dynamics for pi-stable most equations. And this is exactly what we cover here. So, if you take a small initial datum, it's going to converge to zero. If you take a large initial domain, Going to converge to zero. If you take a large initial data, it's going to converge not to one because of ectology but to some pushy steady states. And if you take a continuous and mostly family of initial data, then you will find some sharp threshold between first two photon. It's exactly the kind of feminine that we provide. So only the boundary cases are not known? Yeah, actually, we did it. Because it's a bit complicated because it depends whether C star is equal to 2 squared or 0.0. So I don't remember exactly actually, but so if both are. Remember exactly up here, but so if both are the same, then it's like in the KPP case, so you actually die in the critical case. But here, when two square root of dg prime of zero is not the same as the star, then you may have actually already some sharp threshold. So the picture becomes a little bit more complicated, which is why I just excluded it on this slide. But we do have uh we do know what happens then. And also the other thing that I will do not write here, but it's uh it's actually simpler to prove, the surface part is a more difficult one. The self-fucial part is a more difficult one. But another result, which is not written here, is that if you fix the initial datum and if the speed varies, then you still find a critical speed. So, this critical speed is going to depend on the initial datum, going to be somewhere anywhere between linear speed and non-linear speed. But for fixed initial datum, there is still a critical speed. In some sense, the conclusion is still rather intuitive. So, the population survives if the speed of climate change is not too fast. But also, also intuitive, but we didn't. But also in TG, but we did not see this in the KPP case. We also see that if you have a large population, it's going to survive a stronger cl climate change than a small population. And so the intuition behind this is quite intuitive. So this is what I wrote here, and this is also what I spoke about, or I spoke about linear speeds and non-linear speeds before. So if you have a small population, very roughly, it's going to spread at the linear speed, right? So if the climate change is faster than Climate change is faster than a Bisilina speed, then the population is going to die. But on the other hand, if the population is large, then the speed is going to be closer to the actual C-star. So if the speed of climate change is less than C-star, the population is going to survive. So that's why you get this balance in terms of the size of the population. And mathematically speaking, so I don't want to go into too much detail, so I wrote a few sentences before, but I want to point out that actually, so sometimes I call this equation like So sometimes I call this equation like monostable with 50 kOV or something like this. But it's actually a bit misleading because in this intermediate table, the equation actually becomes right stable in some sense, which is why you get the shaft ratio. And it's not so unexpected because so monostable is on the right, right? But on the left, the curve is negative. So you have some kind of balance between the two. And this balance may make the equation more of a bi-stable type. And so the main case is not a pool, but you can see this when you compute steady states. And you see that in this. States and you see that in this intermedial speed range, so you always have some kind of a positive steady state like this blue one. So, negative core fret is negative on the left, so the positive steady state cannot be uniformly positive, right? But it's uniformly positive on the right, converges to one, and it's called to zero on the left. You have a total steady state zero, and as soon as C exceeds the linear speed, you have some kind of bifurcation phenomena which appears, and the unstability of zero is inherited by. Is inherited by some new steady state between the two. And so, very roughly speaking, when the initial datum is below the green line, you converge to zero, and when it is above, you converge to a supposed steady state. It's more complicated metal because actually you have an infinity of steady state, but in some sense, there is some largest one, so you still get the same kind of feature and for a bi-stable case. And so maybe I should go on. So maybe I should go on. So you must ask yourself what happens with a monostable and bounded favorable zone. I just say that it's a much more difficult issue, so I'm not going to talk about this right now. And in the few minutes that I have left, I want to give a few words about the case where the diffusion now is hydrogenous. And now, so I'm taking KPP equation, so I'm not now forgetting about the monostable node KPP. In this last part of this talk, it will always be KPP. But now diffusion depends on X minus C hat T, I should write. X minus C hat T, I should write to be consistent with before. So it's actually not a very good way to write host-to-vis diffusion, but it's for us more convenient because we use some kind of servant solution method. And as you know, usually these seven-inch solutions are constructed using exponentials. And of course, an exponential is a nice function which has a second derivative of the sign. So you have some kind of monosity for spectrum. I'm very late, so I'm going to go directly to the interesting case. And so this is one of the cases considered. The cases considered. So the Heto's division looks like this. So it converges to T minus on the left, which is a small value compared to T plus per unit on the right, and it's pointing between the two. And so if you try to do some heuristics about that, what happens? You're going to miss some stuff. Sorry, if I'm very fast, I'm already late. And also, okay, let me just go straight to the answer. So the tricky part here is that you get some kind of non-local pooling phenomenon, just as we were talking about. About Wu, I think, yesterday. So you may think that as the front is in this left part, the speed is going to be two scores of d minus right. But actually, and it's related to linear diffusion, the KPP features everything, actually you feel the better part here. So if your font is here, it's going to be far away from the part of high diffusion, but still it has an effect on the speed. And so we compute it, compute the speed. I'm going to skip everything. Compute the speed, I'm going to skip everything, sorry. So, I'm just to give some intuition about the non-local pooling phenomenon, and this is exactly what Luca asked the other day. This is related to the decay at infinity. So, basically, the good part, so it's not necessarily a good part because it's just different, but the better part in terms of speed, it makes the solution slightly larger than it should be. So, it changes the exponential decay and it makes the speed higher. And one good way to see this. And uh one good way to see this is to look for an exponential enzymat. And also this um this formal argument gives you exactly the sponge speed at speed. So of course usually in more complex case you just take an exponential enzymatic like this, you put it in the equation and you immediately find the minimal speed. This was a Mass Aliko argument earlier. Here because of retrofitting you need two answers. So one exponential of minus lambda x, one exponential of minus mu x, and I'm adding some factor in front just to make it continuous at the frettor. Continuous at the heterogeneous part. And if you put this in the equation, you find those two things. Of course, I'm forgetting about the transition between two regenerators, but I'm just making some simplified model. But anyway, so if I solve these two equations, I find some minimal C such that some lambda and some exist. And it's a little bit tricky to compute, but you find a formula for the speed, and this turns out to be exactly the spreading speed of a system. And this kind of Speed of a system. And this kind of formal argument, it also works for competitive systems, as we heard the other day. You can also, of course, the actual proof requires science per solution, more complicated. But if you just want some formal arguments on non-local print phenomena and what is going to be your speed, just this works perfectly fine. And I'm sorry if I was too quick for the last part, but I'm going to stop here and I thank you very much for your attention. Okay, thank you for your next talk. And any questions? Max? Yeah, there was. Sorry. Your last part was a bit too quick. Yes, sorry. So for Z minus region and D plus region, so there are two species. This uh shift uh Uh shift uh how does it compare shift sh I see uh maybe I should go to this so this is a graph of uh spreading speed in terms of uh C speed of the hydrogenation and uh so here C plus is equal to two and C minus is equal to one so C plus of course is two square root of D plus and C C plus, of course, is two square root of D plus, C minus, the same. So this is what it looks like. So when the speed of a heterogeneity is less than C plus, then you know there is some compactly sparted subsolution here, which goes faster than retrogenitis, so you can use this to find whether the spinning speed is indeed two scores of D plus. And uh when uh maybe I should start here, so when s speed of rate is very large, then you have no non-local pooling phenomenon. You have no non-local pulling phenomenon, and the speed is just 2 square root of d minus the speed of the speed. And here is the non-local pulling phenomenon. So here the speed is larger. So you would expect the speed to be C minus, right? If you don't know about the non-local pulling phenomenon, you expect the speed to be C minus, but it's actually larger than C minus. Questions? Questions? I guess just following up on that, that it's sort of like a terrace, like you were saying, that C heterogeneity is like this other thing that's out of head, but you're still feeling it with it. Just so I understand. Yeah, so sometimes I kind of make a connection between those two, like several steps of propagation. But I don't know if you can go beyond that. I mean, so it depends also what you're talking about when you're speaking about steroids. But like steroids for Scala equation, it only connects stable steady states. Equation, it only connects stable steady states. So you're never going to see this, at least it's for a Terrace for scalar equations. But of course, if you start to say that Terrace, any sequence of fonts is a Terrace, then like competitive systems, it's really two successive fonts. If you want to see this Terrace as a Terrace because it's two successive fonts, then yes, you can see this. I have a comment. Okay, Xiao Chung, yes. Okay, so very nice talk. Very nice word, Thomas. Thank you. I just give a comment. So since you have two limiting systems, two limit systems are good system. But my guess, so in my talk, I discussed the uh the propagation properties and the uh for the For the monocentric flow without transition invariance. So, you might receive the people with Dr. Ye, so we studied the combination of good and good in this system. So, in that case, I guess very likely we can use our results to discuss this kind of heterogeneous diffusion case. This is my guess because since you have two digital systems, I mean, two limiting systems have spreading speeds. This is like this only a comment, okay? I try to use our general result to revisit your example here. If I have time, yeah. No, quite a few more problems. Maybe if something comes out, I will let you know. Yeah, yeah. Thank you. Okay. Okay, thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Any more questions from Zoom audience? Okay. Thank you, Carmen. We resume at 2 o'clock today.
