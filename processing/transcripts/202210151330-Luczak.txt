That was one of my biggest information. So thank you for inviting me. It's a really great pleasure to come here, especially such a nice place with mountain views. So I wanted to also show you some views from Leadbridge. So you can call Leadbridge uh Bank of Salted Alberta. Is it actually called Lead Bridge, or is it something else? So, this is cool, and this is what the margin you can see from his obvious saw. This is exactly from our science, new science building. But the river is not the left. The bridge we're seeing is not the left bridge. Yeah. No, let's bridge the name of person. It doesn't have anything to do with the bridge. Okay, after it was clarification. The page must be the after that person was classified. Just a co-worker, just show. Just a cohort, just joking. Okay, so first I will start with some neuroscience data which was published some time ago. That when we are here talking about predicting seizures, so here we had some model of spontaneous seizures. Spontaneous seizures, so it means that they occur at some unpredictable times. And here we had some two different ways of inducing these spontaneous seizures, and we had rats record. And we had rats recorded for 24 hours over multiple days. And we had activity from hippocampus and cortex. So we had quite a rich data set. And when you look at activity during seizure, you see here each of those lines is activity of one neuron. On the top is local fear potential. And what you can see here is that activity from one seizure to the other seizure is quite. Procedure is quite similar. Even more remarkable, if you look at this very small period of time, can you can start seeing this icta spikes, this activity of neurons during each of those big coordinated events. And also, what you can see is those sequences are quite similar from one to another, but also across seizures. So, this was something interesting. So, this was something interesting. Time equals zero. Is that just for the preferred bout simulation? So, no, so this is spontaneous seizure. So, we detected where the LFP is changing based on deflection. So, this was by us marked the beginning of the seizure. Okay. Okay, so here those sequences are quite interesting. Sequences are quite interesting, and I just wanted to mention that I spent part of my career looking at some sequences, and this is some spontaneous activity. And Jor mentioned that some data with recording from the dish that there are some bars of activity, and the size of those bars nicely scales with some exponent. And similarly, Exponent and similarly, in our data, but we have this bars of different lengths, and it seems like each of those bars is one single like a word or message, and we call it packets. And again, to somehow link to previous talks, when you look at this differences between activated and inactivated state, the synchronized and desynchronized state, what we think happens is that in synchronized, What happens is that in synchronize you have this only sporadic messages, and what happens when they synchronize is just that those messages are sent right next to each other. So, this sending this bars of messages, like da da da da da, it makes this brain in this desynchronized activity. The other interesting thing about those sequences is that if you put some imagination, you will see that more or less. Some imagination, you will see that more or less the sequential order is preserved. And even if we present some sensory stimuli like tones, we see again more or less the same sequential patterns as in this spontaneous sequences. So it means that probably there is some connectivity in the brain that, regardless how you stimulate this little rotal network, it will generate some more or similar sequence. Some more or similar sequences. So, why I mention it? Well, let's go back to this sequences during seizure. So, here what we did is we look what was the exactly sequential patterns. And the easiest way was to look at cross-chorograms. So, we look at cross-chirograms between each pair of neurons. And this is the picture of this cross-chirogram. And what we look is how those How those neurons are correlated before seizure. And what we found is very similar. So, consistent with this previous work what I showed you, it seems that those ectal patterns which are causing seizure activity, those are not taken out of nothing, they are not completely different states of the brain, but rather they rely on the same connectivity, the same neuronal assemblies as occurring. Assemblies as occurring before seizures. And why it is important for predicting seizures, I will mention in a second. And we saw it in all our rats in multiple models. So another way to illustrate it is here, each dot represents one neuron, and the lines between those neurons show which neurons were strongly correlated. So during seizure, the So during seizure, this red line shows that, for example, this neuron was correlated with this, this with this, and so on. But if we do the same analysis for spontaneous activity before seizure, can we see with these dashed blue lines very similar pattern that not all those correlations are active, but neurons which are highly correlated before seizure, they are also tend to be highly correlated during seizure. Correlated during seizure. So again, we are looking for some similarities before seizure and during seizures to help us later to predict. And so how we can use this knowledge when those sequences are similar before seizure. So we can, for example, look some template matching analysis. So we can take the sequence, like here is some cartoon of such sequence, and now we can take some. Some continuous spontaneous activity before CGEM, and we can match this template to each of those periods. And for example, if we match here, we will get good match store because this sequence is quite similar to this. So what we did is that we bin such templates from 50 different seizures what we had in our data set, and later we did. Data set and later we did this template matching to activity before seizure, and here it is from one sample seizure. So, what you can see is that before the seizure starts, there is more of the thread, so it means the sequences are starting occurring more and more. So, what you can see here is that knowing what to look for before seizure could be a good marker to help us to predict seizure. To help us to predict seizure. So, the current problem with seizure prediction is that we don't really know what to look for. And here it would be quite a good idea that we can use these sequences from spike from seizure activity to look before, and this would be quite good predictor of incoming seizures. Similarly, we also look at discriminating between putative interneurons. Interneurons, inhibitory neurons, and pyramidal cells. And we found that it was disproportionately interneurons which were highly correlated during this ICTAR event. So it is additional information that looking at correlations, increase of correlations of interneurons to LFP could also be predictive of incoming seizure. So. Other things what we can use to help us to predict seizure. We also involve data sets as cameras looking at rats, recording activity of rats in the cages. And here what you can see is that across three consecutive seizures, which are spread hours between each other, the posture of Rat, it was quite similar, and also the corner in which he was getting the seizure was. In which was getting the seizure was quite similar, so it seems like there is some consistency. And we didn't yet look at it, but it points out that probably also before seizure occurs, maybe there are some behavioral changes which can help us predict incoming seizure in addiction in addition to neuronal activity. So I don't know, maybe there is some twitches of ear which will be a quiet predictor in addition to neuronal activity that Addition to neural activity, that seizure is incoming. And why it is so important to predict seizure? Well, what is the most difficult for patients with seizure is this unpredictability. If they can get some information that in two minutes seizure is coming, they can adjust the activity. So if they drive on the highway, they can pull over and have a much safer life. So this is quite important issue. So if we have this, if we have If we have this, if we are looking for some features of behavior before seizure, how we should look for it? How we should look for ear twitches or maybe some that rat is spinning three times instead of two times? How to find it? Well, so artificial neural networks are really doing great job at videos and data analysis. And here we build some neuronal networks for a little bit different purpose to predict stroke versus stroke. To predict stroke versus non-stroke rats. And there were three different behavioral tasks. So, first, it was reaching for food pellets. Here, rat has to walk on some leather. And here, it was mice was pulling string. And from those videos, we were able to get some quite good predictions if it is stroke or not stroke. But, what even more interestingly is that now we can ask those networks what you were thinking when you were predicting that. We were thinking when you were predicting that this is a stroke animal. So, we can use some knowledge extraction, which is called explainability, and see what this network was paying attention to, that for example was predicting if it is control or stroke animal. So, here this network is underlying hand, that animal with stroke often will slip hand when it is walking. But so, this was pretty much known, but in this case, with the single parrot jing. With the signal parrot reaching, what scientists were looking is for the spine movements of hands. That when an animal is healthy, it will reach it like that for foot palate. When it has stroke, it cannot make those movements, so it will try to cheat. We'll just put hand above it, drop it, and pull it. So, by looking at those fine hand movements, this is what neuroscientists are scoring to evaluate how well Rat is recovering from stroke. But this network didn't look much at the didn't look much at this. What its network found is that what was the most important, it was on the end of the trial, which by accident we included in those videos, that if animal was using both hands to eat food pellet, it was the most predictive of the help of animal, if animal can coordinate both hands. So here I'm bringing this up because the same approach can be used to find some behavioral differences. Behavioral differences preceding some small behavioral differences which are predicting seizures. And also, what is nice about these artificial neural networks is that you can combine videos with electrophysiological data to predict the seizures. So this is some, I believe, very promising way in the future to make such predictions. Okay, but predicting seizures is, as I said, very important. Seizures is, as I said, very important. It can highly improve the quality of life of seizure patients. But even more important, it would be to help to reverse these epileptic changes, to improve patients to stop the seizures. So here is some speculative work saying that probably seizures are not very different from typical processes. Typical processes which are responsible for formations of memories. So, in memories, when you are memorizing something new in your brain, certain connections are getting stronger and it seems to be similar in seizures that certain pathways are getting stronger and overactive and taking over. And the methods which we are using, for example, to induce seizures, for example. Seizures, for example, kindling, which my students learned from Kamteski how to do it. It's very similar to LTP long-term potentiation process, how to, it's almost the same electrical type of stimulation. There are also studies showing that when you apply not fast but very slow electrical stimulations, you can reduce seizures and it is very similar to the stimulations to long-term depression. Stimulations to long-term depression, how people are inducing long-term depression. Also, as it was mentioned before in this workshop, when we are memorizing something, later these patterns of activity are replayed, usually in the sharp wave ripples complexes. And similarly, in patients with seizure, we see very similar type of activity with slight modifications. So, it was Slight modification. So it was proposed that this epilopenetic mechanism are just hijacking normal memory processing. And also it was mentioned before that like in Alzheimer, people who have problems with memory also have some seizures and many, for example, medications which help to improve memories are also applied to reduce. Apply to reduce seizures. Also, the other link between memory and seizures is that in some patients, just certain memories can by itself trigger seizures. And retinax seizures, these seizures evoked by some certain sensory stimuli, but also there are some papers showing that just some any faults can induce seizures. And after I started working on this project, I started working on this project. I was contacted by a few patients telling me exactly that when they think about something, this particular memory can trigger seizures. So it is another link. So one of the, based on this, what it suggests that maybe treatment for epilepsy could be somehow related to changing these memory patterns. And there are some useful, very promising therapies, for example, for post-traumatic. For example, for post-traumatic stress disorder patients where they want to decrease certain memories, and similar drugs can be probably used when applied after seizures to weaken this specific connection. So, this is something that we are now working on in our lab with, and this work is by Rudrig Das, Carlos Hohen, and Kartrick Iger in my lab. And this we got lucky to get supported by CHR. And also, all of this, what I was mentioning here, we wrote some short review paper which is providing references to support each of those points. But so if we the next step, what I wanted to mention toward the end of this presentation is that if we really know how these memories are formed, how this Memories are formed, how these synaptic connections are strengthened in memories and also in epilepsy. And if we have this better understanding, we can now think about some specific interventions to decrease this aberrant connections and help to treat the epilepsy. So, here is some more theoretical work where we look at this different plasticity rules and we go. Plasticity rules, and we got lucky to get this selected for cover story. Sorry about bragging about it, I just couldn't resist. So, what we did here, and this is, I put those equations for mathematicians here, that what we did, what was nice is that we were thinking what are the basic assumptions from which we can derive some plasticity rule. And here, what we just assumed, the only assumption is that. just assure the only assumption is that neurons need to maximize metabolic energy and how neurons are getting metabolic energy is getting from local blood flow so more neurons are firing the bigger the vasculature is getting the more nutrition it's getting to this brain area so this is for example what fMRI is relying on what energy is using neuron is by anytime neuron fires Anytime neuron fire activity or when there is presynaptic activity, where is the synaptic activity, it consumes energy and also does some additional housekeeping things. And each of those terms can be expressed as a function of activity and functions of synaptic weights. So later what we can do is we can think how the synaptic weights, how the connections between neurons needs to be modified to maximize this. To maximize this metabolic energy. And after with some not that complex math, we derive at this equation where the best way to change synaptic connections is to take what was the presynaptic activity and multiply it by difference between presynaptic, the post-synaptic activity and predicted activity. So think about it and so this rule is very simple. So, this rule is very similar to the standard heavy and learning rule that fire together, wire together. When this is presynaptic activity multiplied by postsynaptic activity. So, here we just replace this term by postsynaptic activity by predicted activity. So, how you can understand it? Well, when you are getting salaried, then you know what really matters for your happiness if you are getting salaried better than your Better than somebody next in the office next to you. So, if you are getting better salary than expected from the guy sitting next to you, then you are happy. When you are the least paid in the department, and even if your salary is enough to pay mortgage and for food, you still will be quite unhappy. So, it seems like it's a similar meaning of this rule: that neuron is looking what is the expected activity. That activity. So, by trying this new rule, how neurons can be wiring together, we are starting building some neuronal networks and both neural networks can also be used to better understand how epilepsy develops and how to cure it. And one thing which I forgot to mention is that we also look at multiple Look at multiple data sets, biological data sets, and both rules are not only derived based on math, but they also have experimental support. Okay, so here what I'm trying to say is that by better understanding how neurons are wiring together, we can build better models to help us understand seizures and memory formation processes. Processes. The other interesting things about this formula is that this actual activity minus predicted activity, it is how you would usually define surprise, that you have some expectations and if something exceeds your expectations, then you are surprised. If you are expecting here me, but you will see some green and mesh martial, you would be surprised and you would try to reconcile this together. Reconcile these two models. And one thing I wanted to mention is that I've said that this can be used for better understanding how epilepsy is forming, but also we use these ideas to define how consciousness may be formed, that in our definition, and for mathematicians in this paper, we have some nice mathematical formula how to define consciousness that it is basically surprising. Basically, surprise reductions that each neurons try to minimize the surprise, and the process of this surprise minimization is defined as a consciousness. And you know, when you are looking in this room, you are mostly looking for things which are the most unpredictable. So, in this case, this guy is standing in the top in front of you. So, the process of this awareness, this consciousness, it is trying to get better understanding of this unpredictable. Get better understanding on this unpredictable thing in your environment, and this is how we try to define consciousness. And yeah, less hair I have, the more controversial topics I get. Okay, so in summary, what I told you is that this activity during seizures is not that different from activity which can start occurring. Activity which can start occurring before seizures. And this is really useful if we want to better predict when seizures occur. Also, I'm in big favor of using deep neuronal networks, but you can combine many different modalities. You can, for example, add some oxygen sensors or whatever and combine it with electrophysiology to get better predictions of seizures and to Seizures, and what is now really cool is that later you can ask this network what behavioral or spiking features were the most important for those predictions. And on the end, I told you about this new rule for memory formation processes that with this modeling work we can get probably better understanding of these ideas: how patterns are formed in there. Form in the brain. And this, what I told you, it was done in collaboration with many, many people. So I wouldn't be able to do a fraction of that with the help of all of those people mentioned, as the co-authors on those papers. And also, we are grateful for all the funding. So, if you have questions about the stock or about Krakow Poland, now we can. Thank you very much. Okay, questions, please. We have time. Yes.
