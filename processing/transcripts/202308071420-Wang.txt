Thank you. Thank you for the introduction and thanks to the organizer for the invitation. Today I will talk about the existence of four minimal spheres in S3 with a bunking metric. This is a joint work with Shinzhou. Spear is outline. We will start at the background and the motivation, and then we will introduce our main results about the existence of forming most fears. Of four minutes spheres and also multiplicity one theorem for the Samo-Smith-Minnack theory. And finally, we will sketch the idea of the proof. We will start at the closed geodesics on S2. And the first important work is given by Burkhoff. He proved the existence of one embedded closed geodesic by the Min-Max theory. And this paper is very important because this is. Paper is very important because this is the beginning of the Min-Max theory. And later in the 1960s, Armground initiated the program of finding minimal sum manifolds by using the Min-Max theory. And of course, after Wolkhoff's work, there are many other related works by considering the length of the shortest geodesics. And yeah, I'm not going to introduce it. And the other And another important work is given by Luznik-Scheneum, and they proved the existence of three geodesics. And there was a small, yeah, I'm not sure if it is small or not. Anyway, there is a gap in it, and it has been fixed by Grayson. And finally, yeah, we have the three closed embedded geodesic on any S2. And then it is very natural to. Then it is very natural to consider the high-dimensional case. For example, we just consider the three-dimensional case, and then you can consider the surface on the three-dimensional case. We know that the geodesics are the critical points of the length functional. And then for the surfaces, you have to consider the critical point of the area functional. That would be the minimal surface. Then, based on the development of the geodesics, you also Of the geodesics, Yao posed a question about the existence of bomb spheres in any S3. So today we will just focus on the S3. So many reference have their solutions in general, even high-dimensional closed manipulates, but we will just restrict the M-bin manifold to be the S3 here. And before Job's conjecture, SAPS and Ulman. Conjecture, Sachs and Ulenbeck have proved the existence of immersed minimal sphere by the harmonic maps and minimax theory. And just a long time of Yao's conjecture, Simon and Smith proved the existence of embedded mimosphere. Jada's talk has mentioned that. And they used the different Different minimum theory with Amguan MPs. Roughly speaking, I'm going to piece consider the space of the cycles. So you can just regard it as the space of the boundary of the open set. And you will require that the boundary should be reconfigurable. And Simon Smith considered the space which is smaller. They just consider the space of embedded surface with fixed genus. For example, you can just consider. The genus. For example, you can just consider the space of embedded S2 and then you can run the min-max theory to find the minimal surfaces with controlled topology. And then after that, White used the degree theory to construct the second minimal sphere for the S3 with positive rich curvature. And he also proved the existence of four minimal spheres when the metric is very. The metric is very close to the wrong metric. And the wrong metric is just as a unit sphere in the R4, okay, with induced metric. And this has also been proved by Juni in his master thesis. And recently, Hatova and Petovo proved the existence of two minimal spheres, of course, with a different method. And their result was for the menbo with positive rich curvature. A man body with positive rich curvature or a metric with bumpy metric or a bumpy metric. Here, we have to give the definition of the bumpy metric because it is also our definition. It is defined to be the metric so that for each minimal surface, the Jacobi operator has no zero eigenvalue. It is equivalent to say each eigenvalue is non-zero, or you can say Or, you can say that the minimal surface is either unstable or strictly stable. And the boundary matrix is studied by White, and he proved the bumpy metrics are generic in the bare sense. So, you can say that almost all metrics are bumpy. Okay. So, that's some results. And recently, Shindu and I. Recently, Shindo and I proved that if the metric is bumpy or the metric has a positive rich curvature, then S3 will contain at least four embedded minimal spheres. And you might ask, is it possible to produce more minimal spheres? Generally, it is impossible because White also proved that for some ellipsoid, there exist exactly four millimospheres. At exactly four millimospheres. And of course, here the ellipsoid have positive reach curtain, right? So generally, it is impossible. And we will prove it by the multiplicity one theorem for the Samuel-Smith-Minemax theory. So we will just give a short introduction to that. So here we will just consider the space of all the embedded. Of all the embedded S2 in the S3. And such a space will have the smooth topology. But with the smooth topology, such a space is not complete because you can find a sequence of S2 converges to a point in the smooth topology, right? So you have to add this point to the space, and we consider the X bar. And now we will consider a map from interval. From interval or some other spaces. You can just use the interval as an example. And then we will require the map satisfies the condition that phi of 0 is just a point. And phi of 1 is another point. And we also require that the phi is not homotopically zero. And geometry, meaning in geometry, it means that you can take the orientation union of the phi. That is, you can just Phi, that is, you can just take the union of phi of t together and then it will cover the manifold, then it is non-trivial in the home topic class. And for this kind of home topic class, we can always define a value which is invariant for each home topic class. That is, we can take a map in the hometown class and find the largest area. And then we can take the infimum among all of the maps in the same home topic. All of the maps in the same homophobic class. This is always well defined. And some Smith members say that it is possible. Yeah, it is the omega is actually realized by minimal surfaces. The idea is that once you have a map, we want the largest area to be as small as possible. So we put at it and from the left side to the right side, and so that's the largest area. The largest area would be as small as possible. So it would be very close to the min-max bed. And finally, you can expect that the largest size will converge to the minimum surface. And this has been strictly proved by some Smith, of course, based on the work of Ambon MPs. And here, this result puts for any compass and not only the map from interval. map from interval. It can be any IP, IP2, RP3, or other spaces. Anyway, given any homotopy class, you can find the sequence of maps in that homotopy class so that the largest area will converge to its min-max value. And the largest size will converge to minimal surfaces, embedded minimum surfaces. So here, for each component class, the For each component class, the SK would be disjoint from each other. And here, the difficulty here is you may have the coefficient MK that is called the multiplicity. The Mk is a positive integer for each K. But some Smith also concluded that for each SK, it is an embedded minimal sphere. So it seems that if you want to produce more minimal spheres, Produce more minimal spheres, then you should have more homotopy classes, right? So we will just introduce the homotopy classes on the S3. But you know that for the definition of the home topic class, it has no relations with the metric. So you can just describe the homotopy class in the unit sphere, and then it is always a homotopy class for other metrics. But the min-max values would. Matrix, but the min-max values would be counted, uh, will have it will depend on the matrix, right? Okay, so now we will just describe the home topic class in the unit sphere, and we will just use the round sphere on the unit sphere to give the home topic class. So, here we have many round spheres in the unit S3 because you can take a hard plane in the R3. You can take a hard plane in R4, and then the intersection of the hard plane with S3 will give you a S2, and of course, you have many S2. And if you fix the direction, for example, the X axis, and then you can take a family of the half-plane that is normal to that direction, and then you can have a family of the around S2. And actually, this is a non-trivial homophobic class. And of course, you have many directions. And of course you have many directions, but all of this would all of this home topic sorry all of these maps will be in the same home topic class. Though two different directions cannot give you the different home topic class. And if you want to produce a different home topic class, you have to find more parameters. Here the idea is you can fix a home topic, a one-parameter home topic class. homotopy or one parameter homotopy class just like the blue one and then we can give a vector that's a rotation on it we can use a1 a2 to be a point in the s1 and then we can given a1 a2 and we can rotate the size for each yeah for the map okay and then you can have a two parameter variant that is the map from the interval across s1 to the space of s2 To the space of S2. And actually, this will induce a map from the interval across S1. Okay, S1 is equal to RP1. And anyway, you can have a two-parameter family. Such a two-parameter family would be a different home topic class. And of course, you can have many other rotations. And then you can have the home topic class with higher multiplicity, sorry, with higher parameters. Sorry, with higher parameters like the interval cross RP2 and the integral interval cross RP3. And then you can prove that these are four different homotopy classes. So for each home topic class, we can define the mean-max value, right? And that is omega i. And it is very easy to prove that the omega i is increasing. That is, omega 1 is less than or equal to omega 2 and less than or equal to omega 1. By two and less than or equal to omega three. And another result given by the Lostnick and Schneelman theory that say that actually if the manifold S3 has only finitely many minimal S2, then the omega i is strictly increasing. I'm not going to going to give the details anyway. That is, of course, if you want to produce four minimal speeds. If you want to produce four minimal spheres, we can always assume that the metric has only finitely many of them. Then we can always have that omega i is strictly increasing. Okay, now we have four numbers and each number by minimax theory is associated with the area of some minimal spheres. It seems that we can have many minimal spheres. Unfortunately, you cannot even conclude the second one if you just use the inequality here and the minimax theory. And the mean-max theory. Because we can have an example that omega 1 is just the area of some minimal sphere. And omega-2 is just twice of that. Omega 3 is a triple of that. And then they are just the same minimal sphere with different metabolicities. So it is very natural to ask a question to find the metaplicity. So is it possible to prove that the MK equals one for each homotopy class? one for each homotopy class and each metric. Unfortunately, it is impossible for all metrics because we have constructed an example last year and we construct a metric on S3 with non-negative reach curvature. And on that metric, the second minimax value can only be realized by a minimal sphere with metabolicity two. It means that the omic. It means that the omega 1 and omega 2 under that metric can only produce the same minimal sphere. So it is impossible for the manifold, even for the manifold with non-negative rich curvature. But it is possible to do it for the positive rich culture. For example, for the in the Shindo's PhD. In the Shinzhouse PhD thesis, Geek has proved that the one-time family will have the metabolic one if the rich covature is positive. And it has also been proved by Hedo-Vamax analysis. And however, for the one parent family, you cannot very important if it is the one or not, because Because some Smiths always tell you that it will produce a minimal sphere. It is higher metabolism or not, it doesn't matter. And for the higher parameter case, then you can produce minimal spheres. And it was proved by Hashober and Trendober that the omega-2 is also realized by minimal sphere with magnetic places one if the rich curvature is positive. positive. They prove based on the estimate of the omega 2 and they proved that omega 2 is strictly less than two times of omega 1. And of course, we know that omega 1 is the area of the minimum sphere with the least area minimum sphere. So if omega 2 is strictly less than two times of the least area minimum sphere, then it cannot be the minimal sphere with higher metallicity. It can only be a With higher metabolicity, it can only be a minimal sphere with metabolicity one, right? So they can produce two minimal spheres for the positive rich coefficient. And we have another method to, yeah, their proof would be very difficult to consider the higher multiplicity, higher parameters like the omega-3 and omega-4. But here we have another proof to the multiplicity one theorem that is here we. One theorem that is uh here we studied here that in some Smith-Me-Max theory, we didn't require the bumpy metric or the positive rich culture. It can be any metric, but for each component, if it is unstable, then it can only have a multiplicity one. Okay, now we can consider the case in the manifold with positive rich curvature. For the S3 with positive rich curvature, With positive rich curvature, then you can have you have no stable minimal surfaces. So each minimal sphere is unstable. So for many volumes with positive rich curvature, you can only have the mutatic one. So here, as a direct corollary, we can say that for the S3 with positive rich curvature, then by the memax3, you can produce four minimal spheres. Okay. And here we stated that we can prove. Here we stated that we can prove the existence of four minimal spheres with boundary metric. And for the boundary metric, you can have the stable minimal spheres. So it is possible to have the higher multiplicity. But for the boundary metric, each stable minimal surface should be strictly stable. And we will use an idea from Anton's paper about the existence of infinitely many minimal hypersurfaces. The idea is. The idea is to cut along the stable minimal sphere here. And we will just cut along a sequence of disjoint embedded minimal spheres. Of course, you can assume that they are only finite of them. And after that, we can say that there exists at least two balls with minimal boundary. And then for each ball, we will add a cylinder to that, to the minimal boundary. to the to the minimal boundary and then we can have a non-compact minimal non-compact manifold such a non-compact manifold will only be Lipschitz continuous in the metric right but anyway we can approximate it by a sequence of compact regions and the regions will have long tail okay and as the tail is longer and longer then it will converge to the such a space and then Such a space. And then we will consider the min-max theory for the free boundary minimal surfaces on that. And the regularity has been developed by Martin. And also use Anne Onson's idea, we can finally prove that if the tail is long enough, then by the min-max, actually you can produce the closed minimal sphere in the interior. And actually the minimal sphere will be contained in. The minimal sphere will be contained in the original compact region. It does not intersect with the tail. So, finally, for this kind of non-compact region, we can produce at least a two embedded nemal sphere in this region. And then we finally have that if you have a boundary metric with stable minusphere, then you will have at least four unstable. Have at least four unstable minimal spheres because each ball will have at least two unstable minimal spheres, and you can also have a stable. So, possibly you will have five embedded minimal sphere if the bumpy metric have stable minimal spheres. Okay, so we can see that once you have proved the multiplicity one theorem, then you can have the four minimal spheres in. Form minimal spheres in a S3 with a bumpy metric. Okay, now we will sketch the idea of the proof of the multiplicity one theorem. So we will also use the strategy to perturb the area functional to be the edge functional and then construct a non-trivial surface with prescribed mean curvature. Yeah, and then consider the conversion. And then consider the convergence to have the things. Anyway, we say that our statement is if the minimal component is unstable, then it is multiplicity one. And this is equivalent to say, once you have a component have a higher metaplicity, then it is stable. Okay, we'll just prove this. That is, we will just take a min-max minimal surface that is a component of some min-max minimal surface. Component of some minimal surface. And we will just assume that it has higher molecules. You can just assume that m equals 2p. Okay. And now we will prove that gamma can only be stable. That is enough. And the idea is we will perturb the area functional to be the h functional. So here, what is h? So h can be any given smooth function defined on S3. function defined on S3. And actually then we can define the AH functional that is the area of the surface. Sorry, we can define the H functional on the space of the pairs. The one element is a surface and omega is the region. And then the H functional is defined to be the area minus the integral of the H over the region. For any pair we don't have to give the relation between the sigma and omega. Okay. Between the sigma and omega. Okay. And then we will just use this kind of perturbed function now to produce a sigma j. And sigma j will be the critical point of the A epsilon j h. The h will be fixed. We'll take a sequence of functional that is epsilon j times h. And here we have the pair that sigma j omega j is epsilon j h. a h a epsilon j h stationary and epsilon j will converge to zero and here uh we will produce the pairs and the sigma j is the boundary of the omega j but the sigma j may not be embedded it will it may have the self-touching set it cannot cross itself but it can touch itself so we can only have that omega j has the boundary equals sigma j in the sense of currency For sigma j in the sense of current sign of the tree. So that's behavioral. And the second thing is sigma j omega j is not only a critical point to the A epsilon J H, actually we will have a stronger property and we'll say that it is strongly H stationary. And we will explain that better. And another thing is sigma G may not be smooth. It can only be C11. Okay, so Okay, so finally we will produce the sigma j, omega j, and then we'll consider the convergence of sigma j. And we will use this kind of convergence to prove that gamma is stable. And before that, we are not going to prove this theorem and we will explain the silver mark regularity and the strong edge stationary. So first, why do we have only Why do we have only 01 regularity for this kind of perturbed functional? So for the min-back theory, the regularity is always almost from the regularity of the minimizing things. Roughly speaking, for the unground piece settings, you have the minimizing in the homology class. And for the thermal speed settings, you fix the topology. So you cannot. So you cannot, so you can only have the things in the isotopy class, right? So now we will give the examples. Sorry. Here we will have the two round circles with unit radius, and they are very close to each other. And each circle will bound a disk. Okay, now we consider the homotopy minimizing and the isotopy minimizing. First, for the area functional, in the homology. Uh in the homology minimizing, then you will have a cylinder. Sorry, you will have a canoe as a minimizer, right? And in the isotopic class, you can only have two flat disks. Anyway, both cases are smooth by unborn simon and mixed sign-in yao because they are minimal surfaces. But if you perturb the functionality with a functional, for example, if you want. For example, if you want to produce a constant mean curvature surface, we just assume that h equals one everywhere. Then, in the first case, in the homology class, you will produce a smooth surface that is cleaner. But in the isotopy class, if you remove, if you only have one circle, one disk, and then the minimizer will be part of the sphere with radius one. Sorry, with radius two. Okay. And but here you have. But here you have the two surfaces. So you have to push the top sheet downward and push the bottom sheet upward. And each one is a barrier to the other one. And then you cannot have the smooth regularity. And actually, for the point with density one here, actually you can prove that it is smooth here. And for the point in the interior of the touching state, In the interior of the patching state, actually, you can prove that there are minimal surfaces, so it is also smooth. However, we can have some boundary points. That's a boundary. We'll say it is a boundary of the patching set, that is called the free boundary. And actually, as this kind of boundary of the patching set, then you cannot conclude that it is smooth. Actually, it can only be 0, 1. And for the And for the first case for the impact theory, it has been proved by Jonathan and Xinjiu. And in this paper, we also proved the prescribing mean coefficient surfaces of the Min-Max theory. Yeah, that's one of the major contributions in our paper. Anyway, we can only have the C11, and this caused a lot of difficulties. Difficulties. And the other thing is we say that the edge stationary is not enough. We actually need the strongly edged stationary. Here, the strong. So, of course, you can now assume the regularity. That is, locally, the sigma j are the C11 surfaces, and locally, you can always have the decomposition. That is, you have the top sheet and second sheet that is ordered. And we say that is. And we say that it's strongly edge stationary. It means that for the top sheet, if you push it upward, and for the bottom sheet, if you push it downward, then the edge function is increasing. This is stronger. And now we will give some examples that are edge stationary, but they don't satisfy the stronger property here. For example, here, you can consider the minimal, so here the gray. So, here the gray part are the region, and the red part is just the surface. And we can consider the pair that is two times of the surface, two times of a minimal surface, gamma. So, this is a minimal surface. And now we consider the region that is a host space. And if you consider the hot space, then the integral is always a constant for any diffusimorphism, right? So, this kind of pair is always a critical. Kind of pair is always a critical point that the two times of the minimal circuit and the people. And also, if you choose the omega to be the empty state, then it is also a critical point. So it seems that we can have nothing, we don't have the new things. We just have the minimal surface, and then if you perturb it, you can not produce a sigma j, which is different from gamma. Okay, so that's a bad case. So that's a bad case. And something even worse if you only have the h stationary, because you have the prescribed functionality to be the h equals three everywhere. You can even have the minimal surface, sorry, you can even have the constant incurvature surface with h equals one everywhere. For example, you can have the three hands of a surface with constant mean curvature one. And omega is just the part above the surface. And actually, this kind of Surface. And actually, this kind of pair is also AH stationary, but H equals 3. So this is even worse. Fortunately, this is not the strongly edge stationary. We can rule out that. So actually, we can prove that for the touching state, the prescribed mean curvature is equal to zero almost everywhere. Almost everywhere. And for the non-catching state, it is just equal to h. So that's a very good property. But here we didn't wrote that case that if you consider the min-max for the h and you can just yeah, here we say that we want to produce a surface that is sigma j, which is different from the m times of gamma. And yeah, here we didn't wrote the case that sigma j is exactly equal to m times of gamma. Exactly equal to m times of gamma, then we can say nothing. So, but we observed that if the first case wants to be a strongly edged stationary, then h should be positive. And for the second case, if it is strongly edged stationary, h should be negative. So if we just choose a positive h and we perturb the area function, then probably we can just have a Probably we can just have the original minimal surfaces. And if you choose a negative H, then it is also possible. But here, then finally, we will just choose the H that is positive somewhere and negative somewhere. So we will say that we will just finally choose an H such that H H such that h is non-negative in some small ball and it is non-positive in some small ball and we will require that h is positive somewhere and it is also negative somewhere. Okay, and now the blue part is just the limit of the that is the two times of the minimal surface and now we want to find the sigma j and this kind of h that is sigma. of h that is sigma j is a epsilon j h stationary with some region okay and of course outside the two small boards we just require that the h equals zero everywhere okay so with this kind of special h now we can consider the region of the omega that is omega j and omega j have only two choices the first The first omega j is the union of the part, union of the part above the top sheet and below the bottom sheet. And another choice is omega j is part between the two sheets. And now you can consider the first case study, omega j, if omega j is part, the union of the part above the public sheet and below the bottom sheet. Above the top sheet and below the bottom sheet, and then you can see that in this small bar that h is less than or equal to zero and h is negative somewhere, then sigma j cannot have the touching state. And in this case, sigma j is embedded in this small point. And then we know that h does not change sign because until the second point because h is negative. Second ball because h is negative, non-negative, and non-positive, and h is zero. And you can only have the patching state until this ball is positive h. Okay, so in this case, we can say that sigma j can only have the touching state in the first ball. And now we can also consider the second case that the omega j is the part between the two sheets. Okay, now in this case, we can finally. In this case, we can finally conclude that the sigma g should be embedded in the first ball, and it may have a touch and that in the second gap. Anyway, finally, we can conclude that outside the small two small balls, sigma j is always embedded. Okay, so we perturb the area functional and we can find the sigma j that are minimal surfaces outside of the two small bonds. And outside the two small. Bars and outside of the two small boxes, we only have the minimal surface with multiplicity one. And now we can take the convergence. And that is, if you have a sequence of minimal surfaces, and then you can consider, and we can also prove that the limit is just the two times of the omega, two times of the gamma. And then we can write the graph, the sigma j as a graph of the gamma. Of course, you can. Gamma. Of course, you can have the definition outside finite many balls, small balls. Actually, for any you can find finite many points and for any compact set outside the two balls and outside the finite many points, then you can have this kind of expression. This is the same with Ben-Shaber's compactness theorem, that paper. And anyway, then we can also consider the height difference and Consider the height difference, and we normalize it, and then it will converge to some positive temperature field. And it is defined on the outside of balls and outside finite many points. And the finite many points would be removable singularity. And finally, we conclude that we have a positive geometry field defined also as the two boxes. And then, by the classical treatment, we can prove that gamma is stable. Prove that gamma is stable outside the two boards. We didn't say it is stable for as a minimal service, as a closed minimal service. But if we choose the ball small enough, then we can say that gamma is stable. And we can all, H is fixed and we have only possible cases. And then we can fix the ball small enough so that outside of the ball, the stability of the surface. The stability of the surface is the same with the original surface. And then finally, we can, yeah, we can have that gamma is stable. So that's and thank you very much.
