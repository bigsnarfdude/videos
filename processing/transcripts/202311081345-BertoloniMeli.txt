What I want to talk about today is parametrization of the local Langlands correspondence using this Cotwit set, and everything I'm going to talk about is with Masao Oi. Okay, so for my talk, F will be some local field that can be Archimedean or non-Archimedean as you. Or non-Archimedean as you prefer and G over F as reductive. So of course for a quasi-split group G, we have, I mean, so the first things I will talk about are, of course, well known, but so if G is quasi-split, then we want to parameterize the language correspondence. Parametrize the language correspondence, and to do so, we typically fix a Whitaker diatom. And then for phi some L parameter, we expect the following thing. Okay, um right so we expect some map from the L packet of phi to irreducible representations of this sort of modified. Representations of this sort of modified component group. So, when F is non-Archimedean, we expect this to be a bijection. In general, we expect it to be injective. And so then the next question is, okay, well, what if G is not quasi-split? Well, I mean, and of course, the issue here is that, so this Whittaker datum is showing up as needed to. Is needed to write down this bijection. So, if we don't have this Whitaker datum, then how are we supposed to do things? Well, so I mean, this has been known for quite some time how to do this. And generally, I think this goes under the term of some sort of Vogon philosophy. And the idea here is for some arbitrary group G, we fix its unique quasi-split inner form. We fix the Whittaker datum there, and then we sort of parametrize things relative. Sort of parametrize things relative to that Whitaker datum. Okay. And I guess there's a lot of different approaches for how exactly we want to parametrize these inner forms of a quasi-splig. forms of a quasi-split group. So one approach is using pure inner forms. We've seen this several times already in the conference. And I guess this was the approach that Vogan originally took in his paper. One could also use this basic cotwitz set. And I guess this approach is due to Cotwitz. And finally, And finally, there's also this approach of Kalethe using his rigid gerb. And the point is: so you might ask, why don't we just take normal inner twists? Why are we using these extra cohomology set to parametrize inner twists of some groups? That's to parametrize inner twist of some group. And the idea is that our notion of inner twist has to be sufficiently rigid that it doesn't have extra automorphisms that act non-trivially on the representations in the L packets. So, okay. So the point of my talk is really focused around this middle set. So I first want to talk about this COWET set a little bit and review kind of what it looks like. And the point is, you should think of this as just some sort of Galois cohomology. So when F is piadic, this can just be defined as the cohomology of the V group, where this L-bar is the algebraic closure of completion of maximal and ramified extension. Of maximal unramified extension of F. There's a bunch of other definitions, and there exists a definition of BG for any local field. For different local fields, the definition looks somewhat similar to this, but with some slight modification. And so for our purposes, how do we use this thing? Well, for each, so this is some set, and for each element in that set, we get We get some group GB that in general will be an inner twist of some Levy subgroup of G. And inside BG is this so-called BG basic and these are the guys where you actually get an inner twist of G. Okay, so this PG basic then gives us a way of parameterizing. Then gives us a way of parametrizing certain inner twists of some fixed quasi-split group. So the other thing is we have this Kawitz map that appeared, I guess, in a different guise in the previous talk. And so for us, this will go from BG to This will go from BG to the characters of ZG hat gamma invariance. And so something that is useful to keep in mind is that something good to keep in mind is that when F is non-Archimedean. When f is non-Archimedean, this Kawitz map is actually a bijection on the basic set. So BG basic just looks like these characters. But this is some easy thing, I guess. My point. So one simple example, maybe I'll put it over here. Hopefully that's still visible. Is okay, so B G L N basic. This just looks like Z, right? Because the gamma, the GALA action on the dual group of GLN is trivial. So the center is just GM. So now characters. So that's Z. And so there should be some map to inner forms of GLN. So there should be a map. There should be a map to this guy, which looks like Z mod NZ. And this map is just the obvious one where you reduce mod N. So maybe a couple of remarks. So this basic set sees more inner forms than pure inner forms, because if we were just thinking about pure inner forms, we wouldn't see basically any of the inner forms of GLN. But here we see them all. Them all. But also, it's okay. So it may feel like it's some kind of big over-parametrization, right? Actually, every inner form that we see appears with some large multiplicity. And we're sort of treating each inner form as a different thing. And that's just sort of part of how this thing works. Okay. So Okay, so now I want to say, so what does the language correspondence look like when we consider BGBasic? So the point is for some language parameter, um For some language parameter phi, for each B in here, we get this group GB, and we have an L packet consisting of representations of GB attached to each B. And this thing is in bijection with the following strange thing. So I guess just this. And so S phi. So S phi here is the recipe is that you take S Phi and you quotient out by G hat dare intersect S phi identity component. Okay and okay, so let me Okay, so let me Okay, so actually one gets a commutative diagram like this So let me describe all the maps So first of all, let me emphasize that we now expect for every local field that this top thing is a bijection So before when I wrote the quasi-split version, it was not going to be a bijective in the Archimedean case. In the Archimedean case. So, this vertical map is easy to understand. Here, you basically just forget the representation and just spit out the element of B. And then this vertical map is a little bit more interesting. The point is that this group Z G hat gamma maps into the center of S phi natural. And so, for any irreducible representation, And so, for any irreducible representation, you will get some central character that gives you a character of this group. And the point is, then, if you have an irreducible representation here, you can remember which B you're coming from by taking the central character and then, well, okay, in the non-Archimedean case, you can remember which B you're coming from by taking the central character and then passing through this Kawitz map that in the non-Archimedean case is an isomorphism. Case is an isomorphism. In the Archimedean case, right, this map is not this map is not a bijection, but actually it turns out so one thing Masao and I sort of extracted from the literature is that there is an object you can put here to make this bottom map bijective so that you can actually recover. I mean, we knew that had to be true because the top map is a bijection. Because the top map is a bijection. So it must be possible to recover the B given a representation here. But anyway, okay, this is the picture. Okay. So by the way, if you have any questions, feel free to ask them. So, um, where derived. You take the derived subgroup of G hat, yeah. Um, okay, so so why are we doing this? I mean, that's a reasonable question. So, so one thing is that I mean, one thing that I should just say is that this is a relative, this BG basic set is some nice thing that we can really work with. So we're not really losing anything by considering these extra inner forms. So maybe that's the first thing to say. Like, it's not like suddenly this becomes a very difficult, complicated thing. Right? This is maybe, you know, epsilon more complicated than looking at pure inner forms. Than looking at pure inner forms. But then the other thing is that this actually shows up in nature in the form of local Shimer varieties. Ah, well, that is you. Okay. Well, I technically mean BG Basic, but I'm then going to assert that actually maybe we should be thinking. Actually, maybe we should be thinking about BG itself. Right, so I mean, so look, I was looking at Arthur's original paper where he sort of formulated all the conjectures about A packets. And I think it's telling that right after he formulates these conjectures, the very next section, he says, Okay, let's apply this to the L2 cohomology of Shimura varieties. But the point is, now we have. But the point is, now we have, so those are global Shimur varieties. Now we have a sort of pretty well-understood picture for how local Shimur varieties are defined and how they work. And part of the data of a local Shimur variety is an element of the set BG. And in particular, this group GB acts on the cohomology of local Shimur varieties. So basically, you see this correspondence shows up in the cohomology of local Shimur varieties, and there's sort of Homology of local Kulshimar varieties, and there's sort of no way to avoid that. And then the third reason is it also shows up a lot in this categorical conjecture of Fargenschulze. So right, and this was maybe our motivation for thinking about this. Motivation for thinking about this. And then I guess the comment I wanted to make is actually for all of these reasons, somehow this BG set seems more natural to work with. So a basic reason is that like BG basic is not a functor in some nice way. For instance, if you take a Levy subgroup of G, then you can ask. So of course there's a map from BM to BG, but there's not a map from BM. But there's not a map from BM basic to BG basic. So you, I mean, for some applications, it can be convenient to be working with something that's actually a functor. And then the other thing is for local Shimur varieties, well, actually the Bs that show up don't have to be basic. And again, in this categorical conjecture. So one natural question, I think, is: can we take this picture and can we just erase this basic somehow? I guess you've probably figured out that the way I'm phrasing this talk are theorems that you can. So basically the idea is assume that you have a BG basic local language correspondence and assume that you also have it whenever you replace G with a Levy subgroup of G, then there exists a natural ejection. Ejection We're now so B is in this cotwood set pi is okay, I'll write this as pi of GB. Okay, all right, this is pi of GB. So pi is an irreducible, immiscible representation of gb of f. And then rho is actually an irreducible algebraic representation of the entire centralizer group. So if you if sometime you were explaining to someone about the Langlands correspondence and you forgot to mention that there was a component group here, it's okay. You were just thinking about. you were just thinking about um you're just thinking about this vg formulation um and also this is so i okay maybe i won't write it but i'll say this is also this bijection that we write down is automatically compatible with this kotwitz map so now what i want to do is i want to try to convince you that actually this is not some like crazy thing and this is um this sort of pretty This sort of pretty clear how to do this. So, okay. So, first of all, if I have a pi, how do I construct this millennium's parameter phi, assuming that I know this basic correspondence? So, the point is, well, okay, so the way this works is this B might not be in BGBasic. Might not be in BG Basic anymore, but it will be in, it will come from some BM basic, basically. So this group GB will be an inner twist of some levy, is what I'm saying. So take that levy, and you can think of this pi as a representation of an inner twist of that levy, and then and then by. And then, by the normal basic Langlands correspondence, we get something like this. And then there's okay, then there's a canonical inclusion of the Levy into the full group. And I'm just saying that the Langlands parameter of G attached to pi is just that. So it's basically the only thing it could be. And now I'd like to give some examples. Give some examples of what this looks like. Right, so first, if phi is discrete, then in the discrete case, there's actually nothing new. There's actually nothing new, and the reason for that is that in this case, s phi equals s phi natural. And so basically, for a discrete parameter, all the packets associated to non-basic B's are empty. And so you don't, and so it's sort of the discrete case looks exactly the same as the previous case. So, okay, so let's see something that is. So, okay, so let's see something that is more interesting. So, let's consider g equals gl2, and then let's look at some parameter like this. So, a sum of two characters that are not equal to each other. So, in this case, BGL2 looks like Looks like so. The basic part we already said is like z, and then the non-basic part is like sort of half of z squared, like the pairs m comma n, such that m is greater than n. So if you want to think of BGL2 as a picture, it looks like sort of this. This subset of z squared, everything on and below the diagonal. So you can think of the basic things as living on the diagonal and the non-basic things as living below. All right. And for this particular example, the irreducible, so the centralizer group is just the maximal torus. And so the irreducible representations of the centralizer group, that's just going to be z squared. Group, that's just going to be z squared. So basically, yeah, so that so these are the two things. And so then how does this work? So the interesting thing to consider is suppose we take a b where m is greater than n. So suppose we take one of these non-basic b's, then we would like to understand. Then we would like to understand for these what the L packet looks like. So this GB in this case will just be the maximal torus, the split maximal torus. And what's interesting is in this case, the L packet should actually contain two representations. So So, you might be freaking out that an L packet of GL2 is containing two representations, but let me try to motivate why this is what should be happening. So each of these representations is supposed to correspond to an irreducible representation of the centralizer group. So, how does this work? Well, this guy should correspond to the one. The one that is like m comma n, and this one should correspond to n, m. And so you see that if you vary this over all m and n such that m is greater than n, you get everything in z squared except for the diagonal. And then the diagonal is what corresponds to the basic things. And these, like, pi sub phi i is just, I mean, Is just, I mean, phi1 is just a character, it's just a map from the v group to gm. And so then I'm just applying local class field theory to get like a character of gm. And so I'm saying this is. And so the point is you get two. So the point is these two representations are just sort of switched of each other. And this should correspond to the fact that if you look at this L parameter of GL2, it factors. Of GL2, it factors through the levy, the torus, in two distinct ways, right? Like we can think of this as phi1 plus phi2 and phi2 plus phi1. And these are different L parameters of the maximal torus, but they become the same in GL2. And that's why this L packet has two elements, because somehow it's containing the data of both of these parameters of T. That's the thinking. Okay. Okay. All right, so I want to describe briefly what the construction looks like. Okay. So So, the first thing is, we need to understand what this COVID set BG looks like in general. And as I've sort of hinted many times, it breaks up as a disjoint union over standard Levy subgroups, where basically the elements in BGM are guys where they give you an inner twist of M. Okay, and so. And so BG sub G is like BG basic. And in particular, this BGM is defined in the following way. So you have a map from BM to BG. So you have a map from BM Basic to BG. B G and one writes down the set BM Basic plus, which you can think of these as the guys in BM Basic that are in some sense G dominant. So like in that other case, for the non-basic things, we were only allowed pairs where M was greater than N. So those were like dominant in G. So that's kind of the picture here. And it turns out that this is an injection. So this is what happens. And so now And so now given a pair pi and B, okay, so B is in some BGM, so B corresponds to some BM in BM plus basic. And some fact that is true. Okay, so this is going to look like a tongue twister or something. GB is the same group as MBM. M B M. So, like the inner twist of M corresponding to B M is the same as this group GB. Okay? And so what this means is now we can think of pi as a representation of M B M and then the pair pi B M. So now we apply the BM basic LLC. LLC and this is supposed to give us a phi m and a rho m and now this rho m is an irreducible representation of s phi m natural okay so this is the situation that we're at and from this phi m we we can get a phi just A phi just like in the way I said before, where you basically phi m is an L parameter of m and now we just compose it with the map from lm into lg. So the remaining piece of information that we have to construct in this bijection is we have to construct an irreducible representation of S phi. So how do we do that? So the point is that here we need to really think about the representation theory of disconnected reductive groups because I mean this Because, I mean, this group S Phi, that's like what it will be in general, right? Yeah, I mean, I didn't say precisely, but basically what it is. So there's this Newton map that assigns to each thing in here, MBM, a Newton polygon. BM, a Newton polygon, and you just ask that that thing is G dominant. I don't know. But it basically means that this thing is dominant relative to G in some sense. Yeah, so basically, maybe one way you can think about this is if you pick some guy in BG and you look at its image in BM, then basically the pre-image will, it will not be injective, but the pre-image will be some sort of viable. The pre-image will be some sort of vile conjugates. And you're sort of taking the one vial conjugate that is like dominant. Okay. Okay. So Sorry Yeah, so so what happens so so b equals one is basic and so then um Yeah, um what I'm saying is that yeah, okay, maybe I need to be what you need is that like the idea is that the M should be the centralizer of the Newton co-character. So maybe you have to impose you have to impose some condition that on the roots in G and not in M like you. In G and not in M, like you, there's the Nunco character doesn't vanish, something like this. Yeah, yeah, maybe like strictly dominant or something. Okay, so now I want to talk about sort of new topic: representation theory of disconnected reductive groups over C. Of disconnected reductive groups over C, but okay, we know why we're talking about this because that's what this S is. Okay, and so actually, so I learned about this from a paper of Achar, Hardesty, and Riesz. It turns out that this is a very nice thing. So basically, if H is some disconnected reductive group, the category of algebraic representations is. Like algebraic representations is what is called the highest weight category. And sort of more explicitly speaking, there's a classification of the irreducible representations in terms of something like a highest weight theory. And the way it works is the following. So basically, irreducible representations are parametrized by certain pairs. So the lambda The lambda will be a dominant weight of T, which will be a maximal torus of the identity component. And then the mysterious thing is this E. So this E is going to be a simple A lambda module. Okay, what is A lambda? So A lambda is a certain twisted group algebra. So basically, the generators are elements of the component group that fix lambda. And basically, one is able to construct a certain two-co-cycle that gives this a twisted group algebra structure. And E is going to be a simple module of one of these. Is going to be a simple module of one of these things. Okay. So let's okay. Let let let me record what we had done so far. We started with a pi B, we got a pi B M. VM, then we got a by M row M okay, so now let me Okay, so let me state a bunch of facts. So the first the first fact you probably maybe you know already, but But if you look at the centralizer, so remember that phi is just sort of like basically phi m, but inside of g. So the centralizer of phi m, the identity component in m hat, is actually a levee of this guy. And all the levees look like this. The levees look like this. Then the next fact is: okay, so this row m is of the form L lambda m E m for some lambda m and some em just by this classification that I wrote before. So basically, it's a highest weight representation corresponding to this pair. And if you sort of pick all your If you sort of pick all your pinnings in a compatible way, then this lambda m will already be dominant. Domin I feel like I dominant in that size circ and then the last thing. Is that actually these twisted group algebras also end up being isomorphic? So basically, I won't be able to completely justify these second two facts, but the point is, is that it turns out that this lambda m is in some sense closely related to this BM. It's related. And the point is, this B M is is this bm is by definition has to be g dominant in some sense and that sort of imposes um that sort of imposes this first condition and then um and then somehow also this m is like the minimal levee through which um or sorry maybe maybe what i want to say is m is the centralizer of the newton co-character of b m so if you've seen this theory before So, if you've seen this theory before, then that is what ends up implying that basically the part of the component group of SV that fixes lambda m is already contained in SVM. And then maybe you can try to see that these twisted group algebras will be the same. So, okay, the point is with these facts, this now becomes. This now becomes completely trivial because lambda m is already dominant, and Em automatically becomes a simple module of this group algebra. So the point is this gives us an L lambda E that will be that is automatically in here and that's In here, and that's like, and that's the row we take. So, in some sense, you can say that this construction is working so that it's compatible with the representation theory of disconnected reductive groups and its highest weight classification. Okay, so that's the construction in one direction. Now, you want to go the other way, given a fee and an Want to go the other way, given a phi and a row, how you cook up the pie and the b. So that's a bit more complicated. And one reason that that's more complicated is because as we saw in this GL2 example, the Langlands parameter of GL2 factored through the torus in two different ways. And somehow that factoring was important. So now if you start with a Langlands parameter of phi, okay, really you have an equivalence class of Langlands parameter. Really, you have an equivalence class of language parameters, and some representatives of that equivalence class will factor in one way through a levee, and some will factor in another way. And you really have to keep track of this, sort of go in the other direction. So it's sort of a bit more complicated. But the point is, is like one can do this, and one can show that these two constructions are inverses of each other. So this is kind of how you get this bijection. Okay, so for the remaining time, For the remaining time, what I want to talk about is actually an application of this to endoscopy. Because there's an obvious question, right? It's like, if we have this BG Langlands correspondence, what does endoscopic transfer mean for this thing? Well, maybe I'll maybe one thing I'll remark is. Well, maybe I'll maybe one thing I'll remark is that in the Archimedean case, the speechy basic local language, it's implied by like what Shellstad did. And so basically, this thing is just a complete theorem in the Archimedean case, because we were sort of assuming you had a BG basic vocal language correspondence, but you have that in the Archimedean case. In the non-Archimedean case, you have it in some cases. So they'll say. So Shelsta didn't use this terminology, but you can kind of extract it from what she did. Okay, so what is the application endoscopy? So let's now, having said that, let's now take F to be p-adic. So the normal situation is the following. So the idea is you have some group G and you have some auxiliary group H connected by some L homomorphism eta and and there's also some element S that That I will take to live in here that plays an important role in a picture. And then you have some Langlands parameter phi h, such that the composition of phi h with this eta is this Langlands parameter phi. And once you have this setup, there's a transfer homomorphism that takes a stable distribution on H to an invariant distribution on GB. On GB. So right now I'm assuming B is basic. And in particular, if phi H is tempered, then the endoscopic character identity amounts to the formula that, okay, the transfer of the stable character of phi is exactly this thing. So let me write out what these are. Write out what these are. So S theta phi H is going to be going to be this, so basically, just a sum over this packet. Packet and then this thing so we have to add a cotwitz sign and then the point is here we take the stable distribution. Here we take the stable distribution attached to phi h, and here we take the distribution that is sort of twisted by this auxiliary element s that showed up. So we're taking traces against that. Okay. So the question is, how can we make sense of this in our context? So the picture So the picture is like this. You have this endoscopic group of G, then you have a levy M, and then you have this group GB that is like an inner twist of M. And what we would like to do is, so now B is just in the full Calvit set, we'd like to take a stable distribution on H and somehow transfer it to get some distribution here. Transfer it to get some distribution here. So the obvious thing is to transfer here, then take some kind of Jack A module, and then try to like transfer again. The issue is that then you get a non-stable distribution, and so it gets a bit difficult to transfer it. But luckily, there's a nice, there's an alternative approach that I learned from a paper of Ben Shu, which is the following. So you can ask if you transfer your distribution here and then take a jack-in module, that Module. Is that the same as going around the other way? So it turns out there is a way to make a commutative diagram here. Basically, there exist some collection of endoscopic groups of M that are also Levy subgroups of H. And these are indexed by, okay, so this is roughly true. These are roughly true. These are roughly indexed by like file group double cosets. And so now the idea is you take your stable distribution, you take the jacket module to each one of these levies, you transfer all of them over to M, and then you add up all of that. And that is the same as going around this way. But now, when you take the Jackie module here, it is, you can, I mean, GB is an inner twist of M. GB is an inner twist of M, so you cannot just transfer all the way to here. And that gives the transfer map. And remarkably, this exact map shows up in the comology of Agusa varieties. So this sort of construction actually already shows up in nature somewhere. So I think an obvious skull. Goal is to try to compute then the following thing. And by compute, I mean you have this transfer and you would like to describe it in terms of the L packet for phi at this group GB. So this is the goal. So, this is the goal. And unfortunately, or maybe fortunately, I sort of think this is we think this is quite hard. And essentially, we think that because of a paper of Atobe. So let me try to explain. So one can ask, okay, what if H is just G, right? G is an endoscopic group of itself. And then basically, this becomes a question of if you take If you take a representation of G and you take its Jacket module and then you take the enhanced Langlands parameter of all the irreducible pieces in the Jacket module, what shows up? And basically, Toby has this paper, Jack A modules and the local language correspondence, where he kind of computes, or one thing he does is he computes for symplectic and odd special orthogonal groups, like what this Jack A module compatibility looks like. Jack and module compatibility looks like, it seems really complicated. In particular, more than just our packet shows up. So other representations show up. And it seems quite difficult to try to pin down exactly in general what you expect. Okay, so I have about 12 minutes. But let me try to describe some sort of partial progress. And first, let me give an example. I mean, actually, we don't even really know what this thing should look like for all of GLN yet, but probably if one understands the literature well enough, that's possible. But here's an example to keep in mind. To keep in mind. So for G equals GL4, you can take the parameter that is trivial on the vague group and just looks like two copies of the standard representation. And so then SV should be isomorphic to GL2. And so we suppose. So, suppose row in SV is not a character okay, then we can just all right, so the point is when So the point is when rho is not a character, that will give gb that is like looks like the gl2 squared levy inside of gl4. And so then one can compute that in this case. So, okay, instead of writing this, maybe I'll just say exactly what this is. It should be Maybe I'll just say exactly what this is. It should be the induction of two copies of Steinberg. And in this case, you get the following thing.  So, okay, so maybe you're going to get some representations of GL2, and maybe you expect to see these Steinbergs showing up, but then you also get this extra thing, which is like a product of two inductions. Okay. So, right. So, what we do is we So, what we do is we define what we call like the regular part of this transfer. So, now talking about general G. And we also define. We also define some pairing pi s reg per pi in some L packet of GB. And okay, if I have time at the end, I'll try to say a bit more carefully what these things are. But basically, so there should be a phi h here, but basically, if phi h If doesn't have any SL2 part, then this should be the correct thing. But in general, it will be some of the correct thing, but not everything. So, for instance, in this case, this regular part is like this two times the Steinberg, but then we wouldn't see this. Okay, and so then. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, that's one of the mysteries of endoscopy. Like, I mean, you always take H to just be quasi-split, right, in endoscopy. Yeah, I mean, I think that's a very reasonable question. We sort of formulated it in this way because it seemed to give us some interesting answers and it seemed to be related to some things I'd seen in some comology of a goose varieties. But I think it's, yeah, I think that's a good question. Okay, so basically then we're going to have to do that. Okay, so basically, then the theorem we're able to show. Okay, which admittedly, it's not so clear what this means if I don't tell you what the different terms say. But okay, so this is our theorem, but we have to assume a bunch of things. So let me say what we're assuming. So, assume BG basic LLC so that any of this makes sense, and also assume you have the endoscopic character identity in the basic case. Okay, then we also need the following relation. So, suppose that fee, suppose that. Suppose that phi factors through some Levy subgroup L of G, then we want the following relation. I mean, actually, we will use this. We'll use this really on the endoscopic group. So we really need this for the endoscopic group. But we need that if you take the stable character of phi as a parameter of L and you induce it to G, then that is the stable. Then that is the stable character phi on G. So this basically usually goes under some name like local intertwiner relation, something like this. And then finally, we need compatibility of LLC with some rational automorphism. Automorphisms of Automorphisms of G. So, like, for instance, there's a paper of Haynes, where he sort of expresses some compatibilities with automorphism that we expect local animals to satisfy, and we need those. Okay, so I think I have four minutes. Is that right? Okay, so this is what we assume. And so, in my remaining time, let me say just a little bit how we define these things. And, okay, I'll. Okay, I'll confess that these definitions might appear a little bit ad hoc. Basically, our goal here was to try to isolate which part of this transfer is related to the packet that we wrote down. And what we think is that this is what that is. And so it was convenient. I mean, it was convenient that we were then able to show that that satisfied this identity that looks similar to the one you might be used to. For the one you want to be used to. So, I'm going to take a look at the bottom of the bedroom. Okay, so basically the idea is, so L is the inner twist of GB, right? L is the Levy subgroup of G that is inner to GB. And the idea is that we take some Vile group of the centralizer group of phi, and we also take some Vile group. And we also take some vile group of the centralizer group of S V inside L. And we look at these cosets, and then we take representatives and we apply them to S, and then we compute some trace of some certain representation. And that's what this pius reg looks like. And then finally, what does the regular transfer part look like? Transfer part look like so the first thing we so okay first Okay, so let me try to explain this expression. So remember that when we compute the transfer, the first thing we do is we have to take some Jacket modules to some various endoscopic groups of the levee. Groups of the levy. And so that's what this Jacket module is. And then what I want to do is I want to take a minimal levy that phi h factors through, and I want to apply this local intertwiner relation. And so I want to replace this term with this induction. And now the situation is that you have a composition of a Jackie module and an induction. And so whenever you see these, you meet. And so, whenever you see these, you immediately want to apply Bernstein-Zelvinsky geometric lemma. And the point is, when you do that, Jackie module in induction becomes a sum over certain vial elements of basically Jackie module first, then this vile element, then an induction. And the idea is here that the right. is here that the regular part so regular part is W such that WHM is contained in HLI. So in some sense, we're in some sense we're only considering the W's where this Jack A module Jack a module doesn't do anything. Right. So so okay, so then why does why does this why does this in the case when you have no SL2s, why is this the right thing? Well, when you have no SL2s and you factor phi h through its minimal levy, then what you get is something like a supercuspital parameter. In other words, you expect that the Parameter. In other words, you expect that the L packet there consists entirely of supercuspitals. And so now any term where this JACA module takes you deeper, you're going to kill everything because they're just supercuspitals. And so the point is, when you don't have any SL2, then this throwing out those terms does nothing. But in general, it could modify the situation. So that's basically the definition of these things. So maybe I'll stop there. So, maybe I'll stop there.
