So, Jenny, just so you know, you're already being recorded. Because the previous one has stopped. I didn't realize that. So, I am? I'm already being recorded. Should I stop and restart? No, I don't think that will work. Is it still got? No, it stopped on its own, and we thought we were stopping it, and we ended up starting the next one. I think that's what we're doing. So it's not actually. Yeah, we see happening. All right, thanks. Thanks for being here. This is exciting. I'll try to make this talk a little bit entertaining. When Ian first asked me about this workshop, he said that this is not your usual run-of-the-mill theory workshop, but we want to have some deeper discussions about what are we doing right? What are we doing wrong? What can we do differently? So I've tried to phrase it a little bit with that spirit in mind. And with that spirit in mind, let me start here. Person A says, Me start here. Person A says, and my model forecast says, Person B, did you make any assumptions? Person A, I made a lot of them. Person B, then we don't believe your forecast. Person A, can I tell you about it anyways? Person B, do whatever makes you feel less absurd. So, you know, I do feel like that sometimes. My group works primarily on pretty idealized process-based models, and I do think there's a lot of value in that, but there are a lot. Value in that, but there are a lot of assumptions that we deal with, and I think a lot of them are very consequential. I think a lot of them are very consequential in how we think our models, but also how we should present our models to decision makers. Quick side note, I actually worked for the UN for a couple years, so the policy science interface is something that's very important to me. I don't think we do that all that well at the moment, so if you care about talking about that, that's a different discussion to be had. But for now, I think at least sort of let's keep it in mind. At least, sort of, let's keep it in mind that a lot of the models we do are really a very first step towards understanding a very complicated and highly non-linear system. So, I think in terms of assumption, it's useful to divide between three types of assumptions. Explicitly stated assumptions that are somewhat justified. Then, explicitly stated assumptions that are implied, but maybe not even necessarily stated. And third, I think those are the most interesting ones, implicit and ones, implicit and often unstated assumptions. So if you are into philosophy of science, this will often be called the unknown unknowns. So there are things that I know, there are things that I don't know, and then there are things that I don't know that I don't know. So just gaps in our thinking. And I think those are actually really important, particularly for near-term CRIs. So I will try to give you just a quick snapshot of three projects that we worked in. Three projects that we worked in, where I feel like I've really fundamentally changed my thinking about the physics of this problem. And all of these, interestingly enough, were really triggered by data. So yes, I'm a modeler, I'm a theoretical physicist by training. I love my PDEs, I love my computer codes. But I think often from a process-based point of view, we can do a lot more with data than we give it credit for. I feel like the inverse modelers have embraced data in a lot more intentional way. Intentional way. I think in forward models, so my group obviously works on forward models, I think data plays a different role. I think it's equally important, and I think the key role it can play is to refute our models. I feel like often in our science, we want to confirm our models, we want to reproduce the data, we want it to be consistent. But there's this whole alternate universe of trying to see, well, maybe the data contradicts my model. And I think those are some of the most important learning experiences in terms of how we. Important learning experiences in terms of how we think about ice sheet dynamics. Because I think we are trying to understand a system. So, one thing that I found always baffling when I took my first climate physics course is when I'm trained in quantum mechanics, so you start with mechanics and it goes like centuries back and then like centuries and centuries of like hardcore thought going into this. And then you come into quantum mechanics, and there's at least decades and decades and decades. And in climate science, it feels like we're really at a starting point of a really At a starting point of a really important question, but one where we have very little data, one we have very little profound understanding of what we're looking at. So I think it's fantastic. That's why I switched to science. That's exactly the kind of questions I want to work on. But I also think it's important to stay modest about what we don't and what we do and what we don't know. So here is my snapshot, my project number one, my project example number one. And I think the assumption was mentioned by Ian this morning. We often assume that I Ian, this morning, we often assume that ice sheet dynamics is mostly a fluid dynamics problem. And it is to some degree, but I think there's a whole other way of looking at ice sheets, which is basically a fracture mechanics problem or a solid mechanics problem. And I'm not even talking about Kelving, where that connection might be the most obvious. What I really have in mind is I can think of an ice stream as a flow feature, or I can think of an ice stream as sliding over a hydrologically flushed fault zone. Flushed fault zone. Both of those are equally valid in terms of the stresses we're talking about in the system and the observations. But they lead to very different model setup and to very different model questions. So here's an example. Flow of fracture is what we're trying to get at. Here's our mechanical model of an ice stream. This is work by my graduate student Cooper. We're looking at a mechanical transition at the base from slip to no slip and a simultaneous transition from temperate to frozen. So where is You froze it. So, where is the fracture mechanics problem? The fracture mechanics problem is basically: this is your fault, this is your fault tip, and then this is your intact sort of zone. So, that already gives you an idea, when you think of it from an earthquake mechanic point of view, that the properties of this interface are incredibly important. Because what these fractures do really depends entirely on the energy balance of this interface. And there's been plenty of work on that in the And there's been plenty of work on that in the earthquake mechanics world. So, with this kind of model, what we've done is look at: well, if I have this fault zone here and I have a lot of hydrology happening on it, one thing that can happen is the water can channelize in certain ways, and that can actually really change the yield stress of this bed. So, we're mostly thinking about plastic beds. So, here you can see that the yield stress of this bed depends on the normal stress, but also on the pressure. Normal stress, but also on the pressure. And the pressure, the power pressure here, is given by the hydrological system. And one thing that is, I think, interesting about this model is if you apply it to the field, like it's one thing to realize, oh, hydrology is important, and every glaciologist will tell you, duh. Like, we've known that for decades, right? So it's not really an exciting model result. One thing that is exciting, however, is if you apply it to the field, so in this case we applied it to Chem, I think it helps us understand an observation. Helps us understand an observation which, when you first hear about it, really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. So, here is the observational data that motivated this problem. And we were looking at radar data, mostly by Janie Catania, in her PhD thesis. And she looked at where during the shut-off sequence of Chem, the shear margins were located. So, here is Chem iStream. It stopped flowing about a couple hundred years ago. There's still a debate over why. One thing that's interesting. Over why. One thing that's interesting in the shutdown sequence is the shear margin jumped, quote unquote, almost discontinuously from one location to the other. And that's just an observation based on radar data. It's way before our work, so this is none of our contributions. This is just something that was suggested by Ginny Catania and her co-authors. You also see actually imprints of surface imprints of potential mudwater channels at depth. Channels at depth. Now, I think that's an interesting piece of information from a modeling point of view because if I take into account changes in the hydrology here, so the hydrology model initially has a channel at this location, and then I'm changing the water routing to this location. And the dynamic consequences of that are shown on top, where you're looking at the speed. Initially, it's located here, and then it jumps discontinuously to here. To hear. So if you think of ice as a viscous fluid, that sounds almost absurd because viscous fluids move so slowly that how can I jump, right? But viscous fluids also transmit stresses instantaneously. And when you think of it from that point of view, this makes perfect sense, right? So what this ice stream does is it reflects changes in the basal conditions, right? So how can that help me understand she emergence a little bit better? I think. Bit better, I think. The picture that has emerged from sort of this line of thinking to me is that when we're interested in processes, we shouldn't assume that it's always the same process, right? So upstream, it might be a very different process. So this is, for example, the classes of models that Mariana has worked on, where I assume there is the two, where I assume the two conditions at the bed are coinciding. So the slip to no-slip transition coincides with the transition from Coincides with the transition from temperate to frozen. And that will give me some migration, but relatively slow migration, because I need to melt to move it. Then there's sort of this regime where I have well-defined hydrological elements. In this case, that's where Betty Mukerot, he showed that that can actually lead to a stable margin because the water automatically buffers any changes in the width. And then finally, I think we get to a world. Finally, I think we get to a world where I have a lot of complex hydrology happening in which I can actually just jump it back and forth between those shear margin locations because the water system is very rich and complicated and I can have sort of a cam limit here where the ice stream rearranges in a very dynamic way. So, how has this changed my thinking? It has changed my thinking in two ways. First of all, I think we often assume that the time I think we often assume that the time scale that dominates the contribution of Antarctica to near-term sea level rise is given by ice. This kind of work would suggest that it might be given by water. If I have a change in the subglacial routing system, in the subglacial hydrology, and the ice stream readjusts in terms of its width or in terms of its location, that can have very severe consequences for the other ice. So there is an implicit assumption in just using a Stokes flow and saying, Using a Stokes flow and saying that is the time scale that is relevant because the basal interface contributes a lot of potential time scales, both in terms of the sediment, in terms of the water, in terms of the complex processes that happen here. All right, so assumption number two was that we have these super idealized models, and then we really want to understand or at least say something about sea level rise. Current sea level rise is dominated by the Amundsen Sea. Thwaites Glacier is an incredibly complicated Is an incredibly complicated thing, right? Like it has topography, it has connections to other glaciers like Pine Island, it has hydrology, it has rock, it has sediments, it has a complicated calving system, it has complicated basal topography. It's really from process-based point of view a pretty complicated challenge. Now, how can we get better at using these kinds of idealized models to try to tackle these kinds of fields? Try to tackle these kinds of field sites because these field sites is where we have data, and hence these are the field sites where we have opportunities to really push forward our understanding. So, this is an approach that we were interested in, partially based on the CAN work, to understand how would the slip zone of this ice stream adjust. So, if you for a moment try to embrace this idea that an ice stream is really just slip over a hydrologically flushed fault zone, that means the fault zone. That means the fault zone, the slip hatch, is going to adjust. We see that in earthquake dynamics all the time, right? So these slip zones are very, very dynamic features. What I need for that is a free boundary model. What is a free boundary model? A free boundary model basically helps me answer what is the failing region. So I'm not just sort of inverting for basal stress and then saying I'm moving fast in these zones because friction is low. But you try to set friction with some motivated based on some hypothesis and then you. Motivated based on some hypothesis, and then you solve the slip extent. So it's commonly in sort of classical mechanics, it's mostly phrased in terms of membrane problems where I drape this membrane over some sort of surface. In our case, the way we want to tackle this problem is look at ice velocity and then have yield stress at the base that is spatially varying. And so I'm trying to understand where is that slip in a phase, how is that slip. Limit a phase, whereas how is it slim in a phase evolving? Does that make sense? Sort of? Yes? What do you do with P? Right. So the way that this model, I think what this model can really contribute is we're not inverting for the friction at the base, right? So this is purely a forward model. So we have some hypotheses over what might be happening at the base. So for example, you could say, I think there's a certain hydrological system. Certain hydrological system, and it would have this kind of pressure distribution, and that would give me a yield stress that depends on like the highest spatially variable pressure. Or you could say, I would argue it's dominated by overburden. You can have different hypotheses about what happens at the base, plug them into the model, derive what your spatially varying yield stress is, and then see what the ramifications of that are in terms of the slip zones that are evolving. So if P is an externally involved factor. Externally imposed factor. It's not computed in the model. It is not, but you could, right? So you could easily, like, if you have a hydrological model, for example, I'll show you later one where we argue there are some channels there, then I can compute P based on, say, you know, like existing hydrological work. But in this model, you just kind of take a specific hypothesis about what's happening at the bed, and you think about what are the consequences of that in terms of ice-stream dynamics. Dynamics. So, I think an example will make it clear. So, I already alluded to thwades, and of course, that's kind of where a lot of the interest is right now. The first thing we need to do is change the model in a very significant way. The first thing we need is we need to get away from our cute little boxes, right? So here is a finite element version of a similar code. The original code I showed you was finite differences. This is finite elements just to deal with the more complicated geometry. We're using actually Christian's form. We're using actually Christian's formulation from 2006 to turn this into a variational problem. So that's all been derived before, basically. We just implemented it in a different way to make it quick. So this actually runs on a laptop pretty quickly. So it's not even that computationally intensive. The other thing we need is we need a map view, right? So in the original model I showed you, what you have is an anti-shear formulation. Those would correspond to these. Those would correspond to these kinds of black lines. You can see that these black lines get pretty complicated for real field sites. So they're no longer that nice sort of transsectional line, but they kind of wrap around it in a funky way. So what we've replaced this with is sort of a quasi-3D formulation where we look at this sort of gridded area. So we're not looking at the grounding zone right now because that's again a complicated. Because that's again a complicated animal in its own right. What I really just want to understand is for this main trunk of weights, how would potential rearrangement in the slip zone occur? The code was benchmarked. Again, again, Christian's results. So this is from his paper. And this is work done by my graduate student, Paul Summers. And this is what the code looks like in more detail. So we're already using some data here, right? So contrary to the purely idealized models, you need to have some data. Models. You need to have some data, you need to know something about the bed. We're using that machine here. We're in the process of upgrading that. We also have play with some of the bed topography that say Mickey at Stanford has derived. She's working with Dusty on different filtering and different machine learning algorithms to identify the basal topography. But basically, you can already see here that Thwaites really isn't the box in any way, right? So we have very significant variations in topography, we have just a lot of reference. We have just a lot of reference. We also have lots of sediment and water. So it's a complicated animal. So, what are the key contributions that I think this model can provide? So, as I already alluded to, we have specific assumptions about what happens at the bed. So, for example, you can say, well, some people would argue that glacial hydrology is dominated by overburden, which is clearly true to some degree, but which might not be universally true for our glaciers. So, that's one idea. Glaciers. So that's one idea. If we plug that in, then the surface velocities that our model would predict, so this is a purely forward model, I give it the Bayeslip condition, it gives me the surface velocities, are in pretty stark disagreement with what we actually see. Second case, if I have hydrology, this is motivated by hydropotential models, which is using these, then we get a much better fit for the surface observations. For the surface subsidiaries. Then one could argue: oh, maybe it's geology. So, this is work that leverages efforts to constrain where there is sediment versus rock at the base of a glacier. So there's been often when we think about sliding laws, some people would argue that sliding over rock is very different to sliding over sediments. I'm actually not so sure that's true, and I think there's been some theoretical work recently that suggests that maybe both of them actually fall into a plastic regime. Both of them actually fall into a plastic regime and might be a lot more similar than we give them credit to. But this is sort of the idea that this is geologically controlled. If I do that, I get a slightly better fit to observations, but it's still pretty problematic, partly because I have to lock the edges somehow. So the the geology does not give me a sort of obvious way of constraining the flow zone. Yes. And in terms of the model that represents previously? That represents the physiology of the yield stress, or where does that come into the model? Yeah, so we have different ways of computing that. We've tried different things. So, one is you impose an actual Wertmann-type sliding in the rock portions, and you impose plastic in the sediment. So, that's one thing that we looked at. It actually is not a great fit to surface observations, so it looks very noisy. So, this, another computation we've done is this, which we both, we think of both as. Which we think of both as plastic. So, those are, you can play around with different alternatives. I have to admit that no matter what you assume regarding the geology, we haven't really been able to make it consistent with surface observations. But this is making them both plastic, but with very different properties. Yes. So, which is the best fit to observations we could get. So, I would say from this analysis, again, you can do a lot more parameter testing here, but from this analysis, to me, at least suggests. From this analysis, to me, at least suggests that it might be reasonable to think of thwades as hydrology-dominated and fully plastic. So, a lot of IC models have difficulty stabilizing threads dynamics if you plug in high power loss. In this case, we can make that happen quite effortlessly because we're actually solving for the slip extent. Now, why do I care about this? So, okay, maybe I care about this in a generic sort of way, but I think we care about this in a more deeper way. I think we care about this in a more deeper way. And I think one aspect in which we might care about this, and again, this is preliminary work, is that if you embrace the idea that this is really a slip phenomenon, and if you embrace the idea that it's hydrology dominated, at the rates that thwades is thinning currently, you're changing the force balance in rather significant ways. So I'm reducing the driving stress because the thickness is going down so rapidly. That means that the slip zone will try to contract. That the slep zone will try to contract. So, here are some simulations that we've done for today, and this is, for example, 25 years out, so pretty close. And you can see that there is gradually a second shear margin emerging in the interior of the current slip zone, which to me suggests, you know, like again, this is just a model prediction that we need to test against data. So I'm not saying that this will happen at weights. But I think it's worth to consider the possibility. Worth to consider the possibility that if we retreat very rapidly and thin the ice, that there are more things that happen than just the marine ice sheet instability. There are other things that can happen. The basal conditions can change profoundly, the slip zone can change profoundly, and all of these will alter whether the instability actually propagates in the way that current models suggest it might. So I think there is a value to these models as a complementary view on ice streams compared to existing. Ice streams compared to existing approaches. So, assumption three, I just plugged this in this morning because it came up in a discussion and something we've been thinking about. I think these are sort of what I initially refer to as the unknown unknowns. And I think one of those is what and where is the basal interface? The basal interface is really at the heart of so many problems in glaciology. It's at the heart of sediment fluxes, it's at the heart of glacial hydrology, it's at the heart of geomorphology, it's at the heart of ice stream dynamics. It's really something that. Of ice green dynamics, it's really something that is crucial to many things that we're thinking about. But we often don't think of it in incredibly subtle ways. And I think there is a lot more to this interface than meets the eye necessarily. And the data that to me recently was sort of eye-opening in that sense is here from Meyer et al. It's data from Greenland, actually from a relatively slow-moving ridge zone. So the velocity is not that high. And the interesting thing that they observed is that the strain rates in Observed is that the strain rates increase in the vicinity of the bed, but then they drop, and they drop very significantly. So you can see here, if you compare the pink and the gray, the pink is the observation, the gray is the model. Initially, they do pretty well, right? So initially, the model and the data are pretty much one-on-one. But at the base, at the interface, the part that I care about the most, the misfit is dramatic. Like, if this is the misfit, that tells you, in my opinion, that you've missed something. You've missed something fundamental. You've missed something fundamental about what's happening here. And so, this is work that Ludovic is involved with. So, if you are more interested in getting some of the details of the model, I encourage you to talk to him. And it also goes to comments Steve made this morning about GPU infrastructure. Ludwig and I have been involved in this initiative to develop a 3D GPU solver, which is actually, I think, very exciting, and I think there's a lot of value to these infrastructures. And they scale. And they scale really well in parallel if you have a nicely designed algorithm that really targets that type of infrastructure. So, I personally see a lot of value in the GPU world, and I'm sure Ludovic would be happy to tell you a lot more about it, and so would I. But for now, let's maybe focus on the science question that we're looking at. So, this is work by my graduate student, Emma, and what we're looking at is one difference in models and in field sites is that field sites have Is that field sites have heterogeneity, they have roughness, they have topography. And we often throw that out as a modeler, right? It's one of those things where it's just like, we know it exists, but who cares, right? And I think we should reconsider that attitude because for instabilities, and we see that a lot in fluid dynamics, whether you have homogeneity or you have heterogeneity matters a great deal. There are several examples where in a homogeneous system, I have an instability. In a heterogeneous system, the instability goes away. And I think there's a Away. And I think there's a lot of potential to further thinking about that. So Emma has what Emma's contribution was to add an immersed boundary method to Ludovic's code with which we can look at the effect of topography and how that alters the flow behavior. And the key finding is that for certain conditions, which we am happy to talk more about, but for now I'll skip over, you see the formation of an internal sliding. See the formation of an internal sliding zone, right? So often we argue that basal sliding happens at the bed, but that's not necessarily true in a highly non-linear rheology. So for example, David Goldsby has done a lot of really great work trying to map out the details of the rheology of ice. And one of the things that, one of the ramifications of that is that if I have small topography that is relatively closely spaced, I can actually create an internal slip interface. Internal slip interface. So not all slip is almost always at the basal interface, right? So in here, you can see the velocity for this ice stream. It basically just goes over the topography. And that's interesting to me because in the field we often see this transition from flow to sliding coincide with the change in the roughness of the bed. So I think the roughness of the bed might very well be an interesting factor here. Do you have sliding at the bed? In this case, we don't, because we're interested in looking at the We don't because we're interested in looking at the onset of sliding, right? But you could, yeah. I mean, do you actually. So the immersed boundary method we implement kind of goes back to Paskin's formulation of the terms, and basically the idea is. Terms and basically, the idea is: do you take a Lagrangian view of the solid? We actually have tried two approaches. You can also have a Eulerian view, which would be the distributed Lagrange multiplier approach, Lagowinski and Patanka, etc. In this case, actually, the immersed boundary method gives you a better error, like lower error at the interface. So, here we're building on the numerical ski by Kempe et al. 2012. And I'm happy to walk through that in more detail. Okay, no, no, I understand. So, basically, what we defined. Basically with the parent and free you modern just this lab and then the right so the idea is the idea behind the immersed boundary method is you think about what force would I need on the interface to ensure the boundary condition that I want to enforce, right? And then you add that to your equations. But but don't you have it don't you consider it frozen to the bedrock here? Yes, so we have done we've tried several things. So we've tried sliding, we've tried no sliding, we've tried frozen or non-frozen. We've tried frozen or non-frozen. You can actually, and it's basically just a question of the parameter space, right? So, but there is a regime in which you can freeze to the interface, to the basal interface, and still slide internally, right? Similarly, for those of you who've been at AGU, we've also looked at sliding within the till, which is actually also something that is not even that hard to do. So, I think in terms of the basal interface, I think the picture that emerges for me is I can slide in the ice. Is I can slide in the ice, I can slide at the interface, or I can slide in the till. And I think all of those will happen in different dynamic settings. So there's a lot of variability to these systems that I don't think our models always capture fully. That's why I think there's a lot of value in connecting to data more intentionally. So let me wrap up. Just to throw out a few conclusions and maybe get the discussion started. Often when we think about data model comparison, I feel like we look at sort of broad maps. Like, we look at sort of broad match between data and model. But I think there's a lot of value for looking at the subtleties. So often there are little things that mismatch. At the interface, there might be a large mismatch. Or there is this feature like the jump in the shear margin of CAM that really doesn't make sense in the context of the current model. So I think when we, there's a lot of treasure, I think hidden treasure in observational data that can help us understand how our models might not be capturing all of the relevant. Might not be capturing all of the relevant physics necessarily. Then, secondly, I would argue in terms of what are we trying to do as modelers, I think for systems this non-linear and this complicated, I think it's really valuable to have a diverse set of models. I don't think we want to have everything devoted to one model approach, because each model approach has different pros and cons. And I think each model approach can shed light on different aspects of the system. And I think that can help us reduce model bias. And one of the things I've really noticed. One of the things I've really noticed is if you've worked on one model for very long, it biases your thinking because you kind of expect to see what you've always seen, right? And I think there's a value in trying to break through that.
