Thanks for coming back after coffee. I'm glad no one was scared away by that intense round of introductions before. If you didn't meet people, of course you didn't meet everyone probably in the last few minutes. So go find more people at the next break and meet them too. I also want to, as one of the organizers, again, I'm Dance Blankers. You've all technically now met me. I want to thank you for joining us. I'm really looking forward to this week. We're now going to embark on a one-hour experience, which is learning what. One-hour experience, which is learning what COMOC is a bit about. And we spent two plus years applying for, organizing, planning this event. And what I've learned from the five organizers, in fact, we've also did some organizing swapping and stuff. And what I've learned is that we all had a slightly different vision, and sometimes greatly different vision. Sometimes, a greatly different vision about what this was going to be. But I think, I firmly believe that that is a feature, not a bug. And what I would like, what I would like all of you to do, your homework for this week, other than do some great math for some great people, is to develop your own vision for what you think this is. So, to me, this is a tendon. It's a connective tissue between a skeleton and a muscle, both of which are very important. And a muscle, both of which are very important, but they get best when this one's like, I refuse to commit. So we can debate this later. I do have thoughts, but that's for later. So to get us kind of started in this direction, though, I also, I really like heist movies. And so I'm kind of thinking of this as like an Ocean's 11 was a heist movie. We need to introduce the main characters. That's what happens at the start. The main characters. That's what happens at the start of the film. We have a little moment here, a little moment here, a moment here, and we see all the cool people. And then we may even see a villain, right? And so that's what we're going to start with now, the montage at the start of the movie, with Jake's zoo of moduli spaces of curves. So I'm going to get out of the way. Thank you and Jake's start. Yeah, okay. Well, I thank you very much. Yeah, well, and just to echo that, I'm so happy that we're all here. To echo, guys, I'm so happy that we're all here, and I really do speak for all of us when I say that we've been looking forward to this conference for, as you said, literally years. So it's great that we're all here. So, okay, so yeah, so the title on the schedule is What is COMAC all about? I'm going to kind of answer this question a little bit literally in the sense that I call my talk the zoo of modulized spaces of curves. And the reason for that is that I sort of came to this subject personally from Schubert Calculus. And in Schubert Calculus, there's really a zoo. And in super calculus, there's really a zoo of spaces that people study about basically linear algebra objects, right? So planes and flags and maybe like collections of planes and all of these variations. And in the same way, we might sort of informally talk about the moduli space of curves, but there's not just one, there's really many moduli spaces of curves. And we've heard some of them mentioned actually briefly in the introductions. And so essentially, my plan is that I'm going to draw a bunch of pictures. Pictures are, in my experience, like one of my In my experience, like one of the nicest ways to understand both geometry and combinatorics. And so I'm going to try and introduce some of the different spaces, not quite all of them, but a lot of the spaces that are going to come up this week in the different working groups. So, okay, so this is going to be, this whole talk is going to be essentially a big chart. So we'll have spaces for each one, the kind of geometric object that Geometric object that that particular variation of the moduli space of curves allows you to describe, and then what sort of combinatorial object you use to keep track of the geometry. Okay, and the order that I picked is just sort of my personal favorite order from kind of, in my mind, most approach. In my mind, most approachable and simplest to more involved. So, I'm going to start with M0 and MAR, probably the most widely studied of these spaces, and the one that comes up in many of the working groups this week. So what is this? This is the moduli space of so-called stable curves of genus zero with n marked. Points. Okay, so I'm not going to try and define this space properly. This isn't really the goal of this talk, isn't really to be a teaching talk, but just to draw a bunch of pictures. So I'm going to draw you, first of all, what do most of the elements of this space look like? What kind of curves are they? So a general element of M0M bar is pretty simple to describe. So it's a single genus zero curve, and there's really only one, which is P1. Only one, which is P1. So Riemann sphere. Let me find some photo char with some number of points marked on it. So essentially just an n tuple of points. So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Okay, and so like essentially just an um say an n tuple, so this would be n equals eight. So, this would be n equals 8. n triple of points on p1. And this is actually what 99% of the moduli space describes: curves like this. And all, and there's not really any interesting combinatorial structure at this point. All the interesting stuff happens when we start looking at special curves. So a special curve, a special element of this moduli space, now looks like several P1s joined together in a tree structure. Join together in a tree structure, and so a curve, a picture like this. Okay, so now four, here I've drawn four P1s attached to each other at simple nodes, and with, say, my eight mark points distributed across the four different P1s. And right away, in describing this kind of special element of the modelized state. Of special element of the moduli space, there's some discrete combinatorial data to keep track of, which is what is the exact distribution of the mark points across the different components. Okay, and this is sort of the motivation for drawing some combinatorial picture. It wouldn't be relevant to do so so much for this first one, but for the second one, we can kind of translate this directly into a tree. And so the tree, in this case, would have four parts that correspond to the four key words. That corresponds to the four Q1s, and then we will indicate all of the positions of the mark points by showing where they're attached along the code. Okay, and so this describes a somewhat special element of the moduli space. And we can actually still draw a combinatorial object for the first part. It's just not so interesting. A single vertex with all eight But all A point's attention. Okay, and just to sort of give one example, but so okay, where is sort of genometry sort of controlling the nature of this picture? Well, we have a tree that's sort of translating the fact that this is a genus zero curve. I said stable before, and in this case, that turns into a very direct combinatorial condition, which is that the degree The degree is at least three at each vertex. Okay, and so that's sort of our other sort of immediate feature. So this is the type of graph that comes up in studying M0 and bar. Okay, and this isn't just a dictionary to describe the different types of elements of this space. This is really a very useful, like, I guess, device that carries. Device that carries along for the ride all kinds of other computations that you could do in this space. In particular, things like intersection theory that was mentioned a bunch of times in the introductions, and then other things. And actually, before I did other examples, I wanted to give like a little sketch of what the actual space looks like. So a sketch of M05 bar is not my, I have, there are many ways to draw this space, and I just picked a very coarse one here. I just picked a very coarse one here. So, what does this space look like? Well, as I said, 99% of it looks like this. And so, if I take a point in the interior, that's going to be some particular choice of curve that corresponds to the first type of picture. So, it's of type, I guess, one, two, three, four, five if I'm doing M054. I picked M054 because that one's a surface. Yes. So, technically, 100% is the magic. Yes. So technically 100% instead of 99%. 100%, yes. Technically. Well, they mentioned it twice. Okay, and then where do these other parts of the space come up? Well, they're out along the edges, along the boundary. And so if we walk along this space, there's going to be some stratum of it off to the side of curves that look like one of the more complicated tree structures. Say, for the sake of argument, this one. This one, three, four, five. Okay, and if we keep walking along the boundary, we can find more and more complicated tree structures. And so we can find a curve that looks like, let's say, this one. Okay, and all I really wanted to get across here, so I mean, so you can sort of see here that, so for example, how are these different trees related to each other? They're exactly Trees related to each other, they're exactly related by inserting and contracting edges. So, if I think if I contract this edge, I get this tree. If I contract this edge, I go back up. And so, this very basic operation on the combinatorial level of adding and subtracting or adding and contracting edges to a tree tells you what happens when you walk around in the muscularized space. Okay, and so this is like a first taste of that translation, but really I'm just sort of asserting that this drawing is very useful. This drawing is very useful for understanding MCR linebacker. Okay, that's all I wanted to say about MCREMA. Let's go on to MG. Basically, we're just going to do a variation now on these pictures. So, NG, probably historically the most important of these spaces, is now the moduli space of, say, smooth curves. Case of, say, smooth curves of GSG. Okay, and at least at the level of granularity that I'm doing in this talk, we're just drawing kind of pictures of what the curves look like. Because I'm saying smooth here, there's kind of only general elements in this picture, and so they just look like Riemann surfaces, say like this, with some number of holes. So genus 2 in this case. And in order to find In this case. And in order to find anything special, we again have to go to some kind of compactified space. So mg corresponds to curves like this one. Mg bar would now be stable curves, which are the sort of curves that are allowed to be singular that you can get by varying the particular choice of smooth curve. And just to give an example, I just want to kind of show the new sorts of phenomena that come up combinatorially when you look in this space. But in the space. So for example, okay, so just continuing my three columns. So an example of a special element in mg bar would be something like this. So where I imagine taking a loop on this genus2 curve and pinching it so that it becomes a singular. And pinching it so that it becomes a singularity. And so that would look something like this. Okay. And so this is still, so okay, so we still have one more hole. We have a singular point here. This is still a curve of arithmetic genus 2, but there's sort of a way to think of it as coming from a slightly simpler curve, change colors for this, where we imagine popping apart this node and thinking of the result. node and thinking of the result as now as a curve that looks like this. So a say a with one hole and with two mark points. And this is sort of like a geometric explanation for how to describe curves of this form. Instead of being a genus two, you actually have something of genus one, but now it One, but now it's with n equals two of two mark points. And so that would be passing to mg n bar. Okay, and I think to draw one more, I think I'll just draw in one more sketchy. Okay, if I imagine continuing to sort of pinch this curve, I could end up with something with several singularities. And I think I'm out of space on the board to draw it, but I'll just say that what sort of explanation would I have for a curve like this one if I want to describe it using simpler curves? Well, I would pop it apart and actually have just two entirely separate components. And so this would really be coming from two choices of curve, both of genus zero, and with points, as in this other case, that may. As in this other case, that indicate where the singularities are coming from. So, in this way, like this is sort of the actual origin of where our points come from, and this is what we get at MGN bar. Okay, so how do we want to adjust our picture to account for this extra data? Well, the basic thing that we can do is still draw the tree structures and graph structures from before, but now start annotating them. And this is how all of these calculations work, is that we start annotating the graphs. And in this case, we'll just annotate it by putting the We'll just annotate it by putting the genus inside the vertex. So instead of a dot, I'll draw a circle with a two in it. For this one here, I guess I had a circle with a one and two half points. Okay, and here the way I would actually draw this is I'll still draw the one since topologically this is coming from a genus one curve, but it has an edge attachment back. It has an edge attaching back onto itself, so it has a smooth. Okay, and you can sort of see visually that the passage from this smooth curve to this singular curve is reflected in a very simple graph operation. Okay, and I guess just to complete this picture, down here I had a vertex of genus zero, another vertex of genus zero, and actually three. Okay, um, and Okay, and what does stability correspond to in this very picture? So now the condition is the degree is greater than or equal to 3 at each vertex of genus 0 only, and the degree is at least 1 at each vertex of genus 1. Okay, and this is just sort of what ends up being the slight combinatorial constraint on this classograph. Constraint on this class of graphs. Okay, that's all my pictures for Mg and Mg and R. The third one I wanted to mention is what's called the moduli space of stable max. So I'm going to specifically look at m 0 n bar t 2 3 So this is not a space of curves, but technically a space of maps, stable maps. A space of maps, stable maps, to P2. The 3 here means that the image in P2 is supposed to be a cubic curve. Okay, so what do the general elements of this space look like, and what are the special elements look like? And in particular, what are the sort of new sorts of funny phenomena that come up in studying this space? Well, okay, what does a general element look like? Actually, I'm going to switch to drawing this, my P1. So it's a genus zero. My P1, so it's a genus zero curve. I'm going to switch to drawing P1 as a line instead of the remote server this now, just to make the pictures more legible. Well, it's now a map. It's really a curve together with some map to P2 where the image is a cubic curve. And so this is really now a variation on the moduli space of curves where we have curves together with maps. Okay, and if we have some number of mark points, then we mark them on. Then we mark them on the curve here. And okay, and of course, we can sort of be curious also about where they might show up, where they might pass to underneath. Okay, but then as we pass to the boundary of this space, there's some new things that can happen. And so I think the most, the newest one, one that's really particular to degenerated maps, would be so. So, the way I would imagine it is taking this image here and doing some kind of compression thing, scaling the y-axis until the curve flattens into a straight line. And so what does that end up looking like? Well, basically the curve doesn't degenerate, but the map degenerates. And so we can end up with a map whose image is actually a line, but where the map itself is a 3 to 1. Is a three to one map onto the line. Okay, and this is like particular to the moduli space of max. On the other hand, we can also, oh, I guess one of the drawings points just to keep it more consistent. One, two, three. You might conceivably have all three of them mapped to the same point, for example, particularly special element of this space. And then also all of the other phenomena that come up for just studying the modularized space of curves. Studying the moduli space of curves can come up here. So, for example, breaking the source curve into pieces, let's say with the one here and the two and three here, and mapping them into the plane. And so, for the sake of argument, let's say that the top part maps in as a conic, the middle part maps in as a line, and the last part maps in as being contraction. Epson as being contracted, contracting it to a point. So, what would this look like? Well, okay, so let me just draw kind of ellipse and a line. And so the mark point one is landing somewhere on the line, and this entire component, which I'm actually going to highlight in red at this point, is mapping, is being contracted somewhere. Okay. So we can sort of imagine how we might want to convert. Sort of imagine how we might want to convert some of these pictures into combinatorial objects. Actually, for the moduli space of maths, I don't know of just one specific preferred choice of combinatorial objects. So I've seen several, depending on the particular calculations people have done. But for the sake of argument, what I'm going to do is annotate each vertex by the genus and the degree of that part of the map. And so this first part would just be a single vertex with a 0,3 annotation. This last part would look like This last part would look like just a modified version of the previous pictures. So a vertex of genus 0 and degree 2, a vertex of genus 0 and degree 1, and then here a vertex of genus 0 and degree 0 that's actually being contracted. Okay, and I'll just go and mark points. Okay. Okay, and then for this one, you know, already this annotation that I'm doing is maybe a little insufficient because the way I've said it, it should still be 0, 3. But maybe we'd actually rather write something like 0 and then some kind of 3 to 1 annotation to really describe exactly what kind of element in the space it is. So this is where you start getting into these variations of different kinds of pictures. Okay, and then what does stability turn into in the case of stable maps? In the case of stable maps. So, stability is that the degree is at least 3 if the genus and degree are both zero. So it's just now a slightly more specific condition on stability. And greater than or equal to 1 if the genus and degree are 1 degree, genus 1 and degree separately. So that's a slight variation. Yes. Oh, yeah, you're right. Thank you. I think we actually might discuss this the other day. I'm not going to fix that now, but you're right. I should say that. Thank you. Okay, so that's all I wanted to say on the moduli space of stable maps. The last moduli space I wanted to draw a picture of. I wanted to draw a picture of is the tropical one. And so M0N trot, the tropical moduli space of curves, which got mentioned a whole bunch in the introductions. And I'm just going to draw this one very loosely because it's quite different in spirit from the other one. So what is an element of the tropical moduli space of curves? It's essentially a path in M01 bar. So my mental sketch of what is an element of curve. Mental sketch of what is an element of the tropical moduli space of curves is a single element corresponds to something like a path that is in M0n and converging off towards some boundary point. And so how would I like convert this to a combinatorial picture? Well actually I would just draw the same combinatorial pictures I drew before. Combinatorial pictures I drew before for n0 and bar, say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. And in this setting, the main novelty, the main new thing that happens is that now all of the edges are annotated with a length. So we have values A, B, and C, which are actually real numbers, A, B, C opted of real numbers. On a set of real numbers. And what is their role? Is there basically certain exponents. I'm just going to write this very informally. There are certain exponents or speeds, and they're exactly kind of saying what is the shape of this path as it goes into its boundary. So depending on those values, you're sort of varying the choice of path. Okay, and that's sort of what the tropical moduli space describes. And so it sort of visibly comes up directly in studying limits. Up directly in studying limits in the ordinary multiplayer space. Okay, and with that, I think I've covered like five or six of the spaces of interest in the various working groups. I mean, many of our group leaders have worked on Greek Ethereums on all of these spaces. I couldn't cover all of them, so I was just going to mention, just to end up, some other animals in the zoo. So just like continuing this idea. So it's just like continuing this idea of like what are the different variants of this moduli space. And they all are typically things like a curve together with something else. And so it could have been a curve with a map. It could have been a curve with some path converging towards it. But so for example, a curve together with a line bundle or a divisor class. Okay, so Jacobi. Okay, so Jacobians and compacted by Jacobians and drilled out their loci and so on. That would be a next big example, which I won't really say anything about. Okay, a curve with a cover. So say one curve covered by a second curve. So this is now much more similar in spirit to a moduli space at max, but specifically now using relating two different curves. Okay, and then the last big variation that I think comes. The last big variation that I think comes up in some of the different working groups and in a lot of the work in this subject would be curves that are, say, subject to different stability conditions or different singularities that are allowed, different stability or singularities. So, all the singularities I was drawing so far were basically simple nodes, but you Simple knowns, but you could, for example, study curves with cusps, and that would be another sort of variation. Okay. And that's all I wanted to say, just to kind of walk through the zoo and look at all the different panelists. So that's that mix. And then I think oh, I should have questions. Thanks. Minutes before we pass over. Any questions? Otherwise, we would move on to it. Yes. What's your favorite animal? Oh, for me, probably M0 and Bar. I think that's probably my natural home. And then more recently, well, I'm also part of this project for Robin Rouhinier, sort of tropicalizing me and Sean. So to that one. Okay, well, why don't we switch over? Okay, well why don't we switch over to the next talk? Why don't I leave you to manage the recording? No, because we have to do it. Everybody's going to stop me at the recording. Oh, okay, okay. You want to do it? Me? You can stop and come in off for
