And boil down, you know, boil things down to really the fundamental rules of what's going on. But I came to Mayo and joined a lab that's looking at the human microbiome. So that general class of systems is microbial communities and how they interact with each other and their human hosts. And so hopefully I'll tell you, get to a little bit about how we're trying to boil those down to the general principles and really understand the rules. Really understand the rules. So I said we are concerned with the human microbiome. So let me tell you a little bit about why you should be concerned with the human microbiome, too. It's an extremely complex ecosystem, a huge interacting network of species and metabolites, so orders of magnitude more microbial genes than human genes inside you right now. Way more metabolites associated with the microbes than with human cells. So unsurprisingly, a huge complex. A huge complex network of interacting species is going to affect human health and disease. So, pretty clear why Mayo would care and why people across the world are starting to care a lot about the human microbiome. Now, for a long time, I think we've understood well that microbes were doing something. It was you know microbes in our sport were doing something, converting indigestible food components, producing cofactors and vitamins, that kind of thing. Cofactors in vitamins, that kind of thing. But there's been a huge increase in the technology that we have in discovering what microbes are present in a sample. So that's led to a lot of interest in all these sort of new things we're discovering that microbes have an effect on. So host repair pathways, cell proliferation, that kind of stuff. But then even wilder things, the thing I always get asked about at family gatherings because it was in on About at family gatherings because it was on the cover of science or whatever, or you know, popular science is the gut-brain access. So, turns out there's some association between microbes in your gut and Parkinson's disease in Alzheimer's. So, very important, very impactful, huge complex system. Our focus is on how this system is affecting cancer in the gut. Okay, so the gut microbiome is maybe the most popular. Maybe the most popular subset of the microbiome to study because it's exchanging food with the outside environment, too. So it's complex, and we can actually sample it in ways that I won't get into because we all just ate. But so here, so our lab, before I got there, so this research had been going on for a while before I got there. You know, just looking at samples, so this is just samples from an adenoma is a An adenoma is a non-cancerous tumor, but it's often pre-cancerous in the gut epithelium. So you can sample adenoma tissue and non-adenoma tissue and start to ask what microbes are associated with this adenoma, what microbes are associated with healthy tissue, and okay, some pretty good significant associations. Okay, we also like to think about sort of community-wide statistics. Does diversity change in the tumor tissue versus normal tissue? And Tumor tissue versus normal tissue, and okay, it looks like there's some diversity change, so this is kind of promising. There's some associations here, but it's a pretty muddy picture, okay? So, for example, there's a lot of confounding factors, so here these are just p-values, and then these are various sort of community statistics. So, this Shannon is diversity, just observed species. And then this UNIFRAC is another sort of measure of evolutionary diversity, sort of, in a community. And we see, so, okay, so BMI. And we see, so, okay, so BMI has this significant association with what species are present. Sex has an association with this eunifrac. So there's a ton of confounding factors. I mean, obviously diet is going to have a huge role. Geographic location, all these things. So it makes it very hard. And then let's boil down into actually that tumor data. And so from our lab, this figure: okay, if we take a PCA plot of If we take a PCA plot of the relative abundances of species in these different samples in tumor and normal tissue, this doesn't really separate. Definitely the eye test, nothing jumps out at you as any sort of significant difference between these. These dots are just on top of each other. And then to really drive the point home, there's been a couple of meta-analysis. So actually, that table from the previous slide, this table, it's sort of an abbreviated version of it, is the middle column of this. Version of it is the middle column of this matrix, and then the other columns are just from other papers that were doing similar things. And we see that even on particular species, which is the rosar species, different papers will disagree, different studies will disagree on what's associated with tumor, what's associated with healthy tissue. So, this is a tough system to get a handle on. So, this is why, this is where I come in and say, okay. This is where I come in and say, okay, we need to really understand the fundamentals. We need to boil down and figure out what's going on. Yeah, question? I have a very dumb question. How do we actually measure the relative abundances? Yeah, so there's a couple of technologies. 16S is the probably cheapest, most popular, which is just it's sequencing a particular conserved gene that has variations in different species. So a different species will have a different 16S gene. So just amplify and sequence that, and then just see what's different. And that's actually why this is OTUs is. Actually, why this is OTUs is observed taxonomic units, and it's usually just how many different 16S genes did we see? But that's not a relative abundance, that's just which species are there. Yeah, but then you sort of can count the abundance of each particular 16S, and you cannot count absolutely, but you can count relatively, because you know sort of how much you've amplified the entire sample. And then the other more modern one is the metagenomic shock. One is the metagenomic, a shotgun metagenomic sequencing, they call it, which they just sequence everything, more or less, and then it essentially comes down to a database lookup of whatever genes you found. So that's more modern next-gen sequencing, yeah. Can you say that what are the columns? Can you? This is, so the columns are different papers, so just different published papers that of different studies of the associations between, and then the colors are. And then the colors are our p-values of red is association with tumor tissue and blue is association with healthy tissue. Are those using different data sets those studies? Yeah, different data sets. Yeah. Oh, common or is that common? I don't know the sample sizes. No, sorry. I don't know the different sample sizes on all of them. But I know, so the So, two different meta-analyses about specifically colon cancer, and then there's a third one, actually, also by Patrick Schloss at Michigan. That is just obesity, does obesity correlate, or is there any sort of association with obesity? And they showed that yes, but no study published it was a big enough sample size to actually find it. So, you can only find it if you do this meta-analysis. So, a lot of confounders. Okay. Okay, so yeah, so these are good questions because they really drive home the point that this is hard to figure out. So I think to me we need a mechanistic hypothesis. And to me, this is sort of the sample of science, or the cycle of science, right? We do some experimentation, experiments, we do some studies and statistical modeling that suggests some things, and now we need to come up with a more mechanistic hypothesis, which we want to express as a mathematical. We want to express as a mathematical model. If we express a hypothesis as a model, then we can start asking it questions and look at the consequences of that hypothesis. We can look at whether a hypothesis is true or not, and then if it is, or at least there's some evidence that it's somehow close to the truth, then we can look at the consequences of that hypothesis as well. But so, what I'm interested in is figuring out what's the right way to model microbial population dynamics, especially in the human gut. Okay, so we need a model that can do with a few things. We need to actually capture the dynamics. That's probably kind of a, I mean, that's the goal one. So we need something complex enough to do that. I'm all for simple models, but we want as simple as possible, but no simpler. So there's some level of complexity. We need to figure out what level of complexity we need. We want to explain the mechanism of effect on host cells. We're at Mayo, we're working. We're at Mayo. We're concerned with the course of cancer and what we can do to treat it. So that's important to us. And then this is definitely the pie in the sky goal, but you can imagine a world in which we could build these models from single patient data. If we understood the system well enough, maybe. Maybe there's some way, maybe not. Maybe there's enough randomness that it's impossible. But maybe if we understand the system well enough, we can build individualized models for individualized treatment. That's obviously. For individualized treatment. That's obviously a very lofty goal, but let's shoot for the clouds. Disclaimer here: my background is in ODE, so I'm perfectly happy ignoring spatial heterogeneity, but I'm aware of its importance. My argument is always: let's walk before we start running. Let's learn to walk before we start running. So I'd love to talk more about how space comes into it, but. Space comes into it, but maybe afterwards. So, okay, population dynamics. What's the simplest population dynamics model? It's Lock of Volterra, right? It's our friends. I don't know why in every textbook I see, it's always Canadian lynx and snowshoe hair, but there it is. Canadian lynx and snowshoe hair. That's where they were. Yeah, the fur trade, right? Yeah, exactly. So this just says, okay, we interact directly. Our species are interacting directly. They're somehow doing something to each other. Doing something to each other. That's extremely coarse grain, right? But it's simple and nice, and if it does the job, we'd like that. So, how do we know if it does the job? Well, we took a look at some experiments done in Jeff Gore's lab at MIT, in which they grew eight different species. They grew alone in pairs and in groups of three. And we just asked, well, first question: if I fit. Well, first question: if I fit parameters for the Locka-Volterra model or maybe something more complex but still just pairwise interaction, if I fit that to the pair growth experiments, is that going to lift to the group of three experiments? Now this shouldn't shock you, but the answer is no. And then we even dug a little deeper. There's things like you have reversal of sort of the effects, which a pairwise model isn't going to catch when in a pair. When in a pair, we have sort of positive effects on growth. When in a group of three, you see a reverse, you see a negative effect. So, a pairwise model isn't going to catch that. We could not find a single parameterized model that recapitulated even qualitatively the entire set of experiments, even if I just restrict to extinction versus survival. So, even if I go binary, that's what we can. So, our conclusion here is that lack of. Our conclusion here is that, Lacha Vault, we need to add another layer of complexity. Direct interaction modeling doesn't give us the complexity to explore novel communities and figure out what's going to happen if we introduce a new species into an existing community. You mentioned direct interaction and pairwise. They're not necessarily that's true, not necessarily the same thing. So you're right. We could have a we could certainly fit any situation by, you know. Situation by any particular situation, we could certainly fit by adding terms. I could add an order 3 term, an order 4 term, whatever. But then we're just, we get a huge explosion, we kind of get a combinatorial explosion in the order of your model, right? So if you're writing down, say, polynomial OD, if you're just doing sort of extending lock of Alterra, then this is what's the order. What's the order that you'll need, like the number of species, like I don't know, factorial or something? The number of species factorial or something, right? So maybe three ways are enough. Maybe, maybe three ways are enough. Yeah, of course. They only did three. So maybe to go from two to three, it doesn't work, but from three you can go four or five. Certainly possible, yes. However, I tend to think that in any of these situations, you're really kind of limiting yourself. There's no way to make it. There's no way to make that very context-dependent, right? So let's add a layer of complexity that's going to also allow us to get some environmental context as well. What does the data look like? What does the data look like from those experiments? So I don't have a slide to show you the data from those experiments, but they've got, they grew these things on with cereal dilutions and they have something like, I think it's like five time points through growth. I think it's like five time points through growth for each experiment, and maybe five replicates for each experiment. And they did all three combinations. Yeah, all groups of three. All pairs, all groups of three. And they actually did the whole group of eight as well. Yeah. Yeah. So if I remember correctly, Jeff's stuff, when they do pairwise analysis and to try to predict three, it doesn't quite work, but then when they try to predict out 12 things together, To map 12 things together, then they only found a handful of behaviors that they could not predict from pairs, right? Yeah, that's right. So I guess this kind of gets to how good do you want to be here? So yeah, I think it's reasonable to, I don't think it's totally unreasonable to carry on with Laga Volterra or just with pairwise modeling, but I think, as I say, I think, as I said, it sort of misses a lot of environmental context. It doesn't give us a great way to think about interaction with the host. And what I think we would really like to do is be able to investigate novel communities. And so we kind of want something that's going to be able to explain a lot of interdependent, all these interdependent growth experiments, right? Well, what about metabolites? Next slide, yeah. Yeah, of course. That's our level of complexity. That's our next layer of complexity that we want to add, is metabolites. So this is nice. So metabolite-mediated hypothesis is very nice here because it gives an obvious way that we interact with the host. So what do I mean by metabolite-mediated hypothesis here? I mean that the way that a community is interacting with, you know, the members of the community are interacting is through their diet, they're depleting the same resource pool. They're depleting the same resource pool, and through what they're producing as byproducts of their metabolism. So they're pulling out of and putting into the same resource pool, this shared resource pool, and then that is the interaction, according to this hypothesis, the driving interaction of community dynamics. And as I said, has a nice, if we are starting to attract metabolites, if we are starting to worry about metabolites, then we have a way to explain interaction. Way to explain interaction with the host and maybe even colon cancer, right? So, this is sort of the next layer of complexity, and I'll say this layer of complexity is enough to create a single parameterized model to explain those experiments. We have to sort of hypothesize metabolites because the data didn't have metabolomics in it, but we can hypothesize metabolites and come up with a single parameterized model. Single parameterized model. And then over here, I'm just showing you what I mean when I say metabolite-mediated model, well, just from a very general standpoint. I mean that now I'm going to track both my species X and my metabolites Y. My species are going to grow according to some interaction with metabolites, and the metabolites are going to, the amount of metabolites is going to change according to interactions between metabolites and species. Okay? Does this make sense? So this is our nice hairball model that Pairball model that does recapitulate the outcome of all those experiments with the right parameter set. Okay, so great. We think we know how we're going to march forward here, but how do we build these things? So to build a metabolite-mediated model, we need to answer a few questions. So I talked about how we know what microbes are present, right? So that's a tough question, but it's a question that there's a lot of good news. Question: That there's a lot of good new technology working on. What metabolites are present? Okay, that's a harder question, but it's also a technology question. So I'm going to brush it under the rug for now and assume I can figure it out. So what I guess our job and my job, I think, is to figure out what are we going to choose for these interactions? How do these species interact? How do these species interact with the metabolite pool, really? The metabolite pool, really. Okay, so stop and think about how might they, and well, okay, there's information that exists. Let's see if we can use it. There's genome-scale metabolic models. Okay, so we heard a little bit about genome-scale metabolic models this morning. So let's try and mine that information and apply it here. This is nice because I can pull a genome-scale metabolic model from a database, and I'd like to be able to use that information to build my computer. Use that information to build my community model, right? So that's our goal. How are we going to do that? What is a genome-scaled metabolic model? Okay, this is my very small genome. This is my cell. It grows by transporting in some metabolites, converting them to biomass. Okay, biomass is RNA or DNA, or I guess DNA, protein, that kind of ribosomes. Kind of ribosones. But the nice thing about using these genome-nail-scale metabolic models is, as a mathematician at least, this is defined for me by the model that I get from a database. And along the way, it spits out some byproduct Y3 that's transported out of the cell. Okay. So it's nice to represent this as a network because it kind of gives us an intuition about what's happening, but from a mathematical point of view, it's nice that it represent From a mathematical point of view, it's nicer to represent it as a matrix. And so this matrix is just the stoichiometry of all those reactions put in the matrix. Okay, so for example, the fourth column here turns out corresponds to this particular reaction. Our model kind of actually ignores enzymes. So in this reaction, Y1 is converted to A, Y1 is the top row, so we have a minus 1. You lose a Y1, you gain an. You lose a Y1, you gain an A. That's the fourth order. Okay, so that's what stoichiometry, that's what I mean by stoichiometry of a reaction, stoichiometric matrix. Now, I walked into metabolic modeling a year, a year and a half ago, and I read, you know, sort of a nice primer on this stuff, and I saw a matrix that looked like this, and I said, hey, oh, no, all the direction. I said, hey, that's got a nice structure to it. So I've gotten in the habit of writing this like this, and I'll show you, I think, in a little bit why this. Show you, I think, in a little bit why this is actually kind of nice. But these, because of the transport reactions, will always have an identity matrix and a zero, right? I mean, you may have to rearrange your columns, but I'm perfectly happy rearranging columns. And then I've got just the rest of the reactions, okay? And this is nice. So, great, we have an internal metabolic network. What does that get us? What does that get us? Well, it gets us something if we start making assumptions. I want to know the flux of the transport reactions. I want to know how fast this growth reaction is firing because I want to know growth rate. So let's start making assumptions. The first assumption we make is that the cell internally is at chemical equilibrium. That's nice. That starts to make this sound like a quasi-steady state assumption, and I'll show you. Steady state assumption, and I'll show you in the next slide that that's exactly what it is. But it's not enough to actually narrow down a vector of reaction fluxes, right? It's just my vector of reaction fluxes is somehow in the null space of this matrix. That's all that says. That's a pretty big space, it could be. Although, I'll point out it's isomorphic to the null space of this matrix. So I immediately know that the dimension of that can't be too big, and I can actually optimize over the, I can look at a null space of this S dagger, which is a Look at an all space of this s-dagger, which is a smaller matrix. That's nice. Okay, the fluxes are bounded. That seems reasonable as an assumption that doesn't really narrow things down too much, at least in terms of dimensionality. So really the assumption that gets us somewhere is that the cell evolutionarily is optimized to grow. This is called flux balance analysis because we're balancing the flux. Balance analysis because we're balancing the fluxes in this kernel. Now, I'm happy to debate whether this maximize the growth rate is the right assumption, but it's the standard assumption. I actually think it is worth maybe thinking about what we optimize, but maybe that'll be over beers after the talks. Anyway, so we Anyway, so we can maximize this growth, and we have ourselves, okay, now if you're familiar with this, you're thinking that's still not unique. And you're right, but it at least gives us a pretty small space that we can pick from, a small set we can pick from. Small in some sense or another. And as I said, that's a quasi-steady state for a dynamical system. So I can take those fluxes that I find using flux balance analysis and plug them into the community growth. The community, the growth rate of the Right, the community, the growth rate of the species is just the growth rate that flux balance analysis. Excuse me, here's my flux balance analysis. See, I've rewritten it from how you're probably used to it in terms of this S dagger. Nice thing about that partitioning of the matrix is it really makes explicit that the exchange flux react, the exchange reactions, the fluxes, are really a linear function of the internal fluxes. That's, I think, what you get out of that partitioning. As I said, so great, so I have a dynamical system, I can simulate forward, I can analyze, I'm happy. Okay, not so happy. There's a lot of problems here. First of all, I said this V is not unique. You often have some set of optimal fluxes. It's really the side of a polytope. So think of some bounded, low-dimensional space or section of. Or section of your possible fluxes. I'm going to ignore that for now. The maybe bigger problem here, even if I had a way to get a UDB, I have to re-optimize whenever I change Y, which is I'm always changing Y, right? I'm always changing my metabolites. So you have to maybe, I don't know, continuously optimize, or something like that. So that's hard. It makes this hard. So that's hard, makes this hard to scale, makes it hard to analyze. Instead of a nice ordinary differential equation, we have something you'll hear called the differential algebraic equation. So less machinery, yeah. What's kappa again? Kappa. Kappa is just a rate. It's just a parameter. So yeah, these kappas are just parameters. And the way we should think of these is, so these are just bounds on the exchange fluxes. So the exchange reactions over here. The exchange reactions over here, the fluxes of the exchange reactions can be written as a function of the internal reaction, so that's why. So this S dagger V is my, the flux is my exchange reactions. And it's really just saying I can't transport in more than I have. So how fast can I transport YJ in? Well, it's proportional to how much YJ I have. So that's sort of a mass action assumption on uptake. On uptake, you could put more complicated dynamics here, right? You can put, say, Hill kinetics here. So that's. The value of kappa ij you take from? Yeah, we don't know the ket value of kappa ij. Exactly. So that's one of the problems here. We don't know the ket value of kappa ij. This is hard to scale, so it's hard to simulate forward, so it's very costly to try and do any parameter fitting. You know, even if I had great time course data. You know, even if I had great time course data, there's a ton of these kappa ijs, so it's a high-dimensional space I'm searching in, and it takes if I'm talking about a system of three microbes, it takes five minutes to simulate that up to time equals one or something, right? So up to an hour or something like that. So it's very costly computationally to try and fit those parameters. Okay? Yeah. So let's try to think about what these kappas are. There's something about the permeability of the Like the permeability of the membrane for these or maybe the number of channels or something like that. I is the particular microbe and J is the metabolite. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I haven't thought a lot about sort of the physical, what the physical, you know, what physical thing is determining this kappa IJ. Although there, I did see a paper. Although I did see a paper about how metabolite uptake rates, they actually fit some metabolite uptake rates to data using, like by actually measuring the uptake rate. So in that particular, for that particular metabolite, for that particular microbe, we could put something in there. But in general, this is tough. Okay, so this doesn't bother me because I'm a mathematician. I don't care about particular instances of this system. Particular instances of this system. Anyway, I care about the class of systems. So, what does this tell me? It means I really need to understand this class of systems so I can get around these problems. So, I can make conclusions that either don't depend on the kappa ij or conclusions that map parameters to result, right? So that's the kind of thing that mathematicians like, that's the kind of thing I like. So, that's what we're going to look for. Before we do that, let me just demonstrate, or let me just try and argue to you that there's some meaning in this. Try and argue to you that there's some meaning in this model. It's not nothing. You can look at this and you can say, well, this is your uptake rate somehow, or uptake efficiency, or something like that. Whoever has the highest, if I grow, if I simulate a community, whoever I give the highest kappa to is going to outcompete the others. You could imagine that argument, and I'm going to say, no, the internal structure of the metabolic model is giving us some information. How do I know? Information. How do I know? Well, this is, I uniformly chose, uniformly at random chose Kappas, just between 0 and 1, for all three species and every exchange reaction. I pulled from a database online called Patrick three different models for three different species. I make no claims about the quality of the models themselves. In fact, the engineer I work with has already told me that the models are junk, but that's a whole nother s problem. Whole another problem. For the purposes of asking how do we analyze this, it doesn't really matter. And we see that there's a modal outcome here. So random parameters are not, yeah, they're leading to a wide range of possibilities, but there is a modal outcome. So that structure is giving us something. Like, yeah, if I give huge, if I give, you know, tiny, tiny uptake efficiency to this pseudomonas vironi, then yeah, I can have the other two outcompete it. Other two outcompete it. But if I just, you know, the modal outcome here, if the parameters are sort of all in the same order of magnitude, then Sumo's Verona is going to outcompete these other two species. So this is just a histogram of the results of all that, and then same histograms, but just pairwise comparison of those. So okay, great. I can even say that I think this has, we can capture community effects. So this is the same experiment. Community effects. So, this is the same experiment, randomly selecting parameter sets. Additional wrinkle that I take for each parameter set, I simulate growth alone and I simulate growth in the group of three. And I ask, and then I compare in this scatter plot. So each dot for a species is a single parameter set grown. So the final simulated biomass in the group of three versus the final simulated biomass alone. And we see the species Veronae that out-competed the other two. Veroni that out-competed the other two doesn't really care if it's grown alone or in a group of three. The other two species here grow a lot better alone than they do when they're in this group of three. So, okay, so I think these models are starting to show some promise. And so with my last few minutes here, let me tell you how we're trying to analyze these things. And this, I think the rest of this talk is sort of a detail of what our plan is more than what we've done so far. Our plan is more than what we've done so far because I mean, that's where we're at right now. We have to have a way forward, and here's our planned way forward. So, I look at this, and I want to find some structural properties that I can use to make conclusions about that dynamical system. I come from this chemical reaction network world that we just heard about before dinner. So, we're really big on this. Let's just stare at a graph and then make a conclusion. Stare at a graph and then make a conclusion, right? So I'm really hoping I can do that. So, first thing I notice is I care about growth and I care about exchange with the environment, right? I don't care about this crap going on in here. Now, I've written this in a way that has to remind me that I do care, that the exchanges with the environment depend on the internal structure. But where does the internal structure show up? It shows up in this S. Structure shows up. It shows up in this S dagger. It shows up only in this condition that we need to be in the null space of S dagger. So, first obvious thing I can say is, well, I can change that matrix without changing its null space. This is like a homework problem I would give to a linear algebra student when I was a TA, right? Here's a matrix, give me a second matrix with the same null space that's a distinct matrix. So I did that. And so here's two simple matrix. And so here's two simple metabolic models. They're distinct. So notice here E and F combine to form G, whereas here E gets converted into F and it combines with C to form G. So distinct pathways, but in all ways that flux balance analysis problem is exactly the same. If you give it the same kappas, you get exactly the same answer. I didn't change the null space of that matrix. So if I saw these two in a community, I would know a few things. In a community, I would know a few things. I would know that the relative abundance between the two of them is never going to change. Of course, depending on the parameter values, those uptake parameter values. And in terms of how they deplete the microbes, or the metabolites, I can just combine and treat them as a single species. So that's the kind of result I'm looking for. Obviously, that's... That's only the first, you know, first, first simple. You know, first simple stab. So, I just want to show you how hard this is going to be because, of course, if we don't have exactly equivalent metabolisms, then we've got things that are maybe close together. So, here, for some environmental conditions, these are close together, but for some, you know, really not. So, somebody's smoking pot. Yeah, I know I can say, I just gotta wait, okay. So, welcome to Canada. Alright, so. Who's not here right now? Well, okay, this will be very appropriate for those people that we can smell because what I want to do is I want to take these ideas of equivalence and similarity between metabolisms, and we want to define a topology here. Okay, and so what I mean by topology, what mathematicians say topology, they mean something very specific. But it's this idea. Very specific, but it's this idea of open sets and neighborhoods. Okay, so the idea of being close together. So a metric gives you a topology, for example. And then we can start asking things like, what are the topological characteristics of a different community, and does that matter? So the first way that we're hoping that this gives us something is: how do the topological characteristics here, how do they, what impact do they have, or can we connect those to the Well, can we connect those to the dynamical system that we're looking at? And I already really showed you one example of that with, you know, if they're right on top of each other, if in whatever topology we define, two equivalent networks would be the same point in that topology. And in that case, we can treat them as the same species. So, are there other topological characteristics that are going to get us something like average distance or variance of the distance between these things or something like that? Something like that. We can also ask this not just of our dynamical system but of real data, right? We can look at these topological characteristics and ask how do those correlate to actual experimental outcome. If there's a significance there, then that's good evidence that this model is telling us something. This is a topology built on a certain dynamical system, or built on genome-scale metabolic models and how they interact with the paddle-eol. The tablet pool. So, if that sort of gives us meaningful correlations in real data, then we have some evidence that that's a good avenue of approach in terms of how these things organize. And then finally, topology gets us to the idea of continuity. So, like the rigorous idea of a continuous function. So, we can ask about how metabolisms change and whether or not it's reasonable to require, to say that evolution is going to be a That you know, evolution is going to be a continuous function in this topology. It's certainly something we'd look for. So, at the end of the day, we want to develop this algebraic structure so that we can understand communities and community metabolism. And really, we're aiming for the basic mathematical rules of microbial population dynamics. I want to thank again all of you for coming after dinner and thank the theoretical biology group at Mayo that I work with. Theoretical biology group at Mayo that I work with. Minsock taught me most of what I know about microbial modeling, or sorry, metabolic modeling. And then our fearless leader, Nick, here in the yellow tie. Thank you. Any questions? This is a lot of references, actually. Do you have a sense for the end goal that you'd like to that? So you're in the mailing end. Yeah, they clearly want to use these. Yeah, yeah. And is it primarily a diagnostic sense, or are we thinking of microbial treatment? So yeah, microbial treatment would be definitely, again, I said back here that it was sort of pie in the sky, but yeah, so something like, right, can we. Can we build models for individual patients and use them to design effective probiotics or other sort of prebiotics or antibiotic treatment? So C. diff is something that Mayo really is always a, so you hear about C. diff still earlier today. C. diff is a big problem in any hospital, not especially, but including Mayo. That's the most common cause of post-surgical infection. So if we can understand, and it is really a If we can understand, and it is really a community, there's a big community interaction going on because normally C diff gets outcompeted and you don't have to worry about it. But then you give antibiotics and now it can take over. So if we could build individualized patient models, I think that's, again, it's pretty pie in the sky, but that would be extremely impactful in the clinic. Yeah, so how do you now deal with this issue that the flux is not uniquely? Yeah, so luckily here there's a lot of, you know, here we're not, there's a lot to good ideas to follow. So there's a few, so the simplest thing you can do is just add constraints. Okay, so in the common constraints, usually it's constraining total flux, right? But you can add, I guess in theory, you can add any constraint you want to just keep, because really every time you add a constraint here, Because really, every time you add a constraint to your optimization problem, you're cutting down your feasible region, and your optimum lies on some face of that region. If you just cut that face down to a point, then you've got a unique system. So mathematically, it's just, yeah, adding constraints can get you there. And or do you also maybe look at flux per enzyme cost or something? You this model didn't have enzymes in there, right? Right, right. So, yeah, so I think um So I think, like, in, yeah, so constraining total flux would be a very rough way of, like, that would be the physical intuition between behind constraining total flux would be constraining total enzyme. But you're right, you could add more specific constraints in terms of, you know, I can constrain, you know, maybe constraining this particular, or you could add a constraint that sort of turns off a reaction if there's no enzyme or something like that. Didn't go long enough for it.
