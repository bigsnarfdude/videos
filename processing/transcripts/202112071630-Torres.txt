Gracias. Muchas gracias por opportunity can plateau here with invitar measure formar parte estarión de mathematics, mexican en el world. Well, we will talk about a little group finite group. This is a bad thing, going to some cases. And mention how relaxation with some other things, like topologia, geometry, because it is and well some problems also combinatoria. The platform will be relative to since that is a little corta queas and final mega proponent. Some problems that have been, and that is alguna gustarias, each unified are algae computational computers and good idea is some experiments and potentially probability of results, but more specific conform in the platica. Well, in this platform, if we are a group, it will be a group finite. And the commentary is that we focus in problems of context. In problems that have to control the number of solutions corresponding to equations in finites. For example, here we are classical fluids, this theorem was 3. 3 problems as historians, and well, if you are in divisor, in this case, in this notation of the order of the group, so the number of solutions of this equation that is here of the right, and here the one, where one represents the identity in the group, is necessary a multiple division that is. Plodes and visor queen. This area is interesting. Frobinos tiling representations, to read characters, essentially in their time, there are independent technicians that are utilized. There is a pube of Martin Isaacs and Joff Robinson, very cheap, and recuerdo, whereos pube esteem. Thisorema is resulted from a point very elementary, with only some lemons and some results of context basic context. Well, we want to see here an example in the case of the group of Quaternions, the group of 8 elements with the multiplication usual of the Quaternions, aquínos mass una, more. In this case, for example, the equation is here to one, you can check that solutions. And because the other elements in the group satisfaction this author, this equation. The guy is that one, and the unicorns elements that are. And if the uno, and the unicos element that satisfaction is a condition are these two aquí plus, but do more. O men are perdon semi español están poquito oxidado, ya nos seveces niquaros English or Spanish, and like some medicine, I think, in some of the two. Well, here is this example of this precisely illustrated proposition, this turna de Froben. Proposition esteem of Flovinos de number of solutions that precisely a multiple exponent that utilizes here four in this case corresponding to it and two, well, in this case we have with two solutions. Well, this funo los first advances significantly in the studio of questions in groups finitos and some applications. Tiene algunas applications based important applications, for example, the commentaries and theorems of provenance can be made with some lemons, some results combinatories, very insidious, and for the test ten here this term of Kochí, you record from their algebra that y has a primo que vid elord in the group. So, The order in the group, so existing elements of order in the group. Precisely implicit when the divisor is here, precisely that is that pascamente exist almost a solution to the equation that is the one. So implicate, and if you check for example one of the Well, it is a result of solutions, in groups of finites, have consequences important, as important. Importants, like also silo. And one can circular signals, if you don't want it, but what is important to us that is a fundamental en law of finites. And well, more equations, I would say, in this equation that is here of the other, which is terminals of what is like the commutador of two elements here is the annotation, and Aqua la notación, equis coma con brackets. This definito como esta este producto esta expression, the inverse of Quinn, por el unverse de igriga or J, multiplicado por Q, multiplied by vano intention of this expression, is a mear que tan lejos or que tancerca, del una manera está equis de con mutar con. With when you put in the group, where these elements are pregnant here basically that we can proponent that if we go in the group, age nos gustarias see solutions tien la equation of equis with age. Our palace nos gustarias, our gustaria. Cuyo con mutador espresíamente el elemento que este toma en el grupo finite. There are resultados a respecto. This is clásic, provinhos, como los. Classic, like minutes more, think this problem, and propose a formula to calculate the number of solutions. This type of expressions are recorded in the mañana of Carmen, have to precisely conclude homomorphisms for example in this case, we are figuring out if the one another. Our palace visits in the number of parents that confirm, basically, we have vision in the space, or if it is gustan in this case, in the conjunto of homomorphismos, of the group, libre avellian, of rango two, in the finite. Mascamente lo que estreemos contando en el caso, cuando ge esiguala una es una pregunta relevante en varios aspectos, voyadar más. In various aspects, voyadar mascaras al respecto y bueno. That's a question natural. Okay, well, the group derived from G is definitely like the group generated by all that can definitely be in the group there is the annotation, prima, that's what usually utilizes some people utilizing also the annotation. The notation with brackets of this manera para denotabel group derivado. So una natural manager by this group of derivatives also transmitted the commutativity of the group finite. Because not all elements of the group derivado or commutadores, if you put the pencil a little, is very Pointo is very probable that when you algebra pregnano, ancient, or an evil post, very segregated average, explicit in the elements, in the group derived. And that is why the contra example is more than a group of order noventes. Of order 26, there are the encounters with the group derived from order 3 and that only has 2 confidence. So, these are simpaticos that occur in these cases when do not consider these types of equations, and well, in this case, the group derived group that is defined by all these symbols, the multadors. Másomenos pora de los 15as, 15 para cer more precise un mathemátic digenturco or in Spanish proposed consecutur el estabatrojando con el grupo symétric group y el grupo alternante group y el seo cuentar de loses que cuando estatro. De loses that when the group alternate group is typo de cascon que est here a solution. And in that moment, or proposiente, well, if it is a group novel simple, so in the group of equation, the commutador degrees have a Almost a solution. Denobo is with the alternate group, with symmetric group, and the precisely resulted for the alternate group. What do we have is that this was a result now there, that we can do. And it is a result very good, very interesting. Motivova is working in tour of groups, finites, entry of representations, to probabilities, also a total of finites, etc. There are things that originate gracias that conjecture in terms of equations of novels in groups finitos. Well, the conjurer was finally provided in the 20s, and the Yes, yes, with the prova perdida for their autorespost, Liebeck, O'Brien, Chalev, and Thief. I provided this conjugate in the middle of the enramienta principal to this conjugate, the conjugate of Or was precisely the theory of characters. So, it will be a little characteristic, a point or not technical, so some. And well, this work to the conjecture of God, generally much with the groups finitudes, and all that in various perspectives. Well, it's to intern because more materials that are more technical, I like to define the function that has here the pantry. In the pantaya, it two is controlling the number of ordinades in the group of tales that their confidence is igual. It is a sensible providing this una function of class, in other paste una functions well that you will producto carte del group with the group in this case because in the realms well, content. If you want the realities, well, contain solutions. This is a function of classes, so that is constant in classes of conjugacy. Here, this allending of the group. OK, that is what we are non-speaking the function in the real function. So, the visually is a function that is constant in classes of conjugacy. Classes of conjugacion. Well, I recorded that various things that the functions of class form vectorial space, and there are canonical managers for these functions, for this space vectorial space, and especially the characters of the group finite group. So, we will So, we're going to see that we can see this function in terms of this basis of characters, of the group. Well, if you have evaluated the function in the identity, one here represents the identity of the group identity, basically what you are counting here, the number of elements of parents that confirm. Okay, and that can identify with the space, on this case, with discrete cases, with finite, in this case of homomorphismos, groups that will group, of rango, enlist group. And the reason is that you have definitely a homomorphism here, we have Ro passamente unco que tien que definite es la imagen en tigamos los two generadors, digamos que sellaman a. And the condition is that these two elements have definitely a homo morphismo. This space, voyage nositos more commentarios, a space interest, the people in many space. There is a lot in this space 15, which is in the 1920s. In other cases, for example, when the group has a topology, and that is for example a group, there are people who are interested in describing this space, in describing some invariants fundamental, as the fundamental group, the humanogía, the category, etc., of this. Etc. Topological space. It's interesting, and it can be more complicated in the range of the group that is describing here in this annotation. And well, there are all results and other things. That is a little bit of the context that we are taking this plateau, but this is also. Platica, but this is also notable that this study recently. And well, they are connection also with what they are commenting, it is more spaces of representation, spaces of homomorphism by supreme points more geometric. Okay, well, this function is two puede utilizar to define a probabilities and in this case, well. Probability and in this case, well, the expression is the right, you can figure in this 25. Ok, so you are controlling the number of parts that completely, and they are figuring in the proportion of ellos of relatively parts that have in the group. That is, ours, the probability of that, that is theory. Actually, a parquet with much. And well, there are a lot of results on this definition, of this perspective, of utilizing this function that is controlling solutions now from the point of view of probability and commentaries also in this sense. Okay, well, natural energy because studio is. Natural energy here because studio of one because with the elements that connect originally in the topology of these types of spaces and the group topology, how generalizing or how definite, for example, it of the identity, for example, or how to do general para corporate elements. Well, all right, these questions, but the voyage. But in the sigente order, how generalizing, how definite in one place, for esoteric aquira response, are controlling the group, but dond the number of elements in this case of two places in the group that con lot, which is basically the description that has here the right. Significant en tuple in the group with this condition. Now, if you basically is only necessarily going to be a con launch. And not have more conditions in this case to guarantee between them. Okay. Bueno. Entonces esa. Bueno. So that pregnunta esta facia, ustedes only que figar in bueno. The definition of F2 que contar el número depares que con lotan, y bueno de maner immediatos, que espuen propuner la definition para F ene de 1. So we have defined F De, well the respect of this cash case evident. And well, we have a little more because the people gust. Because the gentleman studied these spaces. Well, other comments. Well, the result that, for example, in physics and geometric physics there is a number that we know as the characteristic of Euler associated with a group about a variety of topological space. The people are in varied manifolds. And well, this And well, this is more precisely how the Orvifa Euler characteristic, the characteristic of orbidades, of Euler, and well, definitely first por viten, Viten y despairs for Hirsch Brook, also momentum tube with this type of calculus, also. Of calculus, also signal, since the recuerdo para loses a topology, and these numbers are familiar. And well, here is the definition of this characteristic of Euler, which is good. What is good in all the countries that with mutual condition that are using here for this mature condition, and we have the characteristics of traditional. Traditional space of points, in this case, correspondent to their group generated by the page, which is here in this moment in this calculus. Well, all this definition, motivated for some problems, for some concepts in physical concepts, and well, here, Sigal tamel studio, of the point of category, and if someone turns. And if they don't have some calculus, you also pay the children, this pass for the more characteristic of Euler for orbitades, and more of the million extension. And basically, And basically, when the definition is very natural, it is in two places that with lots in the group, in no group, here in this case, group finite group, this is a group of finite groups. And well, you have a total of finite encounters of the points that generated by tuple. Well, it is a character that also studied no much there in some calculus, much of the same person. Mucho for the same person, and also this characteristic of the studio of the point of view of geometry algebraic. I think that there is some calculus. But this much. Okay, well, record in this video in this question of good porque, because we don't have this studiar, this type of space, this type of problem of context. Problemas of context of cuisions. Well, in theory of groups, hablando demutatividad departments representations. There are various conceptions, very good concepts, for example connection with graphics. Exist this definition of the graphic or mutative group. So in this case, here is a group and this is a algorithm that is the graphic. Definitely the commutative graph of G, the vertices are the elements, the group, and the aristocracy defined by the condition of two elements connections and these elements with multiple elements. Well, this is a construction that utilizes and utilizes raisons, entering groups, entering groups blower for example, there in the años. Fincuentas utilization of a group for some problems that can result in utilities in the theory of classification in the classification of novel simples. And well, existing construction analog is the graphic not multiple groups. The vertices in these cases are the elements of the group, except the group. And in this case, it connects two elements, and these elements are not elements. Really separate when we have simples, we have a part of these groups. These two groups will be more growth, y and graphics, no completivas, that groups, they are more groups. So, this proprietary This proprietary of new commutativity or not capturing much information structural information of the groups and here prominently basically bonito in theory of finites. Well, we mentioned some applications in physics in geometry here in theory of groups. And they are only examples in topology well. Well, what if I do not know that one can do these spaces in this case? One group, in Je, who is y logo incremental, that. Okay, and I don't think this como un sug spacio de producto cartesian y continua uno. Well, if not packet queen, spacio simplicity, well, and a simplicity of what is like the canonical construction of the space classifante of the group in this case. In this case, well, when one construction la realization of this space implicit space that comes to some paper for there, and this notation, the one utilizing this notation. And well, this is their space of the space classificante, the group. The group and what is classified as principles with structural groups, the group, with a very particular structure, which is like a conflative structure. That basically requires that locally, the transition of the transition that is studied with mutant. That is the condition there conditions, well, not necessarily conditionals, but definitions. If definitions equivalent that can express in terms of classes, well, they are a little more technical, but a topological interest in remote spaces put in a solo package and forms topological space that is studying intensively in this day. In these days, in this a year. And what comments can this space present for the discourse producing this topological space, which is a sub space topological space of the classificant space? I can figure in the last principle in this case, with this notation, it sobre vege. Eje about vege, tombar el pullback, and that this space that group ge. Well, this space that is here also studied, which is menos a little bit that space and results capturing structural group here. Here, in this texture. The space is like, it can be realized, is equivalent to the realization of the positive queen as the positive cosets or classes, the terrorists, of the group, so that. Of the group, so here needs to specify more of J. And that space of lateral classes and where the subgroup is a subgroup, and have to be avelian, a subgroup. Well, that's a puerue that is a positive, and it can difficult in their realization, and what is good, is that it realizes real, expressively. Geometric expressamente space total of the pullback that defined in this diagram here. So these space to progress interpretation are combinatoria, possible terminals of the structure of the subgroups, of the group. Well, one progressing definition of F that comment: F of one of the identities of this content. The one of the identity of the number of two places that we're talking about, in this expression, result that that function, here in this case, is basically a number, because it configured in the case specific when it is a number. If you are in this expression, this aquifer results expression. Result that this expression is described by a series of dirichlet. Ok. And that simpatico is that sudor when it is the characteristic of Euler el space total when we have. So the intersection between topologia between combinatorial in this case, point of view. In this case, point of deposits, and well, algebra by this in groups finites. So, here is a queue of dirichlet for the group, the group alternate group of great groups. And here is the calculus, it would be a little bit to calculate very complicated, so I have no time to use the function of very busy positions of cosets. And well, it is a simpatico in topology in relation to these proprietors of mutatividad. Well, my target que estadondando hace unos minutos es. One minutes is how definite. Well, this is the definition, FNG, basically definitely, like the number of two classes in the group that satisfaction this condition. That y with Jota, when calcula el convador obtained one el element that we have That is utilizing for the definition of this function. And we have this case of not utilizing this condition, this is only for cases when it is better. Ok, this is the definition that we utilize. There are other possible definitions that can relax, and well, in this case, I want to visualize human. Visualizar estudar una mener geometrica. F 3 degrees cuenta triples es uno, edos, x 3 que se can visualizar de está manera. So here is the triple, 10, and basically in this order, and the uno conjedos se age and. And the doses with Nuevo Juego in the case when obtaining basically visual que functions, containo triplets that satisfaction is the condition description here for this diagram. So, one can with the definition that invert the direction of some of these conditions, which are in the jars, which is one of those things and definitely transfer. What is what is good here in this case is that this is a function of class, of nuevo. That is a jersey for ustedes, it is a function of class. And well, we describe the terminals of the characteristics of reducing characters of the finite group, the terminus of the structural proposals of the group, in this case, from the point of view of representations. Well, a little more probability of characters, a puede definite function, but. Function per D in this case, basically we calculated the probability that we are in tuple of the group obtainem es condition that appears, of ordinary order, that significance is obtained with mutadores este element. Okay. Well, this is one of the generalizing probabilities. Generalizando is a probability that the principle of one relative age alcuadrado order of Georgia. Because the generalizing por que when we say, like the identity, like the element of the discouragement, we are taking the number of elements in two places that with lot relative to the total number of two plus that markets the probability. So that is the probability that if it is a tuplement, it is in tuples and commutative. Well, this calculus defines a cadena, which is here, description, of probabilities that are decreasing, and well, the more studied first, for example, with known que la probabilities. The probability of that one parent is the totally confused. This is a result that in the mercado por porbaraños of the tentas, and well exploited. And well, we exploded. So, it's here, but we're going to be elementary, and this motive possible generalization. So, in pieces of discourse, that want to provide this. So, I'm going to say with the observation, first rank with this causality, that is in the numerator. Causiente, which is controlling the numerator, well, parents that confirm. Well, what I do is that elements in the first component, and well, the element of the second component, because you have to send a element in the centralized element. And well, we have all the elements in the first component, and basically the vadar el numerador, and here is quadrado. Okay. Bueno. So what is a And you know that the centralized are constant in this case, it is constant in classes of conjugacy. So, for the topo, this is basically what this accountability. What is contabilizing is the number of classes of conjugacy. That is totally not because the numero day is a number very important. It is the number of classes of conjugacy. Del group. Okay. So this is one of the first passes. So this loquier provider. Well, no, the technology. Well, the technical scientists. We are the group as a discipline of their classes of conjugacy, so that is a conjugacy of yours, and what we can see that the cardinality of the group is basically described by the cardinality of their classes of conclusion when. Concuación cues, two human, a lot of classes that have one, that is that they are described by the center. And well, in classes that have more elements, and we have almost two elements. So, when we have this condition, and we are putting content, that is very good that the cardinalidad of the centroid, more two. 2 separate que se numero de clases de conjugación con almenos two elements es a lomás esta fraction. Ok, y bueno ya para terminar lo que queremos demonstrar es que pedo de uno, la probability de una paris conute, semenor que five octabos, society. So we numbers the classes of conjugacy, sobre. So you have here this class and the number of classes of conjugacy of tama, more classes with the two elements and substituent basic aquí algebra sensigita and well reduced en aquín gradient that needs to observe that in this case like That is caso as we are assuming that group is novel indices of the centroid in the group tiene que ser more original que cuatro. So, when the reciprocal is vadar uncuarto y bueno. Simplifican y obtain the resultado que queríamos. This superior 5 octavos is optima. This number can obtain for example with quaternions, ustamen with the group. Cheque y tamen con el grupo diedrico de orden 8. Okay, well y ato poca poco a cuistienes de characteres de un punta vista vastes enci como calcular F two de G. Well, Frobinos is here the point of reference, this results extremely important the probable formula to control. Formula para countenance is coming in the numero departments that are mutador es el element. Frobinos secuent that calculated in terms of characters and reducible characters that have this conjugate in terms of this expression. So that is a sufficient order in the group, the great dimension of the representation. The dimension of the representations and the valor in cada character when it is a formula, beautiful, extremely important to group utilities, various applications. And well, to record what else initiated the conjugate of or that, my uncle, to make more activities, For more, 2000, that the equation is here as well the commutador is igual. It is a equation and solution, we have groups that are not and simples. And well, what is the connection between formulas and conjugate? Well, the result that the formula is the ingredients more important. Ingrediente very important to conjurate. And well, the people who know that the system that we have here is consistent, because what is that the number of solutions is more than so that the function is positive, and for that, when one character is strictly more than one, aquí, during one. In this case, manipulating this cuisine, a puedar cuenta, tomando la normand, etc. That will be requiring that the sum of the magnitude of these major and well what studio many algebraistas students of groups were studied from this numeral. De estenum, the values, of the characters, of the groups finitos, novels simples. And well, that was basically the remaining principle, I mean, tomorrow various paper can be like resulted for mention here in some connection with probabilities, chalef that the people who contribute in the contribution. The work in probability of all groups finites. The probability is a group novel simple. So it is a probability convergence when the group increment by infinity. So someone else is proving the conjecture of order of probabilistic probability. And well, everything is And it is a time that is active. And well, I want to say one commentaries of es de cases, especially. Well, we have the formula of floating formula here, of course, that is here, that is that in terms of the characteristics of reducible characters, if recorded. Characteristics reducible characters, if recorded nations, the digestions are functions. This element is a good aquí basically the composition of this function of class in terms of the basis, which are the characteristics reducible of the space of functions class. So the pregunta is what we can say to respect F3. Well, Well, one messes with studio thinking in this question, and a formula in terms of the characters and reducing the group for this function. It is interesting, but very complicated. What is interesting is that. Interesting is that one thinks that generalizar of two here, in this condition, would be obvious. If not very impressionable, but the result that the complexity of the calculus increment. Well, here is the description. So, that's what they are ingredients. Record what is basically described function in terms of the characteristics and reducible characters. The characteristics and reducible characters. So what is that what are the coefficients of this description? One thing that you can define this function of the character is described in the ingredients in terms of the classes, lateral classes of the centralized center. So that is a tenement that very well posits from the centralized center. Of the centralized central city, and of the lateral classes, and there are contends, and well, and the calculando poco estas summatory tilizando the values of the characters in certain colours. Well, one of them calculates one definite coefficient of the character, basically summarizing the elements, aquí tenos un elemento figo, a sumas obretonos elements, yes. All the elements, and that is what needs to be. Pascally here we have the coefficients of the composition in terms of characteristics and reducible characters. The especially technical no es very complicated, what is complicated is the calculus. To marcise groups, and put it complicated. We have some calculus and ponies for some groups that Algunas groups, to some families, like a application, and redundant application, we have the result that is an application. And that is that we consider this system. So, someone who is presenting here is a generalization of the conjugate of Or if we are. Or, if we say, we have a number, more than 3, and we are elementary in the group alternate group of great energy in my 3. And we have this system. So, it is a system of 3 cuisions in terms of a figure. So, what you see, otieta de 2 solutions, one. Uno anticipando. A result that this system is consistent in the symmetric group of great groups that are in this result. It is vast, similar to what we have in the case of or in the case of or the conjugate, especially one and ustedes put in attention. And ustedes pushed a tension in the result affirming that consistent equations. That system with one equations consistent when you are elements in the alternate group. We have the symmetric group, we have computational evidence utilizing GAAP, which resulted very probable. That the result is very valid when a consistency in the group alternate group. But that's what I have to respect. And well, it is a generalization of the conjecture of Ormendo consolamente un commentarios that makes in the commentaries of exercises. As a principle of exercise, so that they are interested that experience tiling this type of software, like GAP, or MACMA, this software can be a calculus. So, it's a pregunta queen nosotrospendientes however. We have computational evidence that parents do that, the case, basically what this question is how these coefficients here, by your divided porje, van seros. What is basically what is coming in the cases of the formula of the formula of muestra que est. Frobinos de muestra que Fed dos es un character. Ok, nos otros nosa veemos como plover eso par caso de 3, but that case. Other question, this paste sympathic, is that we have computational evidence that when we cuar this function based when we have elements that are. And we are groups that are finitos and simplis: a finite simple group. And then you can utilize the GAP or if you want MACMAP for some calculus, I can see some calculus of the coefficients of this function in terms of characters. The question is like the same. Of the characters, the points like the calculation, one thing, but what is that the function is trivial, so trivial identity? Although we have to group no avellianos simples. Bueno, I think, here I voyendo, you almost have a question to some commentary. Algún commentario. Muchism Enrique are some questions in the term of a formula explicitly that. Dejamer recuerdo. I bueno estas formulas explicitas y un pocuacerca de la velocidad, la que estiene, esta esta convergencia dependent de la familia in the uno sufficient. So these types of results depend much of the characters and within the characters of the different families of groups finites that study. Families of groups finites that study, or well, if there is no response, if we are technical, and depending much of the family of groups, novels simples that one study to establish the problem of challenges dependent on the term of classification of simplicity. There are the groups, the The more per group, a pod representatives because you can infinite impression that a general pero bueno depends on what manera general management is all trading on the fly. The record on the fly, no sea queas, one function in general to the convergence in our families. I have the presentation that depends much in the classification, and the calculus that is with some of those very partials about theory of characters from these groups. Yen in the most preguntas en eltimo. When cuatro de ge cuando can distincto de uno van evidently, put an element and their inverse, the question architectures, or whatever when. And there is a little geometry that respects if you can visualize the case of the context of F3. In this case, one thing in perdo for me concerto orientation and obviously a gamos graphic of visualizer, but they are the conditions that are requiring for the context of the solutions. Solutions. Yes, this calculo is simpatic, and we don't have a problem because we are checking in gap, not utilizing Gap, but we have to do it. Yo, Enrique. Oy mention this, for example, in the case of calculating French tenets the triangular y que y que pues jugar con orientación de las flechas eso chambia many numeros or chambía la solución espero chambiar los numeros. Chambi la solución espera no numeros. Echo es observación de que pueduno chambiar la orientación por semplo duna de la saris. Orientation for example some of the aristocracy is in the project to demonstrate the formula that we have in terms of characteristics and reducible characters. Well, in concrete, no change in number of solutions. And if you can think of it and more than four, No, I think one change function, but change the orientation of more of a aristocracy. And that has to do with this condition that yes that orientation of various service very possible if you don't conclude. If you don't conclude, one change the definition of what is accountability with this function. In this case, if you have many more, if we have the products, all right, so if you consider all the similar queues, we have more and more. So, if there are some things that are. And well, you can do the same context, the same function, but some channels can be very bruscos and modify the function that is utilizing. This formula probabilistic formula has included growth, and For groups infinitesimals, there is a sentido for groups or groups described infinites do not calculate and there are people that integrate calculus for groups, and various results are not in the calculations that in these cases, but for groups, infinite groups. No tengo yo cono simento de queya interest en studiaros espacios point probista dena or que es una questiona vuama más en quera ver sinos podados recordar o cora la connection between these functions and French si vía como connection. And if it's like a connection with this question topological of the word, there are things or if you are the two definitions to part of these spaces of representations, the formula in order to pantry is approach has more with the hebraic part, but with the structural part, the group of The group of groups or the points of representations, the other construction of vecom is more topological. What is the connection of the here to regress a pocket? In this type of calculus, but this is not explorado much in queue there, functions of Dirichlet. How is this here? How is this that this here? What is societas these spacious y bueno quietenes la function new? There is that essentialment real encases whatís commentaramentes. Here, Here there is a connection tienes for a function of that function, that results in the part of a function of function of dirichlet, and well, here when it function of dirichlet is announced a little information topological information in this case of the space. Of the spacious and the characteristic of all of the space. I want to present that in general, or the space vege can consider too well, and I want to present Jebaraca or very good. If you are interested in using it,  In this functions continuous function about the space. Use with not or recuerdan, okas en escuchado. 'Te tore dice that there is a equivalent of categories in this case of access, vectorial vectors, about equis, with the categoria of modulos, projective modules, about this. Okay. So what you're doing or in connection to geometry algebraic connections, can also target the studio of this point that the connection between structure with structure, the people who know transitively commutative bundles with a proprietary commutative proposal in Computative in the functions of transition, and the question is that I have a very queer modulos projectives with a local condition. And this can be in algunos that are calculated some experimenting in geometric heroic geometry. In Jimetric, but this perspective is what is work in progress. And well, we integrated what needs to be a day here to the term of this context of mutativity. We are not going to see all the fun of it. Gracias, what bonito gusco es aludan. Muchas, gracias, y mucha gracias allas, y muchas.
