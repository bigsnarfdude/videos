And for inviting everyone else who's here right now, this is such an amazing place. So today I'm going to talk about lifting relations in light orderable groups. So Macarain had a gave a nice talk earlier and she mentioned the relation module of a group. So she was discussing nice presentations and saying how given a nice presentation, certain nice presentation of a group, you can get a nice basis for your relation module. This talk is going to be about going This talk is going to be about going in the opposite direction. So, you're going to be given a relation module and you want to get a nice presentation. So, let's begin with some motivation. So, let X will always be CW complex. Okay. And then X Twiddle will always be the universal cover. And G, okay, which is the fundamental group. Okay. Then from the US cover, we have, we can look at the cellular chain complex. So this is the chain complex with With so these are just three abelian groups, right? And with basis in correspondence with the end cells of the universal cover. Okay, C2. And boundary maps are given by the end cells. So, okay, we have a chain complex, we have a cover with a Cover with a group action G. So this free obedient basis now becomes a free ZG basis. So we can consider this as a ZG complex. And you can write the bases explicitly. So this Cn of X. This Cn of X is precisely the direct sum as you vary over all n cells contained in X. And you choose some lift in the universal cover, C tilde, C tilde, and this is just place more into this free Z G module. But why do we care about this? Well, from This? Well, g and maybe you want to compute the homology, cohomology of this group, so you want to take some k1, x, and then this becomes a resolution when you augment, and then computing homology cohomology of the group G is just the same as computing homology cohomology of this chain complex tensoring or taking home with whatever module you want. Okay. Okay, and as I said, I'm interested in going the other way. So now instead of having this very concrete topological object and this concrete construction of a chain complex, let's start with some chain complex three ZG modules. Okay. And I'm also going to fix some bases, three bases B N in A N such that well. Well, each AN is just isomorphic to. Same story here. So there are some as B varies over elements in Bn of the free ZG module basis vector B. Okay, so I mean this here is an instance of this, right? But what if we have, we're given this really algebraic thing, and we want to say, is there a CW? And we want to say, is there a CW complex which realizes this? This is what we're going to call the realization problem or weak realization problem. So a version, well essentially this problem was stated by Wall in 1666. Okay, so the statement which I'm going to give was Statement which I'm going to give was later proved to be false, which is why it's a problem and not a conjecture anymore. So, what's the statement? So, we've given this complex of free ZG modules. Does there exist X? Okay, let's connect it such that and sorry, and a Z G isomorphism Isomorphism from A star to this chain complex of the universe of WX. And so without the weak, there are no extra conditions. So I'm going to put So, I'm going to put nothing in the brackets here. With the week. Sorry, with the week, there's no extra conditions. Without the week, we also want to require that basis vectors go to basis vectors. Okay. So, this is a very general problem, which I would say doesn't always emit a positive solution. Always admit a positive solution, but let me just mention some connections to other problems that you may have heard. So one, which is, I guess, the reason why Wall was interesting to begin with, is the following. So, generalizations. Of one if we have CW complex X and the N plus 1 homology group of X tilde vanishes, and this is for all Z G modules N and H N X right or X right of X tilde vanishes rule K strictly greater than N, then is X positively equivalent to an N-dimensional complex. When n is equal to 2, this is unknown, so this is open, this is known as the D2 problem. Known as the D2 problem. And when n is not equal to 2, this is yes. It's due to, I guess, wall 65. But then you might say, okay, what about the n is equal to 1 case? So we'll prove it with a slightly stronger assumption. n is equal to 1. When n is equal to 1, then even with this hypothesis, it will still prove by. This hypothesis was later proved by Stalins and Swan, which I'll mention in a second. So, another question which might be of interest to geometric group theorists. So, if G is a group, has topological dimension N, then the question is: does G have geometric dimension? And this is also known as the Heidelberg Guinea conjecture. So, yeah, when n is not equal to 2, sorry, when n is equal to 2, this is the either conjecture. When n is not equals to, this is true, and this is proved by. By I am error in 57 for n greater than 3 and the starting swan. I should say Starlings did it with a finally generative case and swan in general in 649, but n is equal to 14. Okay. And one final And one final problem, which is actually the reason why I got interested in this to begin with. So, if you have a proof G and it has type FP N Over Z, and does it have type F F Okay, so of Fn over Z just means we have one of these exact sequences where dimension N all the Z G modules are finally generic. And again, I'm assuming everything is always free free modules. I'm assuming everything's always free modules. And Fn just means you have an aspherical CW complex which has a fundamental group G and has finite ends galactic. So again, this is sort of a question about going from homological stuff to topological stuff. So yes, the answer to this, as we've actually seen in the previous talk, is no. Well, no, in general. So best mean at Rady came up with counterexamples for n is equal to 2 in mode D7. But for, so if G is finitely presented, or in other words, it has type F2, then yes. It's a shame that's really I'm interested in finally FP2, so this doesn't help me. Right. Who proved that, by the way? The FTS right? So finally. Ah wall, yeah, it's wall. So it's it's it is, yeah. So in fact, it is this stir. Should buy wall in 66. So, if you prove that if you do have one of these complexes which is realizable, let's say it's topologically realizable. So, I just mean there is a CW complex from which this guy comes. then uh then everything then the whole thing is realizable. So in other words, okay, you probably grasped this from the one, two, and three, but in other words all the difficulty lies in dimension two. If you can figure out dimension two then you can get everything. Um how much time do I have left? You left five minutes or ten? Um sorry. Arm, sorry. Well, one. Don't take the star staircase. Yeah, fine. Sorry. Six. Six. Can it keep increasing? Seven? Okay. So, although in general, you can't go, you know, like if you have a group, 20 general group, it's like FP2. It's not necessarily true that it's going to be 20%. Maybe if you restrict some. Representative, maybe if you restrict some subclasses, there's some nice maps or whatever, you can say something in that case. And that's sort of what this work is about. So let me first, yeah, maybe I'll state the question, because this was sort of the motivation behind this, and tie it in with some comments on the non-positive merger. So if X has non-positive emergence, Non-positive emergence. Why little cover, G cover, such that the first module y is zero. And then, by the construction I gave at the beginning, we get some free sets. Free ZG chain complex on the cells of Y, which is exact at this spot. Then is this chain complex realizable? Maybe you want to put some extra conditions on G components. This is a general question. No. I was hoping somebody would define this going on to my talk, but unfortunately, nothing. So, if you have questions, you should ask Kenny Walton, he's the expert. Okay, so let's state the theorem. This will appear on the archive, hopefully, very soon. So I have to assume that G is a right orbital group. This just means that you have a total order of G, which is invariance of the right multiplication. Invariance of the right multiplication. And the reason it's right-order rule instead of left-order rule, even though it listens to one vice listen to the other, because I like left actions, sorry, left actions mean right-orders work out better. But left-orders, right orders, same thing. And we have some complex free ZG modules with chosen bases. Bases so D2 D1. So we need some conditions. So firstly, I'm missing a definition. So let's call it algebraic. And if I have time, I'll say what that is. It basically just means that this, in dimension one, it comes from some. Dimension one, it comes from some graph. That's what this really means. So this is algebraic, and this D2 map here is given, because we've chosen bases, it's given as a matrix, and it acts on the right. So it is given by some matrix where we have all zeros above the rightmost diagonal. Rightmost diagonal, and I'm also going to require that in this diagonal everything is non-zero, and everything over here can be whatever you want, then A star is realizable. So I'm here. Okay, I've drawn a picture, but I'm not assuming that A2 is bi-degenerate. So you might have to. So you might have to modify your picture to make it infinitely vague. So in other words, if it's realizable and A2 and A1 are finally generated, then the group you started off with is actually finely presented. And you can find the nice presentation by lifting relations from this map. Can you remind us what's the difference between polarizable and left realizable? Did I say what realizable is? Did I say what realizable is? Oh yes it well. It's the same thing. It's the same thing. Yeah. If you can realize it on one dimensional term. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Okay. Sorry, it's the same thing. So in all whenever I say realizing I just mean there is some CW complex which this thing is a isomorphic to the chain complex of that CW complex. CW contacts. Okay, so just to end with a slightly more tangible result. You didn't say what algebraic is, or maybe we did. Algebraic. So, okay, there are two obvious necessary conditions. Three, maybe. Which is that, firstly, if you want x to be connected, you want h0. You want H0 of the star to be zero, you want H1 of A star, sorry, to be z of A star to be zero, because you want the universal power simply connected. And then finally, you just want that the first boundary map sends like basis things to you. Things which look like what you expect if it comes from a CW complex. These are bases in dimension one, bases V expected in dimension one, and V1 and V0 are bases in dimension one zero. Okay, so I'll just stay the corollary and finish. So the corollary is if G, which will be given by the presentation, F is a free group. My presentation, F is a free group, is quite audible. And the abionization of N, so this is the relation module, is cyclic as a ZG module. This is the relation module. This is the relation module. Then, oh, okay, let's make it more precise. It's generated by some elements R, okay, as a Z module. Then there exists a W in N such that W the image of W is precisely R in neurologization, and the normal closure of W is precisely M. So the upshot is if you have a group with a second foundation module and it's weight audible, then it's actually a 1 related group. That's fantastic. Are there questions? I don't understand your question because I thought being realizable was being C star of X plus. Is the C star of Y a realization? Yeah, but Y is not simply connected. Not necessarily simply connected. So it's not. Y is not the universal cover of a real and everything. Yeah. Your question is or is not answered. To what extent does your theorem answer your question? This answers the question for a specific class of complexes called reducible complexes. So in fact, the realization of these algebraic complexes are precisely the reducible complexes, which were defined by Howie. So, yeah. So, yeah, so get this from this, and this will be Zg and D2 will just be a single row vector. And so then it's, yeah. Nobody has zeros about the lightwood stack. Then just think about a rubber.
