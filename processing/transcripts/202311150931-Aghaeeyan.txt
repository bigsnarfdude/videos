On other situations, in deciding whether it's a good idea to get a vaccine or not. As all of us know, vaccination is a key to combat many infectious diseases, such as COVID-19. And in this regard, achieving high enough vaccination in an acceptable term in your role is very important. On the other hand, high vaccination coverage requires high vaccine acceptance. And high vaccine accept tax is the collective outcome of each individual's decision-making processes. Decision-making processes. So, putting all of these observations, let us prompt us to ask the question: when it came to COVID-19 vaccination, how did ICAC decide whether to get immunized or not? On the other hand, in some contexts, ranging from marketing, I mean the literature on marketing sites or some branches of psychology, it has been either assumed in terms of It has been either assumed maybe in terms of authoritarian theoretical baseball, or based on some experimental studies, it has been reported that roughly speaking, people can be divided into dichotomous category, I would say. One of them are success-based learners or imitators, and the other one are multi-fationalists or influentials. Actually, there are a lot of different terminology for them, but I just pick these two. And uh successful learners we mean those who are social learners and those who tend to mimic uh the decision of the people who in actually according to their author the perceived most successful people in the uh in the social life. On the other side, multinationalists are those who are, I would say, asocial learners and just take care about what influence they pay off and try to go for a decision that provides us with the highest possible perceived insight. Highest possible perceived incident benefit and payoff. Also, in the context of vaccination, a large body of studies when they wanted to model the human decision-making processes about whether to follow some NPRs or whether to alter two action or what, they assume either of these two types of decision-makers and investigate and actually investigate lots of theoretical size and also some simulations. Some simulations. The important point is that these two types of decision makers also differ in the types of information that they seek to. Multiple nationalists or influentials seek information that shapes their payoff. They don't care that much how popular or how rare is a decision among the population. On the other side, the success learners are social learners, so they do care about what is the vaccination coverage and how satisfactory. Vaccination coverage, and how satisfied are the other? I mean, are those who are already vaccinated with the vaccination? Actually, they cannot understand how they're satisfied. They just can't know how they show that they are satisfied and the perceived satisfaction of them. Without that, if we knew the estimated proportion of these two types of decision makers, maybe it may inform health management and media about and pro. Media about and providing some idea about more tender vaccine for motor communication strategy. Actually, this is an ambitious goal, but actually it would like to be near to this and it's a final objective of this project. So, it led us to reframe our previous question, that when it came to COVID-19 vaccination, what population proportion of people behaved? Proportion of people behave as myopediaconists. So, from now on, my parameter of interest that I visited and tried to estimate is Alpha. That is, the population proportion of people who behave as myopediaconists in deciding whether it's a good idea to use a first order portion of C or not. Okay, to be more specific, our goal is to estimate the proportion of minority relations in each estate of the United States, including the District of Columbia. In the District of Columbia, then deciding whether to take the first hour of the COVID-19 vaccine or not. Okay, let's go to model formulation. When I wanted to define each of these two types of decision makers, I'll talk about the perceived access variable vaccination. We assume, we show this variable by delta pi, and we said that it is equals to the perceived benefit of receiving. The perceived benefit of receiving a dose of COVID-19 vaccine minus the perceived benefit of remaining unvaccinated. And in the following slide, I go back to that and describe that how we formulated this delta part. And as for population structure, we assume that for each state we have a large enough, fixed size, and very fixed population. And our population of interest is capital N, the number of people who age 12 and 12. People who age 12 and 12. And also, we took out the number of people who are vaccinated out of this capital N. So we have N sub N. By N sub N, actually we mean the number of non-vaccine refuters that who may consider receiving a total COVID-19 vaccine. They are not anti-laxed vaccines. And we assume that out of these NSON, affordable portion of them are market rationales, and the remaining portion. regression is and the remaining part that would be 1 minus alpha 1 times n sub n our number of success learners. So our parameter of interest alpha would be equal to alpha 1 times n sub n over n we show by capital M the number of vaccinated multi-rationalists up until twenty and by capital L the number of vaccinated successful spenders up till twenty. And also, we show by N sub S the number of unvaccinated multiple rationalists who are vaccine seeker and respectively by L sub S the number of unvaccinated successful planners who are vaccine seeker. What do we mean by vaccine seeker? We say a person is vaccine seeker who is unvaccinated and willing to receive the vaccine as soon as there are enough vaccine and doses available for them. Available for them. We basically assume that all multi-rationarists who are unvaccinated become vaccine seeker as soon as the perceived excess benefit of vaccination is positive. I mean, this point one just is an indicator function that equals to one whenever delta pi is positive. And if it is not, then none my preference is vaccinated. Is vaccine seeking. And but for the number of people who are vaccine seekers and social security planners, also we assume not only the sign of delta matters, but also its values. And also it is influenced by the vaccination coverage that we have up until 20. So the number of successful damners who are vaccine seekers can be formulated by this equation. Can you explain that last equation one more time? Yeah, the first apparent numbers represent the number of unvaccinated success learners and we assume that actually the number of those who are vaccine seekers influence. But the vaccination coverage and the denominator represents the total number of people who seek the vaccine, all 20 times n, and n is the whole population. And this max. And this max function just we assume that the more perceived benefits of vaccination, it is more likely that successless learners become vaccine secure. And we formulated that by this max function. If the max is negative, I mean it is zero, so it means that no successless learner is vaccine secure. Success-based learners are also doing exactly the same calculation as the MIAP. The same calculation as the myopic rationalists? The myopic rationalists are the first part, and in the first obvious, they just care about the sign of the delta pi. As soon as the delta pi is positive, all micro rationalists become vaccine seekers. But for the successful members, the value of delta pi matters, and also the proportion of people who are vaccinated matters. And if there were enough vaccine doses for all people who are vaccine seekers, we say that those who are vaccine seekers become vaccinated by rate of vaccination that here we show by Kappa. But if it is not the case, we assume that the number of doses that are available is randomly distributed among those who are vaccine seekers. What I said is just an inverse description of the plastic. Okay, let's go back to our data point. We assume that data point consists of four terms. The first term, CB bar, represents the perceived risk of remaining unvaccinated when there is no confirmed cases or deaths due to COVID-19 contraction. And the second part that is our negative CV represents the perceived risk of remaining at total COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine, and we assume that it just has to do with the perceived vaccine-associated side effects. The third term actually represents the perceived risk reduction in mortality due to COVID-19 vaccine that is result after receiving a dose of COVID-19 vaccine. And the first term and in CD represent the percent cost reduction in mortality that is obtained by receiving dose of COVID-19 vaccine. And the second term actually just simply represents the howl. just simply represent how likely is that a person become dead due to COVID-19 vaccine that D represent the weekly number of the perceived actually the perceived probability of death due to COVID-19 that D represent the weekly number of confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 vaccine and N-Tron represents the whole population no matter of the agenda and similar the last term represent the it is the similar with the third term Similar with the third time, but the difference that it is here has to do with morbidity rather than mortality. So, CI represented the perceived cost reduction in morbidity that is achieved by receiving a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. And I represent the number of new confirmed cases due to COVID-19 vaccine. Is the perception of cost and benefit the same for everyone, or does everybody have For everyone, or does everybody have their own? We assume that the delta part and each element is the same across the whole state. For each okay, here I just show the delta pi and also the equations that we have for modeling this vaccine object trend. And those parameter data in red represent those three parameters that we would like to that we need to estimate and the blue. And the blue trends are those time series that we just use the available data that we have and fit them to the model. So we didn't include any SIR model or something like that here. We just use the data that we have. That was the number of confirmed deaths, the number of confirmed cases, and also we represent the accumulated distributed doses for each asset upon the country. And if we compare the And if we compare the first equation with the previous one, you you may see that here I just replaced the C V bit by this power law function. Actually according to our estimation law, we understood that this power law is the providers with the best benefit and it can capture the decline rate that we have in the perceived soil effect associated with COVID-19 vaccine. And Lambda was estimated for And lambda was estimated for each estate. So, lambda is a given parameter for this optimization. Okay, in the fitting phase, we just simply our constant function is the sum of a square error. And we would like to fit our model to the VQ number of people who seek the vaccine. So, here in the equation number one, the blue one represents. One. The blue one represents the data, the victim number of people who see a first proof of COVID-19 vaccine, and the second term in the right-hand side represents our output of the model. Because in our model, M and L are the accumulated number of people who receive the vaccine. So we just use the delta in order to convert them to the VG basis. And as for optimization algorithm, we use the simulating analytic algorithm. Is the simulating analytic attack. Okay, here is the map what I noted I said that this was colored according to the estimated proportion of my blaster analysis. The darker one represented a higher estimated proportion of my fig blasters to be honest uh I doubt if these results are reliable If these results are reliable or not, then we say, okay, we have this simple model, we have lots of assumptions that we need to be transparent about them, and we just report it and say, okay, given this simplifying assumption, we develop this model, and here is the best estimated value that we have. And so, okay, maybe it's a good idea to just provide some count the interval estimation in order to be sure that it's not too light. Be sure that it's not too light, this estimated confidence interval. So here it is, and we use the non-parametric good straping approach because of the I mean that the residual was not Gaussian distributed and also we have time correlation in the residual. So we needed to decorrelate the residual that we have and here it is the bar represented 95% estimated components. 5% estimated competition. But after a while, Uriah asked me: is it possible also that the data could be fitted by other values of, I mean, we ended up with different values of all equally well, I mean, in terms of this constant function that I said, okay, it's a good idea, but it's a good asking question, but they don't have any answer to that. Answer to that. And thanks to Moore, I will introduce with the notion of identifiability. Okay, consider the following reference estate space model that we had by this sigma: that x represents the state vector, u represents the input vector, y represents the output vector, and theta is a parametric vector. Vector and theta is a parameter of the non-known vector of the parameters that we have. And now consider this emulated as that as first model. That is basically the same, but the only difference is other parameters. Rather than theta, we have a vector of theta i. And we say that a parameter of interest, let's say it is theta i, it is identifiable if the given the output trajectory of the reference estimate model and the emulator. SS model and the emulated asset model are the same for a long time in Obinabo. And this equality led us to the conclusion that this parameter of interest should be the same for the reflex asset space model and for the emulator asset space model. And here it is the rigorous definition. We say parameter theta i is a structure yellow with identifiable if for our most R theta in a physical space of the theta. Space of the theta. By this equality, we have the conclusion that this one intersect should be the same. And here I just changed the notation in order to follow the standard aesthetic model that we had. X sub 1 is replaced by X upon, and X of 2 represent the number of multi-class components you have received at those. Monthly direction is who have received a dose of COVID-19 vaccine up until 20. And y it represents the output that is the accumulated number of people who receive a first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. And we have five inputs that are just spread here. And that's it. Thankfully, given some assumptions that due to a time resection identified here, we were Section identifier here, we were able to show that this special parameter, including alpha 1, is identifiable. Okay, now I am a bit more confident about, again, providing this map and say, okay, by acknowledging all of the limitations that actually the model have, and also all of the assumptions that we made, it is the best estimate that we have. And at least we know that alpha is a parameter. We know that alpha is a parameter that is identifiable in theory. And obtain narrow context level with support that it is also estimable. And as you can see, there is a wide degree of variation accuracy, 51 jurisdictions of the United States, and the lowest one for BCC, and the highest one for the state of Vermont. And here it just represents the Represented the vaccine uptake evolution over the time for the estate of California. In panel A, the green one represents the weekly distributed doses to the estate of California, and the red one represents the day about weekly number of people who receive the first dose of COVID-19 vaccine. And blue one represents our mother's outcome. And the lower panel represents the The blue one represents the estimated weekly number of multinationalists who receive a first global COVID-19 vaccine and the red one represents for the substance test learning. And also we investigated the correlation between experimental variables and the estimated proportional multi-diagnosis. We saw that there is a high correlation between vaccination power and this estimate. Poverty and this estimate and estimated proportion among hypnotists. It is also the same for the proportion of votes in favor of Democrats in the 2020 presidential election and also for the educational score. And okay, to Rafael, we can see that we assume that the vaccination coverage can be a result of the outcome of the result of decision makers. That's what we assume that are either multiple rationalists or successful. For successful learners. And we found that excluding those who are vaccine producers, 47% behaved as multi-rationalists, and the equal proportion behaved as self-cess learners. And also we proved that this proportion multiplication is an identifiable parameter in theory, and they obtained another confidence interval somehow support that it is also estimable. Similar, and we hope that this approach may be useful for health management and media in order to provide more thorough communication in promoting accession programs. And as I acknowledge, I should thank Brock University and ECADMA for funding this research and also Furio and Mark for everything. Thank you.
