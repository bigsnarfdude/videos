Thank you for inviting me here. And this will be another lecture on non-central sections of convex bodies. And the convex bodies which I consider are the same as before the cube. But I will also consider the regular simplex and the L1 volt. And I'm not too much interested in lower. Much interested in lower estimates. I'm interested in maximal sections. And so let me introduce the notation to formulate the results. We first consider the parallel section function. Let's say first we start with the symmetric convex body. So you have a hyperplane at distance t from the origin and you intersect k by the hyperplane you consider. By the hyperplane you consider the volume. You can also consider intersecting the convex body only at the boundary. And this is what Alex Koldowski and I call perimeter function, because we were studying this for the cube. There was a question by Olek Pelszynski a long time ago about maximal perimeters. So this will be basically. So this will be basically the two notations I'm interested in. So I consider sections of a hyperplane with a convex body and section of a hyperplane with the boundary of convex body. And basically I'm interested in extremal vectors. And if t is not equal to zero, we have non-central sections. And there are not too many results of this type for non-central sections. Of this type for non-central sections. Mark mentioned already the first result due to Moody, Stone, Zach and Swavich. So this is the cube of volume 1 and you are very close, sort of at maximal distance. Now this D here is sort of the number which is the distance from the origin. Origin to the midpoint of edges. And this means that if you have a distance which is bigger, it will separate one vertex from all others, the hyperplane. This is essentially the point. And in this case, this main diagonal is the maximum section. And there's a very recent result due to Liu and Koch. It's only on the archive. Well, the L1 ball, and there this corresponding number distance from the origin to the midpoint of edges is one over square root of two, and so in this range, the unit vector E1 or coordinate vector is the extremal one. So my questions here were more or less Questions here were more or less concerned, motivated by these two results. And the first thing I want to look at is the corresponding question for the simplex. So I consider the n-dimensional simplex embedded into In plus 1 as some xj being equal to 1, xj positive. Then the side length is square root of 2. Volume is here. This is the centroid. Is here, this is the centroid. And now, of course, for the parallel section function, I will assume the following: that the sum of coordinates of such a vector on the unit sphere, direction vector, I want to have a sum equal to zero, so then A scalar product with C is equal to zero, which means that the section given by Given by A, Ax equals 0, passes through the centroid. And then I introduce the parallel section function again. This would have distance t, would be sort of a parallel hyperplane to the section through the centroid. And the perimeter is defined in a similar way. So now again, we want the distance. the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of edges, so you calculate it. And the distance of the centroid to the vertices is a little bit larger. This is this one. Easy to calculate. Now here I introduce a certain vector. This is a unit vector in the direction from C to the vertex. So if I sort of make it Make a three-dimensional picture. Here you have your C. This would be this direction vector if you normalize it. I mean this is here normalized to have Euclidean norm one. And this is the unit vector starting at C to this. So the hyperplane perpendicular. Hyperplane perpendicular to this will be parallel to some phase. This turns out to be the maximal section at some distance. But before I come to this, let me just mention the result for central sections, which was done by Webb, student of Keith Ball, the late 1990s. So we have this vector here. And this is a maximizing vector for central section. This section actually geometrically means that the section goes through the midpoint of one edge and through all other vertices. This vector A n, which I have, probably is the minimal volume hyperplane, so like this. This was claimed by Philemon in the 1990s. Phillimen in the 1990s, but was never published. So there's no proof right now. So now I come to this situation that we have a distance between the situation here, sort of this number little d and this here, this number capital D. Here you have this distance to the midpoint of edges. To the midpoint of edges, and here you have distance to the vertex. So, if you're in this range, in this case, this vector here will be the vector which attains the maximal section at distance t. And so, this is a hyperplane which is parallel to one phase. Now, in many of these results, So, in many of these results, the situation for low dimensions is sometimes a little bit different. So, dimension 2, 3, 4, 5 can be slightly different. So, here actually, in dimension 2, it is not completely true. So, this number is here, but this number would be, here would be 1 over square root of 6, but in the first range between this number and this number, it's false. It's false. It's easy to see geometrically. You see, here's the distance d, one over square root of six. But then, if you go a little bit beyond this, the maximal section would be this one, which is almost one over square root of two. But if you start turning and increasing the distance, at some point you reach the situation where... Situation where actually this situation is again given. So the main point here is that you derive a formula from the fact that the conditions are such if you have a syntax, let's say you separate this verse. Let's say you separate this vertex from all others. We have this kind of situation that here's your hyperplane separating this vertex from all others. And now it is fairly easy to calculate the volume of this pyramid. And then you calculate the height of this pyramid, and then you get the formula for the Section. So, not going through the details. So, here's this volume calculation. It's fairly easy to do. And the claim is that this is the formula for the function. What I'm also saying is that for each vertex, there's a unique hyperplane. So, these hyperplanes which are maximal are just those Which are maximal are just those parallel to faces, so you have n plus 1 of them. I actually have two different proofs. There's one possibility using Lagrange multipliers and then showing that you have a maximum or local maximum, that you have a unique critical point under the conditions given. There's also a possibility to do it more directly. But if you use Lagrange multipliers, Lagrange multipliers, you come up with some equations, and these equations yield a quadratics equation. And now, if you want to prove uniqueness of your critical point, you have to show that only one of the solutions of the quadratic equations is available. And the other one is not available in the sense that it does not satisfy this separation property which we need. Separation property, which we need. So this condition is not satisfied for the larger solution. So that you have only one critical point and a n is a relative maximum. So this is sort of analog of the result of Moody, Stone, Schacher and Swarwich and Leo and Koch for the simplex. The simplex. But I can also show a little bit more, namely if you go below the situation that your hyperplane goes further down. Now the problem is that the formula is not valid if the hyperplane does not separate this vertex from the others. But the condition that But the condition that t has to be bigger than this number which was 1 over 0 of t is the value of 2 or something, this is not necessary. It's just that you want to make sure that you have the separation property. And so you can go to the full range of t values, distances. Values, distances from here to the centroid and down to minus one over square root of n over n plus one. And then you can see that this hyperplane is a local maximum in a certain range of t's and it is a local minimum in the lower range of t's. So the funny thing somehow is somehow is if you go down you break the face here. Obviously the phase is the absolute maximum. But if you're a little bit above this then you don't have an absolute maximum but you have a local minimum of this parallel hyperplane because you can move this parallel hyperplane just a little bit and you can regulate a little bit so it does not still does not get So it does not still does not yet touch these vertices and in wiggling around actually increases the volume. So this is a sort of rough change from a local maximum to local minimum. For the perimeter you can also derive a similar formula weights. Because you go to Go to some point, and then you have some distance from the centroid, and then you is taken care of by these weights. For the perimeter, under this assumption, same assumption, if dimension is bigger than 4, again this vector gives the maximal parameter. For n is equal to 4, the proof needs to Needs a little bit more, and I'm not quite sure whether it's necessary or not. But for 8 is 3, this formula is not true for t close to one half, because what happens in this case is if you go if you go to the item. If you go to the midpoint of edges, then what might happen here is that you sort of have this situation that you have some enlarged triangle. This enlarged triangle here is one of the square root of two in both directions, so actually it will be giving a difference, a bigger value. Again, Again, I can show a local maximum property in a different range. I don't have a property of local minimum because I'm estimating these weights differently than this part. And so I can, because I'm estimating the maximum in both cases at the same time, I can only have a maximum situation. So now the central situation for the perimeter. You have this situation here, your centroid. Of course, you can take sort of a triangle, which would be the conjectured minimal value. The conjectured minimal value or the section function of the simplex. And in low dimensions, it has been actually shown. However, there's a different possibility that somehow you can embed the square. And the square actually has smaller perimeter, but larger area. Area. So there's a situation that you have different vectors for the section function and for the perimeter function. And the examples do not extend beyond dimension 9. So it is probably a pact of a small dimension. Now for central sections of the simplex, I cannot answer the question of the maximal parameter completely. I can only... I mean there's this result of web for the section function and the question is whether the same would be holding for the perimeter. But I can show it asymptotically to a factor of 1 o n. Now let me turn to the situation. Now let me turn to the situation of the cross polytope, which was done by Niu and Troch. And the central situation, it's a long time ago that Meillet and Pajor showed that the vector E1 is maximal. And if T is bigger than one-half by the result mentioned, it is also maximal. And so for N is 2, you again have a different situation that you need slightly. Different situation that you need slightly larger values. It is not true between 1 over square root of 2 and 3 quarters. So here the maximum volume hyperplanes are those parallel to coordinate directions. So again, there's a result about the local maximum of the parallel section functions. And And here the limiting point is 3 over n plus 2. So you have a local maximum if t is bigger than 3 over n plus 2 and a local minimum if t is less. For the parameter you can also write down a formula and make some estimates using log concavity, log convexity. concavity or convexity estimates. And you get again that E1 is actually giving the maximal perimeter at distance t bigger than 1 over square root of 2. But n is 3, I cannot prove it completely, but the numerical evidence is that it's also true in general. There's also a local maximum result if the dimension is bigger than six and Is bigger than 6 and t is bigger than 4 over n. So you can go down quite a bit and still have local maximum result. Now the same thing, as I mentioned before, the result of Web. You can ask yourself whether for the perimeter you have the same estimate as for the section For the section function. And here again, I can move it only up to some factor which goes to 1 at infinity. Now let me come back to the result about cubic sections. So first of all, we have the result of Keith-Ball, which was mentioned already. And we have this result of Uttistone, Sacha and Schwarz, which is here. So there the situation is squared of n. the situation is square root of n minus 1 over 2 and square root of n over 2. And the main diagonal direction is maximum. In dimension 2, again, you need to restrict the little direction. Now I'm actually also proving a local result in this situation, local maximum, local minimum. And I'm using a different formula. Again, using this pyramidal Using this pyramidal construction. So I'm writing down the formula here. It is a very simple formula. It's sum of all coordinates minus t to the n minus 1 over product of all a i's. So here it's easy to use again Lagausch multiplier approach. And for local maxima you can prove the following thing. Now what is about I should say something about this range This is sort of the maximum possible range You see if you start out with one vertex and you look at all adjacent vertices Then it's clear that you cannot go below this point here in the main diagonal direction, because then the formula will change, because by necessity you would have to separate two additives from the others. So instead of going to this point, I go a little bit further down. And this is this. This number here. And then at least you have a local maximum, and the restriction is needed, as I said, because the formula would not stick. Now here I assumed n bigger than 5. Where n is 3 and 4, again you have only a local maximum in a more restricted range. And in dimension 2 and 3, actually, the result does. three actually the result does not hold in full generality. So there's some difficulty. So I mentioned already that Alex Kolodobski and I showed about two years ago a solution of a problem of Perzzinski, that the perimeter, the maximal perimeter of the central section of the cube, is given Q is given by the same vector which was Ball's vector. So sort of the solution of the perimeter problem is the same as the solution of the parallel section function problem. So Oleg proved it at the time, 2005 or something, for dimension 3. To look at upper estimates for the perimeter of non-central sections at this distance, you have to look at some formula again. So it is similar formula except that the power is reduced by one and you have sort of a weighted term. And then you have to use similar estimates and estimate the weights separately. Fortunately, you see the maximum for the weights. See the maximum for the weights and the maximum for this function occurs at the main diagonal, so at the same point. So again, you can show that in this case, for T big, that the parameter in the main diagonal section is maximal. In dimension 3, it is also true, almost 1 over square root of 2, but not quite. Probably it is true in general. So again you have a local maximum in this range for n bigger than 6 and it is also true for some values close to 0 of n minus 1 over 2. But it is not completely true in general for smaller dimensions. So for instance in dimension 3 is not true. So the situation somehow is Situation somehow is that you change very often with the result at dimension four or five or something with a parameter typically at dimension one higher yeah I think I should stop here thank you questions so can local external in the case of the cube what be a In the case of the cube, what we obtain if either perimeters or volumes of section would be obtained for a vector that does not have the core, a few zeros and if you are the coordinates it would be a channel. In low dimension, yes, there are different situations. For the maximum, there's sort of the continuous change between vector like E1 and E2. I mean if you have 2. I mean, if you have, you can move from 1, 0, 0 to 1, 1, to 1, 1, 1. And there's a range where in dimension 2 and 3 there's actually a change, continuous change. But for the minimum, which I did not consider, it's likely that you have only standard vectors. And it's an interesting question whether for the q A q at some distance beyond one, it will already be one one one, so the main diagonal. The funny thing is in dimension two and three, you know, up to distance one half, this is the minimum. But if you take distance bigger than one or two, it is probably the maximum, but this is, of course, very difficult. Other questions? If not, let's
