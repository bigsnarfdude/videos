Okay, so it was indeed, as said, it was I tensor T I F and not I du1. So errata. Yes. Thank you. And so today, yesterday, we finished with a series of questions, and today I will try to provide some hint of an answer. And the philosophy we are going to use is we're going to use a derived or higher geometry and the slogan. So the slogan is a stacks are there so that you can pretend that all group actions, all groups act really. So that you can take quotients and you get a nice quotient and the map from the thing before to its quotient is a principal G-bump and the And the right geometry also has its slogan, and the slogan is: all morphisms are smooth. And this is also very nice as a property because we, you know, love smooth mortis. Of course, this is not quite true, but there is also a price to pay. So, what is a price to pay means a technical price that you have to learn something? Price that you have to learn something you didn't know. So, for the stacks, the cost is that you have to learn groupoids. So, you replace sets by groupoids in the definition. So, let me be more explicit, the price. So, with the schemes, we have said that schemes are maps. We view them as functors from From opposite category of affine schemes to sets. And this is the same as K algebras or finitely generated K algebras or rings if you don't want to fix a K. So they are inside here. And this is too small to fit either of those. So with the stacks, You keep the K algebras, but now you go into group points. And so naturally here you get a category, and here you get a two-category because, like, sets are a category, so this thing inherits, and This thing inherits, and the same time, these are a two-category, and so also the functors to them are a two-category. Which means that the commuting diagram here are made of points and arrows, and here they're made of points, arrows, and then when you have a closed polygon, you can put a two-arrow on it. And the commutativity is typically the commutativity of the surface of a solid. And so, the first thing you And so, the first thing you would want to do to do derived geometry is instead of in changing what is here, you change what is here. So, the idea is when you have a module or a coherent sheaf and you mind that it's not projective, that it's not locally free. There is something you can do. There is something you can do. You can find a resolution. So instead of working the objects, you work with complexes. And then, in some sense, you can pretend every module is free, even or at least projective. And we will want to do something similar here. So just modules are two complexes like. Like algebras are two differential graded algebras. So, what we want to do is we want to copy this idea, which has worked very well. And so, here we want to put differential graded algebras, and for technical reasons, we will want to have them of, I will explain exactly what this means. I will explain exactly what this means. But then, where do we go here? You see, the point is here, the natural place to go, the first thing you want to have inside schemes are the affine schemes themselves. And so here you get sets because the natural structure of algebras is being a category. But here, the so to speak, natural, if you are into that kind of thing, structure. That kind of thing. Structure of differential graded algebra is not just a category, it is an infinity category. So you have maps, homotopies, triangular homotopies, and so on. And the language, there are many ways to embody this, but the language I choose here today is to say that these are functors. So these are functions. So, these are functors, and this is an infinity category. And again, there are several ways. Sometimes people call this infinity one, and so on. There are many different approaches technically to this process, and I certainly don't have neither the time nor the competence to discuss them all. Yes. I think so, but uh. I think so, but I don't want to refuse to discuss this without a lawyer present. But what I want instead is to teach enough that people can look at what is being done in derived geometry and feel confident that they understand it enough to use the result and feel confident to go to their favorite derived geometer. It derived geometer or to get to know one if they don't and ask them, you know, I need this. Why don't you do this for me, or why don't you help me do this? Because we do have questions for derived geometers. But if we don't have a minimum language, we can't even ask them. And by the way, my current plan for this whole thing is: I bought a very thick book called Book called Infinity Categories. The authors are Emily Riel and Dominique Verity, and their idea is to have an approach to infinity categories that basically only uses two categories. So since I finally figured out two categories, this is very inspiring as an approach. But it's a book of maybe 500 pages and I bought it two weeks ago. So I didn't read it all. Sorry. 3D old, sorry. But this is the idea. So the idea, in some sense, this step here is really that you want not a category, but a two-category. And once you want a two-category, basically this becomes necessary because the morphisms have morphisms and homotopies. And here, there is this natural structure, and we will see in a moment more about it. About it. And yeah, I didn't say it, but this whole approach functions works in characteristic zero. And else you need to use simplicial algebras. And it's not really different. It's just that I don't have time to do both. And to write examples, differential graded algebra. Samples, differential graded algebras are easier. So, this is the philosophy. The idea is that you have these two new objects. And of course, there will be a notion of just like when we do complexes, a key notion is that of quasi-isomorphism. At the same way, we will see that we have such a notion in differential. That we have such a notion in differential gradient algebras. So let me start by giving definitions. Graded algebra A, this is graded algebra, is a direct sum of vector spaces indexed by the integer. By the integer together with the product, okay, by linear product which is associative graded, so a n times am goes into a n plus m and it is graded commutative. So, or So, or I used to call it skew commutative when I was young. So, if A is in AN and B is in AM, then AB is minus one to the Mn BA. And now what you want to do is you want to take this and add the differential. Differential gradient. Differential graded algebra is a pair A, B, where A is a graded algebra. D from A to A is a k linear map of degree plus one. Well, then I want a complex, so I definitely want decomposed such that. D compose such that D compose D is zero, and then of course I want that this be a differential so it satisfies Leibniz, keeping into account the signs. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You see, that's why I don't do these details. Because I noticed here, because I got stuck. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Maybe you should be giving this course. No, no, no, it was correct. No, it actually is extremely helpful. I'm joking. It's just that this is really unnatural to me. Okay. ABB. ABB and was still here. I am recycling. Okay. So this is the point that these are compatible. And as a remark, you can check. So in particular, you can view it really. Another way to see it is that you have a complex and then you have a product on the complex which is compatible. On the complex, which is compatible with the differential. And the remark or exercise is: you can show that if AB is a DGA, then the homology of A is a graded algebra. So that if you multiply cycles, you get cycles, and if you change one of the two by a boundary, the product is also changed. The product is also changed by a boundary. And of course, the first thing I want to do is give examples. Example one is, of course, differential forms. We are all used that the differential forms have a differential and it satisfies these assumptions. So let me be very concrete. Let me look. Concrete. Let me look at an of course, we are still fixing a field. And here I'm really insisting that my field has characteristic zero. And I want, I'll tell you why in a moment, and I want to consider this complex. This is just the usual differential. Notice these are k-linear, as they should be. And this is a shift of differential graded algebras. And in particular, you can take a global sections. In particular, you get Particular, you get a graded algebra, which is where are the degrees? I didn't tell you, but I think you can guess that this is in degree zero, this is in degree one, and so on. Degree one, and so on. So the grading is fixed by the fact that when you wedge a the complex would exist in any degree, you were free to shift, but once you want that a p form times a q form is a p plus q form, you are forced in the degree. And I would like to notice one thing here. A priori, you can ask yourself why did you insist that it's a n anything would do. You always have differentials, and this is true. And this is true. But the point is that in this case, the quasi-isomorphism, up to quasi-isomorphism, the result doesn't depend on n. So the cohomology here is just k here and zero at all the other levels. And of course, to insist that the only polynomials whose differential is zero are the constants, I think it really helps if the characteristic is zero. Characteristic is zero. And so this means that from a certain, from a, we identify stuff, not only the, I mean, Tiberians yelled at me for several years that the two things are not quasi-isomorphic, they are isomorphic in the derived category, but in this case, but the maps can be quasi-isomorphism. And of course, if you take the natural maps from a n minus one. From an minus one to a n, which is given by just adding a zero, and then you get a map on these algebras given by pullback, and this is really a quasi-esomorph on the nose. And the second example, and here we go back to our original problem in enumerative geometry. Problem in enumerative geometry is that if you start with M, a variety, a scheme, and E, a vector bundle on M and S, a section. Then what you can do is you can do the Cauchy complex associated. So you can do O M Wedge two of the dual and so on until wedge top of the dual and then zero. So this is certainly a complex, but you can multiply wedges. You can wedge some more. And so in this case, the only possible degrees are negative, not positive. Are negative, not positive. And in this case, you have that h0 of this is OX, where X is the zero locus. And in fact, this is the only one. So this is a quasi-isomorphism if and only if the section is irregular, or at least if S is regular. Is regular, then all other h i is zero. Okay, so this and so as I said, I want to consider really differential graded algebras in degree at most zero after inverting quasi-degree. After inverting quasi-isomorphism, as I do for complexes. Yes. And what would be the geometric opposite category of PBA? I glad you asked that. These are derived affine schemes. And so there is, we think. We think if A is a derived graded algebra in degree at most zero, we like to think of it as the topological, the geometric counterpart is something which I have seen written like this, but I also have seen it written in many other ways. I just thought I would use only one for the lecture, diminish confusion. And this is the dual. And this is the dual object. And if I think of it geometrically as a scheme, as a topological space. So topological space is just the spec of H0 of A. And this is exactly why I want it bounded above, because then everything else, H0 is just a co-kernel. H0 is just a co-kernel, and there are no questions. That is what I really would like to say. So, let me tell you, in my head, just like if you have a non-reduced ring, you can always associate the reduced ring, right? And so the scheme associated is the same as the reduced. Is the same as the reduced ring, and then you have a little cloud of new potents floating around. To me, this is the same, that the topological space is the R spec, and then there is a cloud of differential-graded algebras floating around. But I can't pinpoint them precisely because these are also because of this inverting the quasi-isomorphism. So it's a bit. So it's a bit delicate, but indeed, this is what I feel. And hopefully, I will get to state a theorem, not by me, there's no theorems of mine in this whole story. This is all reported news. A theorem which shows you that in some sense this is actually true. But it will take a while. And see, and then a cloud of. Of differential very tangents. So, this is how the point why I insist that this is the topological space, because in all definitions, things like properness or separatedness all go back to this object. So, remember what we saw in the first lecture: that when you do Valuative criteria or formal criteria for choosing properness, all you need is a smooth curve and a smooth curve minus one point. And so this does not see any problem with singularities. For stacks, you have to fudge a bit with the definition, but basically it's still the same. While when you want to do smoothness, then you go the Then you go the other way around because what you use are with fat points. Fat points means that now the topology is completely gone. I mean, it's a point. You can't have less than that. And on the other hand, this infinitesimal structure really comes into the game. And we will see something very similar will happen here. So this is the intuition we want. We want. And let me introduce another important notion, which is quasi-smoothness, quasi-freeness. So A DGA is A D D G A is quasi-free if it is free as a grade. As a graded algebra. And typically, you want it free and finitely generate finitely generators infinitely many degrees, but not always. I think that this, I will only use it in degree at most zero. Let me put it this way. But the point is, a priori, this makes sense in general. To say that you forget the degree, you know, a graded algebra. Know a graded algebra, a free algebra, we know what it is over variables, and you can do the same, but now every variable has a degree. And you could say, for instance, that this one is free generated by the coordinates and the differentials of the coordinates. And the key point here is that if R is Is a differential graded algebra in degree at most zero, then there exists a in all morphism again in differential gradient at most zero, such that it's a quasi-isomorphism such that A is quasi-free. Free. And the place I learned this stuff from is a very old paper of Tukan, Fontanine and Sapranov. There are two papers around 2000. One is the derived POT scheme, and the other is the derived Hilbert scheme. The Hilbert scheme. Why are these papers what I really understood? Because they are written for a geometer. On the other hand, they are not a good model because what they do is they have differential graded algebras, but in their language, they cannot describe the higher homotopies. So they give models for derived schemes which are Schemes, which are really a topological space with a shift of differential-graded algebras. So they are very geometric, but they can still describe quasi-isomorphisms, but what is missing is this higher structure. And so I have been told by people I trust that to every derived scheme in the Chocan-Fontanini Capranov sand. The Chocan-Fontanini Kapranov sense, you can actually associate a derived scheme in the Luri or Toem-Vetsosi sense, in a natural way. In some sense, it's a more special case. It's the equivalent of instead of having a scheme, you have a projective scheme or a quasi-projective scheme. It's much easier to understand. By this, I don't mean that the actual construction is easy to understand because there's a lot of. Is easy to understand because there's a lot of algebra in it. Um, you start generating things, and then when it you fails to be causedomorphism, you build things. Yeah, it's a it's the way you produce something by it, it's really a topological idea. You know, you want to reproduce all the all the groups you want, so you start putting relations. So, what Putting relations, so what do you do? The starting point is exactly the one we had. So, say that our R starts by being K of X1 XN modulo F1 FR. And now you start approximating. First you take a 0 to be K of X1 Of x1, xn in degree zero. There is nothing else. And then you start saying, okay, then I put three generators u1 ur in A minus one, and you insist that the dui is fi, and you get. And you get the algebra generated by this. And the algebra generated by this has a zero cohomology, what you want, but maybe it might have a minus ones cohomology. And so you add the three generators in degree minus two, which map to those. Because they are cohomology, this is still well defined. Because when you do differential again, it will be zero. And you keep going degree. And you keep going degree by degree. And what happens is that when you do differential graded algebras, since it's a very formal structure, you can take the associated RAM the differential module. And so if A is a differential graded algebra. Differential gradient algebra. And again, let me put it in here. So I, and let me also put quasi-free because, anyway, since I want to work up to quasi-isomorphism, assuming quasi-free is not really restrictive, so I will only work with those de facto. And what I can do is I can do omega A. And what is yes? Yes, but it is not something I am prepared to prove now or ever. But it is unique, yes. In fact, you could even find a canonical one with infinitely many generators. So you just put the one in A zero, you put one generator for every element of R, in A minus one, you put one generator for every element in the kernel, and so on. In the kernel, and so on. It's just that this frightens me. But you can do it if you're strong. And so, when you do this, when you normally do differentials, like in that case, you are just adding differentials. Normally, when you consider the module of differentials, you just take the variables and make the three module with those generators. And here, you do the same, but The same, but for every if A has generators xi with degree of xi is di, then omega A is an A module, a gradable A module, which means that this has a grading and multiplication by A respects nicely both gradings, and it's generated. It's generated by the delta x i's, and now I call it with a different D because I already have a D here. I can't have two B's, two identical D's, and this in degree dI. And the differential, you get also differential from omega a to omega. Omega A to omega A of degree plus one, which has the property that the differential of dxi is, I don't remember the sign, so I will not say it. I think it might be minus delta of dxi. And this is defined because my delta is a lot. My delta is a Leibniz, so I go into another degree and I know what this is, I express it in terms of the generators. So this is basically the idea. And now we go back to my original discussion. Remember, I had the No, it's a module. It's a graded module over A. No, no, it's omega one. Sorry. I think this is a better name. Sorry, thank you for pointing this out. This is just a one level. And I told you we are pretending everything is smooth. And because, after all, apart from the differential, it is. It's a free algebra. It's hard to be smoother than that. And in fact, And in fact, what you can do, remember, if you are in this condition, you start with our R, you find the free resolution. Since this is a complex of A modules, and so if you start with R, a K algebra, and you take A to R, a resolution. A resolution, a quasi-isomorphism. This we put in degree zero because by itself it doesn't have a differential. And you take a quasi-isomorphism with A quasi-free dga smaller and equal than zero. Then this has omega a. This is a well-defined element in the The complexes of A modules, and so I can produce, I can tensor it. In fact, you should view this as a quotient. So this is really pulling back. I can produce LR, which is omega A tensor A R. And this is now a R and this is now a complex of R modules. And of course, what I get depends on my choice of A, which is not unique, but it is unique. The quasi-isomorphisms on the algebra side. Sorry, this is hard modules. And what you get is that this is a well-defined element in the derived category. And in fact, it is the cotangent complex. So the cotangent complex, so this is LR, is well defined as As object in the derived category, and it is the cotangent complex. And maybe some of the senior members of the audience, as in more senior than me, can remind me who did this definition. Is it Quillen? Is it Andre to do this for algebras? Algebras, you don't know my name. No, Ilusi comes after. He quotes their work. Exactly, that's the next person that comes in. Is that Ilusi extends this? Yes, that's what I was thinking, which is, I think it's oh, well, that's modern less. Oh, well, that's more or less the same time as Ilusi's thesis. So it's about the same time frame. But I don't think either, at least I'm pretty sure Quillen didn't know of Ilusi's work. And let me tell you what does Ilusi. Ilusi extends this. So let me finish here and start on a new blackboard celebrating what Ilusi did. So, oh my god. Oh my god, I'm so slow. So, what Elusi did is he extended this. First of all, he didn't want to limit himself to characteristic zero, so he used simplicial methods resolutions, not differential graded. Differential gradient and produces a potangent complex for any morphism I think of locally ring topoi, ring topoi, something very, very general. And let me in in a very in In a very in big generality, I will not go into the details, but in particular for any morphismal schemes. And this has the property first of all its in Hugo X and in the U.S. X and in fact in our assumption for us because our schemes are all of finite type over a field and it has the property that H0 is omega so it's really omega plus some material and the h minus one sorry One, sorry, not h minus one, tau at minus one is the naive potential complex, the one we saw. And this, you see, it really matches with what I said: that if you start like this, you put the differentials of the dx i's, and then you put the differentials in degree minus. The differentials in degree minus one of the generators of the ideal, and then you map the differential of the equation to their actual differential. So you really get this. It's not so bad. No, that is actually quite a disappointing. So let me tell you the good properties and the bad properties. Properties and the bad properties. So, problem. Sorry? It's a cut. Cut off. So there is a standard way to cut off a complex. You truncate. Yes. Truncate. That's a better name. Yes. So the properties and the properties, there are good properties and bad properties. So the good properties, first of all, First of all, is if you take x, y, z. Normally you know that you have that the pullback of omega y, you have a property of the pullbacks of the short half exact short x half exact exact sequence of the differential. Sequence of the differentials and this induces an exact sequence of a distinguished triangle in the Rivecat. So you have F pullback of LG goes to LH goes to L F and now this goes back. This is a distinguished triangle. And so if you take a comology, you take a comology what you get is exactly that omega f omega h in f pullback of omega I mean with some cheating here but not very much omega g so this is the one you know and this is the h0 part and so you are really doing some derived functors you have a half exact functor Exact functor, half exact X sequence, and now you know what should go here. In particular, if f is a closed embedding, this is zero, and here you get I mod the pullback of the ideal shift. So, this is really something nice. The second property, which is also reasonably nice, is that if you have a partition diagnosis. A Cartesian diagram like this. Then there is a natural matter from the pullback of LF, and by this pullback, I mean the pullback in the derived category. It's the only one that applies. One that applies to LF1, which is an isomorphism if the diagram is there is a nice word that is something like Tor independent, Tor, so that the higher tors vanish. How do you what's it? Tor independent in case you don't know what Tor independent. You don't know what R-independent means, it's for instance true if either this one or this one are flat, which means that if this is flat, you know this is also flat, and then you can pull back the cotangent complex. Or if this is flat, it doesn't matter what this one does, which basically says that the cotangent complex is, so to speak, a sheaf, or is a local in the flat, in some reasonably flat topology. No, no, no, no, I'm talking about the derived pullback here. The derived pullback is defined, but the point, and there is such a map, but it's not always an isomorphism. And what you really should think of is that, after all, this is similar to the discussion we had: that typical We had that typical example of TAR-independent stuff, which is not flat, is you have two embeddings of two sub-varieties in an ambient, and they are all smooth and they meet transversely. Questions? Okay, so this is a could be better, but it's not bad. And then we come to the bad news, and the bad news did not. Bad news, and the bad news did not come from Illusi. So, some good news come from ILUZ since they are still the good properties. So, I think we are in Illusi at least. 3 LF is zero if and only if F is et al. Again, this really applies in my additional assumptions. I don't really understand. I don't really understand the dullness much when I walk away from stuff which is finite type over a field. But in our assumptions, this is the same. And we have that L F is just has only HZ is a perfect in 0, 0. So I mean it has only So, I mean, it has only one cohomology shift, which is, and after every pullback, it also has one. Sorry, it's isomorphic in the locally isomorphic to a locally free sheaf in degree zero. And this is equivalent to F smooth. So, if F is smooth, then, and in such a case, either of these. In such case, either of these implies LF is omega F in degree zero. Then we have that L F is perfect in minus one zero even only if F is locally L C i. LCI. LCI, I prefer to use the notion, Fulton defines LCI as something which has a global factorization as regular closed embedding followed by smooth map. And this, however, is a local property, so you cannot assume global factorization. So this looks very nice. These are the good news. The bad news If F is not L C I, then the H N of L F is different from zero for infinitely many values of n. So And so it's very nice. Everything has a nice interpretation until you fall off the face of the heart. And this is very disturbing. Okay, so this is the first picture. And so to me, this already shows that I already think, so how I interpret this in my head, but not I, I, how I was taught to interpret this. Was taught to interpret this is that you get a natural embedding from scheme inside derived schemes, which is induced by this construction in a global way, appropriate global way. Or if you want, it's given by the fact that you extend a functor from, remember, a scheme is a functor. And a scheme is a functor from algebras to sets. And of course, each set is naturally a simplicial set. There is a natural embedding. And here you would want to have differential graded algebras. And you need to find something like this. So what you do is you go here by taking h0. H0 and you associate to a scheme, a derived scheme, and this is the new in this. So what you get is your scheme sits inside the derived scheme as a closed embedding precisely because R is a quotient of A and the L is the omega of the derived structure. Of the drive structure restricted to X and the Philippine And so. And so what it's it's it's not quite more like market and because this is bad because when you want to go all the way around these diagrams, yes, and you have higher cost mobility, and you end up with X and some bunch of yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's not it's it's a problem. I understand that this is a problem, but the idea is that you really should work with this. And that if you work with this, you see. Work with this, you see now what you have is that there are so the fact is that many modular problems have a natural derived Derived interpretation. And what are the key properties? I told you that this derived world has some things that behave well. So in the derived world, fiber products are always tor independent. So the cotangent behaves exactly the way. Behaves exactly the way you want it to behave. So you still have, you still have that this thing here, as before, induces what we now call it's the same thing as we had, but with omegas. This is also still true. And you should think of it as these are all smooth maps. So you expect a short exert sequence. But of course, these are complexes. So short exert sequence doesn't really make sense. But the other thing is that if you have index. Have in the same diagram f as before before L P pullback of omega F to omega G is always an isomorphism in the derived category. And this is again something we are familiar with. It's a part of our picture of having smooth maps. If this is smooth, this is also smooth. The base change of smooth is smooth. And the relative cotangent is the pullback of the relative cotangent. It's more a matter of notation, right? So omega L is L and L. Yeah, yeah, but the point is here, it's really the The point is here, it's really the differentials. It's the only thing you can have. The point is, I need a different notation, otherwise, I get extremely confused. And so what do I mean by many moduli problems have a derived interpretation? Let me look, for instance, at locally free shifts. After all, I had promised a shift somewhere. Promise the shift somewhere, locally free shifts on a X projective scheme. So what you can do to look at, I mean, this is not all coherent shifts, but it's a very nice open subset. So what you can do is you can cover your X by f fines. And now on each of them. And now, on each of them, you have a moduli of vector boundaries. So you have a function from f of two sets, which sends S to not to sets, but again to group points, which sends S to locally. As two locally free vector bundles of rank R on Ui times F comma isomorphism. And this is not algebraic, this is a stack. It's not non-derived. It's not algebraic because it's way too big, but it's still a stack. And so I can do the same construction there and get the Action there and get the derived stack. And then what I can do is I can fiber product all of this stuff. Or I think the word I want is limit. I can do the limit in the derived category. And at each step, I can use the fact that when I have a fiber product and I know what these maps have as cotton. These maps have as cotangent complex, then I also know what is the cotangent complex of everything because I have the distinguished triangle or the cotangent complex. Yeah, and so what I get is that when I have done all the fiber products, remember the fiber products will involve vector bundles on finite intersection of this stuff. But these are still affine. That's why. Are still affine. That's why I projected volatile. And so, what you get is you get a derived stack of bundles rank R. Bundles, rank R bundles on X and what you can check is if you take one point and as I told you the points are not really derived, it just means in the image of spec K. So this is just a bundle. So this coordinate. So, this corresponds to a map from spec k to this moduli. And what I can do is I can pull back the cotangent of the moduli and take the cohomology. The cohomology in degree non-positive, and then take the dual. These are finite-dimensional vector spaces, and they are h i. Now I have to get it right. H if this is minus i, I want h zero to be h one. So h plus one is h zero, yes. One is H0, yes, of X and P. And the associated scheme is the original moduli. The associated non-derived stack, the truncation, is the truncation of the derived moduli stack is the usual. Is the usual moduli stack, and so you have the usual moduli classical. This goes into the moduli derived, and so this inclusion gives you a map from the pullback of the cotangent of the omega of the module I derived to. to the cotangent of this is the same omega and L to the cotangent of the moduli classic and this is the kind of obstruction theory we have in mind this has exactly this property remember in this case there's a shift there is an h zero which sits in degree plus one and this is an artifact of the fact that we are working with step Of the fact that we're working with stacks. It's not a problem, it just acknowledges the fact that vector bundles have a positive dimensional space of automorphism. And so this is where now the obstruction theory, in particular, you get an obstruct, a perfect obstruction theory if X is a smooth project. Projective surface, and you can really see that it comes from a derived structure. And why am I so insisting on these spaces here? And the point is, and with this, I think unfortunately, we'll have. Oh, I'm sorry, maybe first of all, I could try to. Sorry, maybe first of all, I could try to close yesterday. This, let me call this J actually. Yes. So, no, this is the derived, is a point. So, I want to look what happens at the point. Because remember, this is how we got our obstruction theory. Obstruction theory, it was a complex mapping to the cotangent complex or the naive cotangent complex. But once you map to the whole cotangent complex, you can always cut off and go to the naive one. And then it had to have some properties pointwise. And these are the fact that pointwise h1 of n e is the tangent and h2 of nd is the obstruction. This is very, very old. This is very, very old. This is not modern at all. This is something I can prove easily without help. So it's really easy. Well, that's why I put the assumption that X is the smooth projective surface, which you couldn't read because I had nastily left the window open. That's the way that it is because it is, but I need to sit and produce my copy of homology and base change. It is perfect and it's a consequence of homology and base change. It's square, it's a tricky because this is a stack, so it's not perfect in minus. So it's not perfect in minus one zero, but it's perfect in minus one plus one. So there are a few, I'm so sorry, but I would like to have a few minutes. Can I? And so the first reason why am I making this fuss about this kind of higher tangent spaces? So what the point So, what the point is, in general, if x is a derived scheme or stack and x is a point, and by point I always mean k-valued point, so an element in the image of k. Then I have, I can associate to this a sequence of A sequence of tangent spaces. And how do I do it? I take the omega x, as I pull it back, I take h minus i and I dualize. And here actually doesn't matter, these are now k. Actually, it doesn't matter. These are now k vector spaces. So, whether I first take homology and then dualize, or first dualize, then take homology is not a problem. And there is a very important theorem which says that if x in y is a morphism of the right. Of derived schemes. Then f is an isomorphism in here. There is a big discussion whether this should be called an isomorphism or an equivalence. So if you want, it's an isomorphism in the associate homotopy category. But it means it's the same thing, the one we want, if and only if one. only if one the associated pi zero or truncation so h zero of x to h zero of y so the associated morphism of schemes or pi zero if you are working simplicially associated morphism of schemes Of schemes is an isomorphism. This is very nice because typically, if our problem comes by deriving a moduli problem, it means that the underived moduli problem is the truncation. So we don't, we know this, so to speak, we understand this. And two, for every x in x and for every. And for every I for every n in n at least zero, the induced map from T n x x to t n f of x y is an isomorphism. So what I wanted to say with respect to your previous question. To your previous question, is that to get an isomorphism, I have to control the morphism at the level of underlying schemes and to control all these infinitesimal things. And the way you can view this T and X, you remember that the T zero was essentially the homomorphism from a specific little scheme. Scheme and this is a home Z n X where Z n is r spec of k of epsilon n modulo epsilon n squared and the degree of epsilon n is minus n. And this part here, I actually learned not by reading modern stuff, but by reading Marco Manetti, who does extended deformation functors. And the point with Marco is that he's a stubborn. So I try to tell him, look, write what you write in this simplicial language, in higher categories. Say, no, I can do it with usual categories, and this is not going to stop me. Then the moment. Not going to stop me. Then, the moment you don't look at him, he's using, you know, L infinity, algebras, and E infinity. You know, he's doing all kinds of infinite stuff, but for some reason, this didn't. But the point is, this is really, so the idea in particular is that if you have a natural morphism of functors of a derived scheme, the way you should be studying it is you can understand. It is you can understand everything which is going on by understanding the corresponding morphism at the scheme level and underived and all these infinitesimal pictures. So you don't have to understand that the global derived structure, this you only use to produce that there is a map, and everything else splits into underived and infinitesimal. So in this sense, I really view In this sense, I really view it as underived schemes with a cloud around. But now, this cloud is not finite. You may need infinitesimal at arbitrarily high order because you may have infinitely many tangent spaces. And there is one more thing I wanted to say. You can see I have already been always been moving back and forth. Always be moving back and forth between schemes and stacks. Because, of course, I really like schemes. And schemes are the ones where I have a nice intersection theory on. But for instance, when you work with shifts, it's very natural to work with stacks. How do we bridge this gap? We have two systems. The first thing is to notice that every shift has scalars as automorphism, and scalars commutes with everything else. With everything else. So there is a way to kick them away by rigidifying. There is literature on this, and it, under good assumption, preserves all these obstruction theories. Basically, because here, if you act on the E by multiplication by a scalar, the action on NDE is trivial. And so this stuff all goes down to the rigidification. And the other thing you may know. And the other thing you may know is that sometimes you have to do GIT and you do S equivalents. And there you don't have something which is fine and you don't know what to do. Out of the S equivalents, the stable bundles are simple. So once you have gotten rid of the scalars, you're done. So what do you do? You apply curve one resolution, which means you just blow up the most singular part, the part with the largest automorphism. The part with the largest automorphism group, and then you keep going and until you get something where the automorphism group at all finite. And this can be done in the derived world under suitable assumptions. In particular, if you had a perfect obstruction theory on this strange artin stack, which has a good moduli space, which is projective, you can get a perfect obstruction theory on an artin stack which also. On an artin stack which only has the C star as automorphism group. And so when you rigidify, you get a proper scheme which maps to your projective scheme that moduli that you want it. And so if you get a fundamental class there, you can always push forward because it's proper. So this really, if one can understand this stuff, there are a lot of details to check, but they can be fixed. And what about Be fixed. And what about if it's not a vector bundle? The answer is you replace coherent sheaves by complex of vector bundles. And of course, everything works much better when these complexes are finite. Otherwise, you are a bit in trouble. Thank you. Thank you very much for your audience. Yes, yes, it is. It's just I told you where I learned it, not that it's still. So again, the problem is how much you understand this stuff. If you understand, my problem is that this stuff does not get written by derived geometers because they think it's obvious and does not. Obvious and does not get written by classical algebraic geometers because we don't understand it. And so there is this gap, and my hope is the gap gets filled. Maybe you should close again because I think Mark is looking. Sorry, you were saying. No, no, I'm not. So is there a relation between this machinery and or machinery? This is actually a very good question because formal schemes play a big role in the formation theory. And so I would really like, I think it would be nice to have a formal interpretation of this stuff. But even writing, you know, my student who wrote Finnish. My student who wrote finished his thesis last March learned a lot of formal schemes, and there is still a lot of extremely basic work which is ongoing. There is this group of people whose name, if somebody reminds me, I'll put in the notes, who do research in they are in northwest Spain on formal schemes and they are very good. And they are very good, but you know, it's a lot of stuff. So, just to define things which are very natural in the non-formal context, you get 60 pages of hardcore algebra. So, the problem with connecting formal schemes to this is that, in my opinion, there may not be enough formal scheme material. And in particular, there may not be enough people who master the one and the other. The other. Maybe we'll go down to this question. So, if you talk about the right stacks, you have to invoke also the descent with respect to verbatim topology. Yes. How do you suggest an extension of using Lurie's machine? So, this is actually very complicated. In fact, I was a bit cheating here because all the stacks I care about are global portions. And so, if you have a global portion, And so, if you have a global quotient, it's quite clear that you just do the same, but you take it equivariant. And in fact, the original work of Lurida does not define derived stacks, it only defines derived schemes. And I think there are now presentations. So, the original Toen Vetsosi, on the other hand, defined in one fails whoop derived n stacks. It had the minor problem that you couldn't embed the scheme. That you couldn't embed the schemes that were not LCI in the picture. And this was disturbing. Precisely because their assumption always had that the cotangent complex must be perfect somewhere in some amplitude. They had a recursion picture where this complex, they started with smooth schemes, which were perfect in dimension zero, and then they did stuff with that and defined things which are perfect left and right. Left and right, so higher stacks and derived, but always of a finite length. And so this was not great. It was a good definition, but if you can't put schemes into it, I don't want it. And then I think by now there are approaches that do derived stacks. I'm not sure they do derived higher stacks. But again, I am not ready to answer names now. Okay, are there any more questions in the audience here and in the Zoom worldwide? Two minutes ago, but there's not, then I think we should thank Barbara for all her wonderful talks. Thanks very much.
