So our talk is to ask the question about what happens when we put nanoparticles in the exactly same system that Jean-De Dieu just described you before. And possibly we may during this talk address a little bit of the questions that you may have had. Possibly to be clearer, possibly less clear. You will tell me. So, but just before, let me annulate. The large number of collaborations that we have, because in fact it's a work that has started already a long time ago. In the audience, there are already two collaborators, Randy and Otto Bulu. But I would like also to emphasize that it corresponds to what I will show to the postdoc of iPhij V D and to the PhD of Supergo. So you recognize here the structures that John Dodio presented to you. To you, schematized, again presented inside you, between the substrate and the air. And for example, for the chain of dislocation, I have presented them only at the basis of the curvature rule, which impacts the area where we mostly expect dislocation there. And why do we study these nanoparticles in this system? In fact, there are two main reasons. First, First, because the evidence of the nanoparticle assemblies that we may have would be like a confirmation of the presence of the defect that we have evidence. And we may not only confirm their presence, but we may even obtain new information on the defects themselves by the study of the nanoparticle assemblies. Why? Because when you have Because when you have a solution of HCB molecule that you deposit on top of the hobbit PVA polymer, and in the solution you also have nanoparticle, what happens? In fact, when the solvent evaporates, the defect forms, and in the september, this is really what we expect, nanoparticle gets trapped in the defect core. Why? Because you see very easily, I guess, that when a nanoparticle is localized When a nanoparticle is localized in the core, then locally it expels the disordered molecule of the core, and as a result, you may minimize, even minimize energy in presence of nanoparticles. And in fact, it's exactly what we observe. In presence of nanoparticles, these patterns are stabilized. And then this defect core can be viewed as a top plate for n a nanoparticle assembly that will be induced. That will be induced. In other words, the defect core will be the place where nanoparticles will be confined and will create original, eventually, new kind of assembly that could be otherwise difficult to achieve. And because these nanoparticles have specific optical properties, these new kinds of assemblies can be interesting for the optical properties of the nanoparticles. And we study three kinds of nanoparticles. kind of nanoparticles. They are fluorescent nanoparticles and gold nanoparticles, either spheres or hot. You can notice that they are all surrounded, including these ones, by organic ligand, which are there mostly in order to preserve stability of the nanoparticle in solution before they are mixed with the liquid crystal. And you can also notice that all sides are quite small, exactly because they must be of the order of the size of the defect core. Size of the defect core. If they are too large, they will induce disorder and this may destabilize the structure. So we study fluorescent nanorods made of semiconducting material such that these codes emit light at a very well-defined wavelength, which is controlled by the size of the particle. So it's very interesting because we can use fluorescence microscopy to detect. Microscopy to detect the presence of the nanoparticle, which will go to the defect, so we will see the localization of the defect. We can also analyze the shape of the nanoparticle assemblies. And because we use rods, which emit polarized light along the axis of the rod, by the analysis of the polarization of light emitted by the nanoparticle assemblies, we may obtain information about the average orientation of the rods. Orientation of the rods within the assemblies. So, this is why this study is quite interesting, and also you may notice that these rods are single-photon emitters, which are quite interesting, especially if you are able to control the single polarization for this single photon emitter in our systems. The optical properties of gold nanoparticles are fully different, and I will take a little bit of time because I'm not sure that you all know they are related. That you all know they are related to the well-known plasmonic absorption of cold nanoparticles. So, what is it? In fact, when you have a cold nanoparticle in presence of an oscillating electric field of light, then the electrons of the golden nanoparticle will move, and then you will have. Move and then you will have oscillating dipoles. And these oscillating dipoles can be quite easily calculated using Maxwell equation in relation with the boundary condition. And you can demonstrate that there is a specific value for the dielectric permittivity of gold for which there will be a resonance and a giant dipole. And because the permittivity of gold depends on the wavelength of light, then you will have Length of light, then you will have a specific wavelength for which you will have a strong absorption of light by the nanoparticles at around 520 nanometers for spheres of the order of 15 nanometers. And as a result, the solution is red. And why is it interesting? Because in fact, if you have now two particles Okay. We'll see what happens. Can you exit the presentation and restart it? Try exiting the presentation and restart. Why, what? Like, pressing a skit. It's that kiss. Oh, wait. Oh, watch me. There we go. All right, good. So, when you have two nanoparticles very close from each other, then closely you see that you will have the dipole that will interact. And as a result, when you have an assembly of nanoparticles in close contact, you are able to play on the absorption of light. And you can even see that if you control the polarization of light, so the direction of electric field with respect to the axis of the assembly. Of the assembly, then clearly the interaction between dipole will be different if the electric field is parallel to the axis or perpendicular, inducing perpendicular dipole interactions. So you can have a system where if you have anisotropic nanoparticle asomy, you will have a resonance absorption of light controlled by light polarization. And this is what we try also to study. And I will start with the situation of small conceptual. With a situation of small concentration using gold and then fluorescent nanoparticle, starting by a gold nanosphere of size around 6 nanometers. So when you put a quite small concentration of gold nanospheres in your liquid crystal film, you see it is poorly impacted. Here you have the same colour that described by Francesca this morning, the stripes that we don't see very well, which are there. And now you can measure the not only. Measure the plasmonic absorption for first a perpendicular polarization for incident light. So, what happens? We detect the plasmonic resonance and we observe that it is in fact very similar to the one that you have obtained in solution for single nanoparticle, which tells us that in fact for a perpendicular polarization of light, the gold nanosphere behave like single nanoparticles. However, when you change the However, when you change the polarization direction, what do you obtain? You obtain again a beautiful absorption band, but now the wavelength is strongly redshifted by 50 nanometers with respect to the one in solution. What does it tell us? It tells us that there is no interaction in this direction, but there is a strong coupling in this direction associated with the formation of nanoparticle chains. And we can even estimate the average. Estimate the average coupling, the gap of the nanoparticle within the chains, which is very small, of the order of the lithium size. So they are strongly coupled within the chains, which is interesting. So we can conclude that indeed there are 1D defects able to trap and assemble nanoparticles in the 1D defect. Clearly, 1D defects look more favorable than 2D defects to trap nanoparticles. To track nanoparticles, and we obtain a cross-packing of a nanoparticle. What is interesting is that then, with polarization, in this order-oriented system, we control the absorption of light. You can observe, more interesting, that the width for the parallel polarization is larger than for the perpendicular polarization, suggesting that there should be several values, different values of Of gap between nanoparticles depending on the change, which may be possibly due to the fact that there are different assemblies in different kinds of defects. For example, disclination with respect to dislocation or dislocation of different border vectors that may induce different coupling between nanoparticles. Well, it's a speculation, eventually related to different kinds of disorder that may induce, depending on the size of the Use depending on the size of the defect core. And why 1D defects are more vulnerable than 2D defects? Open question. So what happens now if we have gold nanohots and no more gold nanospheres? But in solution, you don't have one single peak now, but two absorption bands. The one at large wavelengths is due to the fact that the polarization will be parallel to the long axis, whereas for the short Long axis, whereas for the short wavelengths, it corresponds to the case where polarization is perpendicular to the long axis. And in solution, we always measure the two because the nanorods are disordered. So for a fixed polarization, you always measure the two. So what will you do in order to test if nanorods are well-oriented in our system? We will fix the polarization with respect to the AB cylinder, the ATB stripes. And when we do that, what do we observe? When we do that, what do we observe? We only measure the compound. And this suggests that nanohods are parallel to this direction. And this is indeed confirmed when you rotate polarization, now perpendicular to the defect. Now you have only the first one. So indeed, you demonstrate that in our system, we create oriental nano rods, and this again confirms that they may be. confirm that there may be a trap in the 1D defect like that here in inside view presented and here in top view. So we confirm trapping by 1D defect but this has another result orientation of the nanorods. So why nanorods are oriented in fact it's easy to understand because not only they will be trapped by the defect but the amount of expal disorder will expulse disorder molecule will be the largest when the rods will be parallel in the defect. So this is why not only it hurts but it orients. And as a result we are able to control the wavelength of absorption of light by a large amount from 500 to 800 nanometers. And what the internal question? Oh, sorry. Yeah. Explicitly, which is a 1D and which is a 2D. A 1D, and which is a 2D. What do you mean by 1D? The 1D is a line. I will come back to the defect, to the model. This is a 2D defect. The central one which shares perpendicular layers with flat layers. Yeah, there's a domain wall somewhere. And there is a domain rod, exactly. And a large one. It's expected to be of 400 nanowetters. So, of course, if you have a rod, there is. There is actually no reason to have it oriented. So, this is why we really believe that it is in the other debate, which are one D, either destination, either dislocation, and all in this direction. I don't know if it was very clear, but parallel to the MICY Lander axis. And if now we pass from a very diluted system, you see here in this case the concentration was very low. Case the concentration was very low to a slightly larger concentration. Then you see that, in addition, the circumbond is redshifted by 100 nanometers, which tells us that now we have an entromagnetic coupling between oriental nanoholds, we create chains. And in fact, we can even analyze this spectrum to demonstrate that we have only short chains in relation to this small possibility. Change in relation to this small concentration, a mixture between dimers and hymers, but again with a very small spacing between nanoparticle nano odds in the chains, which may be controlled by the vehicle. So with this system, we have built an array of oriented shades, of oriented nanorods. And it's interesting, in fact, for two main reasons. First, because then we can control the absorption of light by polarization either parallel. By polarization, either parallel or perpendicular, leading to very large variation of absorption wavelengths. But most interestingly, it's quite well known that when nanorods are electromagnetically coupled, then you will have a huge excitation of the electric field between neighboring nanorods here, which are the so-called hotspots. And with our oriented system, now we have Oriented system. Now we have hotspots which become monitored by light polarization appearing with the polarization parallel to the HCB defect. So I can please notice it's very easy to put it because it will be perpendicular to the rubbing in this specific case. So what happens if we change the nature of rods? Well in fact we are the same because if there is no reason that it depends on the nature of the rods even not so Nature of the rods, even not so much for the 1D D effect of the nature of the LIBOR. For this fluorescent nanorot, what did we do? But we measured the polarization of light with respect to the orientation of the stripes, and we have found, shown in this histogram, that the polarization is very well defined, parallel to the stripe. So suggesting that the rods, the long axis is also parallel to the stripe. Similar interpretation. Similar interpretation, the trapping and orientation of odds by the 1D defect appears to be a general behavior. And now we can ask the question: okay, we have demonstrated that this one D defect exists, my opinion, this is more or less a demonstration, but also we can ask the question: how many nanoparticles can we track in this one deep effect? And for that, we came back to the initial system of all nanoparticles. To the initial system of gold nanospheres, where we have measured, in fact, using quota-for-but scattering spectroscopy, the total amount of gold atoms. And by measuring this, we have obtained that in a system where still the optical properties are fully anisotropic, so made only of chains of nanoparticles, we have a very large amount of nanoparticles. Amount of nanoparticles that can be trapped in the defect, this number, and you can calculate for a single chain of length one micron how many nanoparticles you will have. And then we obtain that almost five 1D defects are fully filled, which tells us that we have indeed quite a number of 1D defects in one even ME cylinder. And we must have indeed some dislocation as indeed claimed by John Rule. As indeed claimed by Jean-Louis Dieu previously. And the other results is that we are able to form very long chains, obviously. So the question now that I can ask is what happens if all the 1D defects are filled and we further increase the concentration. So we have this correspond to the large concentration regime. And here you have a particular microscopic picture for the Picture for the limit small concentration regime where you hardly guess the presence of dots that may be associated with some nanoparticle organization. But if you multiply by the factor five, no, not five, seven, six, seven, then what do you see? I think, I hope you see that in each ME cylinder, roughly you will have formation of events that you can now even detect. That you can now even detect by optical microscopy between parallel polarizers. And so you have a formation of ribbons. And if you now measure the optical properties, the light absorption of these ribbons, the result is very different than before. You have a fully isotropic absorption, which tells you that the structure of nanoparticle in the ribbons, the assembly structure, should be isotropic. So what is it? In order to do that, of course, we came back to X-ray. Of course, we came back to X-ray diffraction. And you can recognize the circle described by Jean-De Yu-Kudiosky. But in addition, do you see that you have very intense rods here? And you can compare them to the rods that are measured when you form a system of the same nanoparticle on top of the substrate with a quick crystal. So you never, you don't have to center, and you know by. Center, and you know by electronic microscopy that in this case, locally you form small hexagonal networks. And as a result, you have the one O band, the one one band, the two O band of the hexagonal network. And here we recognize the same one O and two O bands that allows us to claim that in this system we form a 2D hexagonal network of well-defined period, and moreover, this network is flat. And moreover, this network is flat, flat like the one which is formed the substrate. So, where is it? We can already say that the period of this hexagonal structure can be easily extracted from the measurement of the rods, and we have a value which is different without liquid crystal and with liquid crystal. Again, in presence of a liquid crystal, we have a close packing of nanoparticles in the hexagonal ribbon. So, strong electromagnetic. So, strong electromagnetic coupling. And our immediate interpretation in relation with your remark will be that we expect this hexagonal network to be formed in the 2D defect now. And how can we demonstrate why it is there and not, for example, on the substrate? Because we have made a further experiment where now we made X-ray diffraction with... Now we make X-ray diffraction with a sample perpendicular to the X-ray beam. In such a geometry, what we measure is the orientation of the one O-road. And for the system without liquid, you see that it's not oriented. You can have all oriented of the exabulal network. And then you have a scattered circle. And when you do exactly the same with the system in presence of liquid crystal, what do you observe? No more circle, but examinal spot. Hexagonal spot at 60 degrees that tells you that, in fact, we don't have any more a disoriented hexagonal network, but we have formed an oriented network, as shown here in top view, where the dense direction of the hexagonal network is parallel to the defect. And how do we know that it is parallel? So I come back to here. Because you see that this pit here can be compared to the one of the perpendicular layers. Compared to the one of the perpendicular layers, it has exactly the same orientation, which tells you that the dense direction indeed is parallel to the perpendicular layers close to the substrate. So, Emmanuel, I kept waiting a few slides back. You showed the said that it was a factor of seven code. It was it was data that you could view a visual microphone. That you can do a visual microscopy. Yes. Further back. One more. There. Ah, yes. Why is it isotropic? Why are the ribbons anisotropic? It's a good question. In fact, it's well known that a hexagonal network of nanoparticles even oriented is isotropic because you see that if you have a direction of the electric field, it can always be It can always be linearly distributed in two directions, and then as a result, you can always have one direction along the dense direction, whatever direction of the polarization you have. And as a result, in fact, an hexagonal structure of nanoparticles leads to an isotropic system which does not vary with polarization. Polarization. But I see ribbons that look stretched in one direction. The ribbons are oriented. Not only are the ribbons oriented, they are stretched in the direction, they are in the middle of the 2D defect, but inside they are formed by an hexagonal network. The hexagonal network is isotropic. And you could have some isotropy if the hexagonal network would be very thin. Well it's seen with like a very small ribbons, you see. But because the central defect is 400 nanometers, you form very large, in fact, hexagonal ribbons of nanoparticles that are equivalent to infinite for the point of view of the plasmonic absorption. Yes. If the nanoparticles are assembled in forming these ribbons and the ribbons are larger in size, doesn't that influence the introduce disorder in this way? The and introduce disorder in this technique? When they assemble and they become larger in size, then they start to approach this extrapolation length where they can introduce distortions in the spectrum. But in fact, they are very large here, but if we come back to the model, This size is 400 nanometers. And so it's round. So it's very large. And in fact, when you measure the size of the ribbons by optical microscopy, you have a large size because it's increased by the fraction. It's not precise. But it's exactly compatible with what you expect. Usually, you form ribbons that appear to be slightly of smaller width. So, like 200. So, like 200 nanometers maximum, something like that. So, they are well interdefect. They don't go outside necessarily. The ribbon width is determined by the defect that's already there. And it is what we see. And it's only one nanoparticle thick, and it's a really bad interface. It's it's going from this to this. Right, the at that at that interface, right? The the layers are like this and then below it. The layers are like this, and then below it, that's like this. Very, very sharp and terrible. Yeah. And this is something that I will not show today because I have no time, but I can tell you that I would like to show you some obtain my cost of the picture. We did a new experiment that is not shown here. And this is in relation with what we discussed the first day. In fact, it's not so because. In fact, it's not so because the olytries are very much stabilizing because of the particles, they are only oligarchs. But in fact, here there is a structure which we call, you see it, large trips. So in fact, we have coexistence of two structures in our system. And we are able, we have made the experiment where we have only large trips by controlling the robbing. And by controlling the robbing, so we control the robbing strengths and we may expect And we may expect a different structure. And this different structure, we expect that it does not have the central effect. And then, as a result, we don't see an oriented network. We have a nectar network in this structure, but it is disoriented. So this is an agreement that it's really the central defect that induces not only the component, but the orientation of the defect. But why is it oriented? In fact, it's not very clear. In fact, it's not very clear because if you see in the bottom, so I think I may have asked the question here. Yes, where does it come from, the fact that it is oriented? And it's a real open question again. And my belief is that the ligament around may interact with the somatic layer below that may guide the network. But when I say that, I don't explain what is the wheel. What is the real molecular phenomenon that may be responsible for that? However, I then expect that the interaction may be controlled by the legal nature. And this is something that we are trying to understand by varying the legal quite now. So I have no answer yet, but this is, I think, reasonable. This is the only reason why I see that. Reason why I see that it could be oriented like that? The Williams and Claymont paper mentioned earlier, I think that's the one where they have the different grade boundary models where it can sort of break or somewhat gradually bend. In fact, if we conduct for the the Clement paper, we f for this defect. This is a work that we are trying to to That we are trying to understand now, we believe that it is really a topological defect because only it's perpendicular, so we really expect some melting of the smell tip locally here, because otherwise we don't understand very well how it can connect. However, here there are very reason to believe that you can refer to the old Clemand paper with some possibility of With some possibility of additional layer and so dislocation that may be localized here. And this would be 1D defect always like all other oriental in this direction. And this is why we believe that we have a large number of 1D defects able to trap a large number of nanoparticles. Yes. So about this problem of the fact that the nanoparticle is particle is actually they are actually thicker than this layer of melted. Have you observed any effect of the temperature of the liquid crystals on banana particle that might somehow make it favorable to people? Not yet, but I would like to add something about your question. In fact, we have compared large, which are not so large, five nanometers, and smaller nanoparticles. Nanometers and smaller nanoparticles of diameter around three and four nanoparticles. And why I find very interesting is that for the small nanoparticles of size that may be expected to be smaller than the defect core, but the optical spectrum is very different. It's very strange. It is anisotropic in the other direction. This is something that we know since very long time, and this is why we have a Saint Courton experiment thirteen November. Experiment 30 November, we absolutely want to precisely study the structure of smaller nanoparticles at the different core. It will be very interesting. But this is an interpretation I'm not fully sure, but almost sure. But what we know, because we did some in the past, some experiment, if the nanoparticle are too large, we can go up to seven nanometers that works, but always it works less. Well, I don't know how to say. So it's really tough. So it's really stabilized for particles around six nanometers. And more interesting, I think, when you have nanorots, it's easier to trap nanowatts, in fact, than nanospheres. And I think it is in quite agreement with the fact that really you gain energy in the dislocation. And really, nanowatts, uh you have the constraint of the size, but not so much. And especially because you don't care about their length, because it's always parallel to to the cold. Parallel to the gold. So I think I may have no time, but I would like just to show you. I could have shown you the result for the fluorescent rods that are also localized and form. I just show you the picture because it's a beautiful picture. You see, you form ribbons, very well oriented. Sorry, sometimes we present the rod the strap like that, sometimes the straps like that, but they are the same stripes. But they are the same stripes. This is just a sample which is rotated. And we can measure the polarization of light emitted by these ribbons, and we obtain that it is thin-oriented. That tells us that rods in these 2D defects are, in average, oriented again, parallel to the defect for this specific fluorescent rod. And not as well oriented than the change in the change. Here you have the case of the change, so you case of. Have the case of the change, so you get of the 1D defect, which is very well oriented. But anyway, you preserve an orientation. Oh! Ah, yes, something you did. I just wanted to show you a last thing. Not you, somebody did that yesterday, no? I pushed a button that I should not have done. No, okay. Well, just what I want to show you is that, okay. Is that okay? So we have in fact this model that Bohemet showed yesterday, where here there is some disorder, here it is very well augmented. This is a model that we gained from this observation. But we have also another phenomenon that is interesting very much that we study right now is the fact that when you study these fluorescent ribbons, you can follow and observe some data. Follow and observe some dynamics, which is very strange. I just wanted to show you how to do that. Here, I think. Yes. Do you see? This is a small ribbon in the 2D defect. And it jumps. So there is a dynamic. I just wanted to tell you there is a dynamic. Just wanted to tell you: there is a dynamic of this nano-hole assemblies within the 2D defect. And of course, when you come close to the fast transition, you still have more dynamics. Sometimes you have the assembly that just make a very long travel. You can understand because the size of of the defect I think increases. But there are really questions to understand this very specific dynamics within the defects. Dynamics within the defects. And this also could be an interesting thing to study. Thank you very much. We do have a few minutes if there are any more questions. How mono-dispersed are your nanoparticles? So the size dispersity, are they all really precisely a specific size or is there a spread or? A spread or? In fact, I cannot tell you I work with chemists because, of course, this is not our job at all. So they form quite beautiful nanoparticles. But I must say that it's a question anyway, because in fact it's not so easy to form these ribbons. I think it's quite easy to form the chains. If you have a bad quality of the nanoparticle, it becomes Of the nanoparticle, it becomes difficult to form the ribots. And we worked with a chemist which made very beautiful nanoparticles, and then we have ribots everywhere. You see, so the question of the polydispersity that you say is probably an issue. Yeah, because I wonder if you have, like, say, rods of a longer aspect ratio mixed with rods of a shorter aspect ratio, if some of them would want to locate only within the lines, or some of them would want to locate within the winds or lines. Would want to locate with other women's organizations? In fact, it's a very good question because we have a very large number of projects. And of course, what I expect is that depending on their size, I will prefer some defect or some other defect. And this is now we are going to the situation where we want to study mixed system with well-defined to see if there is a preference depending on the size and so on. Because I claim that the 1D defect are more favorable than the 2D defect. We are sure it is true for the. 2D defect. We are showing this true for the nanosphere. But for the nano hots, for very, very small concentration, I showed you it's true. But very rapidly, the hots get taught in the 2D defect. At least, this is our preliminary result. So, the choice between the two defects depends on the size and probably shape of nanoparticle. And this is a very interesting issue that we would like to study. That we would like to study. And this should be true also for the different types of one G defects. So, this is exactly what works. And it's kind of interesting why they would also separate by size because they're not. It could be a way to have a mold. I think it's no, I know, I forgot, a way to put some size in one defect and the other ones and to separate them. Yeah, but is it because of elasticity that that would happen? Or, right? I think because if we compare the different one defects, then. If we compare the different 1D defects, there are different size for the core. So, really, we expect the large core and especially the discrimination to accept more easily the large nanoparticle and the dislocation to accept more easily the small one. And why I am almost sure that there are dislocations of small size, it is because in the chains I showed you, you can obtain a very small coupling, so nanoparticles are. Coupling, so nanoparticles are pushed. So it means that the size of six nano vectors can be anyway larger than some of the defects that are present here. So when I put a lot of nanoparticles, in fact we did a paper for suggesting this, we expect the largest defect to be filled first and then the smallest one. And this may be why we have a large width of absorption with all possibilities. Absorption with all possibilities, this is really why what we need, and this is in agreement with some of the research. Did you try focal connectomenes at the same time with focal connectomers? And one more question: How do you know your oil speaks about focal connection? Hello. I answer first to the second question, which is easier. We really are fully sure that we have Are fully sure that we have only one symmetry in one dimension because X result shows that there is a rotation in this direction. And if you remember the result shown by Jean Deudieu, when you move the mu angle, so you move the emicylander in this direction with respect to the X-ray beam, and there is a maximum very well defined. And there is a maximum, very well defined maximum, which tells you that the orientation of the rotating layers is very well defined along the direction of the M-cylinder. This is for sure. And the superposition with the calculation of MUBRA confirms that, because the calculation MUBRA has been made with a model of MECI Landon. So it's a purpose, so it works. However, this job that we observe. Job that we observe suggests that there are equilibrium positions along the M-cylinder, so subjects that may not be fully straight and possibly slightly disordered with some periodicity. This is a gesture. This is very indirect. But bioptical microscopy and so on cannot see it, but there is most probably something. And for focalcogniti. And for focal colleague, just to say, I don't do that, but there are a number of people like you who did that, and there are also, I will go to a PhD jury in Bordeaux in December, but there are difficulties. It's difficult. For the reasons that you say, there are not a lot of defects. The density is low. Thank you, Manuel.
