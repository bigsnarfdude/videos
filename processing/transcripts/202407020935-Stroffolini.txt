All right, our next talk will be given by the US. Our next talk will be given by Bianca Strocolini from Napoli and Putzburg. Thank you very much for the invitation. I have a written disclaimer that maybe what I'm going to present is based on mathematical proof, but beyond there are some motivations and in particular something that is related also to the talk of Giacomo, who was presented yesterday. Was presenting yesterday a model for semantics and he was explaining why VDIS continued problem appear. So what I'm going to talk about is contained in a paper together with Federico Pasquale, who's here, and it was And he was postdoc with me under this project, StarBlues, University of Naples. And it is about some free discontinuity problem with manifold constraint. And on top of that, there is also some additional requirements that is you will see in a moment. Okay, so the outline of our talk will be about FIDS contributing problems that Continuity problems that appeared yesterday in the talk of Dr. I will state some more results about regularity issue. I will introduce something about the variable exponent and in a moment you will see why. And I will talk about Soboleph approximation and I will state our regularity result and if permit I will sketch some proof. Proof. Okay, so in order to convince you that the variable exponent is important in application, I will refer to this paper of Chen, Levin and Rao. They were facing the problem of image registration. So here you can see three pictures. The first one is the image with the noise. The second one is the reconstruction. The second one is the reconstruction of the image based on the so-called TB book-based diffusion, that is, taking P equals 1 and the elastic energy, and the corresponding space of function is the space of PV function. The next, this is good where the gradient is sufficiently large, so for example at ages, and so there are And so there are a jump going on. Here you see the reconstruction using the model isotropic 1 equals 0. And the last one instead is a reconstruction using some exponent that is tuned accordingly to the damage of the image. So this was the first So this was the first I mean for practical application the first paper was suggesting to use for in for application this so-called parable exponent approach. So what are three discontinuities? So basically they were meant for image segmentation problem. There is Problem. There is the Dana School of the Giorgi, Cabiero Riasha and Broso Fusco Vallara. Then there are many others also, not from Italy, but this book is a kind of reference for all you want to say about there are also quite recent applications in the fracture mechanics. Francor Mariko, here you Francfour and Maricot, here you can see. Imagine that you have a body and you have stretched the body, so then some crack will occur inside the body, but at the beginning you don't know where the crack will occur. So, to model either this image segmentation or the structure mechanics problem, you need to deal with the function. To deal with the function that could jump. And so you need to consider a free energy that consists of two terms. In the fracture mechanics, you take a bulk volumetric energy and an interfacial energy corresponding to the surface of discontinuity. Whereas in the image segmentation problem that I present. Segmentation problem that I presented before, you have basically instead you are working in the plane, so you are dealing with the back energy that is defined in the plane and an interfacial energy that occurs along lines. But here, so as I was saying before, we have to leave the so-called setting and work in the this space of even better spaces. Even better spaces. And here I will for the first time. So it appears this variable exponent px. Psi is the gradient variable. So you prescribed for the bulk energy this kind of behavior with respect to the gradient variable. Here, gradient u is the approximate gradient because you are. The gradient because you are dealing with the space of function that the jumps, and SU is the jump set. But in a moment, okay, this is the you can see here the definition of SBB2 function. So you have here a function that would jump, you have a You have a distributional derivative with no counterpart. This is referred to the S, that means special, no counterpart. The absolutely continuous part, or in the geometric measure theory, you can also define the approximate gradient, is the derivative with respect to the peg measure, is a square integrable, so y here is the two here, apparently here. Here, a pyramid here, and there is a jump set that in the planar region simply consists of lines. And this set is rectifiable, means that the auster dimension of SU is less than plus infinity. And almost everywhere at the points of this jump set, there is a well-defined normal, and from both sides of the normal, there are u plus. There are u plus and q minus. So the jump occurs along the normal of the jump set. Then this is the approximate gradient is defined outside of the jump set and the integral of this to the power 2 is less than plus 3. So this is the definition. Yeah. That's what that's what is the counterpart? The counterpart is the Path is no, there is no canto path here because the spaces, space, spatial bounded variation mean that there is no cant of path. I'm asking from a place of ignorance, what does canto part mean? So you can that you have this random measure. The cant of part refers to this measure. So this function, so the function u, so you define the So you define the the okay this is a radon measure so you can split the radon measure into for example in the plane the absolutely continuous path despect to L2 plus the j path despect D and restricted to also H So, each one is fitted to the jump set plus the counterpart for the measure. So, you have a measure, so you decompose the measure into. So, this means that it's like some, okay, could be concentrated or a set of countermeasures. So, this is the counter file. Okay. So here is the energy. So we have the, as I was saying before, so let us stick for a moment to the space of special bounded variation with the p power. So here this is the energy, the elastic energy, and here is the energy and here is the Hn minus one measure of the jump set intercept the set A and the question are how regular are local minimizers of this function so in particular for example this is a particular example related to the talk of Giacomo here Giacomo was considering this so-called bibliotic function defined on function defined on the jump set. Here we put phi equals to one, so we have only the measure of the jump set. So the question is how regular our local minimizer and what we can say about the jump set is. So in our case we are substituting P with the variable exponent and the target space with the m a compact manifold m. The reason for that will be clear later on. So, first of all, what are known results? The Giorgi Carrero Liashi in the Scalar case showed that the jump set is essentially closed, meaning that it cannot be spread in the whole set omega. And so the Hn minus one measure of. One measure of omega intercept the closure minus assume is equal to zero. And then outside this set, the closure of this set, you can look basically the function behaves like a so-called function. So you can relate the regularity outside this singular set as the regularity of a pi harmonic function. So U is C one alpha for every alpha less than one. Alpha for AB alpha less than 1. Instead, for vectorial case, also there are results of Cariro Liage, either for unconstrained vectorial case and to values max with values in sphere. Then there is some extension to variable exponent in the scalar case, but in all cases they are using a Poincaré inequality together with the truth. Truncation. So, our approach instead is based on the Sobolef approximation. So, instead of truncating the function and use some quarter-fold, something that relates the function to the scalar one, we are using the SOWERF approximation. So, we think that also from a practical application this this could be uh more useful. So Useful. So this is again the back energy that you can see here. This kind of connection. And why this? There are recent papers that maybe I have quoted later on in which they are studying electrological liquid crystals. Heterological liquid crystal in microchannel. So they are assuming some kind of heterogeneous behavior of the back energy depending on the point varying in the subset V or omega or this is. So this are some references concerning variable exponent space. Variable exponent spaces, so NPX and the Sovoli space. There is a Russian school, Sharakudinov, Kovachik Rakovnik. There are two recent books, Giningarine, Asyluska and Kutsurib and Firenza. And then Cheikov has contributed in the eighties to the study of variational integral with a piece called the non-standard growth. This is called the non-standard growth concern homogenization problem. So, there are some results about regularity killing in the Sobolev case due to Chikov, Koshaminjon, and Sharpin Minjone, application to electrological fluid by Lucishka, Ranjokova Eluchiska, and there is this book of Gikov Kausolov Olenić. And then there are some really And then there are some relations with integral representation and gamma convergence of variational integral, still in the sopholes case. Related to instead to the P V function, as I was saying, there are models in image restoration, this article or channel in a row. Then there is a gamma convergence result in quality to astrolog and all polluters. There is a a a lower semicontinuity result. Lower semicontinuity result, and there are this paper that I was mentioning before, but all these papers are using this truncation argument. Okay, let's give some at least some recall what we need about this variable exponent space. To start To start with, we are only assuming that P is a measurable function, but you will see in a moment that maybe this is too weak. So you have the P plus, P minus, so the essential to supersension if, but and then you can define for the measurable function this the modular. This terminology is kept from all its sets. Setting. So you take the integral of u to the power px, this is not the number, but if p plus is less than infinity, then the space L P consists exactly of a measurable function for which the modular is less than plus three. So we uh I will not define the norm, but because for uh for our purpose we don't need For our purpose, we don't need to. And you can define the space of, again, space of special, so with the no-counter part bounded variation with the exponent px. And this space is the space that comes when you are dealing with problems in fracture mechanics. In fractural mechanics, so with small strain elasticity, so you need to replace the accurate symmetric gradient with only the part, the symmetrized part. And then you need some condition that is here. So basically, you need to formulate you take a direction, then you take all points that are orthogonal to this. That are orthogonal to this direction. You take the function restricted to the line starting from y and you require that this projection is a function of bounded variation. And then you have this, in a sense, we are using some quarter formula. So you integrate all this function that depends only on one variable along. On one variable along this omega xi, and you require that these are bounded by a unique radon measure L Y. Why this space? Because originally the Sompolef approximation was proven by Proni Focardi and Urlano, limited to the two dimension for this space in order to prove the existence of. Prove the existence of a strong min-master for Griffith fracture. So the origin of this is for the Griffith fracture. Then there are other contributions, always in two dimensions. And there is this recent paper of Kagnetti-Schambol and Scardia for three dimensions. So the key idea n equals to, I repeat again. equals to I repeat again so you start locally so you consider a ball and you assume that the jump set of this function u is smaller compared to the radius of the ball. Then you can prove that there exists a sample function in a smaller ball. So you have this ball be row Be rho, then you have a smaller ball of radius s rho. Here you define this function w. Outside, w is equal to u and you require that there is this function is better because it's sobo inside and coincides with you outside, so it has less jump and also. It has less jump, and also the approximate gradient is controlled by the approximate gradient of the starting function. But to be more precise, this is the statement. So, the key points in the statement is this eta here. This is a universal constant. Yes. Just a question about the notation on the previous slide. What is that? Curve and less than are equal in. Only what? This this one? The curve is less than or equal, yeah. This is uh so controlled by some constant. Just like so, so when I use this, means that there is some constant here. So it's like so equal with the sun constant approximately. Sorry, I'm not using that. No, no, so maybe I shouldn't say so. So, the key point here is this eta. So, basically, what you can get in two dimensions is you can construct an approximation using a control geometry. The control geometry is hidden in this constant here. This is not possible in three-dimensional. So, this is why we are confining ourselves in two-dimensional. ourselves in two dimensions. So k is the dimension of the target space. So you first start with a borel set containing the ball bit to R that whose measure is smaller with this is exactly the same constant compared to the radius of the pole. Then you select a radius in such a way that In such a way that whenever U is SBDP and is such that differs this the jump set differs from this by a set of measures zero you can construct a pieceforce affine function in a smaller ball and that coincide with you outside in which way you select this radius row is radius uh row is selected in such a way that the doesn't carry the boundary of the ball doesn't carry points of the jump set. So this is the key estimate. So you need that on this on the boundary of this ball the jump set as no the h1 of s u intersect the boundary is equal to zero. Then you have Then you have what you expect. So the approximate gradient of this piece of frame function is controlled by constant, by the approximate gradient of the starting function u. You have an average measure in L1 given in terms of the total variation of u. Then, as I was saying, if u is equal to u outside the Equal to u outside this small ball, and also the just set of this approximation doesn't intersect the boundary of this good ball. And also, you have this condition. So, you need, in principle, to require that u is in any field. But so, remember that we want to apply this. So, this result was the one of confidence. So this result was the one of Conte Focardiolano. We want to apply this result choosing a target, not a K, but a compact manifold. So for us, this condition will not be too heavy because in principle you will have values in a compact manifold. So this is the construction. So you construct a triangular geometric Triangular geometric grid, as I was saying before. So, first you start with a bored set. So, you choose this good radius, but not only you need to require this condition, that I was saying before, that J intersect the boundary, the H1 measure is equal to zero, but also that every time you take a circular annuli of this triangular. Annuli of this triangulation. The quantity of J in this circular annuli is exactly controlled by the radius r over 2 over h. So you need a quantified control jumping from one circular annuli to another. So this also is not possible in higher dimension. In higher dimensions. So we were able to construct a closed Borel set, essentially closed, in such a way that in three dimensions H2 of this set was small, but this condition was not verified. So that means that if you want to reproduce the same construction, Reproduce the simple structure in dimension three, this is not possible. In fact, the Sokolev approximation I was mentioning before of a Cagnetic Schambolska idea is not true under this condition. So you could, in principle, exclude you you should exclude a set with a small H two measure, but not verify the this condition. Verify this condition that H2 measure is important zero. The second step, so this is the grid starting from a bore set J, we call this grid G'. Then the second step is to adjust this grid to the function U. So you take So you take uh U in S B V uh P such that the jump set is basically the same as J, then you deform G' in such a way that the vertices are like points. On each edge of G u is W11, is defined on a segment, so you use a fundamental theorem in calculus, and then you have that the And then you have that the value of U at the vertices is close to the local average, and as I was saying before, the geometry of the grid is universally bounded. That means that you control in this construction, triangular construction, the ages and the angles of the grid. Then you define the piece. Find the piece was a fine interpolation between the vertices of the grid G. And then you have this estimate. So Ct is some convex envelope of something. I will here. But so this is done locally. Then you have to cover the set omega with the family of balls in such a way. In such a way that these balls are intersecting at most side times, so there is a finite intersection between balls. So you control with the discountable family if you enlarge a little bit the measure at the perimeter of also the jump set. And then you have the same kind of inequalities now, not on the ball, but on the wall. Not on the ball but on the whole set omega. So, what expect. Okay, so what's new with respect to our result? We are considering instead of P Px and we are dealing with the manifold constraint, compact connected Riemannian manifold. So, the motivation, as I was saying before. The motivation, as I was saying before, this is the paper I was mentioning before. So, there is an application of electrological liquid crystal in microchannel for medical application. And so, you can think of this kind of variational model for complex material: Q is a quotensor, F is the Landard Design potential. Dart the gen potential, L is the one elastic constant, and if you consider QL the minimizer of this functional, then in the small elastic constant regime, this QL will converge to constraint minimizer, M is the vacuum manifold, so the contra image of zero, and to this function F. So you will end up in you will end up in minimizer of this so here this px and here is the junk set okay so this is the statement of our partial regularity theorem we are for the partial regularity theorem we are considering not a general manifold but General manifold, but the sphere s k minus 1. Omega again is a planar region, so you take u local minimas of the function I was showing you before. So the function is integral of the gradient of the approximate gradient u px px plus h1 of s u intercept omega. And we need to assume more on the variable exponent Px. We need to assume this is called the strong logo continuity. So, in pre so first of all, P should be continuous, but also the modules of continuity omega is this the models. Omega is this the modulus continuity of px should go to zero multiplied by log one over r is this limit should be equal to zero. This is useful as I will see later because we need to blow up something some we need to argue by contradiction to blow up some quantities and so some quantity will go to the Some quantity will go to zero exactly under this condition. So if you assume that P is strong, order continuous and P plus, remember P plus was the upper supremum of the sponge Px, then the jump set is essentially cruised. And then if you add some more structure, so this is related to the To the second result, as I was saying before, after you have proved that the jump set is essentially closed, basically you can transfer the same regularity of the soboli space to this or to minimizer of this function. So the theorem that I was staying before concerns. That I was saying before concern the regularity of W1PX harmonic max with the values in the stimulus one. So this theorem was proven by the Philippis and she was assuming that P is C0α for some alpha and then she was able to prove that minimizing the harmonic mass are partially regular. Are partially regular, so that means that there is a set contained outside the jump set in our case such that, and an exponent beta, such that u is c1 beta outside is in this in the set omega 0, so outside the jump set. And she was able also to give an estimate of the asteroid dimension. Of the asteroid dimension of the singular set. Okay, so as I was saying before, to prove that the jump set is essentially bounded, you need a density lower bound. So you need to prove that there is okay, you are proving locally. So you take a pole, then you take the amount of The amount of jump set contained in a ball, you say that if you are able to prove that it is the density lower bound, this corresponds to the fact that each one of these is equal to zero. So, the typical procedure is the blow-up argument, so the argument of a contradiction. And so, there are some new features. Some new phenomena appearing. So, in principle, we are dealing with this PX variable exponent. So, there is no fixed homogeneity. So, you need to find a procedure in order to scale map in the block procedure, because you are dealing with variable exponents. And then, the second question is that we are considering map with the values in With the values in s minus one, so we need to find preserve the local minimality, and so this is the definition of local minimizer. So, you take any competitors such that the measure, the set where the two are different, is contained in omega minus the jump set. The jump set. Okay, before even try to do the sketch of the proof, I would like to highlight the logo continuity that is weaker than the strong log order continuity. Loger continuity corresponds to say that this limit log 1 over rho is less than plus infinity. Is less than plus in. So our result for the Sobolev approximation is attained under this weaker condition. The geometrical meaning is this one that there exists a constant such that the oscillation is controlled by this is the definition that I was presenting here by C. Here by C and the minus the logarithm x minus y. The geometric meaning is due to last dealing. P is correspond, so these two are equivalent. P is local, the continuous, and locally for every ball, the measure of the ball raised to this exponent, so p minus minus p plus b. Minus P plus. B means that you are computing the essential inf, at the essential soup only on the pool. So this spoiled is in principle is negative. This measure is controlled by this constant C. So this means that if the log order continuity, if you assume log order continuity, Assume logo that continuity, you can freeze the variable exponent on a small ball around the point. So, this is crucial when you would like to deal with the blow-up methods. So, this was the original estimate due to Conti Focanti Urlano. This is our estimate. And you can see here that it's worse in the sense that here the constant. That here, the constant appears exactly one plus the square of the radius of the ball. So these two are the same. And here we don't have the norm in LPX, but instead we have the maximum between the two norms in the lower exponent and the upper exponent. This, okay, for the variable. Okay, for the variable exponent, instead with the manifold constraint, I will state that the result only targets the sphere. So you need to use to, you are able, this result is contained in the paper of card and lean and was also refined in a paper of Canevari Orlando. They were living. Lando, they were dealing with the lifting problems. So you need you can find a K-man's two-poly closed set and ellipsis retraction in such a way that this inequality holds, but you cannot reach the exponent 2. And so, in our case, we need to. In our case, we need to assume that the largest spawn P plus should be less than 2. This is due to topological observation. So, okay, so this is the maybe, okay, I can this is the definition. So, we need to define the infimum, but so we have three parameters. Three parameters: the function, the set, and the parameter t. So, what is the meaning of t? We are taking the infimum of this functional, of v in SPV lock, such that this v are assuming values in the sphere of radius t. And then we compute the deviation from minimality. Okay, maybe I will. Okay, maybe I will jump okay, you can easily got this estimate, but the key estimate is the density lower bound here. And maybe I can so this is the how to prove the density lower bound. You can prove this by contradiction. So you take a point in a sector. In a set that is inside omega. So here is omega. Omega delta is the set with delta distance from the boundary of omega. Then by contradiction, you take a sequence converging to x0, a sequence of epsilon h going to zero, such that the functional on this The functional on this sphere this ball v z by h that is converging to zero is small. The deviation also is small. While if you take a tau that is less than one, if you are going in the in you f you are computing the functional in a smaller ball, the condition this condition here is valuated. Is valuated. So this is the argument by contradiction. So we are first, so we have this sequence of point convergent to x0, then we have sigma h at the radius of the pole V sigma h and we are We are considering the translated map. So we are changing variable, putting y in the ball of radius one, xh plus sigma h y, but you don't you not only you need to change the function, but you need only also to change the exponent. So you need to. So you need to change the exponent to translate also the exponent with y in v1. In this way, so you have the estimate by contradiction that the function on this sigma h was mole This was the assumption of some epsilon H signature. When you change a variable, you have for the translated map an upper bound and also for the jump side. Why we put here this th? th because th is blowing up so the function the sequence pH are taking values in balls that in some sense are inflating so the th is going to plus infinity so in the end in the end what we expect is that the limiting map will have values in a in a hypertinent. So In a hypertrophy. So, this is a demonstration. So, okay, this is some scalar quantity regarding the homogeneity. I was saying before. So, if you consider this scaling and you put this constant here, you have exactly the same compactness argument for pH and also for the deviation from minimality, and again you. Minimality, and again you have this same contradiction argument. So, in order to prove that these variable exponents are converging to a fixed exponent px0 and also that this quantity here is going uniformly to one, you need the strongholder continuity. So, if you are able to prove this, then you can Then you can get again that this is controlled by something going to zero. Then, in this is the place where we are using the Sokolev approximation. So, we use the Sokolev approximation for the skis, for the translated map. Then, the Sokolev approximation multiplied by th. By th is the same that works for the function dh. Then we show that this Sobolev function converges with some Sobolev function with the fixed exponent px0 with values in an effect plate. And then we need to prove that this function w is a local minimizer is a local minimizer of the Tx0 energy with respect to compact support perturbation. When we are after this, we can infer a contradiction with the classical L infinity L1 estimate for Px0 at Montefunction. So summary, so if P is constant, we were able to prove in this case able to prove in this case to provide another proof of the result of Carielo Leaci based on Sobolf approximation. One point that still remains open is to extend the blow-up analysis to more general targets since our result of sopolate approximation holds for a general compact manifold. Another question is to reduce the loss of exponent Reduce the loss of exponent in the Sobolev approximation and maybe extend the Sobolef approximation to higher dimensions or to curve targets. But in this result, as I was saying before, you cannot reproduce the same construction. And again, you don't have the hope to have that the H2 of the measure of the jump set interceptable will be equal. Intercept the ball will be equal to zero. Thank you for your attention. We have time for a couple of questions. Yeah. Thank you very much for your very nice talk. I was just wondering about your sobble approximation. Yeah. Even just a scalar version. If I understood correctly, you're just using If I understood correctly, you're just using a fine extension of the transformation. Yes, yes. No, but for us, the key point is that we don't have the, so we have a vectorial and manifold constant. Maybe if you want to do it in Scala, maybe this is the result that I was mentioning before of Leone, Schiller, and Solomono. And it's okay, in some sense, it's easier than the one we. Sense is easier than the one with the vectorial and the manifold sense. I was wondering about the construction because I was thinking about look house extension and so on. And the thing that people seem to, as far as I understand, seem to do in these contexts is that on lower dimensional simplexes they do a fine interpolation or some sort of reprojection of the words and then you and then on higher dimensional things they extend homogeneously. Homogeneously. Yeah, but really, you don't have the homogeneity. This is the problem. No, no, homogeneously in the sense that like by radio reprojection. Yeah, but maybe this could be a problem because we are also dealing with the display X homogeneity. I'm not sure that this radial extension will be still in the right space. Okay. So in the interest of time, I think. Sorry, in the interest of time, I think we should continue that discussion during the coffee break. Let's have funniest questions that we have an announcement by Carla. There's one more question. My understanding of P of X is that in a way, it represents the kind of rigidity of the material. The material set P goes from one other boundary and two. On the boundary and two. I wonder whether you could prove by using your technique that, for example, the singular set, if B goes from one to two coming inside, the singular set is more inhibited to reach the value. Yeah, yeah. Can you prove that? Yeah, the singular set, yes, you if in fact we we are proving that, yeah, in the sense we are choosing the radius. Choosing the radius and such is good radius that cannot reach the boundary. So the junk such is inside. Yeah. This depends presumably on the way the exponent grows as you enter the main. Yeah, yeah, I think so. Yes. Yeah, you're right. So tonight at 7:30, 7:30 to 8:30. 7:30, 7:30 to 8:30. We're going to have the first of the two panels that we will for the workshop. And this panel is called Interdisciplinary Research and Professional Networks. So, of course, it's young researchers, but we really need everybody here. Okay, so there will be basically two topics.
