Can people on Zoom hear me okay? Yes, we can. Okay, great. Thanks, Ian. So, hi, I'm Thomas Vitavek. Uh, right now, I'm a postdoc at Brandeis University with Benjamin Rogers, but today I'm going to be telling you about some work I did with Sid Nagel back kind of following up on Irmgard's work back at the University of Chicago. And so, one of the systems we've been really interested in there over in the lab is the viscous fingering instability, right? Viscous fingering instability, right? So I'm sure many of you have seen this type of instability before. I'm just going to play a movie of it for you, right? But this type of fluid instability makes its beautiful types of patterns, right? And this is a nice kind of model system that people like to look at because this is a system that exhibits Laplacian growth, which is a common type of growth scheme seen across many systems. And one of the reasons this is so nice to study is because it's a really simple experimental setup. A really simple experimental setup, right? And so, what we saw in this movie here is kind of a top-down view of this Healy-Shaw system, which is just two large flat glass plates with a thin spacer between them. And then you just have some tubes going into it, injecting fluid. That was this kind of dark line that we saw here at the beginning of the movie. And we'll fill this with a high-viscosity fluid and then inject a low-viscosity fluid into it afterwards. And so, this is a system that has been looked at for quite a long time. That has been looked at for quite a long time, right? And for a while, people were very interested in looking at the kind of most unstable wavelength, the critical wavelength of the system. And so back in the late 50s, when people first started looking at this, they looked at mostly immiscible fluids because of oil recovery reasons. And they saw that the critical wavelength is this number that basically depends on the capillary number of the system, right? Your surface tension, the viscosity difference, how fast you're injecting your fluid. And a lot of people then became interested. And a lot of people then became interested in what kind of happens to this system when you try and take this wavelength to zero, right? You want to know what happens when you make this thing as unstable as possible. And so there's some really nice work that came out of Harry Swinney groups trying to get to this limit by just injecting really quickly and having a large difference in viscosity. And our group in Sid's lab was interested in how do you, what kind of happens when instead of trying What kind of happens when instead of trying to force the viscous dissipation, right? You want that to be really, sorry. You want to know what happens instead of trying to make things go really fast, you want to know what happens when you try and make the surface tension really small, right? And so one way to do this is by instead of using immiscible fluids, you try and use miscible ones instead. And so Irmgard kind of took this up to begin with. And what we can do is we can. With and what we can do is we can just kind of do one viscous fingering experiment here where you fix your two viscosities and your plate spacing with immiscible fluids. And you can just ask, what happens now if I do this with just miscible fluids, right? So I keep the two viscosities the same, gap spacing the same, injection rate the same. And what ends up happening is this very surprising feature where instead of this thing becoming extremely unstable, right, we thought the wavelength was going to go to zero. Instead, you get complete stability. Right, and so this is kind of a puzzle for us. And part of the reason this happened here, you might notice that the viscosity ratio I have put on the side over here, right, is a specific number. And so what Erngart had looked at in our lab is kind of what happens when you vary the viscosity ratio between the two fluids. And for remissible fluids, you get this nice kind of change in the overall length scale of the pattern. In the overall length scale of the pattern, how large these fingers are, right? When your inner fluid is much smaller than your outer fluid, you get these very long finger structures. But as you take the ratio of your viscosities towards one, you get these kinds of smaller, stubbier fingers. But if you do the same type of sweep with miscible fluids, right, you see very branched patterns kind of in this low viscosity ratio limit. But as you approach, Ratio limit. But as you approach one, you actually get this region of stability right near viscosity ratio one, but it doesn't actually happen at one, right? There seems to be some region of unfavorable viscosity contrast where you have suppression of this instability. And so this is what I was interested in kind of pursuing. Why is this region of stability there? And so to talk about this, I'm going to show you kind of a measurement of some properties of this instability at onset. Properties of this instability at onset to see if we can kind of learn what about the system is driving the stability. And then I'll show you two experimental ways to try and play around with the system near this stability point. And so to learn about what is driving the stability for miscible fluids, what I'm going to focus on is a property of the instability, the onset radius. So if we look at how these patterns evolve, when you first inject this fluid, When you first inject this fluid, you have some stable propagation, right? This thing is growing out as a circle, and then some finite radius, you'll then see fingers start to appear at the outer edge, right? And so this is a length scale inherent in the problem where there seems to be a finite onset point for this thing. It's not unstable from the beginning. And so what we can do is we can look at how this onset radius changes with the viscosity ratio for our miscible fluids. For our miscible fluids. So here's a plot of our measured onset radius as a function of the ratio of our viscosities, right? We saw before in that kind of sweep suite of images, right, that this thing looked very slightly more stable. And that's captured here as well, where we see this kind of dramatic increase in this onset radius. Yes. Benny has a question. So, this is for a given velocity. So this is for a given velocity or given flux right? Yeah, so we're in a limit where we're kind of at low Reynolds number, but diffusion isn't important. And so this kind of onset radius seems to be independent of your injection rate if you're in that kind of ratio. Just there must be some dimensionless ratio that it must be the radius over something. So. Oh, yeah. So I. Oh, yeah. So I'm just trying to avoid. Yeah, it's the radius over the gap space. Okay. Okay. Yeah. But then, as long as your flow rate isn't super fast where you're getting inertial, then it's pretty constant. Okay. And so we have this kind of onset radius measurement, and we can see that this thing looks like it's starting to diverge, not near one, right, which is what we saw in our images before. But we can ask, you know, since this is a property right near the beginning of the instability, maybe. The beginning of the instability, maybe the kind of linear stability analyses that people have already done can capture this kind of feature already. And so there are a few different ones you can choose. There's the most basic one that Patterson developed for radial cells, just looking at kind of Darcy's law. And then there's some other ones here, which account for viscous stresses, either normal to the interface or tangential to it, which kind of captured a saturation of the wavelength that people saw. A saturation of the wavelength that people saw at higher capillary number. But when you try and calculate what this onset radius is for various theories, they basically all tell you that really it should be diverging at a viscosity ratio of one rather than at this kind of lower value of one of around a half or 0.3 that we've been seeing. And so, how are we going to try and, what are we going to look at in the system to understand what's causing this shift? And one feature that's very important is that since our fluids Is that since our fluids are miscible, there's no surface tension that's driving the inner fluid to really fill the gap, right? And so here are two images kind of in the unstable regime and in the stable regime. And what I've done is I've just taken a cross-section of these things here. You can kind of map the intensity you see of these patterns to a thickness of your inner fluid. And so these are what the cross sections of these two. Of these two patterns look like. And what we see is that in the regime here where you're unstable, it really looks like you have a very flat, blunt structure right at the interface. Whereas in the stable regime, it's looking more rounded, right? And one thing to keep in mind with these two images here is that the scale bars are quite different. Right here, this is a scale of one gap spacing, but this is over hundreds, right? And so if we just zoom in on the tips. So, if we just zoom in on the tips of these two things, what we see is that very quickly in this kind of unstable regime, you go from having no inner fluid to having some kind of fixed height here. Yes, I am. So, so when you go to miscible fluids, the first thing you say, oh, we're going to zero surface tension, but of course, you're sort of replacing the capillary length. Of replacing the capillary length with the diffusion lengths. That's right. Yeah. Okay, that's coming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So we're gonna play with the diffusion soon. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But yeah, so at still high, high injection rates, right, you can still think about this diffusive layer as being rather thin. But yes, we'll certainly play with that soon. But the point here is just that it seems like the really big difference here is that the kind of jump in the viscosity contrast you have right at the interface is. Have right at the interface is what's changing here. And so we can kind of keep this in mind and go back to kind of how people had formulated our Darcy's law from before, which was driving the flow in this gap, right? And so just as a reminder, Darcy's law, you're taking the kind of Poissoy flow that you would expect in a gap like this. You average over the dimension, this small dimension, because you think it couldn't possibly be relevant, and you get that the velocity is proportional to a pressure gradient. Pressure gradient. But what we just saw is that you really have some structure within this small length scale. And so instead of just having a single fluid right near the interface, you have more of this kind of stratification of fluids where your outer fluid is wetted to the walls. And then this lower viscosity fluid is forming a tongue in the middle. And so if now you have this kind of stepwise parabolic profile, you can modify, you can then average over this kind of stratified structure. This kind of stratified structure instead. And what we're going to get is we're going to get a modification of this mobility term in Darcy's law. And effectively, you get some expression here that depends on this thickness and the viscosity ratio. And it effectively just is something that's changing your effective inner fluid viscosity at the interface. And so now we have this challenge of we're kind of shifting the problem over to now what's the thickness of this inner fluid tongue? Of this inner fluid tongue, and so in experiment, we can go and we can do experiment, we can run this at many different viscosity ratios, we can just try and measure what's this jump in thickness that we have right at the interface over a range of viscosity ratios. And what we find is that kind of what we saw before, parallel to what we saw with the onset, is that as you approach one, you get this sudden drop off in the thickness. And so now, if we take this value for the If we take this value for the tongue thickness, we reincorporate this into our kind of the linear stability analyses, we get a much better agreement with this onset radius. And so, what we're seeing is that really this jump in thickness and the properties of this inner fluid structure seem to be really important for kind of predicting the onset to this branching instability. And so now we can go back to Anne's question and we can think about what are, yeah. In the previous slide, can you explain again what are the two curves now on the right, the green and the dashed one? So, this is what they correspond to. This dashed line, which kind of the bear theory, where we just assume that both fluids are fully occupying the height of the gap. And then this green line that we're doing here is now we're just taking into account the fact that we have some. Some fraction of the gap. But both of them are based on linear stability analysis. That's right. That's right. Of the flat of the circular structure. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. And so now being an experimental... Oh, sorry. And the profiles, the velocity profiles, you've guessed before integrating them for measured, or how did you formulate that? You formulate that? Yeah, so this is a guess, right? Certainly, when you're probably when if you're within like a plate spacing of the tip, you're going to have to have some recirculatory flow. It's not going to be just Pusoi, but a little bit away from the tip or in front of it, it's probably still a Poisoi type flow. But we don't have a direct measurement of that. Okay. And so Okay. And so being an experimentalist, we want to ask how can we kind of probe this structure? And so we thought about two different ways of doing this. One is kind of taking a passive approach where we let diffusion now smear out this interface. Maybe we'll see something interesting if we do that. And I'll give you a kind of teaser about some ongoing work where you can actively try and perturb this structure by shearing this Healy Shaw cell. But these two kind of approaches are probing what's the importance of. Are probing what's the importance of kind of the gradient of your viscosity contrast right at your interface. And the other one is, you know, how big of a jump you're having? How do these things impact your onset? And so to start off with diffusion, right, what we can do is at kind of higher injection rates, what you've already seen, right, you have this kind of initial growth followed by the development of fingers. And then our intuition is that, right, if the kind of contrast of this tip was important. The contrast of this tip was important. If we slow down, we should see this system stabilize. So, if you reduce your injection rate by a factor of 10, this is somewhat promising, right? It looks like this thing is just growing circularly. But then if you really want to check to see what's going on, you think you're really understanding the system, you should continue slowing down. And surprisingly, you find a re-emergence of fingering as you allow diffusion to become more important again. And so, this was pretty weird. And so, this was pretty weird. We didn't know why this is going on. So, we want to explore why there's this kind of transition in the patterns. And so, if you look at what these two things look like at high and low speeds, you can actually start seeing that the morphology of these two patterns are quite different, right? At these high injection rates, you have these short, stubby fingers. And you can kind of see, I hope you can see that along here, right, there's a gradient in the intensity, right, which was because of this change. Which was because of this change in the structure. But when we go to low enough speeds, we start to see a more uniform coloration, signifying that this thing is really filling the gap more, right? So here are two cross-sections of what's going on inside the gap. And so to study this a bit more closely, what's going on here, we're going to look at two different measurements of this thing. We have a question. In the previous slide, can you clarify the gray? The previous slide, can you clarify the gray scale? So there seems to be, if I go along that red line at four o'clock, it seems to be it's gray or dark gray, jumps down suddenly to a light gray, and then the further down. So is that, am I seeing that right? Just looking at your image. Oh, you mean right around here? No, the image on the right at four o'clock. Yeah, yeah. If I just follow along the red. Yeah, so it's not a smooth jump. Yeah, you can kind of see that here. So I think what. Can kind of see that here. So, I think what's going on is that kind of early on, you're still moving somewhat quickly. And so, at early times, you form a little bit of three-dimensional structure. But then as you get further out, things start to diffuse and the gap fills more. And it seems like this kind of layer at the front is kind of a memory of this kind of faster injection rate near the beginning. Because the pattern formed in the bulk. Formed in the bulk, in the format interface. Yeah, so we can look at that movie again. What Anne's pointing out is that these fingers, if I kind of stop it around here, you can see you have this kind of nice, almost circular region on the outside, and then these things are forming in here. And so, if we kind of look at this, the thickness here, I think what's going on is that you've kind of fully filled the gap back here and then. Filled the gap back here, and then this part is now going unstable rather than this region at the front. Yeah, and so what are the fluids? I know what fluids are. Oh, my mistake. Sorry. So these are the question was, what are the fluids? So I'm using just mixtures of water and glycerol here. And so we're going to measure two things about this instability. One of them is the growth rate. One of them is the growth rate of fingers, right? We want to see do the growth of things slow down as you approach this kind of stability point. And so we can just measure the finger length of these patterns as a function of time, kind of extract this linear growth regime from it. And the other thing is that this, our friend, this onset radius from before. And so I'll begin by showing you what happens with the growth rate, right? So we can take a single pair of fluids and we'll start at kind of high, high injection rates where we saw these. Injection rates, where we saw these patterns. And as you progressively slow down your system, what we find is that these fingers will grow at slower and slower rates. All right, so this just this drop off here. And then as you go to this kind of low regime, as you slow down more and more, surprisingly, the fingers seem to grow relatively faster. This is a dimensionless growth rate. So it's a function of the pattern size rather than time, but they seem to become more and more unstable as you slow down. More unstable as you slow down. And then right in the middle is where we saw this kind of stable point. And so this is just a single pair of fluids, but we can do this for a whole bunch of fluids at a fixed viscosity ratio, and we get this kind of mess. But then if you, as we all like to do, if you take an appropriate dimensionless number here, the Peclet number, the ratio of advection to diffusion, we get a fairly nice collapse of this type of data. And so what we see here. And so, what we see here is that you're really getting a suppression of fingering right near this transition point. But if we look at the onset radius for this thing instead, we also see this kind of dramatic behavior at a transition number, right? So at higher injection rates, higher Peckling number, we kind of have a constant onset radius, which was related to your question from before. Whereas once we're to this lower regime, we see this kind of falling off of onset radius. So it starts by. Falling off of onserious. So it starts by fingering rather late and then does it early and early in time. Sorry, Thomas, can I ask a question from the online? Yes, please maybe. So you're mentioning that you expect things, I mean, that the two mechanisms are suppressing each other where they meet in the phase map here. Is it true that they are, in fact, suppressing one another, or in the case where the growth The case where the growth rate is almost equal for the both, if you essentially still have a growth rate, and so what happens if you just keep injecting the liquid infinite time, do you expect to see still one sort of instability or do you expect this to stay stable? That's a great question. So I think really what's going on here is that right near this transition, this is really a critical peckling. This is really a critical Peclet number that induces stability for this high regime. And then, yeah, I do think what I'll show you soon is that this other lower Peclet regime is really related to an onset time, which is what you were getting at. And so I think if I had let my patterns evolve for longer, you might see this kind of extension of this onset radius maybe transfer up here, right? So you might initially see one pattern and then it evolve into this other regime at a later time. So then. Time. So then, like, if we do it for later time, do you have any insight about which pattern we should be expecting where the growth rate of both are almost similar? I think you would get this lower Peclet regime pattern, right? Okay. And I'll get to why I see it. I see. Okay, great. Thank you. Oh, we have a question from. Just I think to follow up a little bit on this discussion. Up a little bit on this discussion. So, this is only the same fixed gap, right? You don't change the gap size. So, for this one, you can actually things will rescale with the gap as well. So, you're sure about it? Did you measure it? So, namely, because you know, this I like to see phase diagrams like this, I'd like to see them with dimensionless groups on the axis. So, Peclet number is definitely dimensionless, and your claim is that. Dimensionless, and your claim is that the dimensionless axis is really totally separate from the velocity or anything, it's just the radius over the gap. So that's how we should seek the vertical axis. Yeah, yeah. So this one here, this is the radius over the gap. This growth rate, I've defined it as it's the outer radius. This is dimensionless. Yeah, yeah. Okay, that's no problem. No problem. Okay. It's something like that. Okay. But yeah, we'll have another dimensionless number that will describe this in just a moment. Yeah. And so and so now that we see this kind of transition between two morphologies, we can ask kind of what's driving the emergence of this lower Peclet regime, and then what was kind of inducing this initial stability in the system for this high Peclet regime at this critical Peclet number. Critical Peclet number. And so, to answer this first question, we're going to go back to looking at this onset radius. And we'll keep in mind that what's going on is you're seeing a transition in this inner fluid structure from having a tongue in the middle to being more filled, right? And so this makes us think about, you know, some diffusive length scale is probably important. And so instead of looking at an onset radius, we can now instead think about some kind of dimensionless onset time, right? Because we're interested in. Right, because we're interested in when this fluid is kind of really washing out any structure that's going on, and so we can replot this as this dimensionless onset time versus onset radius. And what we see is that, right, this high Peclet regime, that's just this set of data points here. But then this kind of lower Peclet regime is really always just being described by the same dimensionless onset time, which is around order one, right? And so, what this is telling us is that. And so, what this is telling us is that this low Peclet regime morphology happens once your food interface has diffused enough to really cross the gap. So you're kind of erasing any sense of there being structure in there, right? And one thing that this seems related to is if we were to look at what emissible fluids would look like, right? So if we had an emissible experiment, right, the cross-section there is just this plug flow that fully fills. This plug flow that fully fills the gap. And we can see that this kind of concentration profile is becoming very reminiscent of this. And a consequence of that is actually that this kind of low Peclet morphology is unstable all the way up to a viscosity ratio of one instead of a half or something like that. So this system is really much more related to this kind of immiscible type of case. And then the other question I posed is, why is this thing becoming stable in the first place? Becoming stable in the first place when you slow down. And so, what we can do is we can kind of sit at a single radius for these patterns and ask what does the tip profile look like for these things as we progressively decrease our Peclet number, right? And so what I'm trying to get across here is that this is the tip structure for an experiment that was at this Peclet number, right? At this Peclet number. And so as you kind of slow down your experiment, You kind of slow down your experiment, but you stay in this kind of constant onset radius regime, we get this self-similar shape the whole time, right? So we always have this kind of sudden jump in the viscosity contrast at the tip. But as you slow down and you start to get into this regime where it's now stable, you can start to see slight alterations here at the tip. This thing looks like it's starting to get a bit of a slope. And eventually, this tip structure here gets kind of fully washed out, right? So it seems like what's going on is that. Right, so it seems like what's going on is that slight amounts of diffusion are enough to smear out this viscosity contrast, and that seems to be enough to stabilize this system. And I think this is also related to why this kind of Kudokopele number, I hadn't mentioned it before, but this is around 700, right? This is kind of a large number. It's not at order one. I think that's because this, the length scale in this was the gap, whereas probably the relevant length scale is how much I really have to. The relevant length scales, how much I really have to smear this inner facial structure to make it stable, right? Cool. So, this is it about this kind of diffusive regime, right? We saw that you really only had to mess with the structure a little bit to stabilize these high injection rate patterns. And then a teaser for this other half for this shear case. What we want to do, or what's going on in Sidlab, is to study. Is two students, Zhao Ning and Samar over here, are kind of following up on this. And we're looking at now if we think this tip shape is important, maybe if you perturb it in some way while you're injecting, you can induce stabilization. So I'm just going to show you a movie from this kind of translational case. So this is what goes on. We've seen this before, where you just inject normally. But now what we're going to do is we're going to take the top plate of this cell and we're going to oscillate it back and forth slightly. Slightly. And what we see is that we can actually kind of delay the onset of this instability a bit. And we're still trying to figure out exactly what's going on here, but it seems like kind of a cool mechanism for delaying onset controlling this instability bit. And so that's it. But I just wanted to show you, right? We kind of honed in that this kind of inter in this gap. This kind of interaction seems to actually be really critical for this miscible instability. And it opens up kind of new routes to kind of perturbing in some way and trying to play around with stabilization for this system. But I think one kind of open question still is, right, we're kind of seeing that this kind of sharp jump, this very blunt structure was important. But one thing that I'm still confused about is why this blunt structure seems to go away at a viscosity ratio less than one. Viscosity ratio less than one. I'm not entirely sure if people understand why that's happening, but something I'm curious about. Thank you. I built one of these things as an undergraduate experiment, and I could never get the capillary number small enough. I guess all your experiments are done really slowly, so the capillary number is small. Is that right? The capillary number is small for all these experiments. For the miscible fluids? For the miscible ones. So it's slow. I guess it's the capillary number is the speed over surface tension. So it's really large capillary number. Large. Right? But there's no surface tension in these cases. Oh, okay. Yeah. But yeah. But yeah, I was going to say that even when you have immiscible fluids, there's a great big thick layer left on the plates after the thing advances, and that's usually left out of every model. Yeah, yeah. So for the immiscible case, you don't want to go too fast. You still have to go, I don't know, millimeters per second when you're advancing things. But one thing that's interesting, I didn't show it here, but if you then try and go really quickly, you can actually get. Similar, somewhat similar-looking inner fluid structures there, and you'll start to see shifts in onset radius as you go faster. I just wanted to a comment is because you're saying you're wondering about these changes in structure. And I wonder if it's some, you probably know about this, but some related work in by Dominique Salon in the late 9th. It wasn't, yeah, maybe Legioness. It wasn't, yeah, maybe Legionesso, but somebody was a really conflicted name, I can't remember. Yeah, who looked at and they basically looked at the streamlines because it has something to do with the stagnation point ahead of the finger and some inversion in the circulation flow that leads to the difference between the blunt and the other tip. And I think it was studied partially, at least, but not in helio shawl cells, but in Healy short cells, but in the in narrow channels in the 90s. I know there was for the Healy shock case, people were looking at something called a kinematic wave theory. They were looking at some lubrication theory of the flow in the gap, and they saw some kind of shock front there. But maybe it's easier to just do this. But if so, so just on this slide here, at least in terms of this shock case. Shock case. This dotted line here is what they kind of predicted for what the thickness of this jump should, this blunt, blunt thing should be. And it seems to be a bit different than what we're seeing experimentally. But yeah, I'd be interested in following up on this reference. Actually, your sketch of the cross-section kind of reminded me of the Brett Aton problem when you push a liquid plug and you look and people are interested about this. People are interested about the thickness of the film that you leave behind the play. And I was wondering if you will try the, I mean, if you try the experiment in YouTube, or you're not expecting any Cephantela, what will give the thickness of the viscous film that you push with a non-viscous one admissible? Yeah, so if you look at this kind of yeah, I think Taylor did these types of experiments a long time ago, and that's actually. Experiments a long time ago. And that's actually, they didn't really go to this kind of higher viscosity ratio regime. They were working down here, but it saturates to around this value of 0.58 or something. I think it was non-miscible in the... For that case, it was for immiscible fluids. But I think people have done this for miscible, but I don't recall. I don't know either. Just a container advantage of having the microphone next to me. I have a question on, I really like the idea. I have a question. I really like the idea that you move the upper plate. On one of your drawings, I think you had the rotation. Did you try rotating instead of oscillating? Yeah, so we were also looking at this because one thing that puzzled us for the translational case here, if I just play this movie again, is that I guess this argument for disrupting the tip structure only really works in the direction of the tip. Exactly. Yeah. So rotation might be quite different. But we also see it's like really suppressed in this direction, right? In this direction, right? And so it seems like what rotation is doing right now is just kind of killing the smallest wavelength modes from being able to grow, right? If I'm shearing so that the arc length is kind of the size of the mode that it wants to make, I'm now disrupting that and it transitions to a higher. It could even smear out actively, actually, your fingers, maybe, you know, because you would mix your fingers. Yeah, so it seems to make the wavelength larger, even as you're actively shearing it. But yeah, that's we're still. Sharing it. But yeah, that's we're still that part's still confusing to us. Hi. This is a bit more general, but I was curious when I saw the patterns, whether someone has done experiments where you have one liquid into another, and between both liquids, there's something like an elastic membrane to see how this kind of elastic or mechanical character would affect the fingering. Yeah, that's an interesting question. I'm not aware of people that have done. Not aware of people that have done a membrane, but something related to that is work by Sung Young Lee, who unfortunately couldn't be here at this conference, but she did this beautiful work where you put particles into the inner fluid, and then because of something called cheer-induced migration, they end up traveling to the interface, and then you see buckling of like a particle film that forms at the interface there. So that's probably somewhat related to that, but I'm not sure about actual membranes there. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Sure, very last question. I was wondering, so if you when so basically you see two instabilities now, that's what you argue. There is one in the large peculiar and one in the small peculiar number, which are totally distinct, right? I mean, nature. And if I understand correctly, the one for the tiny fingers that you see, what Imgard, I think, saw first in this case were. In this case, well, these are explained by linear stability analysis once you modify, once you include the viscosity ratio, yeah, so it seems like the onset point there is being captured well with linear stability analysis. Yeah. Even though the structure that grows does not seem to show much thin soidality, but nevertheless, you think this is a linear stability. But what about the other instability? Is it obvious that it's described by linear stability analysis? So I think initially when people were looking at diffusion in miscible fluids, they were trying to describe that lower regime. So they have some expectation for the wavelength now scaling with the Peclet number. I think we just didn't get to low enough Peclet numbers to see that type of thing because our wavelength was pretty constant. But there is really a linear stability analysis in the Low Peclet of the Of the show predicts some non-trivial wavelengths, which depends on. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
