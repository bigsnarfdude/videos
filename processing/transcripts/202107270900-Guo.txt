Okay, so all right, so I guess we can start our morning session for today. So the first speaker of the morning is Yan Guo from Brown University. And he's done a lot of really interesting work in kinetic theory and plasma physics for many years. For many years, so I'm very excited to hear what he's going to say about the stability of contact lines in fluids. So please, please take it away. Thank you. Thank you, Jacob. Yeah. So first of all, I'd like to thank the organizing committee for the kind invitation. I'd like to thank also the nice introduction of Jacob. So today, I'd like to report some recent progresses in the study of In the study of stability of contact lines in fluids. So there are basically two examples of contact lines. One example is, say, a coffee, coffee in a coffee cup, coffee in a coffee cup. This is one situation. So in other words, you have fluids in a vessel. Fluids in a vessel. So, this is the first situation, which I will speak, discuss this case throughout most of the talk. And then the second situation is a droplet, right? Droplet of fluids, say a droplet of water on a flat surface, say on a table. So also contact line occurs in that situation. Occurs in that situation. So I will briefly mention this droplet case at the end of my talk. So let's focus on the case when we are in the situation of a vessel. So let's consider, let's say, a cup of coffee. So this is a cup of coffee like this. Like this. The most important feature of the problem here is we look at so-called contact line. Contact line exactly is the coffee, where coffee meets with the mark, right, with the coffee cup. That's the line we call the contact line. So if you watch carefully, then you can see that one of the main features of this problem is if you look. Of this problem is if you look at the angle, angle between the surface, blue is the surface on the top, right? And with the wall of the coffee cup, the angle usually is not 90 degrees. You see, there is a distinct angle. Okay, it's a little bit hard to see in this picture, but from experience, you can see, or simply just a cup of water, we can see. Water, we can see the angle here. In general, not 90 degrees, right? In general, not 90 degrees. So this line here in these pictures are points, right? These lines are called contact lines. And this angle are called contact angle. So contact lines and contact angles, in particular, the contact angle. And compact angle, in particular, the compact angle plays a very important role in this problem. So the motivation of studying this type of problem has twofold. Well, one is certainly this type of problem is very important in many physical applications. The second reason is. The second reason is actually mathematically, this is a very generic setup to understand. So you see here, usually we call the upper surface of the coffee a free surface, a free surface. So whenever you have a problem involving a free surface of a fluid, and then when the surface meets with a solid wall. Meet with a solid wall. In general, you will have a contact line and also contact angle. So, this is a very, very generic setup. So, mathematically, it's very important to understand. So, we are going to focus mainly on the 2D problem, 2D problem. So, in other words, we're only going to study the problem. Study the problem in 2D, so then we always look at the cross-section of the coffee cup construction. So, indeed, we can formulate, we can formulate as follows. We have a vessel in R2 and the top. How free surface can be parameterized by these two variables. Y1 is the horizontal one, and then Y2 is the vertical variable. Vertical variable, vertical variable. So the free surface on the top is given by y2 equal to zeta, zeta of function of pn y1. And the contact line now is only 1D. So this is a so the surface is 1D. So the line now is only a point. So the compound really is a point, which is exactly. is a point which is exactly the value. So y1 is going from negative l to l so then the point really is characterized by this two functions in t function in t so this is sometimes also called triple junction triple junction triple junction so this is the geometric setup and we are going to consider And we are going to consider a viscous fluid. So, since we're considering the problem with surface tension, as well as the size of the problem, we're having a coffee cup or sometimes a very thin vessel. So, usually, the viscosity plays an important role. Also, when the size of the object is relatively small, then the Relatively small, then the surface tension effect is also crucial, right? The surface tension effect actually gives rise to the angle, right? Angle of the contact line. So certainly that's the crucial part of this problem. So we are going to consider a viscous fluid, which is described by the Nevierstose equation. So also we're going to consider the surface tension effect on the free surface. On a free surface, this is a setup. So, if fluids, we all know that you have the stress tensor mentions given by this. So, this is a setup of problem, setup of the problem. So, before going to the full model, so let's recall the steady stationary case. In other words, let's consider the situation, the equilibrium. The equilibrium situation, right? So, in other words, when the flu is not moving, the coffee is just steady. This actually is a very classical problem, a very classical problem. This is the underlying geometry of the surface, pre-surface, is called capillary surface. So, now we don't have the moving part, right? So, the velocity is zero because it's a station. zero because it's a stationary so um so we now in this case we only have the configuration to figure out configuration configuration so we're going to assume the surface tension on the free surface upper free surface so then there is a standard way to formulate this problem okay as a variational problem as a variational problem uh Problem to determine the shape of the free surface. So, here, actually, turns out in order to write down the so-called free energy, free energy. So, we need to know the physical property of the solid vapor and solid-fluid interaction. So, there are some physical parameters. Physical parameter, we're going to just focus. So, sigma here is the strength of the surface tension effect. Then this is standard from physics literature. So, then in order to figure out the free surface, which is denoted by zeta, right? Zeta is the free surface. Zeta is the free surface, well as the zeta evaluated at L, right? It at L right, X1, Y1 equal to L, or minus L is the contact line or point, right? So this is the physical free energy, right? So as you can see, except for this term, this is a G is the gravity. Okay, we are always including the gravity effect, which is actually quite important. So sigma here is the surface tank. Sigma here is the surface tension, right? So, this is a standard functional as in the minimum surface, right? Minimum surface. And this is something new. This is something new, which is given by the fact that we'll have a contact point, wall interaction. So now we try to do the original problem. So we solve the Of the equation, the equilibrium state for this capillary surface. As you can see, the main part of the equation is similar to the minimum surface equation. So you have this mean curvature, mean curvature operator. So this is similar to the minimum surface equation. Minimum surface equation. The only difference is the boundary condition. The main difference is the boundary condition exactly given by this. Since here you have basically free moving point. So there's no Dirichling boundary condition force this end of the free surface. So this is the Neumann type of boundary condition we can imagine when we do our original boundary. When you do the original problem, so this is the equation 1D. This is the equation 1D, and this is a well-known actually. This gives rise to the angle we observe exactly due to this. This is a certainly coming, this part is coming from the mean curvature part coming from this function, well-to-variation. And this part is coming from here. So this determines. Yeah, so this determines the angle, angle, the contact angle. So, indeed, this is such a classical problem. So, Laplace, Los, and Yang, they all study this problem. And they figure out the contact angle. And the contact angle has this formula. This is a very famous formula, right? This is called Young's relation. So, the contact angle is given by this quotient. This is a Potion: This is a related to the surface tension, in fact, and this is a physical quantity, right? Physical quantity, physical quantity. Uh, turns out this is always the absolute value always less than one. Okay, so this is the cosine always makes sense. So, this is the case of a steady problem, steady problem, which is a we can say is extremely classical, extremely classical, which Extreme classical, which actually gives rise the understanding of the steady case, right? So you have this configuration. The most important thing is this angle. This angle. This angle, the presence of this angle makes sure, I mean, this is certainly what we observe in real life, right? But also it poses mathematical challenges because we know for Because we know for Stokes' problem, for instance, right? Stokes problem, in essence, is a fourth-order elliptic equation. So we know for a Stokes problem, when you are in a cornered domain, corner domain, then the regularity, right? The regularity really remains a severe difficulty in general. So, in particular, when this angle is pretty big. is a pretty big right near say pi right you will have this like this right if you'll have the if you have the angle is going like this right so so it's almost parallel right parallel to the uh the wall so then the regularity is really really weak you can only get maybe just each one each one so this is a steady problem it's a well-known problem so we would like to see problem so we would like to study certainly the dynamical uh stability that's uh relate relates to the uh dynamical problem so for the dynamic problem uh it turns out surprisingly this is uh still a active research uh area even in physics uh the reason uh i think there are several reasons i think one of the reasons is because of this uh uh triple Because of this triple junction, some people believe we might, there maybe new physics need to be introduced in addition to classical fluid model. Some people use so-called phase field models to study this problem. So of course, we can also use a classical fluid model, right? So this is done recently. So this is done recently, in recent years, I would say, by Wienan We and King Wen Ren. So we are going to study a classical fluid model in this context. The motivation is since there are a lot of different models, but so far there's no rigorous PDE. No rigorous PDE justification, for instance, the local well-posedness of any of the models so far. So, until our work. So, our motivations are these in the classical setting of a fluid fluid model, we try to show well positions. This is the motivation. So, even though there are a lot of different models, but there is one thing which is a thing which is uh uh which is uh common in all these models which is the uh dynamics of the contact angle so you can do experiments right measure those uh measurements so this is a one of the key key law experimental law if you wish okay but this law can also if you're can also be formally derived from let's say uh rational mechanics right Rational mechanics, right? If you can try to within the context of hydrodynamics. So this law basically says there's a relation, relation between the velocity of the contact line or contact point in our context. So this is a relationship between this velocity as well. Velocity as well. This is more or less the angle. This is more or less the contact angle. So there is a relation between these two, where W is some experimental functions. Usually depends on particular nature of the fluid, particular nature of the fluid. But the most important feature of this function is one The argument is zero, it's always zero, as well as when w prime. Okay, if you take a derivative here, it's always bigger than zero. For instance, this will be one example of this kind of function. So you have certain monotonicity of this function at zero. So let me try to convince you why this is necessary. Uh necessary. This is never well this is a necessary because when we are in the situation situation of a steady uh steady flow, right? When we have a steady flow, then certainly the contact line or contact point does not move, right? Does not move. So this velocity should be zero. Okay, so so then w of zero should be equal to the contact angle, right? Contact angle, so-called, yeah, uh, in the uh In the static case, in the static case. But if we go back, so this is sorry, this is the contact angle. So if we go back to the Young's law, you see this is exactly zero. This is exactly the zero in the steady case, in the steady case. That's basically the Young's law. So Um, yeah, so in other words, uh, when this is zero, this has to be zero because we knew for the steady case, the right-hand side is zero. That's the basic Young's law. That's the boundary condition. That's the boundary condition derived from the free energy. Free energy for the steady case. So, this is a this is very natural. This has to be zero, and this is a And this is only from the experimental data. So let me just try to illustrate what is the meaning of that. So the meaning of that is, so the red thing is the equilibrium contact angle, equilibrium contact angle. So now when the covey or that is moving, It's moving right. So, suppose your angle is through this distance, right? It's this position. In other words, the angle here is bigger than very powerful. So, then the velocity is going down. So, that's the interpretation of this sign condition. Of this sign condition w prime at a zero bigger than zero. One situation. The second situation is if we are in this situation, so this is the equilibrium angle, right? Equilibrium angle. And then if my fluid is moving above, okay, above this point. So then the velocity, velocity has to go. So that's the So that's the interpretation interpretation of this uh all right so now we will we are going to write down the full fluid model the full fluid model is uh actually it's a very simple yeah very simple uh it's just this particular uh dynamic law for the contact point or The law for the contact points or contact line plus usual free boundary conditions for Navier Souls equation. So, in other words, when we have a cup of coffee, then on the upper free surface track, we have this standard balance law, balance law for Balance law for the surface tension with the related surface tension with the nemissels with the nemersotte the pressure and the velocity. So this is a standard. This is a standard. Standard. This is a standard free boundary condition for the upper free surface. And on the side of a wall, we impose the Navier boundary condition. Those are all classical. On the top, it's just a standard free boundary conditions. And then we also impose the standard, right? This is the kinematic boundary condition. So everything is standard. Everything is standard. Everything is standard. Everything is standard except for the contact point or contact line. So we impose additional. This is the law given by the pyramid. So that's the problem they're studying. So our goal is to try to see whether or not we have local posts and we're even in our Uh, local proposal, or even in our case, we can show global stability within this model, uh, global stability for the steady states. Right, the steady states are given by Gauss and Yang of people. So, that's the problem. That's the problem we try to set up. So, I would like to uh I would like to uh I like to try to illustrate the importance of the sign, the W, right, the sign, the monotonicity condition in terms of the energy dissipation, energy dissipation mechanism. So let's just try to compute the standard energy, standard energy. So when we compute the usual never source energy, then we... Never shows energy, then we see this is the free energy, study free energy. And then there's a one term, all the others are similar, right? Similar to the usual free boundary value problem, except there's a new contribution at contact point, right? Got a contact point up here, right? And this exactly takes the form of this. You see, this is a very much related to the Very much relate to the dynamical law we have. So we want to have this as a good sign in order to have energy dissipation. So this is when we try to do a pure estimate at least. We notice that, of course, if this is identically zero, or this is identical zero, and obviously this term is dropped. This term is dropped off. So at least the whole thing has a good sign. At least the whole thing has a good sign, just like the usual Navy Stokes problem, Navy Stove problem, without the contact line. So this, the first case is equivalent to say that actually the contact line is not moving. Contact line is not moving. But the velocity is always zero. The second one would say the contact angle, you remember? The contact angle, right? Remember, this is the contact angle, right? This is the constant thing, and this is the angle. The contact angle, so that the last one drops out. So, as a matter of fact, this situation was studied by Schweizer a long time ago, 100 years ago. So, he studied the case when we have a fixed contact angle. Exactly 90 degree, not only fixed, but 90 degree. But 90 degrees. When you have 90 degrees, then you can invoke a lot of 90 degrees very special. You can invoke a lot of regularity theory. So, in this particular case, you can solve the problem. Of course, these two scenarios are not really coincide with the experimental observation. So, of course, if you look at here, you see that both the lines and angles. Lines and angles are changing in general. So, the general boundary condition, the dynamical law of the contact point, if we rewrite this, this exactly will be this point. So, recall this exactly is our W, right, W of this. So, the condition that W prime at the zero is bigger than zero, right? 0 is bigger than 0. This means that let's just take w to be exactly the function, it's the linear function, let's say z. So then this exactly will be square. That will be square. So this exactly give you a good sign. That will give you a good sign. In general, when we're dealing with a small data problem, in other words, this is small. So this is dictated, the sign of this is dictated as. The sign of this is dictated when this is very small, zero, near zero. So you can see clearly when this is very small, this will behave exactly like et zeta squared. So indeed, we have a good sign. Okay, we'll have a good sign. So since we're doing stability analysis, these are very small. The quantity, the deviation from the steady case, presumably to be very small. So these are. Presumably to be very small, so these are small quantities. So clearly, for us, as long as W has this sign condition, it doesn't really matter what the specific form of W is. For our problem, you know, we always have a good sign. So this is our starting point. This is our starting point, at least at the zeroth-order energy level, we have the expected energy dissipation. Energy dissipation, energy dissipation. Here, actually, we have some dissipation at the point at the contact clock. So, this is the starting point. This is the starting point. So, now we try to do mathematics. So, we try to reformulate this problem so that we can apply mathematical tools to solve the problem. To solve a problem. So here we are using a geometric formulation for studying pre-boundary value problems developed by Ian Teis myself. So this is a way to study the free boundary value problem by using a somehow By using a somehow a hybrid formulation between the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulation. So the key thing is that you make so-called harmonic extension. Try to avoid a loss of half a derivative in general. So if you're not so careful with the extension, usually you could end up losing half a derivative, which would be crucial mathematically. Mathematically. So you do some possible extension, extension, and then you reformulate the problem in the fixed domain. However, you still try to retain the fluid or geometric property of the problem. So then you rewrite the problem, but you try to keep this a geometric form, right? So this is a, it depends on the varying. It depends on the varying domain. So you try to keep track, you try to keep track of this similar to covariant derivatives, like covariant derivatives. So then you try to estimate them in a combined form in some way. So then you try to recover the real fluid quantity. Real fluid quantity in the Eulerian format, for instance. So you try not to break the estimate. So the good thing about this, of course, in free boundary value problems, usually you have to fix the domain. You have to fix the domain. Otherwise, it's hard to consider differences of functions. Differences of functions. On the other hand, physical domain, if you're not so careful, sometimes you can introduce some bad terms in analysis. By keeping this form, geometric form, somehow you try to minimize such a presence of the unwanted terms due to transformation, basically. So, this is a reformulation. So, now I'll try to say the theorem. Okay, the theorem. So, our main working function space is this so-called tangential energy dissipation rate. So, these are just functions. These are the functions when you take only temporal derivative, time derivative. derivative so those are the basic quantities we try to uh we try to uh uh to start to uh to estimate so uh eta here is the uh perturbation of the free surface right perturbation of the free surface u is the velocity u is the velocity so this is the um uh the energy we call the energy and here is the dissipation dissipation Here is the dissipation, dissipation. Notice this is the usual dissipation, usual dissipation. And this is the dissipation from the free surface. And here is the dissipation from the contact line. So these are very similar to the structure of the zeros-order energy estimate. Zeros order energy. You just take up more time. So, this is the most important thing. Norms we can control. This is the starting point. And then, in order to close, we have to use elliptic estimate to get more spatial estimate based on this tangential, sorry, this temporal control. So, this I won't go through. This is quite complicated. So, those are the quantity we could control via this. Okay, via this temporal control of the energy and also dissipation. Okay, so this here we're trying to use elliptic theory, elliptic theory, try to get a control. Turns out it's quite elaborate and turns out those are sufficient to close the program. So the main result basically says asymptotic stability result. Stability result. Okay, so assume initially the energy, the energy is small. So then we have or we have the aperior estimate. The aperio estimate is exactly like what you expect with too high order. So here the D and E include all the original temporal derivatives as well as those secondary spatial derivatives you can bound. Derivatives you can bound based on those temporal derivatives via elliptic estimate. So this is the R result. I want to make some comments. First of all, there is no restriction on the angle, right? No restriction on the angle. So as I said, when this angle, when this angle is so large, So obtuse, right? So if this is the angle is larger, for instance, almost almost go up to the wall, parallel to the wall. So in other words, it's almost high, almost high. If you come, if you'll come this way. Very, very hard. So yeah, in that case, we know the regularity gain is almost only H1, right? For Neville Stokes. or near stokes but um even in that case we can uh we can control we can we can control that of course our estimate uh our estimate uh blow up when the angle uh approach to pi uh approach to this uh singular situation singular situation okay so this is uncommon okay so actually uh we know that Actually, we know that for water, usually the angle is less than 10 over 2, something like this. But for, for instance, a mercury, we know from experience, we know that the angle usually is bigger than that. It really depends. The angle really depends on the physical property of the fluid. For us, there's no restriction. there's no restriction no restriction for the steady okay for the steady uh configuration okay for the steady configuration you know it's always strictly i mean any angle will be fine of course when we do perturbation this is really tiny right tiny perturbation so that ensures you know uh even perturbed uh uh perturbed angle still will you know stay close So, mathematically, the key difficulty is the presence of the corners. So, this certainly is a low regularity, as I said before, but also when we try to estimate by using vector field method, so this presents a severe difficulty. So, usually, what you do is you'll So, usually, what you do is you try to apply vector fields which preserve the equation as well as the boundary condition. So, that's usually the general philosophy. So, then you apply such vector field, which more or less will be similar to the zeros-order energy. So, then this is a way so that we can try to bootstrap to higher-order regularity. But in this case, one by one. Uh, in this case, one will have a corner, then you can see that there's no spatial vector field you can use which preserves the geometry. Geometry, there's no way. See, the tangential vector, if you're away from the corner, it's fine. But at the corner, everything breaks down. So the only vector field which is basically preserving, which is preserving the structure. Which is preserving the structure is the temporal derivative, temporal derivative. You will take the time derivative, more or less the equation as well as the boundary conditions, at least to the leading order, at least to the leading order, they are more or less the same. So this is the only starting point you can work with by the energy method. So this is indeed what you do. So the first thing you do. So, the first thing you do is you apply those temporal derivatives. Temporal derivatives. You can only apply temporary at this stage. So, then this you have more or less similar structures of the energy dissipation as the zeros order estimate. Of course, you have a nonlinearity, right? You have a nonlinearity. So, the key thing is whether or not you can control the nonlinearity by the following estimate. In other words, the words the full power of the dissipation as well as a half power of the energy. If you have this estimate, then you see for energy small enough, I can absorb this to the left hand side. So then I get global bounds, global bounds for the energy as well as I have a global existence basically. Existence basically and somehow some kind of decay for the dissipation. So, this form of the energy is very this form of the non-linear SM is very important. For instance, if you have different powers of E and D, then you may not be able to get the global resistance. So, this is a very important first thing. So, the question is whether I can estimate nonlinearity this way. Obviously, you cannot because the nonlinearity. Obviously, you cannot because of non-linearity involving spatial derivative, spatial derivative, and these are only involving temporal derivative. So, the key idea or general philosophy is, okay, you try to use the temporal derivative, try to use the ellipticity, you'll try to gain back the spatial control, spatial control. So, in other words, you want to show somehow the general non-linearity is bounded by the parallel and The parallel and E parallel and D parallel via the elliptic acid. So, this is the this is the general framework. So, we have we apply the temporal derivative only, and then we try to close by using elliptic estimate. So, the question is how to use, how to start the elliptic estimate. How to start turns out this is a not Turns out this is not really straightforward. This will have a lot of boundary conditions. It's quite complex. Turns out the right way to view this problem, to view this problem, to gain the ellipticity is through the scheme, following scheme. So, what you should do. So, what you should do when you try to get the elliptic estimates is you first invoke the kinematic boundary condition. So, you start with some estimate for the derivative of eta. Now, when you know some derivative of eta by kinematic boundary condition, then you know you know this moment. You know this one is good. In other words, u dot n is good, more or less. This is by kinematic modeling condition. This is by kinematic modeling condition. Now you use this u.n information, okay, and you skip the you skip the boundary condition relates to the normal direction, normal direction. So then you basically skip the eta part, you know, skip the eta part. You'll use this boundary condition combined with a Combine with some parts, some parts of the free boundary, free surface boundary condition, so that you can get UMP estimate without involving the boundary condition on the superficial radio which is involving the mean curvature of so in other words this step you skip this guy by using the kinematic boundary condition Many boundary conditions. So you can get a full elliptic estimate for the fluids. And then, once you know the fluids, then you use this boundary condition involving the mean curvature operator, you try to gain back the estimate regularity for eta. So, this is the way you gain. This is the way you gain spatial derivatives. You know, you start with some knowledge of the temporal derivative eta, and then you get spatial estimate for the fluids. And then you further use the mean curvature operator to gain the estimate, spatial estimate regularity for it itself. So, this is basically the basic. So, this is basically the basic scheme we're using. So, notice that in this scheme, we're losing one T derivative. We're gaining spatial derivative. However, the price we have to pay is somehow we're losing one T derivative. So, you will go from here to there, right? There's one T derivative less. But because of the nonlinearity, the structure, right? So, this is most of them are sufficient. This is enough. So, what we are doing is. So what we go we are doing is we apply two temporal derivatives in our scheme. So the key starting point would be the temporal derivative, right? Temporal derivative of eta. We need to get this to start. You usually, if you want to use the H theory, right? So in the Hilbert space, you try to use the Space, you try to use the H1 or H2 theory, then more or less the minimum thing you need to have is this guy is in three halves in order to jumpstart the Education estimate. Okay, so this is somehow is more or less needed, three half estimate. So second degree of eta in three half somehow is the key estimate in order for you to start the bootstrap. So, this estimate actually is natural when we consider a simplified problem, which is so-called quasi-static neighbor source model. So in other words, you replace the full nearest source model by dropping the convection derivative time. So you just have the slows for the neighborhood stokes. However, because you're However, because you still have three surveys, it's still a time dynamic problem. Dynamic problem, just this part is a static. So, if you look at this model, so you can see clearly when you take two derivatives, okay, formally speaking, you know that the stress tensor, right? Stress tensor has this property. This is almost good. Then, by the normal choice lemma, you know that this actually bumps up by using once. bump up by using once the the mean curvature operator, you bump this to three halves. So then you can start with the regularity gain for lower derivative, one t derivative. So this is pretty natural. But in the case when we have a full numerous stowes problem, this is a very serious problem because now we know this is a Now we know this is the equal to three degrees level U, which is out of our working space, right? We know we don't have the SB. So, this is the key difficulty why we have stuck with this problem, with this problem for many years. We couldn't figure out how to deal with it. It turns out actually we were able to resolve this difficulty by a Different estimate. So we were able to show you have minus estimate by constructing a new test function. So in essence, why this can work is even though we don't know this guy is bounded. However, we do know three-derivative eta, which is u dot n, two derivative u dot n, somehow will have some control. We'll have some control. So, in essence, we're able to use three derivative. This is a natural control of this. So, we were able to construct a new test function to obtain this minus estimate. And turns out this will be enough for closure. So, in the last remaining two minutes, I will just briefly mention about the droplet problem, the droplet problem, just imagine we have a droplet. Imagine we have a doublet of water or fluid on a free surface on the table, for instance. So, this is a typical situation. So, here we consider the theta here, the angle is less than parable two. So, for the, again, the quasi-static problem, okay, this is a setup. So, when the contact angle is less than power two, there's a physical term called the hydrofold. So, in this case, Ian Tai s and Lei Wu, they were able to prove the stability, prove the stability for the cache, for this simplified model. So, of course, for this model, when we have a tablet, there's a couple of new difficulties. One is that there is a horizontal displacement, which is free, so then you have to. Which is the free, so then you have to try to take into account the possible movement. And then also when the contact angle is bigger than parallel two, this is also called hydrophobic, hydrophobic case. So in this case, there's a problem with formulation of this as a graph. So there are two difficulties. So, there are two difficulties. So, now we are generalizing the quasi-static static problem, this result, to the case of a phone name stoves with the contact angle less than parallel two still. So this is the reason we're doing work with Ian Thais and Lei Wu. We're completing the manuscript. Hopefully, we can report the result. We can report the result in the near future. I think I will stop here. Thank you all so much for your attention. Okay, thank you so much. Does anyone have any questions before I ask mine?
