Thanks to the audience for coming. Everything I'm saying today is joint work with Chen Yu Lu, Josie Mazzoni and Jared Speck. Let me start introducing the main actor of the stall, which are the compressed body equations written here. So the notation is as follows: V is the velocity, rho is the density, and S is the entropy of the fluid. They are all functions of. They are all functions of time and space. Any space for me is always R3, which means I'm going to always be working in three spatial dimensions. B is the material vector field, which is a time derivative plus derivative in the direction of the velocity. And P is the fluid's pressure. So P is a known function of the density and the entropy, known as an equation of state. And which equation of state to choose depends on the state. And which equation of state to choose depends on the nature of the fluid, and usually determined experimentally. So this initial value problem, we're given initial conditions, velocity, density, and entropy at time zero. And it's well known that if the initial data belongs to Agn of sigma naught, sigma naught is the hypersurface of time equal to zero, then the Euler equations are locally well posed if n is greater than five halves. is greater than 5 halves. Strictly speaking, I have not the density, but I have the density at time 0 minus rho bar, and rho bar is a positive constant background density. So this is simply saying that the density approaches a positive constant at infinity, and you need that to prevent this equation from degenerating. So throughout this talk, whenever I talk about the initial density belonging to some AGN, I really mean the initial density minus this background density, which is fixed. Ground density, which is fixed. On the other hand, the Euler equations are U posed if you assume only data in age 2. So it becomes very natural to ask what happens for n between 2 and 5 halves. So that's like the theme of the talk. So let me give a little more background. If you consider fluid, it's irrotational, which means that the curve of the velocity is zero, and isentropic, which means that the And isentropic, which means the entropy is constant. Then the other equations can be written as a system of quasi-linear wave equations in this form. So here phi represents either the density or the velocity, n is some specific nonlinearity, and h is a Lorentz metric that depends on the fluid variables. Then from this quasi-inear system, we can say a few things about the local posiness for the rotational and isentropic Euler equations. Isentropic Euler equations. The next results I'm going to state are, in fact, more generally applied to classes of quasi-linear equations like this, but I'm going to make these statements specifically in the context of the Euler equations. So we start with Bahui-Chamin. We get local opposites for data in 89 over 4 plus. So this is lower than the classical threshold 5 halves plus that I mentioned before. Then we have the work of Daniel that lower the regularity to 13. That lower the regularity to 13 over 6 plus. And this work is, in fact, optimal within linear theory. By linear theory, I mean that all you use is that the coefficients satisfy a certain regularity. You don't use any structural properties of the coefficients. Then this result is optimal. Using some structural properties, in particular due to the fact that the metric itself satisfies a wave equation, Kleimer and Ordniansky have lowered this a little bit further. And then finally, And finally, you have this breakthrough result of this methane rule that lowered the regularity all the way to the optimum value page 2 plus. So this result was reproved later on using different techniques by Wong. So why do I say that this is optimal? Well, because it was already known back to the work of Lindblatt in 98 that you get u posits for these equations if you assume the data only in H2. In age two. That was already known. Now, what is interesting about this result of Lindblot is that the U pause this mechanism is the instantaneous formation of shocks. So this makes a connection between regularity theory and the problem of shocks, which is a problem that is of much interest in the fluids community. There is this connection. Now, and from this point of view, from the point of view of the study of shocks, in this constant In this context, you're not so interested in the full problem of local positions, but you are focused on the a priori estimates. And if you focus on the a priori estimates, then you can ask the following question, without assuming the fluid to be irrotational or isentropic, what is the minimum value of n to close the estimates in Agn? And if you do that, if you can close the estimates in Agn, you are essentially Can close the estimates in HN, you are essentially ruling out the formation of shocks for a small time at least. Because you're controlling for a small time these norms. In other words, you can view this, an a priori estimate, as saying that the time of classical existence depends only on some low regularity norms of the data. So we have the time of classical existence, we want to know what is controlling the time of existence. Well, it's controlling the time of existence. And if you can close the estimates using some global regularity norm, you're controlling the time of existence by that data. And that's the point of view we're going to take here. So let me move on and state the theorem. So here is our result. Consider a smooth solution to the compressed body equations, and assume that the data satisfies the following assumptions for some real numbers n between 2 and 5 halves, which from now on I'm going to. 5 halves, which from now on I'm going to write as 2 plus epsilon. Alpha, which is a number between 0 and 1, d, which is going to depend on epsilon alpha, and some epsilon, c1, c2, and c3. First, we assume that the density, the velocity, and the current of the velocity belong to age 2 plus epsilon at time 0, and the entropy belongs to age 3 plus epsilon at time 0. Then there are some variables C. Then there are some variables C and D that I haven't introduced yet. I'm going to define them later on. But for the sake of understanding this theorem, you can think that C is essentially the curve of the curve of the velocity divided by the density, and D is some special combination of second derivatives of the entropy. These two variables at time zero belong to some holding space. And finally, along sigma zero, the data functions are contained in the interior of a compact subset kappa. Of a compact subset kappa of space-time, sorry, of state space, kappa is a subset of state space, where the density is bounded from below away from zero, and the speed of sound is bounded from below and above by this constant C1 and C2. So if you don't know what the speed of sound is, I'm going to define later on. But the way we should understand this assumption is that these are assumptions that tell us that the equations are non-degenerate. So you get a true. Non-degenerate. So you get a truly hyperbolic system of equations. Then, under the assumptions, the time of classical existence T depends only on this data, on this constant D and this contact set kappa. And moreover, the so-called L and hold the regularity of the data is propagated by the flow, which means that the norms that you can control, they are uniformly bounded functions of this constant D. Of this constant D and this compact set kappa. So in a nutshell, if I were to summarize this result in one line, so we are saying that the time, the solution's time of class coexistence, can be controlled by low regularity norms of the data. So that's the punchline. That's the statement. But improving this result, we derive some results of independent interest. We obtain some sharp estimates for the characteristic geometry of the problem. That's also called the acoustic geometry. I'm going to explain that later on. We obtain Strippert's estimates for waves coupled to vorticity. And you also derive some Schaulder estimates for what is called the transport duplicate part of the system. All this I'm going to explain during the talk. So that's the theorem. Let me make some remarks. Some remarks. So, what is the main difficulty? If we had to pinpoint this problem, the main challenge is that the Euler equations form a system with multiple characteristic speeds. So physically, there are two propagation phenomena associated with the Euler equations. You have the transport of entropy vorticity, so those are of course transport phenomena. And then you have the propagation of sound, right? So sound is propagating the fluid, so that's a type of wave phenomenon. Of wave phenomena. So we can think of our system as having a wave part and a transport part. So we have these different characteristic speeds, and that's the main challenge in this problem. Now, if you want to do some low regularity estimates, the standard thing you want to try to do is have to do some striggers estimates. But the problem here is that striggers estimates are typically adapted to the wave part of the systems because they are tied to dispersion. There are no strickers estimates for the transport. There are no restricter testimonies for the transport part, because transport equations do not exhibit dispersion, right? So that's something which you have to handle here. And also, we have to handle the interaction of the wave and transport part. Throughout the talk, I'm going to be talking about and mentioning the wave part and the transport part for didactic reasons, but you should not think that these are two independent things that you just treat separately. Of course, the system is coupled, so the wave part and transport part interact with each other. Okay. So what I'm trying to say here, in this slide, is the following. Despite the presence of a wave part, you should not think that the Euler system can be viewed as some type of wave equations just perturbed by some transport terms that might even be smoother. Even the tiniest amount of vorticity is a game changer here. And what's behind? That's because And what's beha that's because, as I said, there is no strigger's estimate for the transport part of the system. So what this is the main enemy. Now, if you go back to state of the theorem, I have the assumptions that the density and the velocity belong to H2 plus epsilon. That's within the scope of the optimal regularity that I mentioned before. But then I have some extra regularity assumptions, right? I assume that the vorticity, which I assume that the vorticity, which is the core of the velocity, is in 2 plus epsilon, so it's one degree more regular than what you would expect from just the velocity in 2 plus epsilon. I have the entropy interest 3 plus epsilon, and I have this variable C and D in some holder space. Throughout the talk, I'm going to explain why these assumptions are needed to prove the theorem. But what I want to stress here is that we're able to propagate the extra regularity of the Vortisian. The extra regularity of the Vortisian entropy. So it's not like I have these assumptions for some dumb reason sitting there and then you do nothing with them right now. They are propagated. And they are propagated even though they are deeply coupled with the rougher wave part of the system. In particular, it's very interesting. I find it very interesting that we can propagate the whole irregularity, because that's not the typical norm to use in this kind of microbiological problems. Now, more recently, one considered the isentropic case. We consider the isentropic case, but with vorticity, which means the current velocity is not zero, and she was able to further lower the regularity. In particular, she has no holder assumptions on her data. Okay, so I mentioned that the difficulty is that the Euler system has multiple characteristic speeds. So let's describe the characteristics of the compressed Euler equations. They are the integral curves or the flow lines of the material vector. Lines of the material vector field B. So those are the characteristics associated with the transport part. And then we have no hypersurfaces with respect to the acoustical metric. So those are characteristics associated with the wave part. The acoustical metric, by definition, is a Lorentzian metric in space-time, given by its expression here. And in this expression we have this quantity C, which is the fluid sound speed. Which is the fluid sound speed. The sound speed is defined as follows. The sound speed squared is the derivative of the pressure with respect to the density. Remember that the pressure is given by a compression of state as a function of the density and entropy. And under our assumptions, the solvent speed is always positive. So here's a picture. So we have the integral curves of the vector field B, and then you have the character. And then you have the characteristics hypersurface of the acoustical metric, which are also called the sound cones. They're called sound cones because they're cones in space-time that correspond to the propagation of sound, very much like the light cones for the standard wave equation correspond to the propagation of light. But differently than the standard wave equation, this problem is quasi-linear, so the characteristics of this problem depend on the solutions. They depend on the solution itself, right? Because G and B depend on the fluid variables. So that's a feature of the quasi-linear nature of the problem. Also, in this picture, on purpose, I drew the sound cone off the t-axis here. This is to emphasize that different than like most pure wave problems that we study, here in this context, the vector field d dt does not have to be time-like with a Be time-like with respect to the acoustical metric. So ddt is not necessarily time-like for the relevant metric of the problem. Okay, so the other equations that I had written before, they have one limitation, that they treat the different characteristics associated with wave and transport, they treat them on the same footing, and they sort of hide the role of the acousticometric, which has this important. Which has this important feature in the problem, corresponding to the propagation of sound. In other words, the other equations written in their standard form have no good structure. So for this problem, what we have to do, we need to untangle the different characteristics and make the role of the acoustical metric explicit. So that's what we're going to do. And in order to do so, if you have to first introduce some So, if I have to first introduce some notation and definitions, first let me introduce the logarithmic density, which is simply the log of the density, that's just a convenience. Then you have the specific vorticity, which is the co of the velocity, but weighted by the density. It's called the specific vorticity. We have the entropy gradient, which is simply the gradient of the entropy. And then we have those variables C and D that I mentioned before. So now I'm going to define them. Before, so now I'm going to define them. We call them the modified code of the vorticity and the modified divergence of the entropy gradient. They have some urban expressions, but the story here is the following. You should think of C as essentially the core of the specific vorticity, and D as the divergence of the entropy gradient. And what happens is that when you go do your estimates, you have to control the curl of omega, the divergence. The curl of omega and the divergence of s. That just pops out in the estimates. You have to control these quantities. But you cannot control them directly. Okay, so at least you're not able to. However, if you define C and D to be the quantities you want to control plus all this extra junk, then this variable C and D to satisfy evolution equations with battery structure for which you can derive estimates. Okay, so that's why I introduced these variables C and D. C and D. Now that I have all this notation, I can state the new formulation of the other equations, and this state is the following. So any solution to the original equations, let me go back to the original equations here. Okay, I cannot find the pointer. But okay, so starting in smooth solutions to the original equation that I had written before, then that solution is going to all satisfy this system of equations. This system of equations that I'm going to explain now. So the notation is as follows: psi represents any one of these variables, the logarithmic density, the velocity, or the entropy. Box is just the wave operator with respect to the acoustical metric. Bolt D is the space-time gradient. And LAB is a shorthand notation for the B is a shorthand notation for the following. It's an expression that's linear in B with coefficients that are smooth functions of A. So for example, this represents something that's linear in the vertical C with coefficients depending on psi or something linear in D with coefficients depending on psi. And then Q A P C, something similar, is an expression that's quadratic in B and C with coefficients depending smoothly on A. Depending smoothly on A. For example, this term is something that's quadratic in the derivatives of psi, derivatives of omega, with coefficients depending on psi. So when you write the Euler equations in this form, you are writing them as a system of wave equations and transport equations. In particular, if you look at the principal part here, these equations, now we have the acoustical metric and the vector field B, so the characteristics are very The characteristics are very explicit because they are in these principal operators. And then we have what we call transport div core equations, which are these equations here, which are transport equations, but they are coupled to a divergence and a core. So we call them transport div code equations. And the punchline is that, of course, even though these equations look much more complicated than the simple look in order equations that are at the beginning, these equations have very good structure. These equations have very good structure, whereas the original equations they look simple, but they don't have any good structure. There isn't much you can do with that. So these are going to be the equations that we're going to use to derive estimates. Okay, so from this formulation now we can sort of classify our variables. We identify the wave variables, those variables whose dynamics is tied to the sound cones, as being the variable psi. Psi and the transport variables whose dynamics is tied to the flow lines of B as being the variables omega, S, C, and D. And then the basic outline of the proof is the following. I'm just giving the basic outline, and I'm going to go in more details in some of the ideas. We use known techniques from wave equations, which means energy estimates and striggers estimates, to control the wave variables. Now, because of the quasi-equality, Now, because of the quasi-linear nature of the problem, it turns out that you can only close these triggers estimates if you control the acoustic geometry, which means that to close these triggers estimates, you have to derive some complementary estimates for several geometric quantities associated with the sound quantity. I'm going to explain that toward the end of the talk. So, there's some geometry that comes in here. That's what I'm trying to say. Then the second part is that you need to control the transport variables with an amount of regularity that's consistent with what you are getting from these triggers estimates. And for that, the energy estimates for transport equations are not enough. And as I keep saying, we don't have these trickers estimates for transport equations. So what saves us here is that you can combine the transport type energy estimates with the limit gas. Remember, we had Solvin. Estimates. Remember, we had sort of an elliptic system there because you have a div and a colour, right? So you're going to exploit that structure to derive some elliptic estimates, propose these estimates here. And finally, we have to also handle the fact that the transport variables, they appear as source terms in the acoustic geometry estimates. So that's what I was saying. We have to handle the interaction of the acoustic geometry in the transport part. And this is a Part and this is a feature of the fact that the problem has different characteristic speeds. So, if the fluid were irrotational and isentropic, then the only characteristics would be the sound calls. And you would not have to worry about two and three. Okay, so what I want to do now is to go into a little more detail in some of the ideas. So, to illustrate. So, to illustrate some of the ideas, I'm going to now set the entropy to be equal to constant. So, this variable C becomes only the curl of omega weighted by the density, and I'm going to drop this weight here and think of C as being just the curl of omega. And then the system simplifies, it takes this form here. And every time you see the colour of omega, you should really think that's the variable c, but I'm going to write colour just because it's cleaner to see what's going on, I think. So, here are the equations. So here are the equations, and then what you want to do, you want to control the age of 2 plus epsilon 1 of psi. So we're going to take 1 plus epsilon derivative of this equation. Do that. And you see when you do that, you get this term. And you see that you have to control 1 plus epsilon derivative of the current omega. Now, omega satisfies an evolution equation, so here, but you cannot get this estimate from this evolution equation, because we take the curl in 1 plus epsilon derivative of the co and one plus epsom derivative of this equation, you're going to end up with three plus epsilon derivative of psi, which one derivative too much. So what you do, you look at the equation, the evolution equation for the co, which is the volition equation for C actually, remember, cozy electronic C. And then from this equation you see that you can control the colour of omega in 1 plus epsilon, provide you can control this term here, which means provides you can control two. which means provides you can control two plus epsilon derivatives of omega in L2. Then, how do you control two plus epsilon derivatives of omega in L2? Use these two equations here. So here you have an equation for the colour, here you have an equation for the divergence, you take one plus epsilon derivative of each equation here, and then you combine that with the fact that a full derivative of omega can be estimated in terms of the divergence of the complex standard Gibb core estimate. So you combine these two. Estimate, so you combine these two evolution equations with diff colour, run the entire machinery of estimates, and you can close this. I'm being very schematic, but the punchline is that this works. And in the end, you control one derivative of psi in one plus epsilon, and one derivative of omega in one plus epsilon in terms of data that are not right here. And the important thing is that you have some control norm, right? In the control norm, you have the usual thing, which is one derivative of sine and infinity. Of sine N infinity. That's just standard from the wave equations, comes from when you commute the wave equation with derivatives. And then you have this term, which is one derivative of omega n infinity, which comes from this part here. You see, when you took one plus f derivatives, you end up with one term that has top derivatives inside, so we are forced to put L2 here, so then you have to put an L infinity here. So that's how you get d omega L infinity. So, this sort of a sketch of an argument, I think, sort of convinces you why you need that assumption. Because you need to control omega in 2 plus epsilon. So, that's why you have to put an assumption that the curve of the velocities 2 plus epsilon time is 0. It's because of this term here. Let me also point out, that's what I was mentioning before about good structures, that the equation wants to see, let me go back so we can see the equation was better, this equation here. Is better. This equation here, it's not simply the curve of this equation. If you take the curve of this equation, you'd expect to get two derivatives of psi. But no, there are some constellations that happen, and you get only one derivative of psi. So that's the kind of phenomena that I was mentioning before that led us to introduce this variable C and D, because when you compute the evolution equations for C and D, there are some cancellations that satisfy better evolution equations. Okay, so now, so this is more or less standard. So, the key ingredient that you want to close this estimate by controlling this control norm in terms of the data. That's why you need to prove the theorem. So, you need to control these mixed spacetime norms, the L1 in time and L infinite norm of one derivative of omega, sorry, one derivative of psi and one derivative of omega. You need to control that in terms of the data. Of the data. For this part, that's a wave variable, so we use triggered estimates. So that's something that's known. But for the transport part, as I said, there are no striggered estimates because there's no dispersion for transport equations. And I keep repeating myself, but that's the point of the talk, right? There are no dispersion for transport equations. You cannot do strigger estimates. So how do you happen to start? Well, we would like to use elliptic estimates. Well, we would like to use elliptic estimates because remember we have a sort of an elliptical system, we have that divine curve falling around, but we cannot because counter and sigma operators are not bound in L infinity. However, they are bounded in other spaces, so what we do, we control the L infinity norm by the stronger norm, which is the Caesarea alpha norm, because in Caesarea alpha you can do elliptic estimates. And that's essentially the reason why you need an assumption for the dating in border space, because you're going to do this elliptic estimate. Hold your space because you want to do the zero-task space. That's the reason. Okay, so let's move on now. Then the way the proof goes, there is a standard bootstrap assumption, right? So that's under bootstrap argument. You take some bootstrap assumption and then you improve it. That's what you do. And its bootstrap assumptions and its improvement involve a lot of quantities, delta naught, delta one, delta. Delta 0, delta 1, delta. For the sake of this talk, it's not very important what they are. There are some quantities that are determined in terms of the parameters of the problem. You have the alpha and the epsilon. What I want to point out here is that the bootstrap assumptions, they have essentially two parts. They have these parts here, which are essentially to handle the energy estimates, and they have the sums that are needed to control the acoustic geometry. The acoustic geometry. Remember, I told you there is some geometry involved that I'm going to explain soon, and that those bootstrap assemblers are to control the geometry. Okay, so let's go and talk about some reductions. And let's focus on control of psi first. Let's forget about the transported part for a moment. So, you're going to control this L1 infinite norm. Suffice it to control the L2 and infinite norm. And to control this norm, we go through a series of reductions. We use pre-scaling, energy estimates, and Duhan-Nel's formula to reduce control of this quantity to the following frequency localizes triggers estimate for a linear in phi equation. So it suffices to get estimates for this equation. It's linear in phi, box phi equal to zero. And box is the box again with respect to the acoustical metric. And the estimate you need is this estimate here. And the estimate that you need is this estimate here. It's an estimate involving q in time. q is some number slightly greater than 2. Then you have some lambdas which are some dyadic frequencies. And this estimate itself is happening on a time interval that has also been rescaled by lambdas that I'm not writing here. Okay, I know this looks complicated, but it turns out that this estimate can actually be reduced to a further. This estimate follows from a This estimate follows from a fixed frequency stricker estimate, where it suffices to prove this estimate, where P here is the Littlewood-Pallet projection onto unit frequency. So if you can prove this estimate, then you can work back and get this estimate here. So there are all these reductions that are somewhat long, but I want to point out there's nothing new here. All these reductions are done, those previous works that I mentioned before on wave away. We simply borrow from from those works. So there's there's not nothing new here, essentially. Nothing to do here, essentially. And then finally, this estimate here, the fixed frequency stricker's estimate, follows from a dispersive estimate that I'm going to state next. So as an applied argument that resembles a T star argument, the fixed frequency strigger estimates follows from this dispersive estimate here. So here you see we have some decay. You see, we have some decay in time, right? And so this is kind of more asylum. But then we have some coefficient t, so this is a function of time. And this is a function of time that has essentially the same integrability properties in time as this leading order coefficient, this linear order term. So I'm not going to write what D is explicitly something ugly, but the point is that this term D is sort of quasi-linear in nature. Let me explain this. Linear in nature. Let me explain this. Even though we reduce the problem to an estimate for this linear in phi equation, box phi equal to 0, the coefficients, of course, depend on sign. And you have to control these coefficients when you do these estimates. So that's what I mean that this, so this essentially coming from controlling the coefficients. That's what I mean by this. This quasi-linear nature. And control of this coefficient is established by controlling the acoustic geometry. By controlling the acoustic geometry, which I think is going to be the topic of the next or three slides next. Now establishing the existence integrability properties of this function D lies at the core of the result. There's a lot of work that's going exactly to show that you have this D, which has the correct decay in time to satisfy this integrability condition. So let's So let's go on now and explain how that's done. And let me start notice that because I'm doing an S at a fixed frequency here, I can replace this L infinity norm by an L2 norm. Let me also point out the following. I was a bit vague here because I moved from an estimate for a spacetime derivative of psi to an estimate that involves only the B derivative of psi. The story here is the following. The story here is the following. The spatial derivatives of phi, you can actually estimate them more or less independently by a separate argument. The core of the argument goes into estimating the derivatives that involve the time direction of it. However, remember that I told you that the vector field d dt is not necessarily time-like for the acoustic metric. So it turns out that the correct vector field here is the vector field B. So that's the guy that you're estimating. Okay, so now to see how we get the decay estimate, the dispersive estimate. The first observation is that the decay properties of an equation of this form, box phi equals zero, the decay properties of solutions to the equation are directionally dependent. So the derivatives of phi in directions tangent to the characteristics, they behave better in terms of the k than derivatives that are transverse of the characteristics. Then, derivatives that are transverse of the characteristic. That's a general property of wave equations. That's true already for the standard linear wave equation. So, the relevant characteristics here are the sound cones. So, now I have to be a little more concrete about how I characterize the sound cones. And you can write the sound cones as being level sets, HU, of a solution u to the following Iconov equation. The Iconov equation is this fully non-linear transport equation with Transport equation with suitable initial conditions where the coefficients depend on the acoustical metric. So you solve the equation, the level sets of this function u are going to be precisely the sound calls. So now here's the idea to obtain the K. What are we going to do? Well, one of the things that you usually do when you want to prove the K, you construct some weighted energy. I'm not going to write what the energy is because I Write what data energy is because I think that will not be very enlightening unless I had another 20 minutes to talk about. But let me try to explain conceptually what's going on. You construct some weighted energy, and this weighted energy has two parts. It has an interior part and an exterior part, which corresponds essentially to this part in space-time in blue. That's the interior part. And you have some exterior part, which is this brown part. And then you want to control your energy, you need some multiplier. You need some multiplier, vector field. In the interior part, you're going to use a multiplier which is f of r tilde times n. What is r tilde? R tilde is this variable t minus u, and you should think of r tilde as being the analog of the standard radial variable for the standard radio wage. So it's the analog in this context where your geometry now is not flat. And then n is the following: fix a sound cone. Fix a sound cone, take this sound cone here, Hu, which is a level set of the icono function, and intersect the sound cone with the hypersurface t equal to constant, for example t equal to tau. That intersection is going to be some topological two-sphere, which draw schematically red here. Now, that two-sphere is going to have some unit outer normal with respect to the acoustical matter, which is this normal n here in the picture. That's the n. n here in the picture. That's the n the vectors which are losing as a multiplier here. So what you're doing here essentially, take a function of r tilde time is n, you are doing essentially a more revast estimate, a more revast estimate adapted to the acoustic geometry, the geometry of the problem. And once you do this more revast estimate, you obtain some integrated energy decay, which is the key element that you need to prove the Need to prove the decay in time that I stated before. Okay, but then there is an issue here. I'm not telling you what this f of r is, but if you look at this carefully and if you go through the arguments carefully, you're going to see that this estimate, the more vast estimate, becomes weaker and weaker when r becomes larger. So that's why you have some sort of cutoff in an interior region and handle the rest in this exterior region using another multiplier. So in the exterior Multiplier. So in the exterior region, the multiplier you're going to get is a power of R tilde times L. And what is L? L is a vector field that's tangent to the sound conus. So here are the picture of L is a vector field that's tangent to the sound conus. Okay, and then the following happens. We have our energy, you have a multiplier, so when you're going to do an energy estimate or the two, you integrate by parts, right? parts, right? So when you integrate by parts, you're going to pick up derivatives of n and derivatives of L, which are the vector fields you're using. And you have to handle these error terms, which involve derivatives of n and derivatives of L. And the way you handle them is by showing that these derivatives then can be expressible as the connection coefficients of a null frame. So what is a null frame? So on each pointer in spacetime, So on each pointer in space-time, you have these spheres, which are intersections of the sound cones with the constant-time hypersurfaces. And then you can take an orthonormal frame to your sphere, which is illustrated here by this vector field E. You have two of them, right? But of course, I cannot draw four-dimensional pictures, so I drew only one vector field to the sphere. These vector fields, they are space-like with respect to the acoustical metric. Then you have this vector. Then you have this vector field L. So the vector fields tangent to the sphere in L give you a total of three linearly independent vector fields. So you complement that to a fourth linear independent vector by considering this vector field L bar, which is transversal to the characteristics. Now these vector fields L bar and L turn out to be null vectors with respect to the acoustical metric. So that's why this is called a null frame. And that's what you're going to use to control these error terms. But the message here, like I mentioned before, is that the decay estimate that you are after can only be obtained in conjunction with appropriate estimate for these connection coefficients, which are your error terms. The question then is how you control those connection coefficients. And control the connection coefficients is what we call control of the acoustic geometry. Control of the acoustic geometry. Okay, so this is a long story. To control the acoustic geometry, we have to derive estimates along constant time hydro surfaces, along sound cones, and along the spheres by studying some very delicate evolution elliptic system that's satisfied by the Conache coefficients. So it's a big system that's called the no structure equations. And this is something that's known going back to the work of Plymouth and Christodolo on the stability of many. Plymouth and Chrysobulu on the stability of an equal space, the normal structure of the space. And then you also have to handle the transport part, right? So the transport part you handle using some transport and difficult estimates. And I'm putting this into one line here. I don't want to give the impression that the transport difficult estimates are simple. They're not. I just don't have time to go over everything. So you have to handle that. Everything. So you have to handle that as well, and you have to exploit a lot the structure of the equations to get the right estimates here. And you also have this issue that I mentioned before, that the wave part and the transport part, they interact with each other. So I just want to make a few remarks on that for you to have an idea of the kind of difficulties that arise. So one issue is the following. These transport variables These transport variables, they enter as source terms in the Nova structure equations. The Nova structure equations, you write them, they're just geometric equations, but then in the end you have to use Euler's equations. And when you use Euler's equations, you're going to get some source terms that enter now in the normal structure equations. And then you run into several difficulties. One of them is the following. The way that you should derive estimates for these connection coefficients using the noise structure equations requires, in particular, Equations requires in particular that you derive some L2 type of estimates not along fixed time but along the sound cones. You have derived some estimates along the sound cones. However, think about this for a moment. So you have your sound cones, and then you have this variable C, and this satisfies transport equations, right? So the characteristics are the flow lines of B, and they also satisfy some type of elliptical system, but that tells you that in principle you should be able to That in principle, you should be able to only obtain estimates that are tied to the integral curves of B or to this hypersurface of possibly. There's absolutely no reason why you should expect that you're able to control these transport variables along the sound cone, which are completely different characteristics. So at this point, things look almost hopeless. However, something very interesting happens. This vector field B, it's always a unit time-like vector. Always a unit time-like vector for the acoustical metric. And remember that the tated vectors to this hypersurface, the sound cones, are no vectors, so these are no hypersurfaces. And these are, so this is telling you that these characteristic curves, the integral curves over B, are always transversal to the sound cones. And that's key. That's key because then to get the estimates for the transport variables among the sound columns, you do the following. Along the sound cones, you do the following. You start with a space-time integral here where you can control your transport variables using transport estimates and elliptic estimates. And then you do an integration by parts. When you do an integration by parts, you pick up some boundary term, and because of this transversality that's coming from this condition, that boundary term comes out with the right sign to give you the energy that you need along the sound poles. So this transversality is key. So, this transverse strategy is key to obtain estimates for the transport variables along the sound course. And as I said, so that's why the relevant vector field here is B, it's not dt, because dt might not even be time marked, right? How am I time mark? So, then, of course, I'm saying that you do elliptic estimates, you have to show that you can actually do that. And then, one issue that I And then one issue that appears here that would not appear if you're doing just wave equations is because now you're doing these estimates using holder spaces. So one thing that you do when you do holder estimates, you have to compare the solution to different points. So I have the solution at one point here, one point here, I have to compare. But the only information that you really have is what's coming from the initial condition, because these are transport equations. You have to trace back the solutions all the way back to the initial condition along the characteristics of the vector field B. Of the vector of field B. So that tells you that to get a Hoder estimate here, we have to somehow show that this distance here at a later time is comparable to the distance here at time zero, because that's where the data is. And to do that, we have to get some quantitative control of the integral curves of the vector field. That's something that's intrinsic to the transport part of the problem. And then, okay, this is. I don't have time to explain this much detail, but because of this holder regularity, because of the fact that these guys enter as source terms in the noise structure equations, you also need to derive some type of Holder estimates along these spheres. And then it's a similar story. To derive these Holder estimates along these spheres, you have to see how things are propagated along the integral curves of this vector field L. So you need to get some quantitative control of these integral curves of L. Of these integral curves of case. That's another aspect of the problem. Okay, so that's all I wanted to say. Thank you for your attention. Thank you so much. So, any questions? Yeah, so does this give any insight into that? Well, into how shocks actually form in terms of the regularity structure of the emulsion? What do we have here? Right here, all you're saying is that think of this in terms of a continuation principle, right? So what kind of norm do you need to control at a fixed time to know that you can prevent shocks from a small time after that? But there's more that we need to really understand the structure of shock. There's more that we need to really understand the structural problem because that's a that's a much more involved problem. One thing that I should mention that the direction is that when you go back to the when you go back to the Euler equations as written here, where are they? Which, by the way, I think they didn't mention. This is not done in our work. This was done before in some previous work of Jarrett and Jonathan. And they use this equation exactly. And they use this equation exactly because they were using the Robo School formation. And for that, it's crucial that these quadratic terms are actually no forms. We don't need that. We just need them to be quadratic, right? But just from this observation that for the shock, you need this to be no forms, whereas for us, it just needs to be quadratic. It tells you that for the actual shock problem, you need to kind of much more delicate things. Questions, I think we had a short break, but we started at all.
