Okay, so the next uh speaker is Claire Lages, and she will be talking about road networks. Yeah, road networks. Thank you. So hello, everybody. I'm Claire Lages, I'm an assistant professor in the University of Franche Pointe in France. And I came here to talk about road networks and when I see how they can look or not and understand And understand from the pattern we can see on those networks, how we can deduce some rules to be able to model their evolution. So, first, do you recognize that? What is it? Yeah, we are here. And here is the final moment trade we did yesterday with some of you. So, yeah, it's done. So yeah, it's bad. So the first question we're going to ask is why world networks? Why is it interesting to look at those networks? If we try to fly a little bit around our cities, I start with an easy one, but I like this game, especially when I talk after lunch, because I will ask you to help me what it is, you know, how manage all those all your. Management algorithms, oh you read me. So this this one was easy. So you see a very particular uh shape of our network. We know this shape to be the one of North America. Another quite easy one here. The shape is more typical of European cities, so uh really organic shape uh with uh many streets and we we feel history through through this organization. This organization. Let's try a less easy one. I don't speak. You know these cities? Pittsburgh! No. Pittsburgh, okay. It's in France. Um little bit more in the south. Avignon. Avignon, good. So another Euro typical European city, so shaped like European cities, so shaped by the rivers, communal network, and we can see the city center here and many layers as an onion growing. So we are speaking for those kind of shape of network of organic cities. And for this one, this example is to show you that this kind of organization can be found in Can be found in Europe even if it's more likely to be American shape of cities. And the other way, here, this one is a hardest one. You should find it your all my configuration. Define your North Korean. Sorry, Price. My admiration. Now, so we are in North America here. North America here is to show you that organic organization could be found there also. So one of the most ancient cities of North America is an old church and we see here the organization to be more organic. So we can expect So we can expect a road network to share information about the story of the city and its use. And this is what we are looking for. So we are considering just a road network without any other information, so no congestion, no reads, no actors, politics, just the structure of the world network. And we will try to read it. And we will try to read it. And to read it, I did my PhD with Stéphane, this is here, and we try to find what kind of tool we can use to read those kind of networks. So we are here on the side of description, and we're going to try to read cities. This is the part of my PhD thesis, who was some years ago, not that much. That much. And all the exercise was to take the network, build a graph from it, so by putting nodes at the intersection and making arcs between those nodes, seeing the angles between arcs and pairing arcs according to the minimum deviation angles between them. And so by doing this, we did one object we called waves. We call ways. So, from this little extract of network, we had 55 arcs, and now we have 14 ways. So, a way is an aggregation of arcs who can cross the entire network or just a laser, a small part of the network. So, it's a multi-scale element which allows us to read the cities, and we will see that it's quite interesting. We we will see that it's quite interesting so it's equivalent to a street, a way not exactly, because uh the street is given by by the name and this name can change and here it's just structural. So it's an hydrograph we put on the initial graph to be able to compute some indicators on it and to try to get some information on cities through it. So what determines a way is the minimum deviation Two minutes away is a minimum deviation from at each node. Sorry, I went fast on this one, but at each node we are looking at the angle of deviation between arcs and we are pairing arcs if the angle is minimum between them and according to the maximum pressure angle. We put at 60 degrees. So we have ways and we are seeing that it's quite interesting. And we are seeing that it's quite interesting to work with weight because, for instance, for closeness centralities, so computed on edges, we have this kind of results. So, we can picture that it focuses on the center of the map, so not very interesting. But when we do it on the edges, on the ways instead of edges, we have this kind of results, and so we can see a real hierarchy. A real hierarchy in the road network, and we can read the most ancient streets, the ones that are here, just to deserve more locally the territory. What does it mean two ways are close? So the closeness centrality is um you know the inverse of uh topological distance. So from each way we are looking if we can get to all the network easily or not. All the network easily or not? Sorry, I I was assuming that this one was okay for everybody, but maybe not. So, if something is green, what does it exactly mean? If it's green, it's quite not as much accessible. And if it's red, it's really accessible. Okay, if it's red, it's on the way. Yeah, you are easily passing by those screens. So, which buttons? Okay. Okay. So the green parts are the old parts of the cities that are like labyrinthine kind of medieval stuff or what? The red parts are the green. I reverse your question. So it is actually the red part which is the most ancient part of the cities. Because when a cities is built, each new part is made to go quickly to the city center, so to minimize the number To minimize the number, the topological distance to the main structure, which is the red one. And so, this is the first indicator I developed during my PhD. And the big advantage of the way is whatever is the choice you make to cut your network, your result will be really stable. Because if you compute it on the edges, it will change the result according to where you choose to cut your network. Where you choose to catch your own network. And with Stéphane, because we did this work together, we tried many indicators and we focus on those bringing the most interesting information. Here is the degree centrality. So the degree is the number of other ways a way is crossing. So this gives So this gives us an attachment hierarchy as well. This is the orthogonality, which looks at the angles of waves between them. And this is the spacing. Sorry, I read the title in French. The spacing is looking at the distance between intersection on the ways. So you have the very dense part of the cities in here in red, and in blue, the the the In blue, the streets which have not much intersection. So, this was part of my PhD. So, I was wanting to show you a little bit how we read cities, but I want to explain you from this how we can model the growth of the cities. So, to go to the simulation, we have to go by the motifs. Let's go back in a plane. When I arrived in Calgary, I looked at the outside, and just before arriving in the cities, we saw those big lines, those streets going through the territory without any obstacle on their way. And when we arrived closest to Calgary, we start to see Start to see appearance some motifs on the ground. And some of them are really interesting because in those kind of cities which is planned, the motifs appear at one time, they are think at one time, or it is not an organic builder mode. So we saw, maybe you did as well. You did as well. Many really interesting motifs arriving in Calgary. And actually, if we took a satellite image of the place, we see this is Calgary. This is before coming to the city, so with a big straight line here because it's all flat. Here we have the city and here the Okimounts. And we can see that with the road network, we have very different kind of shapes. Very different kind of shapes. So, on the flat ground, the big, very straight road. Then, in the cities, a variation of motifs. And in the rocky mountains, then it's very seamless roads because there are more shapes to grow. So, this is the road network of the place, so you can really see the cut made between the flat land and The flat land and the rocky mountains. So, through the structure of the network, you can really see the topography of the place. And our challenge in the PhD I was supervising those last four years was to characterize those motifs, to be able to put them in a simulation and to be able to characterize the growth of cities with them. So with Philippe Bonon, who was part of the Morphosity team with Stéphane as well, we were thinking with two other master thesis students of selection of motifs. And here you are them. And with those motifs, my PhD student, who is a doctor now, Anna L. Gush, tried to understand Try to understand what kind of combination of indicators can characterize each motif. And she sees that with degree, when you have a low or to the high degree, you have very large and arborescent tree-like motifs. She sees as well that when high degree and high hortidinality is bad, you have large squared motifs. And when you have low And when you have low degree and low orthogonality, you have narrow tree-like motifs. And with low degree and high orthogonality, you have squared narrow motifs. But the main information here is with a combination of indicators, we are able to characterize some kind of motifs in the cities. And this is interesting because we can, from that, define some morphotic. Can from that define some morphotypes. And so, from CTs, we get the motifs, and we will now define the morphotypes. And what Anae did is defining eight morphotypes, so radialinear, concentric, convergent, divergent, pamphlet, orthogonal, diagonal, transversal, intercalab, and cellular. Those eight motifs, she characterized them, saying, okay. them saying okay what is the elementary motif what the what is the performance location the size the process of evolution the process of retouchment and the with the alternative spacing and degree well what kind of value does uh characterize those motifs and from that she wa was able to Was able to characterize the growth of the city. So, this is her drawings saying, okay, from a city center, so you have first the radials going through the land, then the orthogonal and diabolical pattern emerging, then the cellular ones, and then the intercolour and ramified, transversal, the concentric, ramified, Ramified, and from this, you have a global pattern emerging on the ground. And this is what we want to simulate. And to do so, we have finished with the description part and we go through the modeling part. And we will have, we will need a model. So we worked with Thoma Kochta model. Toma Kocha was a PhD student. Thomas Potter was a PhD student of Stefan as well. He did his PhD just before me, and he defined with Stefan on the round a potential field, saying, okay, this is my round network, and I will define some preferential spots to put my nodes and to make my network work. So this is the formula we use with the sporing parameters. With a sporing parameters, rejection radius, scaling parameters, and a cumulative minimum distance here. And quickly, so he initializes the network, sets his parameters with n the total number of nodes and collects the probing factors. He generates nodes according to this potential function, select a new node, Select a new node, connect this new node, and so he has his new network and repeat this process. So from this model developed by Toma Cota, with NIA we went further because the model of Toma was about to create the radial and linear shape, the ramified one, intercolor one. One, Antarctala one, and Orthogondan one. And with NIA, we developed the Waymark model with some kind of additional parameters. So to connect a new node, there are new options. So one parameter OP saying, okay, I will connect orthogonally to the past. My previous network, the EPP, which will connect to the end nodes and the WP, which will connect to the existing network according to the degree centrality value of race. We also added parameters according to the handles of the new. Although the new segment created, so either a minimum intersection angle between a new segment and all the segments in the network, either an angle here of separation between each pair of possible segments. And by setting those parameters in the Waymouth software we developed in our lab with Jean Lidel, who is a research engineer, we were about Engineer, we were able from an initial network to set the parameters we wanted to make the network work. So in the software we can see the generated filter layers and the metadata okay. And so the challenge was to reproduce some the morphotypes first, so way more possible to reproduce those eight morphotypes that are. Those eight morphotypes that Anna defined in her PhD. And from those morphotypes to recreate city motifs. And so you remember those motifs that Philippe Bonin draw? There were 14 of them and eight are doable with the the model Anna created. I created. So, for instance, this shape of CTIF is in LMOS, and from this initial network, we see that with several steps, each step with some different set of parameters, we can recreate a looking light network like this one. Almost done. This is an example of media. This is an example of Medina in Mahrakesh, so with another set of parameters. This is Catagen, so a squared kind of role network. And Brive Lagalliard, who some of you are really well known, so with radials and concentric networks. So bad news, Waymorph is not able to connect to the loop. I'm sorry, Anne. I'm sorry, I'm Nick. But this is one of our perspectives. So, yeah, so from our description of cities, we want to decompose things and we were able to recompose in the modernization to simulate the city growths. And the aim is to be able to take the ancient road network of Ancient world network of really dense cities, and to see if we are able to simulate their growth and what the model give us in front of reality. So, those research I just presented are made from 2009, I miss my English with the beginning of the thesis. The beginning of the thesis of Chema Kofta with Stefan to now with the end of the PhD of ANAI. And Stefan was in the Morcosity research group at the origin of the PhD of Thomas and mine. And then at the end of my PhD, I was really frustrated to not have been able to simulate the presence of the growth of network. The growth of local network. So, when I had the position, I said, okay, I want to do to supervise the PhD to do so. So, and I did that. And we were able to define the morph types of ways, developed the way more with Gilles and Cécile, Tanier, another colleague. And there's plenty of perspectives emerging from them, going from soft mobility. going from soft mobilities to a scenario which includes more some part of the networks to make from those kind of beautiful networks more to create more information thank you very much for your attention time for questions But it's very clear and does not plan air to play any role in road networks or probably not in a proposed plane or does not plan to play any road. Actually on those nodes on those reports, when you have two streets going one above the other, we do not put a node space. So it's not really planned. Blanche. Thanks a lot, as well. Is it with the model you've made? Have you sort of found investigated if there's some sort of optimal road network or optimal motif? And again, how would you define optimal whether you can easily get to places? Have you looked into sort of which motifs are better than others? Yeah, that's interesting. Yeah, you have to define optimal first because the optimal could be really different. Here I Different. Here, this is the picture I propose to admit for the art exhibition because I really like the idea that you see two cultures on it, you know, there's this one and this one. And you feel that the optimal is not the same on both of them. And actually, I supervise an internship right now of students trying to see the resilience of See the resilience of each kind of motif. And so, by trying to remove edge and saying, okay, when how do those react my indicators according to each kind of motif and some attacks on them? So, maybe we can answer the question this interview. Alex, one more. If I give you a map, I'll learn how to shape it. I will give you the. How well can you fill it in? On natural tools, on the center. I gave you a map of the center, and then I have a resolved roach in the center. Okay. Can you do that? I think not exactly as they were. It depends also on the city. You see, there are many organic cities and many planned ones, and the logic is completely different between the two. So if you librarize some part of the network and Is some part of the network which is really located and you want to rebuild it? I guess if you define well the set of parameters to shape the thing as they were, so do you need it to be squared or ramified or anything? You will have something. Not the exact thing or which was erased, but you you'll get something. You might need the central part, but I guess because that they don't have I guess because they don't have to be able to do that. So, if you only look at the statistics of everything around those particular rates, and you have a model for how to connect things, like how the city is right, you should be after a reasonable guess remember something under a possible to make some assumptions on what's great. It was really less taught, but it was huge for instance. Different. Yeah, very fun talk. I think that there are a lot of cities that are built up like close to bulk waters, like close to rivers, and there are others that were constructed around mountains for defense purposes, or others that spontaneously arises when you make a big roll and then people want to be close to the road. So I am wondering if there are different motives that currently. There are different motifs that characterize these different cities. Which are the motifs that are close to a river, which ones are close to the mountains, which are the ones close to the main roads? If we take the motif of Lee here, I think here there's no constraints of topography, actually. He draws those according to one point and saying, okay, here for this one, we can imagine there's Here for this one, you can imagine there's a river here. I think, according to topography, if you have a river, you will have a blanket in your city and it's like a resource. So it will concentrate a lot of access around it. If you have a mountain, it's not a resource, it's a constraint. So you will minimize the access and because it will be more uh sharp to to to go through. Um to go through. During my PhD we talked about it a little bit and even after during the building of the simulation by saying okay here we simulate on a flat floor with no constraints and the next step is maybe to say here it's maintained here there's a sea, here it has a resource and putting some set of parameters according to this saying okay if there's According to this, saying, Okay, if there's a mountain, we want to pick new nodes there, or very few of them, and we will try to minimize the distance through the slope. And if there's a river we want to connect it, see, it will integrate those kinds of information, I guess. Also, historical information for some cities. But if I understand correctly, your model, which tries to recapitulate what the networks look like, does not include the fact that maybe some motifs were more likely to be done in medieval times versus modern times, right? So did you you didn't incorporate any of that? Actually, I did a whole ton of research. I did not have time to speak here. Have time to speak here, but about those enchant maps. I am currently working on a serious game where all the people are invited to see the actual network on the map and select the world network which is still here to rebuild the data through time. Because analyzing those kinds of evolutions, the real one is very Is very time-consuming because we do not have the vectorial data for all maps. So, Anna, at the beginning of her PhD, we chose three cities and she did the work to digitalize all maps and to understand how those three cities move through time. And it is also through this reflection that we determine the motifs and the parameters l uh linked to the motif. Linked to the motif. But it's really true that we didn't already say, okay, this motif is this period, is from this period, and so to rebuild the network according to real historical period. And I think I will have to collaborate with some historians to do so because I'm not a historian myself. And I have the second question which was very you partially answered it already. How do you get your data? Do you do it I guess now you can I guess now you can use also Google Maps, I guess, right? No, it has. No, actually, my challenge is to be as generic as possible. I want my computation to be working on every city as long as I have the data. And for geographical information, we have OpenStreetMap, which is a kind of Wikipedia for geographical data. And the data is not really. And the data is not really clean, and I am also working on some kind of pre-processing on those kind of data to clean it before putting ways and indicators. But with OpenStreetMap data, it's kind of magic. You see, I wanted to see Calgary and the surroundings, so I just had to download the data, clean it a little bit, and I can have the map of Calgary and so on. And also I just Also, I just take the chance because this is what I proposed for the art exhibition, and the game is to find where it is. The game is to find what cities it is. And this is OpenStreetMap data, yeah. But I clean it. Because in OpenStreetMap, you have many sets of stairs, there are some private things. Prime things and very pollution in the question. This is a city with a lot of square gaps. Sorry? This is a city with a lot of holes. Yeah. All of those holes. Yeah. I made a tip slide. I don't know if I have to show it, but you you have one where it is. I have a question which is related to the previous question. For at least for dense cities. For dense cities, the pattern of streets is roughly the negative of the construction. So, what is the relationship between the kind of habitat and the kind of motif? Because you have skyscrapers or little huts, you don't expect the same motifs, I suppose. So, there must be some energy between the construction and the roads. It's through entities, but see, here. Intidies, but see here there's nothing, you know. Uh, my plane pictures, it's just huge, so it's not constrained by any of the building here. Here we have a city or dense city. In the cities, right. So, the only rule, I think, i it has been a lot of discussion through the multiple city team research team with that. And what I under uh I remember from the I remember from the discussion is the main constraint is to have two slots, passage, plots, two plots between two roads. So to have at least two house, two buildings between two roads. And it's one plot, a minimal size. I'm not sure of myself. I don't want to say something wrong. Maybe Say something wrong. Maybe Stebal can complete it, but in some old African cities or in Venice, you have the houses, and then the free space is where you can walk. But very quickly, it gets structured, it's away. And then the priority is not the housing, it's housing that you can go through.
