I'm on. You can hear me online. Great. Okay, it's a pleasure to be here. I imagine I cannot, we normally begin by thanking the organizers, but it seems like we need to do more than that under these sort of circumstances where they had to work harder to bring us all in here. And it's, as I was saying, my first in-person conference for the last two years or two to three years. And, you know, I can't tell you how different the flavor is being in person. How different the flavor is being in person versus being on Zoom, and um, hats off to the people who are online. I cannot do more than an hour of Zoom if I'm if I'm online. So, hats off, you guys have been really great. Okay, so with that, I want to turn to the topic of today. And this is work that we essentially did over the pandemic. Okay, we took data before the pandemic, and then we kind of beat on this, and that's sort of the beat on this and that's sort of the main purpose of today's presentation. Okay. I want to say that, you know, if I had a sort of simpler marketing way of putting my title, I would call it what we are going to be talking about is tensional twist folding. Okay. So that's what it is. Like you take a sheet and you twist it under tension. What do you get? Okay. And I don't claim to be either pedagogical or chronological. I will just like say it in a, in a way. Just like say it in a way that hopefully makes adds a little bit of excitement to this thing rather than so apologies to Benny, that is what it is. Okay, I pick on you right away. Benny, I'll pick on you. Okay, so the work really is mostly the work of Julian Chopin, who's in Brazil, but we have been collaborating on this for the last 10 years. And this actually advances the cache. Okay. Okay. All right. I did play cricket. Okay. Okay. So that's what we're going to be talking about. And let me just go to the next slide, which probably is here. Great. So that's all set up. So the way one thinks about it is in some sense, sort of going back to when we were hunter and gatherers. When we were hunter and gatherers. So, if you look at it, cat guts were essentially intestine, cat, not automatic, it's mostly made out of cow, boine materials. And so that is your typical starting point. So you have the intestine, which is essentially clean. It's the collagen, which is really the important part. And then if you twist it, okay, so then you make it into cat guts. And they have had applications. They have had applications from making your bow and arrow, you know, going back to the very first application. It has had applications in making tennis rackets, if you like. It's used in packaging food, sausages, all right? And even like the candy, for example, right? There also you start off with a sheet, you enclose something and you twist it. And this little piece here, you can see is what we're going to be talking about. Is what we're going to be talking about. So it's been there for millennia, I feel like, this idea of having sheets, for example, which are easier to manufacture and things like that. And then you make it into something which is actually useful. So in that sense, functional materials. And my favorite among all this is this one here, which is in fact from people in Rajasthan, which is a part of a desert-like country in India. Country in India, very much similar to here, probably at this time of the year, but it's all the time like that. Okay, and so here, for example, this is the headgear, and it's a kind of an interesting movie to watch. We just look at it, like how does he turn a sheet into a twisted, elongated piece like that, and wears it. And the purpose of this is ceremonial, maybe, but you can see it is actually quite well worn, right? And basically, it's used. And basically, it's used from drawing water. So, this thing is almost 60 feet long or 20 meters long, and you can go into the deep wells, use it to do that. You can use it for protecting themselves, protecting themselves against the wind, dust, and so on. So it's like an amazing little story you can read about of this multifunctionality of this kind of sheet. And it's redeployable. You can just use it in different ways all the time. And this person probably used it for 20 years, 30 years before. 20 years, 30 years before you need a new one. And then you can go, like, for example, in fashion, for example, this is a crush dupata. It's kind of like a whale, and you can crinkle it by twisting, for example. So many such applications in which you can find this idea of starting with a sheet and twisting it to make it somehow functional. And this idea has been sort of taken up. And, you know, I think to answer Steve. You know, I think to answer Steve, for example, how did I get into it? Okay, is really this picture over here. And this was in science. I get it at home. If I get it at work, I just toss it without ever reading it. So if I get it home, then I can sometimes read something. And this was the picture which grabbed my attention. And it said that, well, if you start off with a little, so these are carbon nano tubes stretched into a sheet, okay? But it doesn't have to be anything fancy like that. But it doesn't have to be anything fancy like that. You can start off with polyethylene sheets. That was what it was. Here, something like this. And you can twist it. And they claim that you could make it into Archimedean spiral, bispiral, bicecrolls, and all that. And you could, in this case, make it into a yarn and put material inside it. It can be something simple like wax, right? And then if you heat it up, for example, or cool it down, this thing here. Or cool it down, this thing here wants to turn. It wants to expand a contract. And the fact that it's been twisted around so many times and then plied together, for example, will really give you that extra bit, excuse me, that you won't normally think of just as a single string. So the cheap things to make. And Ray Bagman is the group leader in this. And it's been amazing to watch how creatively they have gone about solving very interesting problems, applying this idea of just using. idea of just using twist in some sense to to make into actuators for refrigeration for energy storage and so on okay so that was what um grabbed our attention and um and then looking at it it was like a as a they are material scientists so it seems everything seems obvious to them and so for me nothing was obvious okay so how can you get something so ordered um and so that's when uh julian and i started sort of very simple question Sort of very simple question. A simple question would be: well, if I start off with a sheet, some length L, some width W, all right, and some thickness, so they're all separate from each other in lengthwise. And if I pull on it, okay, if I pull on it, or we pull on it with some tension T and then twist it, what would you get? That's what they seem to be doing. And they were finding all these amazing things to show us. All right, so you can then vary the tension, you can non-dimensionalize it. Tension, you can non-dimensionalize it by and also use different materials. So, everything soft from PDMS to the acrylic sheets, for example, we could change it by many orders of magnitude and therefore be in the sort of stiff regime versus soft regime, if you like. Okay, so there's a lot of parameter space to go here. And then again, length width, aspect ratios, and things like that to explore. Okay, and I think what I want to say is that at the onset, while we have done something, this is a few. While we have done something, this is, I feel, like, an amazing sort of thing to get into if you are interested in going in a new direction. Okay. All right. So, the question is: what are the equilibrium configurations? And so here is sort of the movie, which I'm kind of going to come back to again and again and again, if you like. So, if you don't remember anything of what I said, maybe you remember this. Okay. All right. So, let me see if I, yeah, it's turning. Okay. So, we are looking. Yeah, it's turning. Okay. So we are looking at something, essentially a PDMS or a transparent sheet which is being twisted. So it's being held at two opposite ends there, clamp boundary conditions, just to make life easier and sense, okay, that's what I have. And then we are twisting. So this original sheet is like aspect ratio one and has been stretched a decent amount. And then as you twist, this is the kind of patterns that emerge in this case. Emerge in this case. All right. And so you can do this over and over again. And what is surprising about this, okay, when you start off is that how ordered it is. Okay. So that is something we weren't ready to see quite, actually. And so just to summarize. There's a question from the online audience. Yeah, go ahead. Hi, Yashad, Paulo. A quick question. Does in your experiments, right? Perhaps even in the experiment or the work before, does friction between the fibers matter? Excellent question. Excellent. So there's a hierarchy of questions we can get into. So what happens before there is self-contact? Okay. And then there is after that, there's self-contact. What would happen in that case? And so these are excellent questions you can ask what would happen if there's lubrication between the sheets and things like that. But for right now, Sheets and things like that. But for right now, just to prime you on those things, the one way we can test these questions is that if you twist it and untwist it, if it's sort of there's less hysteresis and things like that, you can say, well, the contact doesn't matter when you go beyond a certain amount or not. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so just to summarize what we just saw, here is the initial wrinkle. Ah, you're here. Okay. The camera is there. The camera is there. Oh, the camera is there. Okay. It's like God, like me not to say. Okay, so just to summarize, you know, so when we twist it, so we are twisting at the ends, you know, doesn't matter what the frame of reference is, but what have you. So here it has wrinkled. This is what it is. By the time you turn it to 90 degrees, depending on the thickness and so on, it starts to wrinkle. In this case, in the transverse direction versus the longitudinal direction, it has wrinkled. It has wrinkled in this case. And then, as we twisted, it itself collapsed. Okay, very neatly. And what I'm going to show you later is that what we find is that the initial wrinkling instability and these folds, number of folds, are related to each other. Yeah. See any that that's the initial mode with like six or seven yes, okay, thank you, yeah, yeah. In this particular example, that's what it is. If you change the aspect ratio and things like that, we'll talk about it. Just to clarify, I just want to so the it looks from like there, there's actually self-contact, but that's not true in this wrinkling. So, this isn't like folding already, okay. Well, yes and no. So, up here in the first, okay, so up to nine. Okay, so up to 90 degrees, when you take the sheet and you twist it, up to 90 degrees, you know, it's by itself. Okay, it's by itself. I'll pass this along so you can have fun too with this. Okay. And it's by itself. It's by the time you come to 180 degrees. Okay. So that's when it starts to contact. So of course, we are showing it to you here in just sort of a bright field imaging. And so it's just a projection is what you're seeing. So there is. Is what you're seeing. So there is no self-contact here. By the time you reach 180 degrees, if it's a thin sheet, it starts to self-contract, contact, excuse me. But if it is not, you have to twist it a little bit more, then it comes into self-contact. We will go over that in a few seconds. But by the time you come here, it is very much pressing against each other. Okay, so this is the regime where it is literally a collapsed structure in the center. Structure in the center, and all the way up here as well, they're in contact. Okay, and so then as you continue on, it starts to wrap around each other. And these are the so-called scrolled yarns that people are interested in understanding what they are. So, again, depending on the initial length to width aspect ratio, you can make this buckle in a different number of wrinkles to begin with, or number of fours, and then you can get. And then you can get different cross-sections, if you like, depending on how you start off with different length and aspect ratio. So that is what we are trying to understand. Yes. The first time you self-contact, the first loop seems to be much bigger than the subsequent loops. Is my question clear? This one here? No, on the right side? This one, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So this is just the entree here. You need to initiate and then afterwards. You need to initiate and then afterwards, yeah, yeah, we'll go over it in gory detail. Maybe not as much in the next 30 minutes, but yes, okay, so that is what it is. And so, we thought this particular last picture was sort of very beautiful and so on. And once in a while, you know, when you say it's beautiful, other people agree too. And so, you know, our editors of science and whatever way they think about it also agreed. And this came out a couple of months ago. Okay. Of months ago, okay. So then, um, uh, if you like, just to kind of go into a little bit more, I'm just introducing the phenomena. I'm actually racing towards the end of the sort of the phenomena and then going to come back, and then we're going to look at this in more detail. Okay, so then depending on the length to width ratio, when it when you you know, you say, say you pick a length of to width ratio, so that was one, the one I showed you, which was here, and then if you're sweeping as you twist angle theta or in some non-dimensional way, tau. Or in some non-dimensional way, tau, then that's what you're doing. Yes, Michelle. I can repeat if it's a short enough question. So you said length to width ratio, just to clarify, because you're also putting this thing under a lot of tension. So is that like the initial size or is it the structure? Yeah, so we will come to it in a second. You have to have a minimum amount of tension before it starts to wrinkle. Absolutely. Okay, so we'll go back. Go back and look at it. Back and look at it, and so there is, if you like, Michelle is pointing out: is there attention important? So, yes, there's a third axis which is coming out towards you, if you like. And then we have a chosen one here, which you are showing, for example. Lots of parameters. But the question is, can you actually pattern what you have to start with? And you can just predict what you want. So, you know, just like, okay, I want this many things and so on. So, can you do that? So, that is our question. Okay. Starting with this kind of. Okay, starting with this kind of soft material. Okay, so I don't want to just keep going. So, this is sort of a little overview of what is to come. And this is going to be quick and dirty. It's 20 minutes already. So, here, what is going to happen, what you saw in terms of words, if you are more word than visual, then basically the initial sheet deformed into a helicoid. Then there were some decorations, small perturbations on this little helicoid structure. Okay, so this is the phenomena, if you like. Okay, so this is the phenomena, if you like. Then it kind of collapsed onto each other. So it's what we call accordion folding. So it literally collapses like an accordion, and then it becomes like a flat sheet. All right. So by this time, you have basically 180 degree twist that you applied here. And then you have a secondary instability. And that's the piece that one of you was alluding to. Okay. And then you get then beyond that, this rolling, which is going on. So that's the phenomena. And then we are not happy. We are not happy with just reporting pretty pictures. So, we want to understand, right? Like, it's a human nature to try and understand what it is that we are looking at. And so, what I'm going to sort of sketch out, if you like, very briefly is the initial modeling that many folks have done. And then, you know, there was a back and forth with experiments and theory. So, that part of the initial wrinkles and so on, I believe, is more or less, you know, your glass is 80% full or 20%. You know, your glass is 80% full or 20% empty, so you can kind of say that the primary instabilities here, I'll sketch that out very briefly, and then sort of the sort of hand-waving or sort of, if you like, simple models that we can understand. Can we understand these transitions? That's what I will go into. Okay, so to give you a little history, I said no, but I will. So here it goes back to Green, the famous applied mechanician. And this was the original picture that you can see in his 36 and a corrected version 37 paper. And so this is basically a steel ruler, traditional steel ruler is what they were clamping here. And if you twist, then that's the helicoid that initially forms. And he presented this analysis of what would happen in this case. Would it be unsatisfactory? What would happen in this case? Would it be unstable or what would happen in this case? If you looked at it, claim that there would be this buckling or wrinkling of this sheet, and there was a picture, and you can't tell what that person is alluding to. There was analysis, but the picture itself is not there. So, this is sort of the now going back 10 years, almost 10 years. This is the work that we did initially just to simply understand what did Greece. understand what did green have in mind and what did other people have in mind so we just started with a with a sheet and if you twist it and this is where i'll start passing this around so this is uh videotape goes right and and this is like the best thing okay i cannot tell you how long we struggle with trying to find the last material and then we found after the fact after a few years oh this works just fine and it's a beautiful demo that i can just pass around and A beautiful demo that I can just pass around. And if you spoil it, I can get a new one, right? So, here you can just play with it. And so, here is what it is, okay? And you can change, you can make it aspect ratio long and so on. And at the end of it all, we were hanging this, the length of our building. All right, so our building is eight floors, and we were hanging it down the center. And sort of, we thought that, you know, if you look at the original. Look at the original focal pendulum and the anniversary, which was in Paris, maybe we could coordinate this. And then instead of this, that we could hang and people twist from the top and so on. But anyway, you talk, but you don't actually do as much. So that is performance art. There you go. But before that, we have the crumpled paper, you know? Paper, you know, anyway. Uh, so let's continue. So, here you take it, and if you twist it, okay, under a little tension, then that's what we're doing. You can see that it's a helicoid initially, all right, ignoring what's happening at the ends. So, at the very ends, you are actually not a helicoid, but far enough away from the edges, it's a helicoid over here. And then you see these kind of dimples. Okay, and so these dimples, and then we're like, is that what Green was alluding to? Like, is that what Green was alluding to? And so on. And so, Kaman and Bassoon, for example, actually wrote a solution. So, the initial analysis of Green actually just said it's going to be unstable, didn't tell you what wavelength it is. And Kaman and Bassoon in 2013, I believe, actually 2008, excuse me, 2008 came up with a way of saying that that should be the wavelength and so on. We'll talk about that. But not only that, you see these transfers buckling. Transverse buckling. Okay, so that is to say that you twist, and so here's the here's the twist angle here and the tension. And to answer Michelle's question, initially, if you don't, you know, you have a certain tension applied, if you twist a little bit, so you're going up along here, then nothing happens. It's just a helicoid. Okay. And just above a certain point, you'll either buckle into the longitudinal buckling over here, or it turns out you can do a transverse buckling. Turns out you can do a transverse buckling. So, this was anticipated or was well advertised in Green's paper, but this one came from left field for us. Okay, right. So, you know, here you are designing sort of structure, which you know is going to buckle in the length, and then suddenly it's buckling a lot earlier. Because if you continue this on, it should buckle over here, but then this transverse buckling comes. Okay, so there's a lot of phase diagram and so on, and I don't want to get trapped in doing that. So, here we had this phase diagram, we had some explanations. Space diagram, we had some explanations for why these various structures form. So, if you keep twisting, for example, go up here, you can see these creased helicoids. And again, if you twist it here, you can see these little wrinkles. If you don't apply too much tension, okay, just go over that and you can see like the sharp teeth-like structures. And if you keep continuing on, you'll be able to see these kind of wrinkles or wrinkles focus. And in that case, you can see that you. That you will have essentially I took a bus ticket and you can fold it, and you will get these kinds of creased helicoids. Okay. All right. So that's the structure we are looking at here. Can I just interrupt for one second? Can you explain to me how is the twist angle defined here on the vertical axis? So the twist angle, there are two ways of defining it. One is theta, which is, thank you. So one is theta, which is just simply the angle between. Theta, which is just simply the angle between the top clamp and the bottom clamp, that's theta. But then we can sort of non-dimensionalize it or normalize it by using length and divided by the width so we can have per unit length. And so there are. Yeah, so I guess what I'm wondering about is what is it here? Because the number 0.8 seems like a really small number to me. And so I'm just trying to understand. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, sorry. This is, we'll go all the way back here. So, eta is going to be theta, the angle that we are twisting through, L divided by W. Okay. So, thank you. And I think, don't worry too much about it. I would say in a five-minute presentation, it's not going, you know. Yeah, but the point is that ADA in some way increases and so on. So, but there is this, well, unfortunately, this is all non-dimensionalized. This is 10 to the This is all non-dimensionalized. This is 10 to the minus 3, just if you're keeping track here. And so it has its benefits and advantages and disadvantages. Okay. So here you can, again, start off with the FBK equation and the version I'm presenting to you here then was done with Vincent and with Benny or they presented this in a more coherent way that I could at least understand. And so then you start off with the sheet, you're looking at a section of this twisted helicoid over here. And if you Helicoid over here. And if you consider a little linear deformation from that, then these equations simplify, and you can get what is the stress along this direction, along the length direction, and what is the stress along the transverse direction. Okay, and so this is the analysis, which you can find it all together in their paper, but it's there in Green's paper too. But what you basically start seeing is But what you basically start seeing is that along the length direction, if you have a certain tension, as you keep twisting, so eta keeps twisting over here, then above a critical point, it becomes compressional. Okay, so that so this was news to me. I didn't like for it. So if you like, you know, you're pulling on this thing, okay? So you're under tension, and then you're twisting, and then And then you're twisting, and there's a wrinkle going along the center. And my feeble brain couldn't grasp that it was actually getting compressional. But once you see it, yeah, then it seems obvious. All you're doing is that you're applying a total tension at the end while you're playing around with. Some of your fingers are small, some of your fingers are bigger. All of you should see this wrinkling. Just have to know it. If you're not, you're a theorist, right? So then, so in this case, what is going on in that initial analysis is that. Going on in that initial analysis is that if you have a modest amount of twist, then that's the stress cross-profile. And then as you keep twisting, it starts getting deeper. And at some point, it crosses zero and it becomes compressional. So that's what the anticipated wrinkling was. And so there will be compression. And so that is happening along the center. So this is a map for eta square over t in some funny units, if you like, after a certain twist, that is it's compressed. twist that is it's compressional in the center and you would expect wrinkles down the center okay all right so that is the sort of uh first analysis so let's let's look at it uh so we have an x-ray tomography machine so we can look at these sheets in great detail and then we can get not only its location but then you can take the the usual derivatives and get the curvature and you can map it okay so initially if you start off with some tension you you twist it it's a helicoid You twist it, it's a helicoid. And so you can test that idea. And then, about a certain critical twist, you can see indeed it is wrinkling in the center. So you can ask, well, where does it wrinkle? How wide is it? And things like that. But then you can look, ask what happens if you look at the transverse wrinkling. And so that was not anticipated. And in our simple-minded way of thinking about it, it was that, well, it should be there. It should be there. And the simplest way to test that is. And the simplest way to test that is that if you hold out your thing here and you twist it, the distance between these two lines, which would be a helicoid if it was a sheet, now is suddenly smaller. So there's going to be compression. And in the linear approximation or the version of the approximation, Green had for his purposes initially, he truncated the expansion to ignore all that and never anticipated it. Okay. Anticipated. Okay, so that was our explanation in our initial paper. And then Vincent and Julian and Benny improved or that sounds like a derogatory word, but wrote a Courier form or a different higher form of the FVK equation and saw that indeed there's a transverse compression which shows up. It's not just zero. Okay, so it can modify. Okay, so if Gamarifi is can I ask a question? Sorry. If instead of twisting along the axis, you manipulated the boundary in a different way, maybe twisting on a different axis or something, could you get some of these wrinkling states to coexist, transversed and longitudinal, for instance? So the scientific answer is I don't know. I mean, I think it's pretty robust, what we are showing you. What we are showing you, but these are all questions we can ask. Well, if I take this thing and I allow the edges, for example, to not only just twist under clamp boundary condition, but I'm allowed to turn, for example, would I get this thing? And so, for example, in the analysis, they consider, they do not consider the ends. You start off with a base helicoid, and you get the same form, and you should have the same instabilities. But now, if I put an additional curve. Now, if I put an additional curvature and I twist it on top of that, I don't know the answer. I don't know whether it will just jump to the looping instability, for example. If I may add something, there is a point in the phase diagram, a single point where these two instabilities meet. Yes. Yes. So yes. yeah yes yes vincent yes so so if you are uh if we you you are at this what we call the lambda point yes you have the longitudinal buckling and the transverse buckling which is the horizontal the the open triangles they meet at this point so at this point you have uh i i don't know if you can say that they coexist at least the the the two line the two lines uh meet The two lines, the two lines meet for two instabilities. Yeah, so uniquely speaking, we find in the experiment either one or the other. Yeah, but that's due to imperfections, right? It is, but it's a contimension to bifurcation point, so they meet in a point. But in the experiment, you'll always have imperfections. So it'll be on one branch or the other. Yeah, so I lied when I said we don't know anything beyond. So we have done some experiments where if you change the boundary condition, Where, if you change the boundary condition instead of a full clamp, but actually have pinched, you get coexistence of the phases. You get these transfers at the edges over here and longitudinal in the center. And as you keep twisting, they invade each other and so on. So now it's all like how many people and how much money do you need to plot all these things out, right? And so, yeah, okay. All right. So I am like, I have 10 minutes, right? So, so, anyways, I'm going to be very superficial. Basically, their model. Their model now predicts not only the critical angle at which you should get the instability, but also the wavelength. And so then my point with all this sideshow was that you can actually predict the wavelength of the instability. So here, before doing any experiments, I always joke, no, I'm very serious, that as an experimentalist, my goal is never to do the experiment again. My goal is never to do the experiment again. All right. So, like, if I can describe it in some way, then I don't want to repeat the same experiment. They are very hard to do. And so, if I can, then I want to do something else. Okay. So, now this is done. So, sorry about that. So now we're actually going into what this study is about. And so here, this is what we are seeing. So going beyond this transfers here into strategy. So this is what surprised us. This is what surprised us. We actually were just stuck so much down here that we didn't realize all this was happening. You could say the same thing about spiral defect chaos, right? In the instance that it was always waiting to be discovered. So here it folded this way was surprising to me. So anyway, so the question is, why does this happen? I'm going to give you a little bit of sketches and then I think I'm going to get through half my presentation. So basically using the X-ray Using the X-ray tomography, we get the shape, we get the local curvature, and so we can cast it in terms of the mean curvature here. And so, these are the color codes that you see here. So, this is the actual sheet rendering, and the color imposed on it is the local curvature. And so, here it is sort of folded out so you can see it a little bit more clearly. And so, in this case, as you twist, all right, so all what we were talking about earlier so far was just up to 90 degrees, and now you're going to all this. Degrees, and now you're going to all this other fun stuff. So, here you start seeing these creases now getting deeper. Okay, so the valley and ridges forming really well, they start to turn in this case, and they start meeting, if you like, at the top and bottom section of the sheet. Okay, so you can quantify all this, and you can say that, well, the energy density here is such that these peaks are getting tall, but they're not shifting in relation to each other. But they're not shifting in relation to each other, and therefore the folds are related to the primary instability. So, how far does the usual question, like you know, you have a primary instability? How far beyond onset is this any your primary instability relevant? So, it seems it is relevant for particular loss. So, so we thought about it a lot, we talked to a lot of people, and this is the best we could come to. Okay, so imagine what are we looking at? What are we looking at? Imagine I start off with a sheet, a piece of paper here. Sheet, a piece of paper here, and I take the diagonal, I cut it. Oh, excuse me, fold it along that. So that's what it is. And imagine now, this paper is not a really paper, it's a little bit elastic, and I can stretch it. Okay, so that's what that is. All right, so that's one. If I have a higher mode, I can start off with a larger sheet or wider sheet, excuse me, fold it into this kind of origami structure, fold it, and then pull on it. And then you will get sort of a rendering of what seems. Uh, sort of a rendering of what seems like to first order what we are seeing. Okay, so you can go on and do this. And I took some time tomorrow yesterday and folded that for you. And so here, for example, this is the initial sheet. And what we are looking at as we twist is that it collapses on each other. And that's sort of the origami mechanics that we're starting. So to first order, all right. So that is what that is. So you can play with that. Okay. And the second thing I want you to do also is when you. thing I want you to do also is when you when you have this in your hand, look at it. You can see it's turning, so it's twisting, but also hold it against the light or something bright and see what structure you see. All right, so that is sort of, it seemed like that's what we were seeing, if you like. And so, like, you know, it's fine to just say that, but now we want to make it more quantitative. Is how is it true or not? Is how is it true or not? Look at a very bright light. Sunlight would be great, but maybe just a bright light would work. Okay, so then you can see that you start off with sheets. These are the folds that we have, and you can twist it. So that's the origami kinetics. So even though we start off with the sheet, which is kind of stretchy, okay, this is the most interesting thing, actually, of what I'm going to say, that you can actually capture with simple origami the overall structure. This is the spherical cow, okay? So this is the first. Okay, this is the spherical cow. So, this is the first-order thing that you can capture this very complicated structure using that. And if you put it against backlight, you can see these kind of spokes as well, which you can see that that's the density of material you're looking through. And so you can try to quantify this. Okay, what is it in beta in our sheet, which is clearly stretched? You can see that this is straight here, this is edged here. How well does that capture? And to first approximation, it does quite well. Yes, Benny. It does quite well, yes. Benny, did you ask a question? Sorry, yeah, yes. I know that you are short in time, and that, but in what sense, what is the statement that origami explains this? So, although this is explained by origami, I'm so to me. How does that sheet as you turn, what is the shape that you see? And what would origami theory, let's say, or framework will tell you that you can verify with this picture? So here. This picture, so here, if I just do this folding that the thing which is going around, and I do that twist, yeah, okay, it explains to me the overall, the skeleton of the structure that we are seeing in this elastic material. What prediction can you make with origami's mindset that you verify in this plot? So, here, so here, so that's that's exactly right. So, here, so what we're going to do is that we're going to say, well, that's my primary instability down the center. Instability down the center. Okay, it is related to the number of folds. And therefore, if I look at these things here, which are triangles, all right, these triangles here is going to correspond to the wavelength, and then it's the length. And therefore, the angle here is going to be a certain alpha, this affects angle, which is determined by the initial instability. And then using this sort of very simple picture, we can at least rationalize what we are seeing. Rationalize what we are seeing in terms of the experiment. Rationalize, yeah, yeah, you know, so rationalize where it comes from and you know, it's like each thing. And so you can then look at that structure you were looking at, and then you can look at yeah, so I just to pick up Benny's question, I mean, when we crumple paper, we're accustomed to the idea that you're creating folds and singularities, but it's chaotic. Singularities, but it's chaotic, sort of. Here, your picture is very similar to that, except the folds, or at least sort of they're not sharp folds, but you get this very orderly structure that is a mix of very smooth regions that are almost homogeneously strained and these fold structures. Yes. And our claim is most of that stretching is happening actually. Most of that stretching is happening actually at the top and the bottom where you're clamping at the center. It is essentially, yeah, it's almost like taking a piece of paper here, and you can actually say something about the stretchy material that you know normally you rely on. If you take three angles and you stretch it to not only a deal, yes, yes, but again, you can describe, and again, this is where the experiments come in, and then you can actually see that these approximations. And then you can actually see that these approximations, if you like, are capturing to first order what we see. That's one. Not only that, so you know, you can do just by hand, but also these kind of fluoroscopy. That's those are that. Sorry, you had a question over there. I can follow. Okay, so sorry to follow up on that further. So you folded it strategically into triangles. So does that collapse rely on it being a triangle? Is but if I just fold it in parallel lines. If I just fold it in parallel lines, it doesn't work. It doesn't work, which is yeah, so it's it's a yeah, you can you can take that sheet of paper and and indeed we tried that and it doesn't work and so here if you do it at an angle then it actually twists as as you try you know it it you know you don't end up uh destroying it it it follows along with that okay is there something that strikes me when you do the orogemi uh the edges make make like a fun kind of shape yeah Make like a fan kind of shape. And so, what sets the which I understand and that you do not get in the experiment? And what sets, in a sense, what sets the length of this of the of the overlapping regions? Yeah, so here, if you like, as we go, so Benny's absolutely right, it stretches everywhere. Okay, it stresses at the center, it stretches the, you know. And the center it stretches the, you know, really speaking, less. And do you have like a singularity on the on the on the on the starting of the overlapping regions or something like that? Like like a decon kind of shape or something? No, no, no, no. These are just simple. These are simple ridges. Okay, okay. Yeah, simple ridges here. That's all. And so the obvious thing was surprising to me, maybe again, that if you start off with a line here, that when you twist it, it becomes angled. You can compare these angles. You can compare these angles in the elastic sheet and in the paper, goes along if you like. And in that sense, it is quantitatively similar. You can use fluoroscopy and look at these apex angles, if you like, here. And again, they scale. I'm going to be very, I'm beyond the time. And so you can rationalize this. Okay. So this was, if you like, up to here. And the whole presentation then becomes: okay, if I continue twisting. Okay, if I continue twisting, what happens? So then the question is: if I have the sheet over here, it has self-folded onto itself. So you have any cross-section if you look at, which has folded. This is a cross-section, and you can cartoonize what we see here. And then we are twisting a sheet, which is effectively thicker. And so it goes through a secondary instability, which is effectively thicker sheet. And so that is our. Thicker sheet. And so that is our recursive folding. It doesn't get stretched, so it's not quite a Baker map, but it's literally getting folded and folded. And if it happens three times, it can happen infinitely many times if it's thin enough is our logic. So that is how it goes forward. And then you can... How much time do I have? I know the answer. Another 10 minutes. Oh, really? Okay, because you've just finished your 45 minutes, I think. Your 45 minutes, so I think there are other five. Okay, all right. So I try to avoid questions, but it looks like you have lots of stuff. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but you know, there's I'm here, so yeah. I think this, yeah, yeah. So here is again the fluoroscopy, and you can ask, well, if I follow one of these edges, color it, like how does it look? So then you can see that the sheet itself. Then you can see that the sheet itself is sort of localizing its twist at the waist. Okay, so you can see that you know, if I start off with something like this, initially it is turning on itself, it's become a thin waist, and after that, as we keep turning, it's the center which twists, and the rest of it is getting planar. It remains planar, excuse me. And this starts growing as we go on. So that's a simple geometry. And so we're going to ignore all this structure over here. All these structures over here, and then consider only: okay, this is a cartoon spherical car idea that this is a plane, even though there are lots of beautiful structures here. We'll ignore all that. That's the sheet. And then if you look at it, it's like a spiral over here. Okay, so then you can just use geometry. You can just say that, well, I'm going around, it's a pitch, and if that pitch continues off in that same direction, then I can geometrically calculate what should be the length of the yarn. Calculate what should be the length of the yarn, and that will grow exponentially or will approach it exponentially. The length over here, which is the maximum it can grow. And so we can get a sort of simple way of telling you that if you twist it so much, that will be the center section where there will be a yarn which will grow. And then they will be connected at both ends to a sort of fan-like structure, which will just sort of rotate. Okay. And then if you have this on rollers rather than. This is on rollers rather than pinchers, then you can just continue to grow this yarn forever and create whatever structure that you started off, depending on the aspect ratio, which is the initial wrinkling, and then and then this self-holding and so on. So this is for larger scatter. Yeah, yeah, so this is this is like going, this is going a whole hard, like beyond primary instability and things like that. But what I want, the point I want to tell you is that it seems point I want to tell you is that it seems and at least as experiment is concerned it has an impact okay the second uh fun fun thing which I didn't know is like okay how much torque do you need to twist the structure okay so you are you're doing this and how much torque do I need to twist the structure and so this is the torque apparently so m is the torque that you apply and okay so as we are twisting here that is theta and you get these Theta, and you get these nice sort of sawtooth-like structures. So, this is this one I'm showing is three, which is the blue one here. But as you make the aspect ratio smaller, you get more and more of these peaks. Okay, so the way you can, the two-minute explanation would be that you can actually understand why it increases and decreases. Okay, and that is basically like: imagine I take this thing here, I'm gonna go. This thing here, I'm going to go back and forth. I'm going to actually show you this video and then say that: well, when we stretch, as you twist, the edges are where most of the tension is located. So if I now imagine I replace the whole thing, okay, it's not quite the same, but just to in the two-minute explanation here, if I look at just two strings which are being twisted together, all right, and ask what does the torque of that look like? Yes, it increases. Yes, it increases, but surprisingly, it will decrease. And you can argue that after you think about it very easily, you can say, well, here it's increasing, as you would expect. But then as it rotates and collapses on each other, that's it. You are at this point torquing something which is pretty much on top. It's just given by the thickness of the sheet. And so that's why you have a peak and a decrease, which almost goes to zero, except the point where it touches. Yeah. But that is, yeah, so I mean, it's I let you know, let us not try for me to finish everything. Just it's fine, don't worry about it. Go ahead. Yeah, yeah, I think it's more fun to have some discussion. So, so this data is the actual theta back to query question or data over motive. No, this is actual theta. Okay, so if according to your explanation, If, according to your explanation, yeah, if or maybe I totally missed it, but I would expect this peak in the curve to be scaled with, not to occur at the same theta, but to occur at the same value of theta over of eta, over L over W. So this peak here is slightly shifted. But this should be by factor of three because you have you can take this and you can tell that this is when it is. Can tell that this is when it is orthogonal, roughly orthogonal, is when you have the maximum, the peak. Okay, so and then it'll start decreasing. So you say it's really to leading order in W over L? About 90 degrees. It should occur always at 90 degrees. Not always, but about, yeah. Yeah, yeah. Up to corrections. Okay. Yeah. And these plots do collapse or not? Or maybe you will shift? No, they will shift. They shift. And here, for example, if you, this is, this is the data. For example, if you this is this is the data, for example, with just two filaments twisting, and so yes, you can see that this is the larger aspect ratio there to the left and they're turning to the to the right as things go on. So yes, I mean there is a formula and I can show you what that is. And so we can then integrate, if you like, these filaments along the edges. So this is the one I showed you was in terms of the edges here, but then you can integrate as if there are many, many filaments along the length, calculates its energy, take its theta derivative. Take its theta derivative, and you can get what should be the torque as a function of amount of stretching you get. And you can see here that if it is not stretched as much, that's the blue one here, it is peaked over here. And as you keep stretching, that peak will shift to the left, okay, as they get further apart. But nonetheless, you can capture this by a simple argument of this kind. So, that is, in some sense, So, that is, in some sense, a summary of where we are. I think I'm going to just stop here. I have fall sunsets, excuse me, so there's more to discuss, but I think it's best to just stop in your head. And so if you like, you can sort of at least rationalize a lot of these observations. You can come up with this kind of simple origami-like way of describing at least the way it starts to fold, even though this is an elastic sheet, which is kind of interesting. Sheet, which is kind of interesting, and then you can go on and that's just use simple geometry to at least get a sense of what are these qualitative features that we are seeing, these features that they are starting to become localized in the center, that the torque increases and decreases, and so on. So we've done other works again, starting with filament bundles and twists and so on, but we'll leave that to another time. Okay, and the final comment. And the final comment I would say is that even though I said, you know, the primary instabilities are well understood and things like that, I think there's a lot more to be done. There's a whole lot of questions. And I will close with this advertisement for Madeline and Ogiovana, who have done actually a simulation. So we have been, this was before the pandemic. We started together and now we are all on Zoom. But she has been actually able to simulate. able to simulate using not FEM, but using sort of a network of springs and vertices here, randomly distributed, not triangular lattice, but randomly. And if you twist, then they're able to capture all the patterns that we see. They can capture the phase diagram quite well. And then as usual, when you can look at these things in great detail, you realize that there's a lot more to be done even at the primary instability. Primary instability. Okay, so I'm not by no means saying that our work is done even in that level. So I'm going to just stop there and take any questions that I have. And my apologies for going beyond that.
