Today I'd like to talk about explicit Worshewitz inequalities. And I think in the abstract I said for shrinking solitons or possibly for mean coverage flow solitons. But I thought since it's a rather focused workshop on geometric flows and there are a lot of experts in the audience who may or may not have seen this talk before, and because we also have a diverse group, I thought I would start kind of extremely generally, hopefully don't overreach, and sort of relate back. And sort of relate back to mean curvature flow, which is sort of the main focus, at least for the applications that I want to talk about. So, the sort of two questions that I have in mind. So, there's two extremely general questions for geometric PDE or PDE for geometric structures more generally. So, the first one is what I What I've been going around calling logidic. And so this is the question of: is a particular solution isolated in the space of solutions? Okay, so again, it's an extremely general question. Anytime you have a structure, and especially any time you have a special solution, maybe it has some symmetry or one that you like more, you could ask this question. And this question usually comes with a caveat, if your geometric PD has some symmetries. So obviously, if you do have some symmetries, then you just deform it, and of course, the answer is no. So we should usually introduce just a little caveat here. Just a little caveat here: modular data centries. So that's question one. The second question is this question of sort of uniqueness, more generally of limits, that I think sort of probably everyone anticipates where I'm going. But so the question of limits is, of course, normally we take a limit using some sort of compactness theorem. Some sort of compactness theorem, in particular, some sort of sequential compactness theorem. And so, sort of a priori, what we get is sub-sequential convergence. So is the limit, let's say, of geometric objects, is it really a genuine limit meaning? Meaning, is it unique, independent of the subsequence? So these are the two, again, extremely general questions that I wanted to start with, and I think everyone's familiar with these questions. You know, they come up for almost any geometric PD. Okay, so maybe. Okay, so maybe I'll copy these over and use it. Okay, so if we specialize just very quickly to geometric flows, there's a few different limits we can take. But one we've been interested in in some of the talks at this conference is, for example, the long time limit. For example, the long time limit. So we could look at that. If we do produce something in the long time limit, we know we really expect it to be a static solution. And so sort of the related problem is going to be the rigidity. So whether a static solution Is isolated. So you can already see these. These should somehow be related. If a static solution was really isolated, then it's the only possible thing it could be. You see one limit going there, then there's nothing in that neighborhood, and really there's nothing else it could be. Okay, so sort of another extremely general limit that we might want to take is if we Want to take is if we don't manage to make it to a long time limit, something must have gone wrong. We probably hit a singularity on the way. And again, as mathematicians, we always want to study what goes wrong. And sort of the way we do that is with a blow-up analysis. So what we might want to do is take a blow-up limit and sort of And so, if we take a blow-up limit, we don't expect the limit to be a static solution anymore, but for a flow, we expect it to be some sort of soliton solution. So we have the rigidity of a soliton solution is sort of the related question here. And again, these two are connected, as you might expect. So if you do this blob limit, okay, so maybe you need to take a sub-sequence, but if you play some tricks, Take a sub-sequence, but if you play some tricks, maybe you can do a continuous rescaling. So if you can find an appropriate rescaled flow, then that exchanges a blow-up limit for the long time limit of the rescaled flow. And so we correspondingly, again, we ask this question of rigidity of solvent on the other side. So, I think it's maybe time to get a bit concrete. So, the sort of main example I have in mind is for mean curvature flow siltons. Okay, so just to, you know, I don't want to spend too much time going over the definition of the nth time for mean curvature flow, but for me, But for me, it's again something where the velocity is the mean curvature vector, and I'm going to consider sub-manifolds of Euclidean space. So sigma t m, always in Euclidean space, but of any co-dimension. And the sort of notion of blow-up that I'm going to focus on, so I'm not going to focus on sort of general limit flows that give translators or anything, but I just want to focus today on tangent flows. Or anything, but I just want to focus on tangent flows. And so those are, you know, where I take, let's write it out explicitly. So I take this limit of so what I would do was uh take the space-time So what I would do was take the space-time track of my floor, dilate it about a fixed space-time point x by a factor lambda, and then take lambda to infinity. And again, so the real question is whether this limit is really a limit as written or if it depends on choosing a sub-sequence lambda here. Okay, just to remind you, this is the power. Okay, just to remind you, this is the parabolic dilation. Okay, so d lambda acts on xt by scaling x and then scaling time twice. Okay, but we can sort of again avoid any of these complications if we take the rescaled flow. So if I instead take sigma tilde s to be some scaling of sigma t, where s is minus logic minus t. So if you check this out, this is something doing the parabolic dilations, but again in a continuous way. So maybe I should have said. So, maybe I should have said by Fisk and monotonicity, sort of your intuition works. So, one of the reasons why mean curvature flow is a good place to develop this series because you have good notions of weak limits. You can sort of do all these things freely. So you take this limit, and if you get a limiting object, you expect it to be invariant under the dilation process. The dilation process. And so being invariant under parabolic dilation means that the tangent flows are modeled on self-shrinkers. These are flows. Sigma t is always proportional to a particular time slice, and if you pick the minus one time slice as your normalization, that's what we call a shrinker. That's what we call a shrinker. And these satisfy an elliptic PDE. So the mean curvature vector. Again, that's supposed to be the velocity of the flow, so it points exactly in the dilation direction. So those are shrinkers, and then we had this rescaled flow. We had this rescaled flow, and the rescaled flow now it satisfies. So the velocity is no longer just the mean curvature, you've added this continuous dilation in, and so you're really forcing it to move outwards. So it's the mean curvature vector plus this dilation term. So sometimes it's called the shrinker mean curvature. I just want to give it a name. Curvature, I just want to give it a name phi here, if you excuse the handwriting. And so, in particular, here, again, as we said, so we're looking at tangent flows, the soliton solutions relevant are shrinkers. If we go all the way around to the rescaled flow, then we're looking at the long time limit, right? The S goes to infinity limit, which should be a static solution of the rescaled flow, and so that's a, again, that's a shrinker, right? Again, that's a shrinker, but we can see just from phi equals zero that is really a shrinker. Maybe a shrinker equation is missing on my answer. Yeah, so it should be shrinking, not expanding. Excuse me. Okay, so again, this is all expected from this general setup. And I should mention again, so I think it's sort of well known that the mean curvature flow is in some sense the negative L2 gradient flow of area. The rescaled flow satisfies something similar. So if rho is the Gaussian area, then Then let me not write it out precisely, but phi is essentially the gradient of the Gaussian area where Gaussian area is exactly the integral against that curve. So, in particular, this is the negative gradient flow, it can be token as the negative. It can be token, that's the native radio flow for the Gaussian area capital. Okay, so I just really quickly reinterpret these two questions in terms of shrinkers. So we're asking, you know, is the shrinker Uh we're asking is the shrinker isolated in the space of shrinkers. And the only symmetries really of the Schrinker equation are ambient rotations in Euclidean states. So you have modular rotation. And on the other hand, the uniqueness question is. On the other hand, the uniqueness question is sort of if one tangent flow gives you a, is modelled on a particular shrinker, are they all modelled on the same shrinker? So as we mentioned, these are related, but they're actually, there's sort of no concrete information. Actually, there's sort of no concrete implication either way. So, again, this sort of caveat that we had to introduce due to the symmetric equations means that rigidity does not imply uniqueness anymore. Okay, so it doesn't imply, but it does imply essentially the uniqueness of the type of tangent code. Alright, and so if you're sort of familiar with the work, this is why for colleague in Minikotzi, they care, you know, they pose the question as, you know, is there no rotation of the axis? So somehow you already know they should all be cylinders, but maybe the axis is a concern. And in the other direction, so you definitely have nothing right if you So you definitely have nothing right. If you have uniqueness of tangent flows, it's not stronger than rigidity, right? So it's entirely possible that the flow just chooses out a particular shrinker that it likes, even if you have a lot in the same neighborhood. So we come to my favourite part, which is to review a bit of history, and so hopefully I don't get any dates or names wrong. But let's do a little bit of review for the encounter plot. So Felix, who I don't know if he's still awake, but Sir Felix, I can. So Felix back in 2012, or again, I think this is the right archive date. So he improved uniqueness for any closed shrinker. So hopefully by the end of the talk, if I get to discuss some of the technical details, we'll see why somehow, not to take away from Felix's work, but somehow having a non-compact model introduces sort of Non-compact model introduces sort of much more significant technical difficulties. Okay, so this is really great progress, but then as we saw, not every shifter is closed. So Collin and McCotzy 15, I think, or maybe I want to write 13. So Conning and McCotzy proved uniqueness for round. Proved uniqueness for round cylinders. So that is SK plus N minus K. And also the rigidity. So they did get both, and the second one, I guess, is strictly with Hilmada, maybe slightly earlier. And that's it. There's a distinction here that this is for the original result is for round cylinders in codimension one. And then just recently, well, a couple of years ago now, the same thing. So again, both results for cylinders, but in a co-dimensional sort of more recently still. More recently still, Evans, Lote, and Felix again. So amongst other things in this paper, it's a really nice paper where they sort of encourage you to be brave and work in higher order. But they, amongst other things, managed to show the rigidity for the Cliffordaurus, so S1 to S1. And then, sort of, a couple of results that are relevant to me. So, with our site at Chicago last year, we upgraded this to rigidity for SK plus SL. So, any product of two spheres, two shrinking spheres. So, just Um so just me and I did so both questions uniqueness uh and rigidity for um so for for certain cylinders gamma k plus i minus k. And so the sort of conditions I need are kind of technical, but I'll just say maybe the most important couple of cases. So the scammer includes Includes so it includes the round case, so it could be SK, which gives you just the round cylinder. And so that gives you in particular a new proof of the Kolinger-Kotze result. And also the case where gamma is an upper Schleimer curve. So if you So if you're not familiar, these are like the unique immersed convex shrinking curves in R2. And sort of this case answers a question of Kolkata and Minikotzi. So those are those the two most important cases. I should also give a shout out that's Also, give a shout-out that's sort of it doesn't fit this chain of work that we'll see, but it is related to these questions. So, Otis, Choch, and once Felix managed to show uniqueness of tangent flows for asymptotically conical trinkets. And so So, what really ties this progression is that sort of well, I guess Felix in his original paper and Otis and Felix used Hoy-Shebich inequalities in sort of the sense of Simon, so more of a reduction to the abstract Hoyers-Shebich inequality, whereas all of the rest involve what I've been calling explicit Orchevich. Calling explicit water shape inequalities, or in other words, really proving it directly for the shrinker model you have in mind. Okay, and we'll investigate what that means directly in a minute. Yeah, so this is these are the, I hope these statements are clear. Yeah, that's right. That's what it's called. Yeah, so just smoothly. Okay, so those are pretty much the developments for mean curvature flow. Part of my talk is to sell that this is a a rather general method, so I uh want to mention just one more result. So for for Ritchie flow oh, so for Ritchie uh So, for Richie Shankers. So, the uniqueness is a little harder to understand because maybe the notion of weak flow is not well understood, at least to me. So, maybe if Richard or one of the other experts understands how to do it, maybe they can take some run with it. But so, for Richie Schrinkers, there's so recently how, and I proved this. And I proved this rigidity result for S2 cross S2. So again, products of spheres. And just to put this into context, so maybe the one I won't write is that for spheres as Ritchie shrinkers, so you have no Jacobi fields if the dimension is greater than 2, and if it's equal to 2, then they're all integrable. So that's why we sort of don't care about dimensions other than 2. Other than two. Previously, there was work of Kruker. So Krinka gave sort of second-order conditions for rigidity. In particular, I think he proved it for CP. 2n. Hopefully, I haven't got it backwards, but he conjectured that the other one is rigid. So 2 plus 1. And he also did conjecture the S2 cross S2 case that we did. Okay, and then sort of maybe a few weeks after ours, there was this paper about William Wayne. So I think they claimed rigidity for Sn minus 1 as well. I think that's claimed Lee and Bing Mong. And then sort of very shortly after this, so Colmingham and Kotzi came out with their paper and tried to brutalize them. So they claimed the rigidity for anything. The rigidity for any cylinder, so any Sn minus K cross Rn minus K. And then, so I think we're told to expect the uniqueness to come soon if you look at the instruction. But again, sort of all of these results rely on well, so all of these. All of these results rely on a similar idea to the formula. Okay, so I think the sort of Boy Shavitz technique is pretty well established, but maybe not studied so carefully by everyone. So I thought I might just quickly review the idea of what a Way-Schever is, why it might be related to these two questions that I put up, and also what I mean by an explicit Word of Schaevich inequality. So the classical theorem And there are sort of many equivalent inequalities, so there's a small chance I butcher this, but the gist of it is we take an analytic function and let's just assume for simplicity that the origin is a critical zero. Then, so in a neighborhood of the origin, we have one of the equivalent inequalities is that the distance to the critical set can be estimated by the gradient with some exponent alpha on the distance. Uh hop up on the distance. I don't know, if you're more used to algebraic geometry, you might see the zero set in here. It's again more or less equivalent to fiddling with your function. And again, another equivalent one is where we are, instead of measuring the distance to the critical set, we can measure the values. We can measure the values of the actual function. So we measure the difference of fx with f0, but f0 is not. So fx, the value is also controlled by the gradient with some other exponent here. Okay, so seemingly simple statement. Let's just quickly take a look at the relation to uniques. So the relation is going to come to the Is going to come to the gradient flow of this analytic function f. Or more strictly to the negative gradient flow. If I take dtx as minus the gradient of f, then what we'll be concerned about is the uniqueness of the t goes to infinity limit. Again, so uh Again, so it's easy if you know it, but maybe if you haven't seen it before, it's obvious. But sort of to prove this uniqueness, it's enough to prove that the length of the trajectory is finite. So you're not oscillating between lots of different critical points. But again, I can replace this by the radiator vap. And sort of the whole point of doing Sort of the whole point of doing a negative grading flow is that you have this formula by the chain rule. So I can also replace this by a time derivative of that. And so if you sort of work this out, if you integrate by parts in the right way, it's actually sufficient to prove a polynomial rate of decay for the function f. Okay, so if you buy that, but this is actually a consequence of the same formula, right? So if df dt is minus rad f squared, then I can use the second inequality here, so sometimes called the gradient void image. If I use that inequality, then suddenly df/dt is better. Then suddenly df/dt is bounded by minus f to the 2 beta. And now I just have a simple differential inequality. So this one is from Loch Shantz. And this one implies that f is over t to the minus 1 over 2 by the minus 1. Okay, so that's the change. Okay, so that's the general scheme to prove uniqueness from the gradient World Shed inequality. This gradient form is also the form that Leon Simon uses for his Worship inequality. So that's great, but then I did sort of claim that these inequalities should be related to rigidity as well. So in this case, it would be rigid. So, in this case, it would be rigidity of the static solution or a critical point of this function. Okay. So, a priori, it says nothing. So, even the first one that conveniently mentions the critical set doesn't actually tell you anything. So, this one says nothing. Because it does tell you what the critical set is, it just tells you the distance to the critical. Set is, it just tells you the distance to the critical set. But on the other hand, you know, we just do a thought experiment if zero were an isolated critical point. Then we would expect the following inequality to hold. Then we would expect the distance from x to 0 to somehow be bounded by the gradient. Right, so if locally I knew that the critical set was just given by zero, that's the inequality that I would get. And so an inequality of this form, this is what I want to call an explicit like a term, what I shared call. So, in particular, we don't So, in particular, we don't go through the classical framework, we try and prove something like this directly, and if we succeed, then it does tell us what the critical set has to be. So, in particular, just, you know, if you prove this, you just, okay, so if crad f is zero, then x has to be zero. So, it's explicit and that identifies the critical set and And for us, in the way we do it, we get a little bonus. So we don't just identify the critical set, we also find the exponent explicitly. So I think I'm only going to state one theorem in the context of mean curvature flow. So I'll state our result with L for the Clipper treasures. So you can think of this as an example of the method. So let's fix our base model. So that's SK cross SL, and of course normalized correctly. So if I have another sub-manifold which doesn't have to be a tracker and it's close in the right topology. Okay, so by being close, you know, we can write this very concretely as that it's a graph of some vector field, and that vector field is C2 alpha epsilon close. But the sort of conclusion is that I can rewrite it. So C max is a normal graph over possibly a rotation of the paths, right? And let's say it's a graph. Let's give that a name. So the best vector field here is going to measure the distance to the set of rotations of sigma naught. So in particular, we prove those estimates. So we can prove that. So we can prove that the L2 norm of V is controlled by the L2 norm of phi, subject to an exponent of 3 here. So again, it wasn't clear. So this is supposed to be analogous to that distance word shape. So on the left-hand side here, you can think of this as the distance from sigma to the edge. To the SON action on sigma naught. And again, phi is supposed to be the gradient of the relevant function. Okay, so hopefully it's clear that this does represent distance word shared inequality. And we also proved the other one. We also proved the other one, the gradient we showed which I'm calling. So f of sigma minus f of sigma naught is also controlled by the L20 of phi, and now with the explicit exponent, three quarters. So, yeah, I think I don't want to state the inequality for cylinders. There is a lot going on, but it's also very technical. So, maybe if we have time, someone can ask. But yeah, I think it's sort of better with this group to sort of try and go into how the proof works. So, there's something suspicious here, which is why do we get this nice exponent 3? And that'll come out of the proof. Okay, so the proof idea is to study just the title expansion. expansion. So the quantity, I'm trying to solve phi equals, well phi equals zero for rigidity, but then quantifying things by phi, so I should expand that about my base shrinker. And so sort of various iterations of this idea have come about, but you sort of well you Well, you need a little bit of brave enough to actually see it through, and then also you need a little bit of finesse to sort of make it quantitative in this way. So the series expansion is just phi is phi is zero at sigma naught. And then just formally, take the first derivative and then apply it to. Apply it to my deformation direction, and then I have some quadratic form, and then I have my cubic form, and so on. And so, what I really want to do is study the behavior of this. And yes, if we not, or that is That is giving equals zero. And sort of roughly, this corresponds to inverting this power series. So the idea is sort of, can I solve this out one order at a time? So I want to really though the right thing to do is to view. Really the right thing to do is to view phi as an error term. So I mean, basically two things can happen. Either I can, if I'm interested in the rejected state, either I can solve it out and find a close by point that also satisfies pi equals zero, or I can't. And so if I find an obstruction to solve this equation, if I find a uniform obstruction, Find a uniform instruction, then if I always find an obstruction and I make this obstruction uniform, then I can prove an inequality like this. That's the goal. And sort of there's a few easy cases. So easy case number one. Easy case number one is where, so let's call the linearization, let's just give that a name, let's call it L. So the easy case is where this is invertible, right? Or in other words. So kind of trivially there in the kernel of zero. Okay, so if it's invertible, then, okay, up to higher order terms, phi is just a invertible linear map of phi. So straight away, Of phi. So straight away, you have that, at least formally, phi is of the order of v, and then you're just done. So this is sort of the super easy case. Okay, let's do easy case number two. Easy case number two. Okay, so easy case number two happens when, again, sort of the polar opposite happens. So in easy case number two, Elvis'sorem. Okay, so that first term completely disappears. And sort of the next best way you can get an obstruction is if the next term is sort of uniformly non-trivial. So L equals zero and And this quadratic form is, so I think the right word is anastotropic. But in any case, sort of it's supposed to be just that d squared phi acting on d is always not true. Well, so by scaling you have to have a B. So, by scaling, you have to have a v squared here, and the only questions can't be kind of zero out at some point. Okay, but if you have this again, so up to higher order, you're just represented by the second order term. And so immediately we should expect this sort of inequality. So, here with the exponent 2. Okay, so the the question is what do you do if uh well what do you do if the kernel is a proper subspace Right, so for geometric problems you're almost certainly gonna have a kernel, at least coming from symmetries. Even if you could not out the sort of kernel, the integrable kernel. The integrable kernel, you still very often, for the interesting models, have potentially non-integrable things in the kernel. And so sort of the two easy cases aren't that helpful all the time. Okay, and I should probably make it clear at this point, I don't know how to handle the general case, right, so I don't know how to handle any situation. But sort of we can give conditions that are similar, right? Conditions that are similar, right? So refining slightly, and then basically we know how to take into account the kernel, and then with the kernel taken into account, there are still some sort of all or nothing conditions that you get at each order. Okay, so let's investigate. So the idea is, again, as we said, so we should try and solve it to first order. And again, if And again, if you look at this expansion, if you're thinking of phi as an error term, then you really are trying to solve, you know, this thing is zero up to error. And so b should be in the kernel up to error. B should be in the kernel up to higher order terms, which means higher order indeed, and also thinking about phi as an error term. As an error point. So I think maybe in the paper we use this notation. So v is u, where u is in the kernel, plus h, where h is an error term, and also it's in the author complement of the kernel. Okay, so i if you have this first order condition, then you can just plug it back in. So this is going to tell you phi is now L of V is just L of H plus 1 half D squared phi 0. So the principal term is going to come from U, right? That's the dominant term in V. So U U. So u u, plus, again, higher order. And so the second order condition asks, can we solve this equation, right? Up to higher order terms. Or again, really, if you think of phi as an error, then can you solve for this thing to be zero in up to higher order terms in phi and v. Okay, so again, what's the obstruction to solving this? The obstruction is that we've already chosen u. We only have freedom for h, and we can't hit things in the kernel with l. But for the obstruction, It's going to be the if I take this thing d squared by u. So that's a quadratic form on k, on the kernel. And if I take the projection to the kernel, that still defines a quadratic form. And this is the thing that's going to stop us from solving that equation. So a second-order construction. So if I have this condition, So if I had that, if I had this condition, then again, so you would sort of take projections of both sides and see that this is estimated by maybe the projection of phi, but then that's smaller than phi itself. And again, u was the principal term of v, so on this side. We still get the same word shape to type inequality. Again, with the exponent 2 here exactly corresponding to the second order obstruction. Okay. So that's the idea. I think maybe I've got enough head nods to see that this is something you can just continue. And maybe I'll be a little bit explicit about this. So, otherwise, the other case where we continue is if this obstruction vanishes entirely. Yeah, so we would be able to solve. So h is minus 2 L inverse D squared phi. So H is some explicit thing depending on you, but it's unique. Plus higher order terms. And again, maybe we should give names to these things. So I think maybe we call this W and say H2 for the second error term. Okay, so at third order you just get phi is L of H2. L of H2 plus D squared phi. So now if you count third order terms, you can have this mixed guy u with w. W is second order. And then also the one you expect, the third order term triply applied to you. Okay, so again, I know the third order obstruction you're interested in solving. obstruction you're interested in solving this equation and so the pi k of this thing is the third order obstruction. Is that clear? And you can continue but you do have to be a little bit careful to track these extra terms coming in from what you already solved. And I I should say again, so so for our result for the products of spheres, so both in the mean curvature flow and the Ritchie flow case, it is a third-order obstruction that we find. So again, the earlier work of Croker found a second-order obstruction for CB2N. Again, there's sort of some differences in the method. Again, there's sort of some differences in the method because he sort of does it at an infinitesimal level, at the level of paths. And I think this is what Evans-Lautain and Schulze do as well. So if you upgrade it in the way we did, then you do get this inequality, not just the rigidity. But that sort of explains where these exponents come from. Maybe I should remark that for the classical inequality, those exponents are definitely not integers. Those exponents are definitely not integers. It's a very hard problem. And yeah, so that I think corresponds to the gap here. So at each obstruction, I have this condition that either it's totally anisotropic or it's totally vanishing. And so I think if And so I think in between what you see is sort of different analytic sub-varieties and things going on, and maybe you have some zero stuff looks like a cusp, and that's why you see these different exponents come out in the classical inequality. Are there any questions? Cool, so I've successfully made some time to discuss some technical issues because, of course, the paper isn't just computing Taylor expansions, even though it's not that easy at any end. So let's discuss. So there's quite a few. So one is to do with the expansion itself. So I'm just going to blanket say it as combinatorial challenges. But you do need to, you know, you don't just need to compute this quadratic form, for instance. You do need to understand it, but you need to understand whether it has these isotropic directions. And that's somehow, it's not so easy, particularly if it's. Easy, particularly if it's very complicated, but more seriously if the kernel is very large. And of course, everything sort of compounds and gets more and more complicated as the order of obstruction gets larger. Right, so somehow you could call it luck or you could call it intuition, but it was very good for us that it stopped at sort of order two or order three. And again, you sort of have to be brave enough to see that that's going to terminate. Another one has sort of been swept under the rug. This is everyone's. That's everyone's favourite buzzword. So there is an issue of gauge fixing, right? So I've ignored it the whole time. Even for the toy example, we just have is zero and isolated critical point. But again, for these geometric problems, we usually have some symmetry group operating. And the question is, how do you mod that out? So in the compact case, this is rather easy. You can just use the implicit function theorem. So I didn't write this down, but in the statement of Way-Schaebrich inequality that I stated, you can always assume that that normal vector field V is L2 orthogonal to the curve. So this really is just the implicit function theorem. But this is not obvious, right? It's really not obvious how to do this on a non-compact model. On a non-compact model. And it's so for a non-compact model, you have that issue, and then you have another issue that really the topology that you might be interested in is convergence on compact sets. And so you sort of don't even know that you're close on the whole thing. So maybe it doesn't even make sense to project it to the kernel in sort of the basic L2 sense. Hard for non-compact eyes. So for me, I use like some almost projection to the altern complement. And then again, sort of these recent developments of calling them in a Kotzi, so then they're able to solve what I think genuinely is a sort of harder gauge problem. Sort of harder gauge problem for these Ritchie shrinkers. And so the reason why I say it's harder is that the group here for mean curvature flow is just SOA, right? It's ambient symmetries. But so for if you deal with these Richie shrinkers, then you suddenly have to deal with pretty well for some creative. Right. Right. So in particular, this is like much, much bigger than than SOR. I will say one thing we need to do is you need to be able to invert this linear operator, right? So again, you might call this a combinatorial challenge, but somehow we, at least in the spheres case, really invoke. At least in the spheres case, really invoked the symmetry of the spheres to be able to invoke this operator and understand what was going on. It's somehow crucial there. And sort of, I think I have a few minutes, so this is what I really wanted to at least show some toy tricks. What space do we really do this analysis in? But I've sort of given you this toy model and thrown norms everywhere. Everywhere. This is somehow a pretty non-trivial question. So the issue, of course, is that, again, if I'm looking at mean curvature flow or rescaled mean curvature flow, those are gradient flows in the L2 sense. So L2 is really the natural space. So L2 is really the natural space, or strictly L2 with a Gaussian weight. So that's the natural space. But again, I'm doing this Taylor expansion, right? And sort of soft left space doesn't behave well under other products. Okay, I guess I'm actually yeah, okay. So maybe I'll just make the point. So we have some expansion of phi is L V L H that's setting plus And maybe let's even just think about it at the first order condition. So at the first order condition, we're thinking about this as O of some normal V squared. Okay, but really, this is an expansion that you. Really, this is an expansion that you do point once. And so if I want to integrate this out, and for example, if I want to estimate the W22 norm of H, okay, so maybe I want to do some little degradity trick and pass this to L2, but then to estimate this in L2, now I need to square and integrate. Plus, so phi minus LH is So phi minus LH is, oh, this thing, but that's going to be V W to 40 V square. And so this is something that maybe you don't a priori have control of. So you do need to do some tricks. In the compact case, we actually prove all our estimates in Herlder space first. And so once you do Hilder estimates, then you do have some control and you can play some tricks. And this is sort of harder in the non-compact case because then you The non-compact case because then you might lose some exponent. And so you need to work a little bit harder to save that little bit of exponent if things are wrong. Okay, thanks, Anata. Questions for Chanata? So in the product of sphere case, do you have like a non-integrable element in the kernel? Yeah, so the point is that they're all non-integrable except the ones that obviously come from rotations. Okay, so but you do find some. Okay, I see. Yes, yes, okay. Any questions from the online audience? Hello, I have a question. Yes. Yes? Are you assuming that this ratio L that you're trying to invert, are you assuming it's symmetric? Yeah, yeah, yeah, so yeah. So now implicitly in all the setup and working with like a nice elliptic self-adjoint operator. Again, if you choose the spaces, sure. Thank you. Okay, any further questions? Okay, I've not let thank Chana done again. I can't do that's time for the next talk. Apologies to Matt.
