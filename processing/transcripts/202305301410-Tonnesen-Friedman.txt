Okay, so time for the next talk. So, our next speaker is Christina Jonesen-Friedman, and she will tell us about the second geometry on certain fibrojoids. Thank you. Well, thank you very much. Very honored to be invited to be part of this. My research is probably very tangentially related to the theme, but I'll try to make some connection to it. To make some connection to it. And so the plan is to describe a certain construction by Yamasaki from a 1999 paper that he did for K-contact structures. And recently, Charles Boy and I have looked at this in the Sasaki setting with the hopes of getting new examples of Sasaki metrics with special. Of Sasaki metrics with special geometric properties. So it's basically the upshot. And so I will just very quickly go through Sasaki geometry, like one slide. I think a lot of it has already been up. Describe Yamosaki's fiber joints without too many details. Talk a little bit about the sort of sad outcome for Sasaki Einstein in this case, and then some results. If there's time, I'll do. If there's time, I'll do bullet three, but don't have to, so I'll keep, I'll be mindful of the timing. All right. So as has been up on screens a couple of times already, society structure is basically a contact bundle with a little bit of extra stuff. The lead vector PLD is killing. The transverse complex structure is. The transverse complex structure is integral. There is a transverse K-lar structure that we can look at, and then there is a column metric above the Sasaki structure that is also Kalar. So I don't know exactly who calling the phrase Sasaki sandwich, but I heard it from Charles first time, right? Sasaki sits in the middle of these two things. All right, so. Right, so this screen kind of represents all I know about the connection through D2 and spin 7. But what I do know is a Sasaki 7 manifold that is Sasaki Einstein has a Calabi-Yau Kerr manifold above it, the Kohl metric. And so that's a special case of the Spin-7 manifold. And also this is Agi-Einstein 7 manifolds. The Einstein seven manifolds are special cases of the so-called nearly parallel to the two manifolds, which I know nothing about, but you know, in CD Sasaki is a special case. So it could be interesting still to see explicit Sasaki-Einstein seven manifolds. We have a lot of existence results in various cases due to, for example, Fataki-Uman Wong and a lot of physicists. But it's still interesting to try and construct something. To try and construct something explicit and to look at it. Oops, oh, oops, too fast. There are other ways you can generalize the Sagi-Einstein metrics more in sort of the metric direction. And for example, you could loosen the condition of Einstein to just being constant scalar curvature. That has the advantage that the transverse scalar structure is also constant scalar curvature. So even if you have, Curvature. So, even if you have a geometry, you can do a lot of stuff there. And you can even generalize to so-called extremal sesaghi metrics, which Boyke, Liggi, and Simanka did about 15 years ago, something like that, which is a direct generalization or lifting up to Susaki's story of Calabi's extreme of metrics. All right. And so I've been interested in these types of metrics. In these types of metrics, together with Charles and also other collaborators, that I will bring up as they come up on the slides. And both interested in sort of the general existence results, but also this concrete construction, right? So we can sort of see and build metrics. All right, so just a little bit of background before I introduce the Yamasaki fiber joints. Masaki fiber joints. So Masasaki metric has a foliation of flow, and that flow can be regular, in which case the transverse scalar structure is truly living on a kalar manifold. It could also be quasi-regular, in which case it lives on ovipoles. And sadly, most of them are none of that. They're the irregular ones, and that's what makes it much harder in a way. And a much harder in a way to work with these explicit Sasaka metrics. A lot of the ones with special geometries are not falsely regular or regular. They live somewhere in the Sasaka code and only locally can you kind of see the transverse kerosene. All right, and then this is just to remind you that Sasaki structures come in rays. Uh, you can like rescale them, but we do something that smells like that. Um, and for constant scalar curvature Sasagi metrics and extremal Sasagi metrics, if a metric in the ray is one of those things, the whole ray is that. So it's not like Sasagi-Einstein, where you know it's it's only one in the ray and it is you have to have that the transverse killer Einstein has to be positive and so on, right? So it's a little And so on, right? So it's a little nicer for these generalizations. I'll be friends with the smarts. Okay. So when we do these explicit constructions, we often do it up to so-called isotopy. So we want to have the freedom to quote unquote move in the transverse kma class. So by that we mean that we can add DC of a basic one form. basic one form, two, oh sorry, zero form function to change the contact form. And that corresponds to this going in the Keller class. And then also if we have a Sasaki metric, there might be a bigger set of Sasaki metrics with the same CR structure. It's the so-called Sasaki. Structure, the so-called Sasaki cone. And when we have that, we can sort of think about moving around in that cone, much like Kela geometers move around in the Kela cone. Doesn't quite behave the same way, but it's sort of spiritually sort of the same idea. So you can imagine constructing some Sasaki metric that's even regular to begin with. And then if the Sasaki cone is big enough, you can look around in that cone and look for metrics that might be nicer. Might be nicer. Okay, so now the Yamasaki fiber joints. It's really sort of a nice idea. And as I said, this was introduced for K-contact structures. So you can sort of join several K-contact structures over the same base. And I'm just going to talk about it for a special case of seminar manifolds. Case of semi-manifolds, just you know, because of this conference, and of course, this is a quick talk. So, imagine you take two compact Riemann surfaces of genus D1 and D2, and you pick the constant curvature unit volume Kla form on each of those. Right, and then you can take linear combinations over positive real numbers to get some other K-like classes on this product. Classes on this product manual. All right, well, of course, we think of these omegas, which is pulled back to the product. And then we can form line bundles by taking linear combinations over positive integers. And for this talk, I'll just pick two line bundles, which means I pick four positive integers, and we can arrange them in a matrix. And we can arrange them in a matrix just for organization's sake. And yeah, so now we have two line bundles over N. And since the channel class of these line bundles is designed to live in the chemical, we also have a principle as one bundle over n that gives us a natural society structure for each of those choices of line bundles. Okay, so what we can Okay, so what we can think of is n, the base, has two different Sasaki structures determined by the numbers in this matrix. All right. So what you do for the final join is you take the sum of the inverse of the line bundles, so now they're negative. You pick a Hermitian metric, these line bundles. You have a way to put Have a way to put some polar coordinates on it. And then you simply take the S3 shear bundle inside of that rank for real vector bundle. So now you have a S3 bundle. And what Yamasaki showed is that that has a natural K-contact structure. So since we picked things that came from integral complex structures and all that, we have a natural CR structure and we have compatible Sasaki structures. The compatible Sasaki structures, and in fact, we have a lot of them because we can choose W1 and W2 and kind of span a two-dimensional a priori subcone of the whole sesophical. All right, and play around with that. So here's sort of the picture if the W's are integers, then we can. Are integers, then we can kind of see the quotient orbital of this. And if w one and two are one and one, right, we can see the regular quotient is just some CP1 bundle over n. Okay? Okay, and if the genuses of the two base pieces are high, then this two. then this two-dimensional cone is actually the whole Sasaki cone. If the genus is zero, then of course not. There's a lot of symmetry on the base that could give us more. Sadly, when we calculated the first chain class of the contact structure, we get trying to point to this, but we get this example. You get this expression. So, if you want that to vanish, you don't have many options. You need G1 and G2 to be zero, and then you need to pick these two V1s. So all you get is Sasaki and Sin Metrics, we needed these to be portioned together for Proportional together for together now for yeah, yeah, so so this this first equality is not trivial and then after that so that's in our first paper on it and then the outcome in this particular case is we get this expression right and if you want that to vanish want to clear the way for Sagi Einstein you don't have many options because these have to be positive Options because these have to be positive integers. Well, so this is negative, right? And this is negative. So you need this to be positive. So D1 and D2 have to be zero. And then this has to add to two. And this has to add to two. So that's it. So not much. All right. So for example, this one does not show up. For example, this one does not show up on the Yamazaki joint, which just doesn't, which is a little disappointing. All right. But, you know, if you are open to look, well, constant scale curvatures as argometrics instead, or extremal, you can do stuff. So, for example, we could calculate the quasi-regular closures and the quasi-regular. And the quasi-regular transverse K-lock classes very explicitly. In this particular case, I have to be honest, it's just some of two-line bundles, and there was a lot of things that was assumed. And in theory, one could then do the following, say, oh, that looks like these admissible projected bundles from the stuff I did a long time ago at the Stolo Color Bank of Sean. Sean, and it's an overfold version, but you can sit down and try and look for special metrics there. The downside of that is you're already assuming that what you're looking for is quasi-regular. And if not, then you need to be very, very careful when you move in this isotical. It turns out that Avostola and Caldebank has found a way around that called the CR twist. Called the CR twist, where as long as you can see the regular quotient here and you can use there is a natural killing function down on that, you can use that to move around in the Sesaki film in a different way. And then they worked with these so-called weighted extremal metrics and showed that if you take the regular quotient and you look for weighted extremal metric, then that corresponds to somewhere else in the Sasaki. To somewhere else in the Sasaki cone, there is a truly extremometric. And then you can sit down and calculate: well, when is that extremometric constant scalar curvature? And then you have something really concrete to work with. So for example, we could see, this is together with, actually sort of a, it's a combination of results by Apostolo Measure and me earlier, where we didn't know if we've been doing this argument, and now recently with Bob. Geometry and now recently with Boyer, Evan Le Chandra, and Hong Yen Wang. But we're using the CR twist, and we can see that for genus less than or equal to one, that two-dimensional Sasaki subcone is saturated with extremal Sasaki metrics and it has to have an array of constant scalar curvature Sasaki metrics. Okay? And then intro back to this question, Sakana, right? So we know that the Keller-Einstein metric there does not lift up to anything like that. But that particular Keller manifold has a lot of constant scale curvature Keller metrics. It has like sort of two one parameter families up to rescale. And one of those one parameter families has ducts of elements that actually live on a Sasaka, a Yamasaka joint. Everyone has to join. So that's kind of cool. Some of them appear. Yeah, I'm going to wrap it up. So, and also from current work with Charles, we can push the envelope for the higher genus. It's a little bit harder. You've got to be careful with the positive definiteness of your metric, but you can do something. Certainly, if you pick a K, sooner or later, it's going to fall apart with high enough genus. With high enough genus, but if you pick a genus, you can pick a clever K that will work. All right, and then just a warning, and that's going to be the last. One has to be careful. There's also a lot of non-existent results for the higher genes. And I think I am going to stop, so we're not going to go back to society actually.
