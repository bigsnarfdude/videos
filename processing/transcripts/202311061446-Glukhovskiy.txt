The flash talk session is Dan Lukotsky from Stonywork University. Yeah, so I would like to thank organizers for organizing. And this is about the joint work we'll be doing with my advisor Theodores and Boris Hessen. And it's going to be the most classical talk, hopefully, of this workshop, because what can be more classical than billiards? And point fortresses are also pretty classical. So let's just go to the So let's just go to that and let's see what point vortices are. So 2D loader can be formulated as a transport of vorticity by a vector field generated by this vorticity. So now let's take vorticity to be singular. That is, let's take vorticity to be the finite linear combination of delta functions at some point. And let's see how they get transported. So I'm not going to go through the derivation. I'm not going to go through the derivation, but in this case, the Elsovar law simplifies, and basically we get an evolution equations for the position of these vortices, yeah, Zi vortex, i, for a position of these vortices, which can be written in the Hamiltonian form with some symplectic structure. So the symplectic structure is this, so it's sum of gamma i, which is the intensities of the vertices, times dx dy. times dx dy, dx y dy. And the Hamiltonian looks like this. So this, so the first term is the corresponds to the force or velocity exerted on vortex i by all other vortices. And by the way, notice that we just remove the term where i is equal to i because we just blindly accept by face that vortex doesn't exert force on its. Vortex doesn't exert force on itself, which is actually a reasonable approximation. And so there are some extra terms. So the first term, the system was the first term, especially on the plane, was first derived by Kirchhoff or Helmholtz. Both of them definitely thought about it. So it's very, very classical, 19th century. And there's so in a bounded domain, there's an extra term which effectively corresponds to the Effectively corresponds to the interaction with the boundary. Because similar, you could think about it as in electrodynamics, you sometimes talk about mirror charges that somehow, so you have a bonded domain, you talk about mirror charges that somehow exert force on your charges. So, this is a very similar thing here. I'm not going to go through the derivation of that, but whatever there is in terms relates to the boundary. Okay, so very classical things. Okay, so very classical thing, so let's try to analyze some very simple classical cases. Okay, so very simple case, two vortices, opposite circulations in the plane. What could be easier? Okay, equations are explicitly solvable. The vertex pair, the dipole, just translates into direction perpendicular to the relative separation. Perpendicular to the relative separation with a speed proportional to the circulations and inversely proportional to the distance between time. So this is very easy to understand. And in fact, a more general statement is true. So the statement was conjectured by Kimura and sometimes in the 90s. And he proved it for the case of a sphere, as well as a hypervolved plane. Plane, which is not a compact medical, but for which close to a surface, but for which it was. And then we conjectured this for general case, and Bot and Color proved it sometime ago using some nice syntactic Hamiltonian argument, which basically involves constructing some simple ectomorphism from the neighborhood of a diagonal of a S cross S. Of S cross S to the cotangent, to the neighborhood of the nearest action of the tangent bundle. So that the infinitesimal supported light ball on a closed surface moves along the geodesic. So basically you take your vortices to be closer and closer together. You also make them weaker and weaker together so that the speed is finite. And well, it moves closer and closer to the JPS. Okay, so now this was not before, this was not the boundary. This was not before the boundaries, so let's see what happens in the boundaries. So, with the boundaries, okay, there's first theorem proved by Bundle and Klukerin in 96. They are proving something completely different, but it implies this theorem. So a single vortex close to a boundary moves along the boundary with a speed that's similar. It's proportional to the circulation and inversely proportional to the distance to the boundary. Which effectively means it's the same as a dipole case because you can think about the mirror vortex and that which I don't boundary and so now it's like a dipole. Right, so the single vortex moves along the boundary. So is the boundary a geodesic boundary? No, random boundary. Uh random boundary it's a geodesic in some metric on what's called like I think Shaalski double or there is some Shotsky double, or there's some object where you can translate this term into the previous one. But you don't have to, you could just prove it using some constructing some solution to legal equation. So now let's look what happens on dipole and the boundary. So for that, we just look at a half plane, and hopefully, you can see the pictures. Can you see the pictures? We can see the pictures. Okay, so typo in a half plane. Okay, so dipole in a half plane oops does what we want it, what it's supposed to do. It moves as a dipole away from the boundary, then hits the boundary. Then the vortices split in opposite and travel along the boundary in opposite directions. Again, this is very easy to see in the health plane. You just solve the equations. Basically, very simple. And uh thread for the future we also need another. So that's another thing what happens when dipole hits a boundary. Dipole hits the boundary, it splits. Boundary, back will hit the boundary, it splits. We also need some more cases. So, what if we have two vortices that travel along the boundary and then meet at some point? So, they could either merge into dipole, like in the second picture. So, they could merge and go as a dipole. System is reversible if you replace circulation, so you expect to see these pictures. But also they could pass each other. They could pass each other. They could pass each other. Imagine one vortex is very close to the boundary, another is farther, so they don't really interact, and Russian is boundary stronger. So they could pass each other, they could pass each other, just pass each other, or they could do leapfrogging. There's a nice paper of Boris, where we see what is the conditions for this transition. It's related to Golden ratio, some cross ratio, the Golden ratio, which is very nice. Which is very nice, but for our purposes, vortices can either meet and merge into dipole or meet and don't merge into dipole. Okay? So what does it have to do with biliards? Imagine the boundary is closed. Imagine dipole goes, hits the boundary, splits, vertices go along the boundary, and then meet at some other place. They meet in some other place, merge again into dipole and sh and uh shoot inside. And shoot inside the domain. Also, we could notice that the angles, which are not marked here, but these angles are the same because basically the angle dipole is with the boundary is only related to the relative separation from the boundary. So literally, a thing hits the boundary and shoots off at the same angle, except at different places. It's like a billiard, except it's like, we call it. Except it's like we call it pensive billiard because it shoots the boundary and then it thinks for a bit before shooting at the same angle. Right, so that's what we expect to happen and basically that happens. Basically that happens. And so let's just formulate. So that motivates us to formulate the system. It's three pages of formulation of the system, three slides of formulation of the system. But it's actually a very simple system. So we define pencils that are. System. So we define passive bail system to the following things. By the way, it's all done in planar domain just because it's easier to do in planar domains. But I believe it works in any simple connected surface with boundary, replacing straight line with geodesic, wherever necessary. So we have a linear domain. So the state consists of some number of dipoles. Some number of dipoles and some number that live inside, and some number of monopoles that stay on the boundary. And basically they move. They move the way we want them to move. How do dipoles move? Dipoles move in straight lines. Because that's what with vortex dipoles do. And when they hit the boundary, dipoles dissolve into two monopoles. To two monopoles, and well, there is some relation between the angle of heating with the speed at which the two monopoles travel along the boundary. Okay, so how do monopoles do? Well, monopoles move along the boundary with a constant speed. And if they meet, the following happens. If the ratio of their boundary velocities, which is the same. Of their boundary velocities, which is the same as the ratio of their distance to the boundary, because it's inversely proportional, is not large. Basically, it's not too large, and the critical values are somehow related to silver ratios. In different conversations, it's literally going to be silver ratios. And by the way, this was computed already by Love in the 19th century in the Commons. In the 19th century, in the context of water streams, but it works as ever here. Then they merge and form a dipole which enters the interior at angle theta with some speed, some circulation. And the angle theta is some exclusive function, which I didn't write here because it's going to take the whole slide, but it's a very exclusive function. Otherwise, they just continue going. So otherwise, they just pass each other. So that's the whole system. And well, basically. And well, basically what we proved, and it's hopefully going to be on our guest soon, when we proved with theory on vortex, is the following, is basically, this is a good approximation. Basically the statement of theorem, that if you start your point-vortex system with more or less relations of dipoles, and then make the dipoles smaller and smaller, then the things can be approximated by the kinds of billion pattern better. And until something weird happens, like collision of dipoles, but they generally don't collide. Or merging of monopoles on a boundary. But it's not trivial, but it's also hard to prove that they don't merge. So basically they don't merge on a boundary and they go into the fragment moment. But whatever, there are some cases which you need to exclude, but otherwise basically we can merge to a dispenser builder system. And yeah, so that's a statement. So that's a statement. That's a justification of the system we just had. And now, a few questions that one could ask. Well, we just justified the system. Let's try to solve it. Let's try to study some properties. Periodic trajectories, caustics, circadicity, whatever. Some basic dynamical properties of this modified billiard. Try to use it for some point fortresses, might be useful. Problem to credibility. Prove non-integratability, find some solutions that do whatever we want. Ideal would be regularize it, and I get actual honest solution of 2D wheeler that do the sort of wheeler things, because it's going to be a massive supply of explicit solutions that's not realizing, but that sounds hard. And do whatever you want, but that sounds hard. Another thing we could do, we could try to expand this thing. Like, we could try to do tripods, we could try to do vortex pairs with different circulations. You could try to do word experience with different circulations and see what does it converge as you merge them together in this limit of taking smaller and smaller. And you could add whatever you want, mass, charge, a lot of things. But basically, play around with that. It's a nice thing to play around with. And thank you. So uh this picture So this picture for the dipole, it suggests you can make a map. The dipole case, we have now, basically it's a map. That is, if you're given a point on the boundary and an angle, then you go to another one. Yeah, you could make a map that you can make if you have one dipole. If you have more dipole. Suppose you have one dipole and you do it in the stadium. What do you get? You get some sort of billiard. You get some sort of billiard, except it hits, and then there is a map, and then it hits, and then there is a map. It's a composition of a billiard map with the Server translation. With this error translation map. I don't know what happens. I know on a disk it's simple. I don't know if you can say anything about ergodicity or I'm a little ergodic, but I. Anyway, it opens up a whole class of interesting systems. But the point is, another point is. But the point is another point is an interesting thing is that our system is actually defined for more dipoles, and then at the point they merge into the solvent monopoles and then other monopoles can meet. Yeah, oh, I mean, there are all kinds of things. So that's in general, yeah. For one dipol, it's listed. Seems like a very clean problem. It proves that it's other questions for the. So let's save other questions for the break, which is coming soon. For now, thanks again.
