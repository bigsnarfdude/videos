Me, will I still be having 15 minutes? Thank you, and so yeah, so thank you for inviting me. And I also want to just say a bigger shout out to my colleagues, Canadian colleagues in the math bio community who kind of welcomed me very nicely over the last few years. I usually do well I used to do very fancy things with DRMs. To do very fancy things with DRMs and non-linear analysis and optimization. I still do that. But I was at some point infected long ago with this biomath virus. So I blame Chris. He infected me first. So whatever I say wrong, it's his fault. So this is work we've done kind of after the pandemic. I think we started looking at this around 20 Around 2022, when you know we had a lot of vaccines and boosters that were kind of coming down from COVID. So, this is a bunch of my trainees, except this guy here, my longtime collaborator, also, my husband, and real life. So, there's some master's students, there's some postdocs, and so apparently they're doing well. Public Health Ontario, AstraZeneca, Clinton Lake, just an area. Zeneka, Quintong Lake, just an AI company, Canadian Institute for Health Informatics, so on. So they seem to be doing well. So we're happy about that. And so before I, so don't be too scared. There'll be some formulas, but there'll be some plots. I love plots personally. So we're going to concentrate on those. And I want to bring us all the way back to Ian's talk in the morning with that nice plot with the real life and the With the real life and what do you say, academia, right? So, you had this, like, I think the lower left corner was like the fun stuff, the academic and simple, and then the upper right corner is the heavy stuff. So, I don't know. So, sometimes here's how things work in your block. You can start here. Five years forward in time, you end up there without wanting to. So, way back when, that was 2015, I was reading a paper that Julian wrote also Sunday. That Julian wrote also some years back about you know migration and blending as IR migration. And in that paper, I would like just a very theoretical thought of you know, kind of fun, but like not fun. How much panic would you need to introduce panic, like fear in the population? You might shut down some parts of the economy, but not all of it. You know, like a threshold so that you reduce cases, but you don't close off. I swear to Off, I swear to God, we published it in 2016. Four years later, we lived it. So, like, okay, not great. Okay, so this is COVID. We all know it. We adopted non-pharmaceutical NPIs to mitigate the spread. And generally, we have physical distancing, lockdown periods, we have quite a few in Ontario, disinfecting measures, ventilation. Disinfecting measures, ventilation, masks. Eventually, we had mask mandates in Ontario for quite a while, economic measures, and so on. So, what we wanted to do is, what you saw today, you saw a lot of SIR type models. You had surveys, you saw surveys of trying to gauge how people reacted in the compliance. You saw mobility and masks being used directly into SIR models as a way. Into SIR models as a way to capture NPIs, right? Well, when we do that, what we put under the rug is we all make decisions, right? We all made decisions, especially in 2020, there was no treatment. NPIs were the thing. And so, if you remember correctly, almost every day, we had to decide: well, do I stay inside? Not only that, do I stay inside to the point that I'm not going to visit my immediate family? In my immediate family, right? Or do I have a bubble? Then, when masks finally came on, essentially, you had to decide every day: do I put my mask off? In time, it was hard and it was annoying. And even people like us, I guess, at some point, you say, Okay, I'm only gonna go to the pharmacy quickly and only to the park. And my dad forgot my mask. My mask. Oh, I'm just gonna put my sweater and just go in, right? So, and then, so we kind of had to make these decisions repeatedly, and they're not difficult decisions, like do I follow or I don't follow the MPIs, right? Okay. So, then how do we make this decision? So, I'm taking the point of view of we should, if in mathematical modeling, just try to have a way to model this decision. Quantify it, then put it into the SIR, CIR, or whatever other model with a delay. Because what I decide to do today will not have an effect right now. I may spread it to other people. That effect might reverberate in the next three days, a week, 10 days. Right? And then I repeat that behavior. So we should have some delay between what we decide to do, what we do, and then what happens. Decide to do what we do and then what happens. Okay, so with that in mind, game theory, you know, that's what I do with my other non-math file life. So sometimes to some, you know, some degrees like hammer nail. Except this actually fits the theory because in games you have to decide you want to optimize something. You could be generally rational, generally risk averse. Risk averse or risk neutral, you still want to minimize or maximize something. The problem is that you're, whatever you do, you're impacted by others, right? Either the level of your well-being, which is your payoff, or the level of strategy. This is a deeper discussion. We're not going to get into that. So another thing that happens, of course, in the pandemic is, especially in Ontario, we have 34 public health units, right? And you'll see the regions. Some of them are very small geographically, but very populated, densely populated. And then the northern part is very large and extremely sparse. So it stands to reason to think about when people make decisions in other parts of Ontario, generally we saw the same data. What was the data? It was hammered every day. Number of cases, number of deaths, number of hospitalizations, experts' curves. Experts' curves showing we're going up and we're going down, right? Everybody could see this. We would, I remember, we checked everything. Okay, so that is the exact same information we're going to put in here. So let's see what we did. Now we say, okay, if everybody had information on cases, hospitalizations, later on, Oxford Index, and so on, we all lived through mobility restrictions and we all in Ontario have All in Ontario had to comply with the mask mandate. So, okay, if I'm thinking about the mobility and the mask as functions of what the information was given, was to us, cases, hospitalizations, cases, and the Oxford Index. So, this is the more economical side, right, onto the masks and the mobility. Then, generally, I have some. Then generally, I have some linear functions, otherwise known as regressions, right? But what we thought is interesting are these intercepts. What are these intercepts? Like, if you look at the formula, if you have no cases, there is no disease. You have no cases, no hospitalizations, no restrictions, no mass, no mobility, then you guys should be zero. Because I mean, think about it. What are you thinking about? How are you going to be impacted if you have to work? Be, how are you going to be impacted if you have to work from home? There was not such a thing before the pandemic. We had to go in. You never thought about how do I feel if I have to put on my mask? It never even computed. It wasn't in my head. It started to be in all our heads, right? So sense of reason that our personal discomfort with having to stay home, with having to wear a mask, will change, would have changed throughout the course, right? Throughout the course, right? And so these intercepts, and to some degree, they will depend on time in our model. They'll be especially deduced monthly. So the more you had to do these things, expectation would be that they're compound, right? They'll increase. Okay. So we computed these guys. In 2020, we started in early March all the way to December because I think before, just before December. I think before just before December, the new vaccines were announced, and everybody was happy. So 2020 was what we looked at. And we computed these for every single of the 34 public health regions. And then we expected to see some sort of meaningful differences on how people felt, right? So these are not how people felt, they are proxies. We interpreted these introspective proxies, how people receive things. How people receive things. And well, some of them were more impacted by, say, population densities. This is the very, you know, lowest density, highest density regions. So one of the risks was, you know, the mask one was a bit more impacted by, but the perceived infection risk, if you, you know, because if you didn't stay home, you didn't want to be, you know, isolated, you would go out. Isolated, you would go up. So, risk would go up, your receiver risk would go up, right? So, there wasn't a lot to tell here. We expected it to be a lot more, and there wasn't. It could be that maybe we didn't delve into the enough data, we didn't have, you know, we didn't refine it better, but it wasn't a lot of interesting stuff. There's very little correlation, just, you know, between some income, median income, and I forgot. And I forgot what. And I think the median income and yeah, the risk between the median income and an age had some correlation, but not really to talk about. So it seems fairly, although we had 34 regions, these perceived perceptions didn't really seem to vary a lot. So in a game, I'm not going to get you through the math. So you set up the You through the math. So, you set up the game. We have 34 players. So, we have an average individual in each of the public health regions. So, how do they make decisions? Generally, in games like in optimization, you have a utility function. This guy is essentially will be kind of a convex combination between a decision. You know, I have a probability to respect NPIs, then this one is not respecting. If I respect, I will have a so-called Respect: I will have a so-called relative discomfort. So it's a ratio between how discomforted I am by staying home versus how discomforted I am by wearing a mask. Okay, so if I perspect, I incur this. If I don't respect, then I should get infected, right? Probably. But then how do I, as an individual living somewhere in Ontario, how do I judge how much danger I have around me? I don't know. Have around me. I don't know, but I would say if everyone in Ontario, right, so this is the coverage that I perceive around me. I'm just looking around. I don't know in Ontario, but I look at your news, I look at the grocery stores, do I see a lot of people with masks who's like, you know, staying away? It's like, yeah, okay. So I may get this delta, which is my own belief that I'm doing great. The coverage is good. So this one minus delta, this could be. Minus delta, this would be plus one. So this is very, very small. And I'm like, well, you know, I cannot respect, right? Whereas if I am a more of a cautious person and I perceive this delta to be small, meaning I don't really trust my population around me to take care of me, then this will be small, this is big, and then so I weigh myself differently. If we solve this game with If we solve this game with 34 players, we get these X stars, which are the estimated optimal adoptions. And this is, then we concatenate everything into the old carrier. So interesting thing, this delta, we don't know what they are, right? We have no idea. So what we did is we didn't know what to do. So brute force for every single player, we ran many simulations, put it between 0 and 1. It's 1. 0 and 1, if it's 1, you know, you're very certain of knowing everything. If there's 0, you're very cautious. Okay, and then this, it doesn't give a lot of fluctuation. And this is Ontario estimate. We put it into an SIR model. I'm not going to go through this one because you've seen everything about it. The R0 and the beta, the transmission is a nice, very close form of mathematical expression. A mathematical expression. Then we have to estimate, these are the zones in Ontario public health regions. Then you estimate the data based on the initial growth. So you have the original attack rate data. And this is the interesting thing. This is what we do from the game. There's a delay. I'll be doing that in 30 seconds. There's a delay. This is from the game. This is something we don't know. This is the efficacy of what have people been doing. Of what have people been doing in Oterio? Usually, you don't get these two different ones, you get one thing. And this one is whatever has happened that dampened the beta, that didn't have to do with my decision, mask, mobility, other things, school closures, school openings, temperatures, seasons, and any other policy that might happen, right? Okay, so we accept to the feeding, and just I'll give you the slide. Give you the slide. So, that is the fitting for Ontario. You can see the beta dampening most of it, then a little bit of a bump in October. This is the efficacy. It kind of is not really as clear as we would have hoped. This is a median, but it sort of goes up to 0, 8, and it comes down a little bit. This is the fit parameter. So, the fit parameter, when it's closer to its high. It's closer to when it's higher, that means the dampening happens more because of these guys. When this guy is lower, then there's other effects, other competing effects going on. So clearly, this is not the whole story. I'll stop here. And one quick question while I bring the next slide up. So these are the set of interactive groups. Set of interactive groups in some respect because what happens in one public calculation? And the interaction is that delta times epsilon xi. Great. So my question is: have you or others considered using cooperative data, not the non-cooperative? That's a good question, though, but I'm not sure. See, non-cooperative doesn't mean adversarial, right? It means...
