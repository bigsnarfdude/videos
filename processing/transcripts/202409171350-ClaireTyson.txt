Lovely to have you here. This work that I'm presenting is my work by a recent master's student. It doesn't work. Which one? The top one? It doesn't work. It doesn't work. Oh, that's easy. Okay. Look at the USB. Okay. So Sarah is the master's student. Eric Foxwell was your co-supervisor. And Bruce Boltgartner was someone involved with the project as well. Briefly, I want to say I am very grateful to the work on the traditional unseated territory of the Silfu Pokanaga Nation. All of these were taken within an easy walk from my house. So the question I asked over a decade ago was, how big does the climate action group have to be in order to tip the population to action? And when I asked that question, I ended up going down a big multi-year rabbit hole in opinion dynamics. And then Sarah came along, and we finally And Sarah came along, and we finally felt like we had the tools to try and answer that question. To do it, we need to understand the social part, the economy dynamics part, the climate part, and then we have to couple the two. So that's the way I'm going to present this work. I'm going to start with the behavior model, and we'll spend more time on that because that's the interest of this workshop. So we assumed simple pairwise interactions, two people at a time. One of them's a speaker, the other's a listener. There's a listener. The person who is speaking isn't going to have any change. It's the listener who is going to change as a result of the interaction. We assume that each individual has a memory bank of a certain length. So the example here is four. And so before the interaction, the speaker here has three A memories and one B memory. The listener has two of each. An A memory for this talk is going to be... Memory for this talk is going to be climate action, and the B memory is going to be bullshit. We're not going to do that. So the assumption is that the speaker says the action that is the majority in the memory. So this sample speaker says A because there are three A's and one B. And then the listener adopts that memory, adds it to the memory bank, and the first in, first out process. The first in, first out process. So if you look at the BAAB at the top, now we have an ABAA, and the B that it was at the back fell off. Okay, so that's our opinion dynamics model. And if you start with a committed minority, so a group of individuals who are determined to say A no matter what, and the rest of the population is B. If you let this process evolve, Process evolves over a certain amount of time, either with a differential equation model or an agent-based model, depending on what you don't use, then there are a couple of possible outcomes. One is that you get a coexistence of the A opinion with the B opinion, or if you want everybody talking A, you might get lucky enough to tip the whole population over. And so the conditions on the right, that's the steady state, that's what happens after. Right, that's the steady state, that's what happens after a long period of time. And so, if we assume that the social model is happening faster than the climate model, then we can assume that in this big coupled system, the social model is going to be at steady state. And so it turns out you don't actually have to run that stimulation. You can use some math to figure out what that steady state is going to be, and that's what this is. So, top left is the situation where there's no committed minority. There's no committed minority. And so there are three steady states: the one in the middle, so where the what we're plotting here is the hearing rate of opinion A on the bottom axis, and then the speaking rate, the resulting speaking rate, on the vertical axis. And the curve we're interested in is the S-shaped curve. And so the identity line is drawn through the middle. That middle point is an unstable steady state, and the points at either end are stable steady states. Stable steady states. So, what that means is, if your hearing rate of A is below 50%, the whole population is going to end up speaking B. Nobody's speaking A. Or if the hearing rate is above 50%, then the whole population is going to end up speaking A. So, that's without a committed minority, you get one or the other, depending on where you start. Okay, now if you add a committed minority, If you add a committed minority, so on the top right, we've added a small committed minority. You can see that S curve is coming up. So now the steady states, the intersections with the identity line, that diagonal, are moving. We still have the everybody speaking A steady state, but the everybody speaking B steady state is gone because we've got this committed minority in the population. And now we'll always have some proportion of the population speaking A. And then as you increase that committed minority, And then, as you increase that committed minority, the curve moves up further, and eventually there's always the committed minority big enough to tip the entire population, no matter what. Okay, so where that tipping point occurs depends on the memory bank length. So, the longer the memory bank, the stickier your initial state. So, the more new A memories have to get added in before your It in before your speaking opinion will actually change. And so, this is what we're seeing here. As the memory bank gets longer, the size of committed minority you need to take the population gets bigger. But it's not 50%. It looks like it's saturating around 40%. Maybe even a little lower than that. If people have very short memories, then you can optimistically tip them much sooner. Anyway, so that's the shape. So that's the shape. Now, if we go to the climate model, I'll do this really briefly. We have just a first-order, a simple first-order ODE for the temperature. The first term is the incoming solar radiation. The second term is the outgoing long wave radiation. And the CO2 term is the emissions forcing. And then the DW at the end is adding some randomness. So, what we have here is. Some randomness. So, what we have here is an Eurostat-Bluebeck process where we're computing the temperature based on, or the temperature change based on the forcing from emissions. A better model has a fourth order term for the outgoing long-wave radiation, but it turns out the first order isn't too bad. So, on the left is what we get out of our model, on the right is what the IPCC has. The different colors belong to different Different colors belong to different socioeconomic pathways that the IPCC has posited as: okay, suppose people do this, suppose people do that. And along each of those pathways, the behavior is constant. So if the populations behave in this way, then we will get a temperature curve that looks like this. If they behave as business as usual, we get a temperature curve that looks like that, and then there are a few in between. So here's our best case scenario. Our best case scenario goes up and down, the same as the lowest curve in the IPCC. And then our worst case scenario is this one, it continues to increase. So not bad as a simple approximation to what future temperatures might be. Okay, so that was our climate model. Now we want to put the two together. So I have to talk about those coupling arrows, the emissions and the extreme events. So to get from the social model. To get from the social model to the climate model, we're using emissions. So, what we did was we took a weighted sum of those. Is this word? Oh, yes. Oh, no, wrong way. Of the best, so this is the best case scenario, and this is the worst-case scenario. So, for whatever the emissions are at time t, we take a weighted sum of those two cases. So, the speaking rate of A, So the speaking rate of A, that's the climate action one, that's R of T, gets multiplied by the best case scenario emissions. And then the one minus R of T, so that's the speaking rate of B, gets multiplied by the worst case scenario emissions. We add those two together and say, okay, that's our emissions at that time. Now, to go from the climate model to the social model, we assume that's through the influence of extreme events. And so extreme events occur at a rate that Events occur at a rate that depends on the current temperature difference from pre-industrial times. And the impact on the social model is that, so S is the set of extreme events. Every time there's an extreme event, the committed minority, so here's the starting size of the committed minority population, it stays the same, but it gets bumped up by some small amount, or some amount you, and then, but then this. And then, but then this, so these because this is an addition to the committed minority, it grows, but there's a decay over time. So people who have experienced an extreme event will switch to speaking A, but then could switch back to speaking B eventually. Okay, so we get results that look like this. On the left, we have the extreme events over time, or the number of extreme events over time. And on the right, we have the temperature change and the rate of And the rate of speaking A, climate action. So, top left, we can see there were quite a few extreme events early, and so that meant that there was a tipping event early. So, now the entire population is speaking A, and the temperature eventually comes down again. In this scenario, we had, here was a year with lots of extreme events, but not followed by very many. Events, but not followed by very many, and we don't get enough extreme events happening until quite late. And then, so the tip happens so late, the temperature ends up being pretty high. So, if you run lots and lots of simulations like this and put the results together, what we find is that if we look at the time at which the tipping event happens and the temperature change at 2100, most of the tipping events happen towards the Most of the tipping events happen towards the end, close to 2100, and so the final temperature ends up being high. If the tipping event happens early, it makes a big difference to the final temperature. And then the mean is what's plotted on the right. So the mean temperature change over years, if you include all the simulations, not just the ones where tipping happens, there are plenty of simulations where tipping doesn't happen. Where typically it doesn't happen, and so that's what the mean temperature curve looks like. Okay, so my first question was: how many? Well, less than 50%, so that's good. On the other hand, how many you need depends on how sticky those original memories are. Tipping only happens if you get a high enough frequency of extreme weather events, and then that effect on the final temperature really only happens. Temperature really only occurs if the tipping happens early. Lots to be done on this. It means the extreme events don't affect the entire population, though they have local effects and they can vary in size and intensity. So that we'd like to work in. And we would like to have something a little more sophisticated for the opinion dynamics model rather than just simply. Rather than just simply the length of memory, we know that there's a lot more involved. However, coming out of this, the take-home message for me was that it's bloody heart. And I think that's it. Thank you.
