Thank you very much. Thank you very much for the opportunity for inviting me. I'm also hoping to do this in person someday. It didn't work out quite that way this time. But yes, like Jennifer said, please give us some opportunity to do something. And for those of you who came to hear a beautiful talk about concordances, I'm sorry. So this is the one we. So, this is when we talk about Orbifolds, and I was told to expect students in the audience, and I wasn't sure who knows what. So, I had to decide who knows what. And I figured everybody knows about manifolds, but maybe not so much about orbifolds. So, let's start with what they are and motivating them a little bit. So, a manifold is a topological space, often denoted M, with the property that every point in the manifold Every point in the manifold, here's a point, has some open neighborhood with a map, maybe we call it phi1 to the first point, that this is a homeomorphism, it's a parametrization. And maybe here's another point, and here's another open set, and this maps like here. Maybe this is phi2. And of course, the important thing is that when there is an overlap, like over here. Like over here, then overlap we have the transition map phi1 followed by phi2 inverse, and that's required to be smooth or continuous, so whatever we require to be, you know, holomorphic, depending what wants for the structure. And so an orbit for this is a very, very similar situation. Generalizes, this map no longer has to be a homeomorphism. It could be, and let me just write it as mod G1, and maybe over here, mod G2. G2, it could be a quotient map by a finite group action. But it's a very sort of controlled finite group action. This is an open ball in Rn. We have some finite group acting on it, and the quotient is homeomorphic to a ball too, because here the homeomorphism type is still a ball. And so, is this, am I writing big enough for you to read? Yes. Yes. Okay, thank you. And so, of course, the first example of an orbifold is if you look at the disk in, let's say, in let's say the unit disk in the complex plane, and you parametrize it by the unit disk in the complex plane, where the group here is generated by z mapped to e to the two pi i over n z. i over n z. So that's just you take n sectors like this. You know, it's a rotation by 2 pi i over n. And then we write the number n here to indicate this because that's the only thing really it can do here. And we can take two of them. This will have m. And because these, the underlying topological space of these two is just the disk, you can, for instance, take the identity map between them. Of course, if m does not equal n, these are not the same orbit. Does not equal and these are not the same or before, so it's not really the identity identity. Excuse me. Now, when is a function between two manifolds a manifold when at every point we can look here at the however any M is similar picture here for the rotation? A map between two manifolds is a function between two manifolds, actually a map between them. If at every neighborhood If at every neighborhood, when you look at the parametrization, you get a smooth map between the open sets in Rn. And so the same thing here. If you want to say that this is a map between orbifold, you have to be able to lift it. And so if you've never seen orbifolds before, this is kind of a good first exercise for which values m and n, this is even enough. And so here's a little bit by way of motivation. A little bit by way of motivation, we can look at the modular surface. So the modular surface parametrizes all flat tori. So a flat tori is just what we always think about the tori. You know, you take a parallelogram, say, in Euclidean plane, you identify opposite sides. Opposite sides, and we want to identify any two of them if they are isometric, and even if they're just homothetic. Homothetic means you can take one of them, multiply it by a positive scalar, bigger or smaller than one, and if they become isometric after that, that's good enough. So, what we're looking for, Taurus, that will be R2 model lattice, and the lattice is generated. I'm just going to write here. This is generated. I'm just going to write here, let's say, v1, v2. These are linearly independent vectors in R2. But you can rotate them if you want, and you can rotate them so that the first one points to the positive real axis and the second one points into the positive imaginary side. And since we're allowed to scale, we might as well say that the one that points in the positive real axis is actually. points of the positive real axis is actually one so we can write it as equal although r2 and c are not equal i don't know maybe not equal one in some number tau with the imaginary part of tow greater than zero so this is the usual picture here is my one and something like this is my tau bad place to write it sorry is my tau Is my toll, and that's the parallelogram that we're talking about. But not every two talls, with distinct toes, give you different tori. And so we're actually not looking at all the points in the upper half plane. We're looking at all the points in the upper half plane, mod tow maps to toe plus one. If I add one to this toe, of course, I'll get the exact same lattice because one is already in the lattice. So that won't make any change. So that won't make any change. But there's another one, less obvious to see, I think, which is tau max to minus one over tau. These two together generate SL2Z, and SL2Z sits inside SL2C, of course. These are Mobius transformations, so they are isometries of upper half-plane, excuse me, of hyperbolic space, the upper half-plane model of hyperbolic space. So you can write it as edge two modes. To move this. And when you look at the hyperbolic plane and you mod out by a group of isometries, you get a hyperbolic surface. And the quotient here looks like it's complete finite volume and it has no genus. But this can't possibly be right. We saw in Dave Dobai's talk this morning that the Euler characteristic of a hyperbolic surface is closely related to its area, namely, Related to its area, namely the area is minus two pi times the Euler characteristic. And this is Euler characteristic one, so it will be negative area. That's not going to work. And so what's the mistake here? The mistake here, if you just look at this, where does this send i? It sent it to minus one over i, but that's i. That's i. So this generator fixes i. And when you say that the group of isometry is quotient hyperbolic plane to give you a hyperbolic surface, you need free action and all kinds of other nice adjectives. But this is the one that we lose here, the free action. And so what happens when you look around i? There is a rotation by pi around the point i. Let me write this, draw this picture again. You write this, draw this picture again. I there is a rotation here by amount pi. That's what gives the fixed point here. It's exactly this rotation here. This is an hyperbolic isometry that gives a rotation, but it fixes a point. And so what will this look like at the quotient? Well, at the quotient, you know, if you have a point on any Riemannian surface and you take a small number r, and you look at a circle around r, a radius. Around R, a radius of radius r around it, its length is about 2πr. For a flat surface, it's exactly 2πr. For a sphere of radius one, it's 2 pi sine r. And in hyperbolic space, it's 2 pi and hyperbolic sine r. But these are all very close to 2 pi r. So in particular, if you take the length of the circle divided by r, take the limit as r goes to zero, you get 2 pi. But here, this is the circle. This, so this is the circle. Let me draw it here. If this is R, this is a circle that has a length 2π hyperbolic sine R. But this part of it and this part of it, if you take any two and tipped out points, break it up into two halves, these two halves get identified. So down here, this point, and this is the image of I, the circle around. image of I, the circle around it does not have length 2 pi hyperbolic sine R, but it's 2π hyperbolic sine R over 2. And that can't happen in any Riemannian surface. So not only is it not a hyperbolic surface, it's not a metric surface of any kind. Topologically, it really is a disk. There is another point. This point has order two. There's another point that has. 2. There's another point that has order 3. A circle about this point has length 2π hyperbolic sine r divided by 3. So it's even worse. It's even shorter. These are exactly all the footprints. And if you want to see the map that does this kind of thing here, you take this disk, mapping to this disk. It's exactly that. And so, and of course, this generalizes, and most of you know. Course, this generalizes, and most of you know this already. I know this generalizes, and it's a very, very important thing for us for topologists, if we are three-dimensional topologists. I mean, if you look at surfaces of higher genus, then this upper half-plane is replaced by Teichmüller space. And there's still an action of the mapping class group on the Teichmüller space that quotients out to give the modulized space. And it always has some fixed points. Always has some fixed points. Far and few in between, most of the points are not fixed points. They definitely have measure zero. They even have positive codimension. But there are fixed points. And there has to be a fixed point. And there is a concept. If you're new, if you really are completely new to an orbifold, it might be too much to try to cover everything in the first few minutes of a talk. But there is a concept of an orbifold fundamental group as a disk. This is simply connected. As a disk, this is simply connected. As an orbifold, it's not, and this is its universal cover. And so you get everything that you wanted to get from before. But this modular surface, if you want to think about it as a surface in the sense of too manifold and not too orbifold, that just doesn't really work out correctly. And so, anyway, I like that surface a lot. It comes up in many places, you know, and I think it's a good example. And I think it's a good example of why, in many situations, orbifolds are actually more natural than manifolds. And a lot of the manifold theory that we know, you know, fundamental groups, covering spaces and all that, just goes through. And so that's it for that. Okay. But if we are talking about three orbifolds, then we have to start. Then we have to start with the most significant theorem about them, which is, of course, Person's orbital theorem. So, and as a clue the word, for those that are remembered to say this, I'm not sure I remember to mention that this is joint work with Rachel Lehman. So, here's the gist of Thurston's OB Flow. Here's the gist of Thursday's Obiflow theorem. Well, three orbifolds are geometric. Okay, so first then. Thurston Perlman geometrization over here in this panel, we're talking about geometrization now of a manifold. How does it work? We start off with the manifold. We do the prime decomposition along spheres. Decomposition along spheres, and that gives us a prime manifold. And then we decompose it along certain tori, GSJ decomposition, and now we get geometric pieces. And so we want to imitate this to describe the Obi-Fold theorem. But there is going to be a problem. I mean, there's a bad in the title. And so what's that bad referring to? And so, what's that bad referring to? An orbifold is bad. Orbifold not covered by any manifold. So, when we had just around the same place, the example of the modular surface. example of the modular surface the modular surface we started the awareness started with h2 and took a quotient and the orbifold category that quotient is actually a covering map but tough stairs is h2 and h2 is the manifold so all the singularities of the orbifold got resolved if that doesn't happen if there is no such cover the orbifold is called bad now geometric pieces are good because they are geometric so they're covered by one of the eight geometries these are all manifolds to undo the geostation To undo the GSJ decomposition, you take your geometric pieces, maybe cipher fibrid spaces, maybe hyperbolic. If they are hyperbolic, you truncate the cusps because you need to glue them. Now you have manifold with boundary tori. Their universal cover now is going to be like in the hyperbolic case, for instance, is going to be what is known as a neutral space, hyperbolic space minus some open set, which is the interior of horribles. Horribles and you glue them to each other. So, of course, you have to glue a lot of them to each other in a kind of complicated way to get the universal cover of the prime manifold. But it is a manifold of a prime orbifold, excuse me. The next step, you start with these prime orbifolds, and you want to glue them together to get whatever you had to begin with. Well, you remove some open balls. Again, you play the same game. Again, you play the same game. You do it in the universal cover. And of course, if you have two prime orbit floats, you ought to glue them together. You don't take two copies of the universal cover, but you have a whole tree of them. But I think you know the picture. The point is, because down here, these are geometric pieces that are covered by manifolds. This will persist all the way up. And every orbifold that has this kind of flow to it will be covered by a manifold. So, this as a statement is false. A statement is false, and you need all kinds of adjectives. So I should have said that to begin with. I'm always assuming everything in this talk is closed and orientable, whether I need to or not, but that's not enough. That won't get us out of trouble. We need to add here good triobes or geometric. And so this is a phenomenal theorem of Thurston, I think from the early 80s. I think from the early 80s, the first proofs appeared almost 20 years later by Boileau and Leib and Poitier. And there's also Craig Cooper, Hodgson and Kirchhoff. A lot of work, a lot of work goes into the proof. But I want to say a word about the proof anyway. Because if this is a survey, then this is really the thing that you need to survey, in my opinion. And so before we start. And so before we say a word about the proof, let's ask what is the singular set in the case of a three-manifold. In the case of a surface, the singular set is a bunch of points with numbers on them. But for a three-manifold, it's a little bit more complicated. The singular set, well, every point in the order fold has a neighborhood which is an open bulb, which Which is an open ball, which has a map, which definitely quotients from an open ball in R3 now. Most points, a dense open set, of course, this will just be the identity. Some points, though, will have a singular set that looks like this. So, singular set in red here. And what do we see here? And what do we see here? This is the ball inside the orbifold, and it's written as a disk across an interval, open disk across an open interval. On each one of the open disks, I have the same orbifold structure that we had before when we talked about two manifolds. We just cross it with an interval. And so the map from R3 will be a map from a disk plus an interval with a rotation. But there is another way that a finite group could act on. A finite group could act on R3, and that is there's only one other way, and that is a triangle group. And when a triangle group acts on S2, excuse me, the quotient is an orbifold with exactly three points. And when you count them, you get a picture like this. And the numbers here will be A, B, and C. B and C. This triangle has to be spherical triangle, not flat or hyperbolic, because it has to act on H2, on S2, excuse me, which means one over A plus one over B plus one over C has to be positive. In other words, A, B, and C has to be relatively small. And, you know, it's an exercise, a three minute exercise to classify all triple of point A, B, and C that satisfy this. That satisfies this. And so the singular set is a trivalent graph. But it could have components that have no vertices at all. So suppose that to discuss the orbital theorem, let's suppose that the singular set has a single component. Actually, I know how to draw this. That's the one thing I do know how to draw. It has a single component, and that single component has no vertices. When I say trivalent graph, you can put it maybe in quotation marks. What I really mean is every time you see a vertex, it has to be of valence 3, but you might not see any vertices. So this will be called the smooth component of the singular set. And so, how did Thurston propose we prove such a nice theorem? He said, take the singular set and remove it. And so, if you do that, now you have a manifold with a single torus boundary. And that was geometrized by Thurston, of course, long before Perlman did the whole thing. And so, this has a geometry, and it might be, it might be reducible, it might be cipher-fibrid spaces, so fibridices, steroid, all kinds of things. Let's concentrate on the A lot of things. Let's concentrate on an interesting thing, and that's when this thing is hyperbolic. So, if we call the singer set sigma, we are now getting a hyperbolic manifold, which is our original orbifold. We're going to switch to O from M because it's an orbifold, minus sigma, the exterior of sigma. And this is like And this is hyperbolic. Of course, it does not have to be, but that's the interesting case. Let's only talk about it. So you have a parabolic manifold with a single cus, and this is all happening after Thesson already did the Dane-Sergio theorem. And how did he do the Dane-Sergio theorem? He deformed the hyperbolic structure on this. As you deform the hyperbolic structure on this, you know, in the Dane-Sergio theorem, he wanted to get to deform it until you get the proper. Deform it until you get the appropriate dain filling that you wanted. But you can also deform it until you get to, instead of the infilling of the form E over Q, gain filling of the form NP over NQ. And that will correspond exactly to having label N on this orbital over here. And so from this, of course, there's a lot of difficulties. And one thing that you A lot of difficulties, and one thing that you know, the original proof of Danes, there's some universal bounds, of course, on this deformation that were given by Hodson and Kirchhoff. But the original proof of the Danes surgery theorem just says that it's all but finite set. The orbifold theorem is a little bit different. It says you will get exactly this orbifold. And this orbifold may or may not be hyperbolic. And so, but this was the strategy. Let me have a look at the time. Have a look at the time. This was the strategy, and then the analysis is very subtle. As you deform, singularities can appear. For instance, the entire diameter of the manifold can collapse to zero. If that happened, you blow it up and keep it fixed at diameter, call it one if you want. But the constant that you blow up by goes to infinity, which means in the limit you get a flat in. The entire orbifold here, as you define. The entire orbifold here, as you deform, can collapse onto a surface or onto a line. Let's say a surface, just talk about a specific case. Well, there's a theorem of Gromov and Lawson that says that in that situation, your manifold is actually a circle bundle over whatever it collapses to. So that the limit then will be a cipher-fibrid space. And you get to the limit, and then you analyze what happens past it, and so that, so on. This one situation here. There's one situation here that you can't deal with. And the situation that you can't deal with is when, during the deformation, the knot goes through itself. It completely changes the topology of the orbifold. But that only happens if the angle where you deform becomes bigger than pi and allows the knot to approach itself to the other side. That's the crucial point. It allowed Thurston to go all the way to angle pi, or I would think of it as 2 pi over 2, and get all. 2π over 2 and get all the orbitals. Okay, there we go. Both of the orbital theorem in finance. Who said it can't be done? All right. So there's something in the chat that's okay from before. Hello. And if you do have questions, by the way, by all means, unmute yourself and Please unmute yourself and ask because you know that when you use Zoom during a talk, it's very hard to see the chat. Okay, that's the idea. That's just the idea. And the point of this theorem is that we can study orbifolds the same way we can study manifolds. If you can prove your theorem for all geometric pieces, you now have to check whether the proof survives when you glue a long tori. And it's very particular. And it's very particulatorizer. And if that works, you now have to check whether you proof survives when you glue along spheres, and then you get it for all manifolds. And the same kind of flow will work for all orbifolds, provided they're good. All right. Is this okay so far? Any questions? All right. So let me give you the statement of our theorem. Theorem Theorem for any orbifold, this is three orbifold, O, we have something like this. O itself will be O zero, and I'm going to write X one, I'll explain the notation in a second. Xi will get us to Oi. Will get us to OI and so on. There is a sequence of moves with O good. So if you start with O0, we start with a good manifold and O refold and the sequences just don't do anything. What do you do at each one of these movies? You take a part of your manifold, which is a bad or before, you remove it and you cap off the result. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is a completely meaningless theorem, of course, because you can take as a part of the orbifold that's bad, you can just take the whole orifold and throw it away. So, to make this meaningful, I have to tell you exactly what the xi's are. So, I hate erasing this. The geometric action theory. So, we have something like this: we have O minus one. Oi minus one, have xi, and we have Oi. And what this means is I have this Xi is actually a suborbital of Oi minus one, and Oi equals Oi minus one minus Xi Kappov. I'll show you an example of what Kappoff means. What Kappoff means almost exactly what he does when you do. Almost exactly what he does when you do prime decomposition. When you do prime decomposition, you cut along a sphere and then you stick in balls. Here, we're going to cut along certain tour before it will allow us to stick in something like a ball. This part is easy and we'll see it in a second. The crucial thing about the serum is I can list all possible, or we can list all possible XIs. Of course, it's an infinite thing, so there are families of XI's, but they're very simple and very easy to. Very easy to understand. The motivation behind this theorem is the following: we already know really well how to work with orbifolds under the mild assumption that they're good. And with a small extension, we can get to work with orbifaults that are not necessarily good. It's those sometimes do show up. Okay. So anyway. Any questions about the statement? Except for the part that I owe you what the excise. Is that all right? Okay, so how do we even start this? Of course, we start this from Thurston's orbital theorem. Thurston's Orbifold theorem implies that if an orbifold is not good, then it admits a. I'm going to have to erase this theorem. That's very painful. That's very painful. A bad three-orbifold contains an embedded bad to orbit. And there's like three or four types of them, but there's one of two types that will appear. I'm going to write them on the board right here, okay? One type of bad two-order code, it's called a teardrop. The notation is S to A with A greater than one, and the picture is the picture of a teardrop. And the picture is the picture of a teardrop. The underlying topological space is S2. It has a single orbifold point, and the weight of it is some number A, which is greater than one. And bad, all teogrophs are bad. Bad football. So a football looks like this. Well, not where I grew up. Well, not where I grew up, but where I live. Footballs look like this. And they'll have some weight here and some weight here. The notation now is S2AB. And we need them to not be equal, say without loss of generality. B is greater than A and A is greater than 1. If they are equal, that's a good football, and it is a good orbifold. And it's a quotient of S3 by rotation by 2 pi over, say, A. Say A, and so the goal of this sequence of XI's is to get rid of all these bad things. And so, my goal is to show you how to get rid of them and to show you why it's actually quite a simple thing to do. So, if you want to apply it to study bad orbit, it's actually quite kind of an easy thing to apply. So, the first thing that you need to get rid of are actually the tear goals, but the footballs are easy. The footballs are easier. This is supposed to say A here. So let's have a look at how we get rid of footballs. So here is a football, which are grammarized schematically kind of like this. This is S to AB, just like there. And because it has two singular points, A and B, it has to intersect the singular set like so. Singular set, like so. And so suppose that one of the two, let's say B, is a smooth curve of the singular set. Then it's very easy to see what to do. An even more schematic picture. Here is the set that contains V, of weight B. Here is the football. And here is Xi. Xi is Is draw it first and then say Xi in this case is a neighborhood of the bad football. Let's call it F. Let me give it a name data. F union this, let's call it C, this circle here, this root component of the Of the singular set. So, what happens with this? First of all, what is this? The underlying topological space, absolute value used to denote underlying topological space, that is S2 cross S1 minus an open ball. If you remember the truth that the only manifold which is prime Which is prime and reducible, orientable manifold, is S2 cross S1. That's actually the proof. Here in the underlying topological manifold, we have a sphere, and here is a curve that hits the sphere just once. Their neighborhood is a punctured copy of S2 cross S1. That's the underlying topological space. The orbital structure is this. And when you remove it, you introduce a boundary component, and the boundary component is. Boundary component, and the boundary component is just a sphere. So, cap it off, capping it off in this case, it's not written anywhere anymore. Capping off in this case means sticking a ball just like you, it's exactly what you do in the prime decomposition. But this worked because this will be smooth component. And so, if we sup it up just a tiny little bit, say it has exactly one vertex, this will definitely be. This will definitely not work because this surface here is topologically still a sphere, but it hits the singular set in exactly one point. So it's a sphere with exactly one singular point, and that's a teardrop. So what do you do in that situation? Well, let's look at what's happening. This will also end in subvertex because it can't be a closed component, and it splits in two. And it splits in two. If the weights of these two are the same, then you just take this. Because if these two weights are the same, then this is a good football. So let's look at the case when the weights are not the same. Tiny bit more interesting. Maybe I'll draw a thicker, sorry. So we have one weight which we can call A, and another weight which we call A star, and now we're saying. Call A star, and now we're saying they're not the same. So say A star is bigger than A, and this here splits into a B and a C. Well, then we take the same neighborhood that we took before with a little extension, which just covers this part. Okay, this in the underlying topological manifold, this is a diffeomorphic. Manifold. This is diffeomorphic to what we had before. So the boundary here now is still S2 topologically, but now it has A, B, and C as three singular points. But 1 over A plus 1 over B plus 1 over C is greater than 1 over A star plus 1 over B plus 1 over C because we chose A to be smaller than A star. To be smaller than a star right here. And this is greater than one. Greater than zero, excuse me. Why do I know it's greater than zero? Because these are three numbers that they see around the vertex. So this is a spherical two orbital. And what you do now is you still remove it. And when you remove it, you get a boundary component that looks like this. And what you stick into that boundary component is a topological ball. It is a topological ball. The underlying topological space is the ball here with this picture inside of it and weights ABC. It's a cone. It's a cone on this boundary component. So you just cone the boundary component to a point. Okay? And so there's some more cases, but they basically all have the same flavor of this. Let's have a look at the teardrop for a second. Second. So we start off in a very similar way. We have our teardrop, which is a sphere topologically. And here it is, destroyed this way. S2 with some weight a, a greater than one. But that means it intersects the singular set with something that has weight a. And so you can imagine what we call the smooth case. That was the first case that we had. Smooth case that was the first case that we had for a football too. If this is just a smooth, simple closed curve, you take a neighborhood of the whole thing and it's almost exactly like what we had before. But let's suppose that it splits and let's have it split like this. Let's have it split here, weight n and n. So it splits to two equal weights. Of course, it does not have to. And over here, it's split to weight. Let me move this A. Let me move this A from here because it will confuse me in a second. A star and A, and maybe on this side they're not equal. We just want to look at both examples. So maybe A star is bigger than A. And then just like we did here, we're going to let this guy split into B and C, which we don't know anything about B and C. And so we take a neighborhood of this. This of this teardrop, and we extend it a little bit to swallow this thing over here. Now, a neighborhood of a teardrop, in this case, Xi, the topological, the underlying topological straits would be S2 crossing interval. This extension here, we say that this boundary component, which is topologically S2, has two singular. S2 has two singular points of the same weight, S2NN, and that's a good football, so it's a good boundary component, and cloning it will take care of that side. Over here, this is exactly this trick. We swallow all of this, and when we swallow all of this, we have S2 with weights. With weights A star B and C with A star I need to go to the heavy direction, so this inequality should have been the other way around. I'm sorry. We go with the heavier one, the bigger one. We have here on this. here on this side S2 A star B C I don't think I'm consistent with my star here actually I flipped it unfortunately but A star B C if you take the reciprocal and add them up you get something which is bigger than one over a plus one over B plus one over C the same as here and this has to be positive because they meet at the vertex so again you have a spherical boundary component okay Boundary component. Okay, so there are some more cases, but they're all the same. They're all almost the same. And here's what the actual fit is, rather than writing all the cases on the board. So, what we know is this. First of all, the underlying topological space of the thing that you toss out is always Always S2 cross interval or S2 cross S1 minus an open ball. The two cases that we saw, that's all the only cases that happened. Boundary XI is spherical, the cases that we saw. So you could have a boundary point just a smooth sphere, just a sphere right on the nose. Sphere, just the sphere right of the nose, but you can have a boundary component, like in this case S2ABC. But the ABC are such that S2ABC is a spherical orbifold, which means that you can cone it to a point. You can close the manifold up by coning. This is the boundary component right here inside this cone, by coning the boundary component to a single point. And the vertex is still a perfectly legal vertex in a three-orbit. And All possible or befold or befold are listed. So there's a list in the paper. There's a list of pairs, all possible orifice. Why do we need all possible orifice? Remember what the goal is. The goal is to take a theorem that I know for good orbitals and extend it for bad orbital. And extend it for bad orbitals. So I need to see what happens when I do exactly this move of removing xi and coning things off. So I kind of need to know what the xi's are. But this is like one of the most complicated xi's that you'll find. Let's take it off the board. All right. And so schematically, again. And so, schematically, again, we had this XI. Here is a teardrop. A teardrop would intersect the manifold in one point. And if it happens to be that the singular set looks like this, sorry, that's the picture that we looked at. That these two split and these two have the same. And these two have the same weight, and these two have different weights, then we take something that looks like this. Maybe I'll try to be more clear in my schematic picture. I don't know if it is more clear. This is a neighborhood of the teardrop. This is a neighborhood of the teardrop itself, where we extend it a little bit to add a neighborhood of this little chunk of the singular set that ends up with the same weight. Over here, we have a good football, or we extend it a bit more if the weights are different. If the weights are different, we can't stop in a picture like this because we'll have a bad football and we cannot be kept off. So we extend it the time a little bit more like this. Okay, this is all right so far. Okay. Okay. And so I feel bad about not writing the list of all the cases, but they're all so similar, you'd feel really bad if I did write it. So the last question remaining is, why does this ever terminate, actually? So let me give you a quick explanation of why I terminate. If it's quick enough, then I'll succeed with what I've, yeah, I found this. So I have to succeed. I've decided that I'm going to. Has succeeded. I've decided that I'm going to finish every talk early. So, why does this determine it? Well, we have to get rid of all the teardrops, we have to get rid of all the bad footballs. We start off with the teardrops. If you look at your manifold, your orbifer, rather, you have your singular set. Here is a very specific singular set. Maybe the underlying topological space here is S3. These are theories. These are teardrops. And so we have all these. This could, of course, also contain bad footballs, like, for instance, this sphere here is a football. And if these two numbers are different, then it's a bad two. This is an example, a specific example of an orbifold underlying topological space S3. I didn't cite the numbers, so it's not really a specific example, but close enough, I guess. And these are all bad. All bad. These are all teardrops. And the point is: let's give them names: T1, T1, T2, until take a collection of TN. If you look at T1 and you intersect it with the exterior of the singular set. So the singular set is a graph. The exterior of a graph is the same as the exterior of links and not what we always do. Take a small open neighborhood, you toss it out. Small open neighborhood, you toss it out. Um, do it to all of them. T N intersect not the senior set, but its exterior. So, what do we get? I mean, we obviously get a collection of disks because each one of these is a sphere. Hit it here in one point, you remove an open disk. This is a collection of closed disks. And each disk is obviously essential. Why is it obviously essential? Because, you know, a neighborhood of the graph is a handle body. The neighborhood of the graph is a handle body, and this circle here is essentially the handlebody. So, this disk is not going to be bounded parallel. This disk could perhaps be parallel to each other, but if you had two of these disks being parallel, then to begin with, you had parallel teardrops. So, this is the collection of essential pairwise non-parallel disks. And then Hatcher told us that there's a final. There's a finite number of them. This is a fixed manifold. The manifold here is the exterior of sigma. So there's only finitely many of them. Now, when you do this move, you take one of them, like this one for instance, you remove it, and my space planning here is awful. You get something that has two boundary components. This is the first boundary component. This is the first boundary component over here. This is the second boundary component over here. This boundary component, just in this example, has points which we're going to comb together like this. And this is what you get here. And over here, we're going to comb three points. And of course, this continues however it does. Also continues however it does. And you count three points. The point is that any teardrop that exists. Any teardrop that exists here after you do this move can be pushed out of the cones because they're cones. If you have something in a cone, you can push it out, which means it existed here. And then it's a very short analysis to say that the maximum number of teardrops that you have here is smaller than the maximal number of teardrops that you have here, assuming that you started with a teardrop, which is a part of a maximum collection environment. So it will terminate after the maximum number of steps that you could possibly need. Maximum number of steps that you could possibly need is whatever hatcher this count is. Okay? Yes, all right? So that's a very simple argument. It's a tiny bit more fun, though, when we talk about football. Because you know, that was similar. I could have used this picture. Put the picture, similar picture again. So say. So say that this is our orbital structure. This, of course, has teardrops. Here is one and here is another. And I can take these two teardrops and tube them together. Like so. Sorry, not like so. Like this. And here's a bad football. Well, it may not be bad. So let's say this is five and this is seven. And let's say that we know that five does not equal seven. So now it's a bad football. The problem is they can keep doing this. Here is this teardrop, and here is this teardrop. And here is this teardrop, and I can tube them again. And of course, I'm not going to tube them the exact same way. Anyway, gosh, I guess I'm better with the figurator than with the trephor. Material, just knot it inside. These are now non-isotopic teardrops and keep going in and pick your favorite knot each time. You don't even need to change it, and you'll get enough. To change it, and you'll get a nested sequence of footballs which is as big as you like. And so, this theorem that Hatcher gave us is just not true here. There isn't any finiteness of footballs. So, the correct theorem is the following. Suppose O has no slipper balls. Footballs. I guess no, no, no, no, no. Sorry. We're dealing with footballs now. No teardrops. So the picture that, see, I just erase it. The picture that we had here, we had one teardrop here, one teardrop here, and we tubed them together. And then we did a nested set of tubes. If you don't have teardrops, we can assume that because we already saw that there is only fine, there are only fine many. Is only fine. There are only fine many teardrops, and you get rid of them one at a time. Then, of course, if you wanted the statement here, it says there are only finitely many footballs. But the question is why? This is the more interesting question, I think. So here is a football five and seven that worked for us before. Let's skip the numbers. This is again, this is an orifold whose underlying topological space. Or if I was underlying topological spaces S3, and some numbers, of course, you have to put numbers here as well, but you know, they don't come into play. Let's put all twos. Here's a football. Now, the example from the tubes before tells us that football can be compressible. That's why we don't get the finiteness from Hatcher. If it compresses, it will compress to teardrop. Compresses, it will compress to teardrops. Once there are no teardrops, this football F is incompressible. This football F is incompressible. That's not enough for finance, of course. And so I won't write it down. Let me just explain it. I'll write it down if you need it. We have a collection of footballs which are pairwise. Are pairwise non-parallel and disjoint. And again, just like we did with steer drafts, we look at them at the exterior of the singular set. This will give a collection of annuli, because if you take this football topologically to sphere, you remove two disks that have the singular point, you just have a smooth annulus. That's what's left. And these annuli are not pairwise. Parallel, because if they were, then the two footballs would be parallel as well. So they don't have isotopic. And they're also essential because if not, they're not boundary parallel, is what you should say. They're not boundary parallel because if they were boundary parallel, you could push the entire football to a neighborhood of the singer set. That can't happen. Can't happen and they're incompressible. So you can say hatcher all you like, but I'm missing one condition. Right? I mean, everybody's muted, so I'm assuming that you're all giving me the answer that I want to hear, but you're muted. I'm missing boundary incompressible. And it's very easy to construct examples, as you can see here. It's very easy to construct an example where the football is boundary compressible. So you just don't get boundary incompressible. Just don't get boundary incompressible. But luckily for us, there's a theorem. Instead of Hatcher, you apply here Friedman and Friedman. Friedman and Friedman do exactly this. They say if you have a bunch of surfaces with boundary, they're not boundary parallel, they're incompressible, they're pairwise non-isotopic, and they have bounded Euler characteristics. These are on annually, so there's no problem with that. Are on annually, so there's no problem with that. Then they give you fineness of that without requesting boundary incompressible that gives finiteness. Let me just write it this way. Okay. So what happened here? We started off by saying that we want to understand orbifolds, and Thurston's orbifold theorem is the way to go about it. I don't think there's any doubt about that. I don't think there's any doubt about that. Not for three orbifolds. That's the way to go. And that's terrific, except that it requires the orbifold to be good. But a very nice gift from Thurston, if the orbifold is not good, if the orbifold is bad, then you can find an embedded to orbifold. And that gives you something to hang your hat on. And now what you do is you take one of these embedded to orbifa test v one. Embedded to or befold has to be one part of the maximum collection lava. Take one of these bad embedded to orbold, it will be either a teardrop or a bad football. You look at it the way it intersects the singular set, and you take a neighborhood of that together with the neighborhood of part of the singular set. You remove that and you cap it off. The thing we needed to prove is that there is a way to remove it, that you can cap it off, namely that the That you can cap it off, namely that the boundary component that you're left with are spherical. And after you do that finitely many times, you'll end up with a good orbifold. So, how do you use this to prove new theorems? You start with something that you know for a good orbifold and you reverse the process. You remove two balls, one or two balls, in the sense of cones on the spherical orbifold from your good orbifold, and you introduce one of the XIs and see whether your statements. And see whether your statement still survives. Okay, it's only by two minutes, but I'm still stopping early. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? In person? But you you're not assuming the manifold is a finite covering, right? Is there a difference? Not in our setting there is the difference, but in general, I think people say very good if it's a finite cover and good if it's an infinite cover. We didn't get into finite coverings at all because the place where we found the finite covering was. Where we found the final covering was by starting with geometric pieces, go to the universal cover. Typically, that's already in field, right? And then sticking them together. So in some situations, there is a difference, not in this dimension, but for us, very good or we faults, which are orifa with finite manifold cover didn't come into play at all. Thank you. Sure. Any other question? Any other question? Do you have an example of a theorem where that was known for good orbifolds and that you extended to bad orbifolds? No, no, no. We just provided the tool. We want you to do that. All right. I'll get up. The answer is no, no. Okay, the answer is no, no. Okay, no more questions. Let's thank the speaker again. Thank you all.
