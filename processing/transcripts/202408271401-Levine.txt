Laura and Kirsten from Biomi. I thought this was my third time here, but looking back, it's my second time. I guess it was twice. It was about nine years ago, was the twice twice. Anyways, it's great to be back here. So, and I'm going to try and do this using the modern technology here. Okay, so the hairy ball theorem, as you all know, it's one way to phrase it, is take n. Take n to m, the number, that's snips no makes the hairy ball theorem. So in Germany, they don't like the thought of a hairy ball for some reason. They ask Eaglesatz. Eagle is a hedgewind. So we didn't get anything. Anyway, so this is just a consequence of a very classical calculation. Huxley, which says that if you have V vector field on compact manifold. M, then the Euler characteristic of M is the sum of the indices or all the zeros. So it has to with isolated sales. So of course, we take M to be Sn, and then since an even-dimensional sphere is 2, this sum has to be 2. So that says this indices of certain integers, positive or negative, you attach at all the isolated zeros. Okay, great. So, and then preparing this talk, I realized this is not at all what I'm going to talk about. So, it's the opposite. So, conversely, suppose we have a compact manifold M, and the Euler characteristic is zero. Then, there does exist. There does exist that V, smell worse. Well, you might call this the hairy donut theorem if you want it to really be disgusting, but let's not do that. So, why? Why is this? Let's sketch of the proof. I think this is a proof. Sketch of the proof. I think this is a proof. So, why? You take the Euler class. I mean, a vector field is a section of the tangent bundle. You take the Euler class of the tangent bundle. And this, let's say, the dimension, let's M. And the Euler class lives in the top colomology, but it's in a twisted, in general, it's an. Twisted, in general, it's in a twisted cohomology. It lives, if you take a vector model, it has an Euler class, but it's in the local system associated to the determinant, so it's just called, that's the classical orientation bundle on n, is the orientation bundle for the tangent level, so it lives there. And then, so that's the first point, and then you have the remap from the top colonels, the compact map, what's like the integration. Compact matter. What's up? The integration. The orientation, isomorphic. So the H0 of the point, push forward, which is just Z. And it's actually, let's say, manifold is connected, just for fun. And so that's an isomorphism. And third, you have Gauss Bernay. Some version of Gauss Bernet. Of Gauss tells you that the degree of this Euler class is equal to the Euler characteristic, and that's zero. Okay, so that says the degree is zero, but this isomorphism says this is zero, and then you have obstruction theory, some version of obstruction theory that you met if you have real. If you have V of V equals zero, it implies V splits off somewhere. So this gives you a no-advantage in the section. So great. So the point of my talk is to say that, right, I mean, it also shows the same thing. If the Euler characteristics is not zero, then you recover without this identity, you recover, I mean, it's kind of the same. Identity, you recover, I mean, it's kind of the same identity. But you also recover that there is no such section because Euler class non-zero, then you can never have an section because the Euler class of a sum is the product of the Euler classes of this one has zero Euler class. Okay, so it's a different one. Great, so the point is, so developments in multimodal homotopy theory. Enable us to run this tape with some changes, changes in algebraic geometry. Okay, so I want to explain how. Okay, so I want to explain how this works. So the idea here is, you know, it's, and we're going to apply this. So our main result is we apply this to affine quadrix. And you see why the affine is important and the quadrix is also important. Not everything's affine quadrix, and we call it affine quadrants. Let me call it Q0 inside affine n plus 1 space, which is just the vanishing locus of some quadratic equation. We'll work over a field of characteristic. So this is k, you know, we're assuming characters. 2. Maybe we should assume k is perfect, but probably that we don't need that. So it means if you take a quadrant. So it means if you take a quadratic, you can affile, oh, this is the final sponsor. Some of some, it's, you know, it's like a football or something, right? Some of modified some of the squares as well. So an example of that would be SN, which is just the damaging locus of the sum of the squares of these two. Okay, so that's a particular example. And you see in a minute, oh, by the way, this is joint work with Anandewski, and it was in response to a question that I got by a securitus route that also Alexei got by a different securitus route from Berto Zanier, who's asking: let me put a K here, because it depends on the field. Let me put a k here because it depends on the field. The case of S2 over the 2x. See why that's an interesting case in the world area. Okay, so that was an unique question. Let me phrase it a little differently. So let's see. So I said you could run this tape, but there are some caveats. Here are the caveats. In running the tape. Oh, sorry. Yeah, but the tape. Sorry, put the topological argument in, then I guess what you're going to do here. Did you were you supposing some sort of compactness? Does this work? Yeah, this is compact. Yeah, compact now, well, n is the same thing. This is compact. I think you need to, in general, you need to say something about what happens on the boundary to do this. Get a non-vanishing vector field? Well, I don't know. Got me, got me. Usually, when you have a Got me right. Usually, when you have a mantle with boundary, you have to assume that the set that the vector field is modeled with the boundary. I'm about the person to ask. But it is interesting that in this setting, I'm assuming things are compact, and in this setting, I'm assuming they're affiliate, which is definitely non-compact. So I'm going to explain how that works and why. That's one of the caveats. That's one of the caveats. So, okay, first caveat is: first of all, we need an appropriate coherency theory to replace single. Single in cohomology. That's not going to be the right thing. And it turns out, you'll see in a minute, that even if we're over, this is going to be most interesting over a non-algebraic and closed field. And they are the usual standard replacement are the chow groups. And those are not sufficient. So you'll see what we have to do. Okay. So, second caveat is that. Caveat is that, so part of this uses this degree map here. So the degree map requires properties. In this setting, in all these settings, the degree map, if it exists, will require properness, but and the same there is. There is for a motivic version of the Gauss Connect theorem, which shows up. Gauss Colony, motivic Gaussian A. But the motivic obstruction theory, to the version of obstruction theory. So, in other words, if a suitable characteristic class vanishes. Characteristic class vanishes, then the bundle will split off with some add is only available. It's only going to be true. Let's say this is only available. It's not like a technical problem, it's a principal problem for affine. So it's a smooth affine. So we're not going to know that. So you have to kind of adjust that. Mark? Yeah. Is number one is for if K is automatically closed at the top. So, if k is algebraically closed, are the child groups enough? Yeah, I'll get to that. Yeah, k is algebraically closed. We'll see in a minute. Okay, so hold on. Let me not state our main theorem one. I'll do that at the end. The beginning, but since main theorem one is a nicer statement for applications, but it has little to do with my program for today. So, if time permits, I will tell you the nice result in terms. Result in terms of answering a particular question. Let me say a somewhat less useful theorem, but kind of gets at the program. And it's also the basis for the somewhat more useful theorem. I'll explain that later at the time of needs. State Okay, so we take, so let Q, so I have my Q0 already. This is the thing I'm interested in. And my main question here is, does the tangent bundle of this Q0 admit a nowhere vanishing section? The Q, this will be the V of information Ai xi squared minus x0 squared sine Tn plus 1. So that will be a projective closure of this thing. I mean, we're assuming characteristic is not 2. Of course, I'm going to assume that the product of the AIs is not 0. So this is a smooth affine quadrant. This would be a smooth projective quadrant. This would be a smooth projective quadrant. And then we have the intersection, the difference q bar equals the summation squared. So that's just, of course, q intercept zero using the sign of the p n of course high so. So Q0 is the open complement. Q is Q minus Q. Okay, so that's the setup. And we, for simplicity, we can say something not, but for this theory, we think we suppose that this squatter has a rational point. So this will be true, I mean, in the case of the spheres, of course, this. Of course, this, my q0 has a rational point, namely the unit vectors are all rational points, right? So that's okay. Friend? So now I'm going to make a bunch of statements, and the rest of the talk will be explaining everything in these statements. First of all, but they should remind you of the thing that I wrote before. So we have a degree map over the tilde here. Matilda's on everything. And this goes from a And this goes from a refined version of the child groups, child fit groups. We read map here, child tilde spec K, which is the Gildan V fit ring. K, is an isomorphism. So that's like my degree map before being an isomorphism. That's your buildings. Secondly, Okay. So that's that's my cohort. So these Chow-Witt groups are going to be my cohomology theorem, replacing the singular cohomology. And I'll explain what these are. So for and even, that's the interesting case of an alternate Gauss-Ronnet theorem. The alternate Gauss-Lonay theorem, together with an explicit calculation, this degree of, so there's an Euler class, that would be part of the story, of the choice of one of the Q, so notice this is my compact plot. So I have a Cal Sponay theorem for the compact smooth quadric, and this has an explicit expression. As an explicit expression, we saw these guys before. So 2, remember, this is the quadratic form, x goes to 2x squared. And then I add to it the second term, y goes to 2 times the product of the ai's. And then plus m times the hyperbolic form. So h is the film. h is the throne, x squared minus y squared. So you get this identity. And this thing here will be what I'll be calling the motivic Euler characteristic of Q over K. That's right. Because the name theorem is really that this is equal to this, but there's also a computation, this being this explicit. That's part of it. Yeah. And so again, there's no There's no M. Oh, this M. Oh, this M is the same M. It's half the dimension. I thought you meant capital M. It sounded like you were saying capital M. Speak very loudly. And for the odd M, N equals 2n plus 1, there's nothing to say. The Euler characteristic is. B this is so then the Euler, so again, N is 2M, then the Euler characteristic, so this is the thing I'm interested in, the Euler characteristic of the affine quadratic. This lives in child zero, child fit zero. Chauvin zero zero. This is zero if and only if this element here who product i plus m times h is in the image of the pushboard. The map of the child zero to sorry child three of child zero this is again that contain that coding fibrilla kit. So if you're you've never seen this before, then think of the situation. Then think of the sits, just take the tildes off of everything. So at least the statements will make some sense to you. And instead of gwk, you have the integers. Okay, so. And then would that integer be like 2m plus 2 or something? The integer, well, it depends. The integer would be 2m plus 2, right? It's the usual Euler character. You know what that is. You know what the quadrature is, a quadrant over even-dimensional quadrant. And finally, So, and finally, there's a trivial case for n equals 2 plus 1, we always have always. Yeah, am I supposed to eyeball that this child 0 tilde Q has no twist when you control it? Yes, there's no twist. Am I supposed to know that already? I'm going to talk about it. I'll tell you. No twists. We got the load twist. Twists. We got the node twists here. It's weird now. Yeah, my name is. No, it's not. It's okay. It's good. It's because it depends what the lower zero thing is. You'll see. The twists are hidden. What? And it's pondering duality, man. Oh? Alright, so. And then you'll see. It's all good. And then, okay, obstruction theory is the same. Abstraction theory is the same. So I can move the floor up. I should have looked abstraction theory. Then we have to finish off the story. We have what we have before, we have more to do with construction theory. Says that in a special case, in this case, E of this anger bundle is zero of tilde and zero. If and only if you can split off the side. In other words, if and only if there's a nowhere vanishing section. Okay? So. Okay, so the upshot is this tells you whenever you have an odd-dimensional quadrant, you always have a nowhere vanishing vector field. And when you have an even-dimensional quadrant like this, then you have this condition to check that whatever this, you have this hyperplane at infinity, and you want to know that this funny quadratic form here is in the image of the degree map. Image of the degree map, whatever that is. But I'll explain that all to make it all concrete. Okay, so and then if that's true, then if and only if that's true, then the tangent bundles has a nowhere vanishing section, nowhere vanishing mirrors. So that's the slope. Okay, any questions? So that's the end result. That may not mean anything to you at all. So now we want to fill these gaps with meaning. Meaning. So you had asked about the, so Andrea, you asked, is it you or Jim? asked about the case of K algebraically closed or of balls. You asked about that. Somebody asked about that. Somebody in this corner. K algebra. Well, I would see. I just asked. You asked. So now what happens? Well, it can be of any characteristic. Yeah, it doesn't doesn't k algebra even close. I think that's true. I think that's Morty's theorem. I think that's Morthy's theorem. So simple case, or the classical case parts use the other. So this is just for the obstruction here. I'm not going to talk about the whole thing. Maybe this end part here, just to see where we're going. So this is 1994. So it says that X be a smooth affine briding over an algebraically closed field the X vector bundle of rank Rank equal to, let's say, a dimension of x, let's say, call that n. Then v splits off a sum n if and only if the top term class of the row is in, well, coming in child n of x or it's the same as the zero for child lower zeros, and that's the n of. Lower zeros less than that's Merchi's theorem. That okay? Everybody happens? So that's Merci's theorem? Did you care for sig naught equals 2? I don't think so. This is not for the quadratic. No, no, no. This is just smooth affine quadrant. Smooth affine variety, not a quadrant. Just has to be smooth. You don't even need smooth. Right. I mean the quadrant won't be smo the one I wrote down won't be smooth. There are smooth quadrants too, but not like that. I'm saying the theorem is not, it doesn't have to be expanded. Oh, that's extended, yeah. That's true. Murti's theorem was smooth, and then Sribas, Krishna, Krishna extended that, but we're not going to talk about it. Okay, so then people said, okay, but what about if, okay, a classic example is this, is the sphere, right? The classic counter example of this is the two-sphere. Of this is the two-sphere, right? Because as we all know, even in the algebraic segment over R, the tangent bundle of the two-sphere is stably trivial, right? Because you just add the normal vector to it, and it becomes the trivial bundle. So that obviously has all of its term classes vanishing, but the classical hairy ball theorem tells you it doesn't split off a sum at. These balls. If not algebraically for example X C X squared equals C squared plus one V equals the tangent So stably trivial, so C2, T1, C0, no signs for the sign. Okay, so that's the example. So people thought about what do we do? And so the thing is, you have to find a refinement of the group. And so people, various people like Nori, I bought a car, a bunch of other people came up with these notes in the toilet. With the assumption formula class group. So just set a bunch of names. We're not going to talk about that. But, okay, so, but there's a, so this was, the Euler class group was just basically cooked up to receive an Euler class. So it wasn't part of a general theory, but now there's a nice general theory which actually agrees with this thing when they overlap. So instead of that, we're going to talk. Instead of that, we're going to talk about what we might call a quadratic. This is the thing we're looking at, refinement of child groups, namely this whole colour of child big groups. Okay, so that's our gadget. So actually, it's a child isn't. So, actually, it's a Chow ring. Just like a Chow ring, right? Intersection point. So, any questions so far? So, that's the thing. Now, I want to introduce the nice cohomology theory, which makes this work. You're part two of your theorem. This, I think, either the projective quadratic ever has a project. Yeah, because. Yeah, because if it did, the Euler class would be zero. That's right. So, unless, I mean, I don't think that this has a non-true zero rank, unless, like, unless m is 1. Rank is even, if m is 1, it's still, m is 1, 2 plus, well, whatever. I don't know what happens if m is 1, but if m is not 1, then you just look at the rank again. I mean, you just look at the usual degree of the, the rank is just the degree of the usual top turn cross. Of the usual top churn class. In fact, you already saw that. Chun plus two. Right. So, right. So, yeah, so the rank was always non-zero. So the top churn class is non-zero, so you're going to have to get it. It's unusual for For hazard bundle to have a non-zero section, except for one project. But affine case is less surprising. Okay, so what's the child bittering? So for the child wit ring, I want to first talk about the proponent of the ring, which I already introduced a little bit. It's based on this. The basic idea is the child group. Is the child group built out of sums of algebraic sub-varieties with integer coefficients, and the child bit groups are built out of sums of algebraic varieties with coefficients being quadratic forms. Some sense. That's the method. Okay. So let's see. We take F, field, we already saw this in Morocco's talk. Field, for simplicity, let's assume we are pieces of F. Let's assume R plus C of F is not true. And then we have this gives us the equal ring of F. So what is this? This is, you take a set of non-degenerate quadratic forms. So this means that you have a finite dimensional vector space and a quadratic form. Homogeneous 3-2 map satisfying some additional conditions. K, valid value things, modulo isometry. And then this thing has, you know, orthogonal direct sum. If you take two such guys, then on V plus W, you just take the sum of the values. So that's that. So you take this thing, the commutative monoid. The commutative monolay and take the group completion of this. Okay, so that's what this is: additive structure. And so, in characteristic mod2, this is the same thing as a non-degenerate metric by linear form. So, V plus V K. And here, you can take tensor product. If you have two such, you have V and If you have two such, if you have a V and a V prime, then you take V tensor V prime. Let's say V tensor V prime, W tensor W prime. It's just a product. That's what it is on pure tensors, and then of course it extends, because everything. So this thing, this thing here, makes this open space. Okay, so it's formal differences of quadratic, non-degenerate quadratic forms. That's the additive structure, and then this thing makes it into a ring. And we all already know any quadratic form is diagonalizable. We've seen the notations for the sum of AIs. You know what's the relation? For example, A times B, you take a rank one symmetric bilinear form, it's just the number A. It's a unit A, and unit B, it's just a B. That's the tensor product. Rank one symmetric bilinear form. One by one matrices. What's it called? The somebody product on matrices. Famous old chronic. Famous old chronicler. Chronicer, right? The chronic or product of one by one matrices is just the product. Okay? Okay, good. That's that. What else? Okay, so we have, we've seen what this state is. It's the product. We have our hyperbolic form, this state here. And then we have the bit ring. W of F is the quotient. is the quotient GWF module the ideal H. So I should say we also have sending, if you have actually a quadratic form, sending it to random q, which is just equal to the dimension of V, extends through a ring homomorphism, which is also called rank from G W F. F along to Z. And if you take any quadratic form Q and you multiply it by H, it's just the rank of Q H. That's a friendly identity. And so this ideal is just the same thing as the subroot generated by H. And you have this pullback square, H w f to C. To C maps of W of F, and you have a sort of a reduced rank map because the H has rank 2, the reduced rank goes to Z mod 2, and this is a fiber spring. So all the interesting quadratic information here just comes from here. So in fact, if you take the kernel of these things through certain, the augmentation ideas are the same. Okay, anyway, so now you. Telling you a little fun facts about this, but we need a little bit more. So, of course, you know, modern mathematics, we don't just have things with values in a field, we have things with values in a one-dimensional vector space over the field. So if if this bit ring the same one that I'm familiar with, could be, you've got a 50-50 chance on it. A 50-50 chance on two bit ring. It's not the bit ring of FP is ZP. No. Exactly. It's not that one. It's the other. The one that I'm not. Yes, that's the definition. Literally not to move. So let L be one dimensional F. Vector space. So it's the same as F, as you don't have a choice. Same as F, as we don't have a choice of one, right? And then we have G, W, F value, and L. These are just L value quadratic forms, etc. You do the same thing where now your quadratic form has values of L, but of course you don't have a ring structure, but you do have a product if you have one L and another L. If you have one L and another L, L prime, then the product goes into L tensor L prime. So except for that, it's the same story. Okay? So get a bigrided ring structure. This is a mod. This is a, of course, this is a GWF module. Have the same thing, WFL equals. It's G W F L tensor over G W F W times L. Trying to just reduce, it's the same thing as taking G W of F L module H times G W of F. Okay, that's the L value in bit. Okay, I'm going to need this. Okay, so now we can give kind of a definition of our child bit groups. Yeah. The question for NAS is, do we know what these things look like? Yeah, some of our. Yes, we do. Any other question? What are they? Oh, FP. I don't know. Are they finitely generated? Okay. Are they finitely generated? Okay, so they're not always finitely generated. Okay, for algebraic or even a quadratically closed field, the rank map is an isomorphic, GW, right? Because the, you know, A is 1, right? For R, you have not just the rank map, you have the signature map. That gives you a map of GWR into C cross Z, rank and signature. It's not an isomorphism because the rank is always congruent to the signature model too. With a signature mod2. It's the only condition. Pairs A, B, A, Car root B mod 2. For the integers, and you can do this for rings also. And for the integers, GW of the integers is the same as GW of the rings. That's a viewable result. It's not so obvious. For a finite field, the kernel, so the augmentation ideal is Z mod 2. So the augmentation ideal is Z mod 2 given by the discrepancy. So it's a Z mod 2 extension of Z with the other mirror. Additively in C cross C mod 2. But the funny thing is for the bit ring, it depends on the finite field. It's either C2 cross C2 or C mod 4, depending on 1 group 1 mod 4, 3 mod 4, something like that. Okay, does that help? There's a presentation, but I'm not going to use the presentation. But I'm not going to use the presentation. It's a simple presentation with these rank one things, generators, and three relations. What's an example where it's not finitely generated? Well, I mean, you take a field like Q would join infinitely many variables. So any reasonable field. Any other good examples? Good. Okay. Probably. Okay. Probably running fast out of time here. Oh, yeah, okay. Okay, so let's see, see how far we can get. Okay, so you might recall for the child groups, what's the presentation of the child, so the child n of x? It's a problem presentation. Take the correct sum over all the co-dimension n minus 1 points of x. n minus one point of x, and you take the resonant field, and then you have the visor map of the solar wall, the cold image from the endpoints of x and z, and the cohort map is chow x. So there's a sort of similar story for the chow. So now we have chow n tilde of x twisted by L. Twisted by L. L is a what's a very Lin is somewhat happier. So now we have a line bundle. Okay, so I'm not sure that's a bit too far. Okay, so what's this? So if you have one of these x's, you have x some point in x of some codimension, and then let's define the orientation vector space of x. Vector space of x to be the determinant. I mean, it's kind of reasonable. You take the determinant, you take the maximal ideal inside the local ring, like mx inside of whole xx, modulo square, dual. That's the orientation. You know, it's, if you were to spread out x to be some subvariety, you took a smooth locus of it, this would be, but this is the normal. This would be, this is the normal bundle to that at the generic bundle. That's what that is. Okay? It's the determinant of the bundle. Okay, so it turns out, so I'm going to write down something. What's the label of the arrow and the arrow and the resolution? What's the label? This is arrow. Divisor. Take a function on a curve, you take its divisor, it's going to be a bunch of points. Okay, so here. Okay, so here's a similar complex, direct sum x. I'm probably going to have to cut my discussion a little short, but there's another group. So remember, this thing here, if you're familiar, this is Milner K1 of Kx. If you don't know that, then fine. What's his meaning? Okay, and now you have a Milner-Witt K1 of Kx twisted by. Twisted by orientation bundle at x, tensor. This is a kx vector space. So a tensor with the number kx with l. Or you take the finer l. Okay, you have that thing, whatever that is. Then you have something which is like a divisor map to the sum. Now it's going to look a little more familiar. x try that xn. Now you have the Hilton-Bit ring of KX, the same kind of twist, or different orientation bundle, because you're changing point. Same thing, but it continues actually. There's another condition. So here, every chain is a cycle. Every co-chain is a co-cycle, right? Every co-chain is a co-cycle, right, for the children. There's no further boundary. Here there's a further boundary. And it goes into the victory. A x again, orientation constants. So this x x and x. So this is just to convince you. So, and then this thing here, and I put this in degree n, this is h n of this complex. So, a generator would be sum of sub-varieties with quadratic forms with values in some funny sheaf of the resume field with some additional condition on the boundary of that thing, which may not be zero, modulo something which looks like a depyl. Okay, since I'm almost running out of time, I'm not going to say anything. Or, but here's our matrix of interest. Here's our matrix of interest. Take L to be omega x. Okay? And then you notice that here, in this case, and you take n to be the dimension of x, so what's this thing here? If you have a closed point, this is just a dual of omega x at that point. Right? This thing is just the tangent space of x at that point, and that's its dual. At that point, and that's its dual. I mean, that's what this thing is, and it's a determinant. That's the dual of omega x. So if you take L to be this thing, and you multiply these things together, that's trivial. So that goes away. Very good. That's why this is a nice sheet. So in that case, and this thing is empty. There's no points of codimension m plus 1, and n is the dimension of x. So that gives you a presentation. So x0, so I'm going to rewrite this. We set then chow tilde 0x to be chow tilde dim xx twisted by 1 digital x. So you get this presentation, you have a boundary from some k1, which we don't care about, like a divisor, g w x. X on the child zero of X. Okay. So that's our group of interest. Zero cycles with coefficients, quadratic forms of the residue. Everything is a cycle. What's that? Everything's a cycle. Because this thing is empty. You plug it out of the mention here. Yeah. Yeah. There's nothing there. Okay, so I was going to say something about the bias. Something about the visor map in this case, but I'm really waiting about that. Alright, so let's see how far this is. So, okay, so let me just cut to the chase. So, why do we put these funny twists in there at all? Well, it's because let me just say, I've made a whole list here. Here. So the bunctor XL goes to child star XL tilde has properties parallel to the functor x goes out. Okay, so this guy here is a T cross pick of X module 2. So if you twist this by the square of a bundle, it doesn't change anything because squares don't care. You know, you don't care about squares organic forms. This is a graded ring. You have for f for y for x, you have f star. Y to X, you have F star, the obvious way, right? You pull back the line bundle to Y, you have a graded pullback. You have F from Y to X proper. You have an F lower star, but here you have to put the twist. So let me just put it in child. Let me use child n of y, omega y. Omega y answer S L to child N minus T, where this is relative dimension V hold up Y m. So we have proper push forward, but that's why you need this because you have the orientation sheet comes in. It's just like, it's completely analogous to the theory of cohomology of. Theory of cohomology of C infinity maps, where the orientation bubble is a little more complicated because the car group is not such as C mod 2. Okay, that's the whole thing. Then we have Euler class. Have V to X rank rank R. Then you have the Euler class of V. What is it? Well, we have pushboard. You take S0 lower step. Push forward, you take S0 lower star of the unit in the child bit ring x and put that. This turns out to land in chow hit r on x twisted by the inverse of the determinant of d. We work it all up. That's the orientation. And various other properties, which I okay, but let me mention now why this is of interest. Why is this of interest? So now you have the obstruction, the analog of RT's theorem. That works theoretically. Any questions? Is the point that you have to identify this other files with some possible thingy? What's that? You have to identify this EV with like the content? Yeah. Yeah. So generalizing, so generalizing, which was originally due to Morel, and then it got fixed up by us on that. Ben, I think that's right, isn't it, Tom? Are you on this? No, no, no. Okay. Okay. No, that's a different scope. Really? Okay. It says you have V on X. This is smooth. Half I, same as you notice theorem, over field K. Maybe it has to be perfect. Bank of V equals N equals the dimension X. Is the dimension of x, then the Euler class v, each of x, w is zero, if and only if v is w plus one x. So, I don't want to have a little bit of time. Okay, so that's that's Mercedes there. Now, how do we apply? I thought Morel would define this E V as like a thing that comes up from a plastic clock tower. Yeah, but but then you have to compare to that. You have to compare. It's not so easy. No, I didn't do this. You didn't do this at all. I think it's easy because actually it's not that hard. You have the universal case. But maybe we'll just We'll just have to. Is that also the other class of B that lives in an untwisted shell? Are those two different other classes? No. I don't think so. Just the ordinary, even the ordinary other C, so if we're working over C and then over C, then uh over C, this thing is essentially the same as the child, so there's nothing to work. Given that the determinant of my Give me the determinant of my I mean no no that's not true. n is equal to the dimension. Remember this this thing is something like a child zero with some twist. So for example, so here's my example. V is a tangent bundle with x. The determinant inverse of v is omega x. And the Euler class, the tangent bundle, lives in what I was calling the Chow momentum. Oh, because the upper end Yeah. Oh, because the upper end with the omega is the same as the upper side. Yeah, this definition is the upper end. Yeah, that's the thing. So it's a notational thing. But it's nice because these things are covariant and functorial without having to worry about the twist. Because the twists are in here, right? You put the twist in here and here. And then. And, okay, so what was that? Okay, quadratic oiler divergent. So remember, so Maura told us about this metic stable homotopy category, which is a symmetric category, lots of things. And we also have this functor, this infinite P1 suspension functor from speed. Functor from smooth variance K here. And the point is with a plus. And the point is, as long as you invert the exponential characteristic, the image, so take for x in here, this guy here is dualizable. So possibly after inverting Inverting the characteristic of k if positive. So when you have a dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal category, you have a theory of traces. So you get out of this thing the trace of the identity on x living in the endomorphisms of the unit object here. So I have to actually, okay. So I have to actually, okay, and then we had Morrow mention Morel's theorem, which says this is g w over k. So I cheated here. You really have to invert the exponent, the characteristic of k if it's bigger than 0, but we're taking the characteristic not to be 2, and all the torsion in here is 2 torsion, so it doesn't lose anything except possibly the rank, but the rank you know anyways. That's just the usual topological order. So it really, it really works. So it really, it really works. And this is what we call mativic, I don't know, let's characterize something like so. Hey. And now there's a series of results, which are now out of time. Very close to out of time, so I won't go through these in detail. But remember, we had this funny Particular quadratic form. So this is very abstract and it's not so easy to compute from this definition, but this is computable with various notions of what you mean by computable. First of all, there's a theorem by myself with Paul Raxett. With Raxit, it says, I won't give the precise statement. So for x, smooth and projective, okay, this thing here is computed from the Hodge homology plus. Plus the cup product and the choice one dimension. So let me not write down the formula. It's not basically you just take the cup product here and you're landing here and then you take the trace and that's your symmetric bilinear form, except it's not symmetric, but anyways. But anyways, most of the symmetric. Okay, that's what that is. And then there's a nice theorem Trinivas, which gives an explicit, this is essentially this work of Carlson, Carlson, and Griffiths, slightly. It's slightly refined, but you can express this thing here in terms of the Jacobian rate of f if x is equal to the solutions of a homogeneous polynomial if p of x1. And the upshot is is upshot is that the quadratic Euler characteristic of my Q has this explicit expression 2 plus 2 times the product of the AIs plus M times H Q is okay so that's that so that's where that comes from Then to finish off, I have one minute. So then, to finish off, you have this localization sequence, which we have in the child groups. It's the same as the localization sequence for child groups. That's one minute. That's one minute. So now we have polarization for the project that I'm interested in. It's closure complement. It says we have child 0 over QR Y I upper star child 0 over Q child upper star. Okay, and then we have these degree maps. These are just the push-forward for the structure map, which we have going to GWK and And we know this is the Gaussian A thing. Did I write this? Yeah. I didn't write these. This is equal to, here I'll write it, Gaussian A, which says that for x squared one second and projective, this thing is equal to the degree of the Euler class of the bottom class. Okay. So, what does that say? It says here you have. says here you have the Euler class heterogeneity Q. This goes at this point between e plus 2 Ai plus A H. And now that says, now there's a theorem of Feld which says if this is an isomorphism, if Q of K is not empty, just because you have a quadratic with a rational point, it's by a rational with Pf. And you can calculate Pn. And you can calculate exactly what happens to Pn, and it's the same thing that happens here. Feld's theorem says that this thing is a birational empiricity. So you have this, and then this goes, of course, to the oil and fats here. You want to know, is this zero? So this is zero if and only if this guy here is in. is in the degree here, degree tilde of zero tilde, which is method. Right? Nothing in here. When does it go to zero here? It comes from here, but you can, this is an isomorphism, so it comes from here. It's adding the image, it comes from the image there. That's the story. So thanks for your attention. Sorry, we're going over time. Questions? How easily can you check? Check what? Death. Death, what are you? Oh yeah, that's great. So the Zagnier's question, right? He asked about Q2. And the funny thing is, so here's the thing. We assume that this thing is anisotraphic, this thing has a K-point. But. K-point. But over Q2, this thing does not have a K-point. When this thing has a K-point, it's very easy. If this thing has a K-point, then you get everything in here. You get the whole Groglandy-Good grain that comes from that K-point. If you have any quadratic form at that K-point here, it gives you the degree is just the isomorphic. I didn't say the degree is some kind of trace map, quadratic forms, which I wanted to say. I ran out of time. But if you have a K-point on Q-bar, this map is. K point on Q bar, this map is surjective. So there's no question. So if this thing is isotropic, has a K point, then everything's fine. But over Qp, where P is odd, this thing always has a QP point. So then it's easy. And you can even write it down using the fact that this thing has a K point, we split off a hyperbolic factor, blah, blah, blah. Write it down as such. Over Q2, it definitely does not have a K point. Q2, it definitely does not have a K-point. So you have to think a little bit and write down something so you can do that. And actually, but it doesn't give you an expression for the section. And actually, this fellow who Zagnier was a contact, Peter Moor, who was a computer science guy, after he found for us that there really is a section, he was able to run a computer program to write down the section over Q2. But there are a lot of But there are a lot of fun results you get out of this where you can actually make this practical. And then I said this last sort of better theorem tells you that this condition is maybe a little hard to check, but there's an easier condition. You have your quadratic form. So your quadratic form Q, which was the sum d Ai plus R squared. That was my quadratic form. And you can let D equal the set of values of Q. equal the set of values of Q. Right? Okay? And this is going to be, if this is anis, non-zero values. Okay? And then this generates a subgroup inside of k star, and you look at it by those squares. And the condition, using some really nice results from quadratic forms, that is equivalent with this. Is equivalent with this is that this is satisfied if and only if minus one is the one. So this is a little easier to check. I mean, it's, you know, it's fine. You can really just work with a thing and check it. This is actually, you can even write, you can kind of explicitly write down what this degree is in terms of knowing. You have to know what the closed bytes of this thing are. So it's fairly computable in this. So it's fairly computable and this part is even more computable. Yeah. So uh we have this this tangential bundle within the plug right is a very explicit projective reference to the module or the coordinate break of the plugin. Right. And we're asking for an element that doesn't vanish. An element in the module that doesn't vanish. Right. I guess the power doesn't just hunt for this in the module. The module or any language. Well, that's what Peter Mueller did. I mean, but it's pretty you I'll I'll show you the I'm not going to write down it'll take me five minutes to write down the three by three module. So it's a little complicated. But actually that raises, so in the case of rank two, this tangent bundle always has trivial determinant. So for rank two, the dimension two quadric, it has, splits off a trivial sum n if and only if it's a trivial bundle. And so that's asking, but it's also the That's asking, but it's also the, you always have, so you have the Euler sequence, right? You have your quadrant q0, so i inside of a n plus 1. And you have i star the tangent bundle of a n plus 1. And then it goes to the normal bundle, which is the trivial bundle on q, right? Because you have a radial vector. Just, you know, the gradient of your. You know, the gradient of your water here. Right? That's the goes to Q0. And then the kernel is the 100 Q0. Right? And it's affine, so this always splits. And the splitting is just, you can explicitly write it down, it's just this vector. That gives you the split point. Because the sum, this dot product with this dot product is one by definition. By definition. Okay? So, what you're doing, if you want to show that this is trivial, you want to show this bundle is trivial if and only if this thing here is a unimodular row. Sorry, unimodular row in the coordinate ring q0 over that coordinate row. Over that quarter. So, in the case of rank 2, you're just asking, sorry, this is an x1. It's x1, x2, x3, a unimodular row over the coordinate ring of the sphere over whatever field you're looking at. And so he wrote down 303. I don't know something. Is it still on? It's so hard. So, maybe it's a very naive question, but two is just a number. So, suppose, I mean, a lot of what you do, you could re-start the cubic surfaces, but the hard surfaces. So, where does it break down? So, I mean, that computation presumably needs to be done. And then on the right-hand side, you use my lava. It's this part here. This is the part. So, for a cubic surface, for example, the cubic surface. When is a doorman? When is a door not? When is a cubic surface birational to P2? It's not just that it has a rational. Okay, but if you have a cubic surface that is birational to P2, then you can run this same table. And it's actually even easier because you know already, I mean, it's probably even, probably it's even easier because for, well, it's not so easy to calculate in general what this thing is. This thing with Simon and Shrunivas. Simon and Shrunivas. It's kind of amusing, but in any particular case, it's a rather long calculation. It just turns out that the equation for the project is diagonal. So it's very simple to make this calculation using the Jacobian ring for the Cheyes, Charge Or, et cetera, et cetera. If you take a diagonal hypersurface, in other words, like a generalized Fermat hypersurface, it's also just as easy to make the calculation and you get something which is two pieces, you know, you just have to. Which is two pieces, you know, you just have the degree plus something else plus a hyperbolic. That's if the degree is even and the degree is odd, you just have this. So if you have like a Fermat cubic, if that happens to be by rational to P2, then it's very easy to make the calculation. But in general, it's not calculation is not so easy to make. So I mean you can there are Sabrina, you probably wrote a computer program to do this at one twenty, right? To do this on 20, right? Oh, okay. Tom would probably write a program that will spit it up if you do it by hand. It gets rather cumbersome after a while. It's not so easy. This is this form. This is Eisenberg, this Eisenberg Levine, which is Harold Levine by Kim Shawsville form. So they they did a lot of those things having to do with real uh algebraic geometry, but they Uh algebraic geometry by the geometry.
