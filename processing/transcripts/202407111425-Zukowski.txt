Animation on the jellyfish, of course, uh but also with Gut, uh sorry, maybe connections. Uh I think Gott was already sharing mechanics on the jellyfish. A lot of in common. But of course, Stefan is maybe not technically my supervisor, but he works a lot with us and has a lot of help solves things. And I think I would like to start by saying that it's a very special event for me. It feels like tails. It feels like Taylor suited for Taylor made for the project of my PUC, which is my big networks. And I'm very glad that you are all here. I'm enjoying every presentation. They are super interesting. Thanks for you. And thanks to everybody who helped the organization with Animix in the first place. So I think there were a lot of hints toward my talk today and what I would And what I will talk about, you've already seen some of the pictures from this slide. We can start with the jellyfish. You remember from anonymous talk that the jellyfish develops, the jellyfish kind of network develops with the sprouts coming out of the circular rim, and then they are growing towards the stomachs in the center. And finally, they reconnect. Like to understand these reconnections. So, chronologically, we These reconnections. So, chronologically, we discovered this kind of interesting phenomenon in the jellyfish that if the longest cannot be connected to the outlet of the network, let's say, to the stomachs, then the neighboring ones are immediately reconnected. Then you also have heard from, for example, from Tony that similar cases and from Pyotr that similar things can happen in Similar things can happen in fractured dissolution cave formation. So you have some instability growing. So the black part is dissolved gypsum in the experiment of Klochtlab. And the white pin is built gypsum, which is not dissolved. You see the fingers are extending to the right. And again, when one of the fingers is touching the outlet, we see the reconnection. We've made also some viscous finger experiments, which is already mentioned, but just to remind you, you have two plates, you fill the space between. Two plates, you fill the space between them with some viscous fluid, and you blow the center, okay, and you see how the bubble is growing. Again, some instability is going on, some finger-like patterns. They usually ripple from each other, they do not reconnect until one of them breaks through and touches the output of the system. And then you can see that the neighboring one, the shorter one, can reconnect. And finally, we also find some examples in the literature of streamer discharges. Streamer discharges, so there are people who are making some sparks, some small lightnings in the lab. So they put high voltage between the pieces. They put high voltage between cathode and anode, and they observe how the charges are formed. And again, they note that when one of them bridges a gap, we will see reconnections of the shorter ones, immediate reconnections of the shorter ones. So we wanted to understand how this works, or how the fingers are interacting. Are interactive. Question: What's your definition of a breakthrough? So, the definition of my definition of breakthrough is that one of the fingers is kind of connecting to the outlet and inlet of the system. So, here the outlet is the outer, let's say, atmosphere, and the inlet is the place where we blow to push the air inside the heat. So, here we have an inlet which is providing fresh water to the Which is providing fresh water to the system, and the outlet is just so a breakthrough has happened, and then after the breakthrough happens, you happen to have a black change. Yes, exactly. Can you phrase it like when you have percolation, then you have recognition? Yes, you can phrase it like that. Yes. So to understand it, we can use this very basic Laplacian growth model, and I think. Basic Laplacian growth model, and I think already Julia was mentioning about it. And we've seen many examples of it. You can complicate it more, but the basic idea is that you have some diffusive field. This can be concentration, for example, VGF, or it can be pressure of the fluid inside a helicopter cell. And again, you have the inlet where you have very high pressure, for example, and the outlet when the pressure is low. There are two. There are two phases, okay? And you have the interface between them, which is growing intact, which is moving because of this pressure degradation in our system. And the instability is growing on this interface whenever the mobility inside of the invading phase is higher than the mobility of the invading phase. And later on, when the then the fingers are developed, they can interact with each other. Tony was already saying a bit about the screening in the system and stuff like that. So In the system and stuff, I guess. So, we'll work a lot on this mobility ratio parameter. So, just to do one more time, you can take the ratio of the mobility of fading phase and to the retreating phase, and this would be our mobility ratio. So, this could be, for example, the different diffusion coefficients in the samples, or different viscosities for viscous field. Viscous finger. And what is often done with this model is sort of the invading phase is usually neglected. So you can say that if the mobility ratio is very high, so the invading phase has, for example, very big diffusion coefficient, then everything will diffuse so quickly there that it doesn't really matter if we solve for the field inside of the invading phase. We can directly put the value of the field from the inlet on the varying interface. Okay? On that growing interface. And I think, as Lady Julia was saying, this leads to some consequences and specifically not to look formation, because then the fingers are repelling from each other and there are no attraction. So we focused on very basic case. We just have two fingers in our cell, and we would like to study how they interact. So you can calculate the field. So, you can calculate the field around these two fingers. Again, you have inlet on the left, outlet on the right, high pressure on the left, low pressure on the right. You have two different mobilities inside and outside. And you can just, and periodic boundary conditions on top of the bottom. You can calculate the blood flash around the fingers, and you can draw contour lines. So you can see immediately how the longer finger is screening the shorter one. The shorter one, okay? So all flux is concentrated by the shorter finger. This is very similar to how the lightning rods work. So did you have control lines for pressure or for what? For pressure, yes. So very similarly, we put lightning rocks on top of our buildings, they bend electric potential lines, and they attract lightnings. And this is basically what happens in this system. Okay, so we have this thumb finger and the So we have this thumb finger and the shorter one is freed. So there is no flux of the field coming to the shorter one, which would mean that it wouldn't grow. And also if you would imagine that they are of similar length, they would naturally grow away from each other because they would get most flat subtitles from the sides. This was also what Timothy was mentioning. If you have two sprouts, they would never reconnect. But this thing But this case changes when we decrease the mobility ratio. So when we start to include the start to think about the field inside of the fingers, and we start to calculate the field also inside of the fingers, which was already shown by Kod and his other PhD students, by Agnis Kaputek. So with this low mobility ratio, you see that the field enters much more into the system. The shorter finger kind of gets some pots of the field. Finger kind of gets some ads of the field, there is potential drop inside of the longer fingers, which would enable this smaller finger to grow and, of course, also to reconnect, because it can get some flexible effect from the bottom, from the locker finger. But still, the question will remain: how do loops appear when we have time mobility ratio in our system? And what changes exactly when we are near the breaks? So, when one of the longest, when the longest, So when one of the longest, when the longest finger is touching the outlook of the system. So we study that now. We can zoom in at the tip of the shorter finger. And we can calculate the flux of the field which is reaching this smaller finger. And then what we do, we change the gap size, so the distance between the longer finger and the outlet of the system. And you can see that when we are far from the outlet, the shorter finger is. The shorter finger is getting almost anything. So it doesn't get any flags, it doesn't grow, only the longer ones are growing, as Tom was showing. But then, when the longer one is coming closer and closer to the outlet, at some critical distance, there is rise of this flux of the field at the shorter decorative. And you see that it kind of revives. So at some moment when we are So at some moment when we are enough close to the outlet, we can get flux of the field coming and our shorter finger will revive and grow again. We can repeat this procedure, this calculation for other mobility ratios. And you can see that for low mobility ratio, we almost always have some flux of the field in the shorter finger, which is consistent with data observations. But then if we decrease. If we increase the mobility ratio, we need to be closer and closer to the outlet to start seeing this increase of the flux at the tip of a shorter figure. And interestingly, actually, it only shifts in gap. So if you look at these plots, they are only shifted. And you can see that if you plot them as a function of If you plot them as a function of mobility ratio times d, they all collapse on one curve, which means that this critical distance, this critical distance at which we start to feel the outlet scales as m to minus one. So if we have bigger innobility ratio, we need to be closer to the outlet to get the revival in our system. So then we can talk also about the interactions between the fingers. So we can define some fraction and review. Find some attraction and repulsion by just again looking at the fingertip and saying, Okay, if I get more flux of the field from the left, I will go to the left and be repulsed from the longer finger. Contrary, if I get more flux of the field from the right, from the side of the longer finger, I will go to the right and be attracted to the longer finger. And then we can plot this kind of maps of interaction. Kind of maps of interactions. So we plot them in the face-to-face mobility ratio and the finger length ratio. And you see that maybe the colours are not great, but you see that this is attraction, this is repulsion. It was yellow in the presentation. But you see that we have this small island of attraction for finite mobility ratio, for small mobility ratio and for small length ratios. But then most of the cases are. Most of the cases are still repulsive, so we will still get repulsion between the fingers. But this dramatically changes when we decrease the gap size. So when we are coming closer and closer with the longest fingered out, you see that this is attraction is growing. There are some regions of high attraction. And finally, when we are after the breakthrough, when the gap size is zero, everything is kind of attractive and we would get direct connections in. Get direct connections in every case. Yes. So finally, you can come to some sort of dynamic simulations. So we also wanted to see how the loops are forming. So to simulate the growth of these fingers, again you look at the fingertip of each finger and you calculate the field that is coming to the tip. And this would be the velocity of the Velocity of the finger, and then I think what Hanser was mentioning, the fingers are always trying to get the most flux they can. So they will grow in the direction from which the highest gradient is coming. And then you can along with the fingers, and of course you can also see how the field is changing around them. So you can see this competition between them, and then at the beginning there is competition, then one of them wins and kills the other one. And fills the other one, but when it connects to the outlet, you see the fill drop inside of it and the revival and reconnection going on. We can take a look at the velocity of the shorter finger. So again, when we look at the total velocity, the plug-dash line, you see that we have this competition at the beginning. I didn't mention that I started with very slightly different initial conditions. Initial conditions. So, one of them was a little bit longer. So, then when you look at the shorter one, it tries to compete at the beginning, but then, of course, the instability kicks in and the screening phase, the second one is long enough to screen the shorter one, okay? So, the velocity of the shorter finger starts to decrease. But then, when we are coming closer and closer to the breakthrough, you see that the You see that the shorter finger starts to revive, and then finally, after the breakthrough, you see the jump in velocity, which hence I'm the reconnection. And similarly, you can look at the direction of growth. The red line is presenting velocity y-direction. So away from the longer finger is repulsive at the beginning, and then very close to the breakthrough, it gets attractive, and it starts to be attractive to you. And it goes in direction can it go? And it goes in each direction, and it constantly. And finally, we can take a look at our experiment. So this was the fingering experiment. So we blow in air, or push water into the oil, you see the fingers forming. This is our shorter finger. I use flat. So again, if you can see it, so there is this long finger which is swimming. This long finger which is winning, there is this small bump which is kind of getting stuck because it's screened, but after the breakthrough, you see the reconnection. So, this is exactly what we are also seeing in our simulations, that you have this screening phase, then before the breakthrough, actually, there is the revival phase, and after the breakthrough, you get further acceleration and reconnection. So, this is high mobility ratio case. So, yes, the mobility ratio in this system is just the inverse of the viscosity ratio. And you can take a look also at the fractural dissolution. So, it was already mentioned, but maybe it's a bit conceptually or it's less common, so I will explain it in more detail. Since I have five minutes, you have initial cell, okay? But in circle in part of the bottom plate, it is replaced with a The bottom plate is replaced with a gypsum gypsy, okay, which is easily soluble with fresh water. Then you inject fresh water, which is kind of eating this gypsum, okay? And this introduces basically two phases because each phase here has different average. There is more space for fluid to move here in the dissolved area than here in the fracture. And as the mobility in a filial cell is In a fidel cell, is depending on the aperture, you get this mobility context. So, in this experiment that I was showing at the very beginning, made by Claudian Maserat, the mobility ratio was quite low. And as we can see also in this velocity plot, actually, the velocity of the finger doesn't change that much. So the smaller finger The the smaller finger is constantly attracted to towards the longer one and it just grows slowly. It doesn't carry if the longer finger is reconnected to the longer or not. And actually, if we take a look at our maps that I was previously showing, it makes sense. If you are in this low mobility ratio regime, you see that despite coming closer and closer to the outlet, the colors, which you can see very well here, but believe me, the colours are not changing. Believe me, the colours are not changing that much. You all the time get mild attraction towards a longer. Okay? So we can take a look also. We can prepare a simulation which will have the same initial conditions. I don't know why we do this, but okay. Which starts with the same initial conditions and we only change the mobility ratio and you see that we can get this different behavior in our system. It's different behavior in our system. So, for low mobility ratio, we can have a constant acceleration going towards the longer figure. All the time, not caring for the breakthrough, but for higher mobility ratio, we see that at the beginning there is big screening in the system, so the velocity of the shorter finger is decreasing, and without the breakthrough, it wouldn't form any loop. But luckily, the longer finger is finally touching that. Finger is finally touching the boundary, the pressure drops inside of it, and you can see this revival of the short third finger and the return. So to sum up, we studied how different unstable growth processes were behaving here in the breakthrough. And we've seen that because of this potential drop, inside of the longer, it's linker when it touches the boundary, we get immediate potential drop. And no matter what the mobility rate is. No matter what the mobility ratio in the system is, and because of that, we see the revival and attraction of the short tour, which kind of can say, maybe serve as an indicator of Laplace or growth in different processes. So for example, here for the jellyfish, we are still not sure, we are still working on what can be the mechanism behind the growth of the cannon sprouts, but kind of in But uh it kind of indicates that it might be connected to the sound which is used. Okay? And uh if you want more details, you can take a look at the publication which came out yesterday. So uh right in time. Stein. Yes, I was wondering if maybe the uh the angle at which you reattach the big You reattach the big branch is an indication of the mobility ratio. That just not too big, the angle is narrow. I think it's complicated. So here maybe or maybe even here. So one thing is the kind of, let's say, mm zoomed out angle, and I agree that it changes, so it And I agree that it changes, so if you make an extension of this finger, it definitely has lower angle than this one. But if you look very locally, what happens at the tip, you know, and you zoom in, I think they have similar angle because right before the reconnection, the gradient is so high when two fingers are close to each other that it kind of tends to turn and reconnect, I would guess, at 90 degrees. 90 degrees. But of course, this is also kind of an artifact of Mara model because we only elongate the fingers and we don't allow them to grow, let's say, on the side. So normally I would say that if a finger is coming to the longer one, at some point if we look very closely, it rather starts also to grow on the side and not on the elongate and turn. Yes, you're the youngest. I'm sorry, it's time. Okay, thanks. I was just wondering in the Sack and Taylor experiment, the viscous finger remote, I noticed that between T3 and T4, the start of the channel gets really, really thick, like it's about to break. Do you know what that's about? Yeah, so of course, when the pressure drops inside of this thing, there is, you know, almost like a balloon which is popped, so of course it collapses. Spot so of course it collapses. So because in our case we we don't change the shape of our fingers after it's elongated, we don't have it. But if you allow the boundary to move freely as you like, then of course the drop of the pressure will also cause the collapse. It would be strong enough to close it entirely. Yeah, yeah, yeah. We see things like that as well. So you can actually see that in some of the cases. You can actually see that in some of the cases it kind of gets detached through here, and there is only the bubble on the side of the output. So you are in a sense going around solving the free boundary value problem by fixing the shape. Yes. Okay, so from the very beginning, you fix the tip shape and you just let it grow from behind. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. And would that be a problem in the reconnection state? Like, I imagine that in the real experiment it does change a lot, the tip of the finger, right? Yes. So that was just the easiest way to kind of code it because I was also tools to do it like that. But of course, the proper let's say model would have a whole boundary moving, not only elongating shape. But I think the But I think the phenomenon of the majority of the majority. Maybe it's still difficult for you to look at phase field models that now can produce physical sphere because then you don't have to fix the shape. I mean, you don't have a three-month value. Yeah, but I still think, you know, for just studying the interactions between two fingers, I think it's kind of okay to use such simplification. And okay, I agree that with the physical models, the With the physical models, there is difference, and of course, they evolve. For example, if you look at the biological systems, like the canalot or the jellyfish, they tend to have the same shape of the cannabis when they grow. So, there are some additional regulating mechanisms which are kind of keeping the shapes, such growing structures. But could you somehow deform the shape to make it Deform the shape to make it repulse instead of attract? Yeah, yes. What do you mean, repulse? Well, the shape of the tip, if you just deform it somehow, could you change from being attractive to being attractive? So you mean by just changing the shape of the finger? Of the tip, yeah. Of the tip? Could I change the interactions between the fingers? Yes. I don't know, I would say that it doesn't depend so much on the tip shape. So I was checking. Tip shape, so I was checking that I know Stefan Taylor or something like that, and then here is hemisphere. It didn't change much the distribution of the field because the distribution of the field is anyway impacted mostly by the geometry in the system. So, if you have some big elongated shapes, it should more or less work with us. So, why is some of the people we were using also this thin-finger approximation for the brain creepers? So every time you do the experiments, it's not. Yeah, but the case is, I think, and it's actually funny, but it's also about, you know, making the experiments. You usually, the experiment like that, which ends up like that, you just stop the video because it's getting so chaotic and everything. So usually you just stop the experiment. And everything. So, usually, you just stop the experiment before anything reaches the outlet. So, before you notice this event. So, you know, to this fracture experiment that I'm showing, it was a very old experiment from Piotr group, but I think it was just left alone for a weekend or something like that. Because normally, when one of the fingers is reaching the outlet, you would just stop the experiment and go start a new one. So, this is also, I think, a topic. Also, I think a topic of discussion with Justin that, and maybe he will talk more about it, that you know, people were not so often looking at the boundary conditions and what happens at the borders, and they just focus on the beginning of the experiment and the beginning of growth. So, you know, normally you look at the viscous fingering and here. And you don't see that in the shape. Every experiment just stops here. And then when you're looking at the system evoke, of course, you can see more. And we try also to observe what happens after that forking structures form. So in the long term, so after it is formed, it remains like that, like a sort of stable in the simulations mean? No, also in the experiment. Yes, both in the experiments and in the simulation. So what are Experiments and the simulation. So, but after the loop score, what happened then? After that, after it's formed? I think it depends depending on the experiment. No, no, yeah, this was a question if you have also that kind of. So, okay, there is a phase where the loop form, and after there is another phase to observe if that kind of form remains in time, as in the jellyfish, because you observe that it remains that kind of shape. Yes, you don't observe that the maybe I'm saying something stupid. Maybe I'm saying something stupid, but you don't have that one of the two vessels cut. So, yeah, in the genetic, the loops are very stable and you don't see them closing or anything. In the viscous fingering experiment, there is a lot of chaos going on when you start to reach the boundary. In factor dissolution, for example, you will see that the front is catching up and the loop is kind of getting this. Getting this small island of Jypsum, which is inside the loop, which is slowly getting eaten. So, there are different things going on. So, do you think that also the dynamics somehow changes? So, there is a formative process phase when you have a dynamics that here is, if I properly understood it, it's like a sort of applause process. But after the loop is formed, you have another kind of dynamics that is going on because Kind of dynamics that is going on because you have a loop and no more like two peaks that are here. So, for example, in you know, in blood vessel formation, I think that's the state of the art, but you have the formation of capillary plexus when the different sprouts are going on and they are growing in the direction of BGF or not growing in the direction of BGF, they are growing and making this interconnected mesh. And then you have different mechanisms in, so the remotely. Again, it's in, so the remodeling of the mesh. So when the piscus finger reaches the border, the big breakthrough, so do you think that what happens is that before that, like the pressure in the air is like the inlet pressure, and then when it breaks, suddenly drops to the atmospheric pressure. Yeah, so it it doesn't go to atmospheric pressure in all length of it. Atmospheric pressure in all length of the finger because you know, here you have atmospheric pressure. It's almost instantaneous. I mean, yeah, so here you have atmospheric pressure, and here you have inlet value. So you have linear growth of pressure. But I mean also in the other signals. Yeah, so that's a good point. So when this one reconnects, then of course we have a big so it's not only yeah, that's the thing. I was saying before reconnection, like just because one finger reached the air, automatically maybe Automatically, maybe like the whole pressure drops? So it depends on the boundary conditions you put. You can put either, you know, you can put either a pump at the beginning of the system at the inlet, and you can pump constant flow rate, and then of course the pressure value at the inlet drops down. I thought you were doing it with pressure, not with flow. How did you do that? The simulations are with pressure, but if you keep the But I if you but if you keep the inlet value of pressure high, constant, as in my simulations, the it doesn't drop. It doesn't drop in the inlet, but when it reaches the outside, then you have atmospheric pressure. No, so I would think that like uh this shorter finger will still fight pressure. That's why it reconnects to the longer one. I have some we can discuss. I we have also some like 1D model to explain it, and you can kind of see it quite nicely that in the shorter finger it's. In the shorter finger, it stays high, and in the longer finger, it is. The time is building up all the talks, all the questions over.
