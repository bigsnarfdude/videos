Yeah, thanks. So I first should thank the organizers for inviting me, attending this conference. I also thank the audience for your comments. And my topic today is about patterns in spherical droplets. So it's basically kind of theory about liquid crystals. So firstly, let me introduce the order parameter. The order parameter in the liquid crystal theory. So, liquid crystals are optically anisotropic. So, we can use a tri-axial ellipsoid to represent the variation in refractive index at a place. So, now in the graph, you see the three orthogonal axis here, and they represent the principal axis in Felix. So, their length tells us the different refractive. As the different refractive index along different principal axes. So basically, there are four possible phases at a location occupied by the substance. So this is the first phase, which is the so-called isotopic phase. So in this phase, the refractive indices are all the same along different directions. So this is the same phase as the conventional fluid. As the conventional fluid. And the second phase, and the second and the third phase, basically they are birefrigent. The birefringent means the refractive indices along the horizontal disk here are all the same, identical to each other. But vertical direction, the refractive index of the vertical direction is different from the horizontal ones. So for the graph on the left, So, for the graph on the left, the vertical index is bigger. So, this phase is referred to as the positive uniaxial phase. And for the graph on the right, you can see the vertical index is shorter than the refractive indices along the horizontal disk here. So, this phase is referred to as the negative uniaxial case. So, these are the two birefringent phases. Phases and the fourth phase is the so-called biaxial phase. So, for this phase, the refractive indices are all different from each other. So, you can have a strict inequality here satisfied. So, these are the four phases. And mathematically, we can introduce an order parameter to study it. So, the order parameter is called Q tensor. The value of this order parameter basically This order parameter basically are real three by three symmetric and traceless matrices. So if you let lambda one less than lambda two less than lambda three be the three eigenvalues of the Q at X, then this order relationship can describe the aforementioned four phases. Basically, you can see the Q is isotopic if the three eigenvalues are equal to each other. Equal to each other because we have twice this matrices, so they must equal to zero. And Q is negative uniaxial if the smallest eigenvalue is negative and the largest two eigenvalues, they equal to each other and positive. So Q is called a positive uniaxial if the two smallest eigenvalues are negative and the one largest eigenvalue are positive. Largest eigenvalue are positive. So, this is the last case, which is the biaxial case. The three eigenvectors associated with these three eigenvalues give us the three principal axes of the material. So you can see the Q tensor has enough freedom to describe the four phases we have mentioned before. So, next, the director field is a very important concept in the liquid crystal. The concept in the liquid crystal theory. So let me see its definition. So basically, director field is the normalized eigenvector of the largest eigenvalue of Q. Suppose we have Q, suppose that Q is continuous, then at the biaxial or positive uniaxial points, the director field can be continuously oriented. But however, at the isotropic and the negative uni axial, Tropic and the negative unit axial points, we have problems. Sometimes the oriented director field may be discontinuous. So, the locations where the director field is misfit are called discriminations. So, let us see two examples. So, this is the first one. So, this matrix is the so-called positive uni-axiom matrix, and the scalar function S here is positive. function s here is positive, as we assumed here. And the vector field n has unit length. You can easily compute the two smallest eigenvalues here. They equals to each other and equals to the negative one-third sx. And the largest eigenvalue is lambda 3x, which equals to 2 thirds times sx. So you can find out that lambda 3 is the largest eigenvalue, so it's associated. Value, so its associated eigenvector can give us the director field, which exactly is the vector field n here. So disclinations are associated with the singularities of the n in this example. So in the next example, we have a very simple matrix qxy here. And for this matrix, you can also compute the three eigenvalues, lambda one, lambda two, and Values lambda one, lambda two, and lambda three. And you can easily check at the origin lambda two equals to lambda three equals to the one. So this is basically a negative uniaxial point. And you can also check for all the rest points on the disk without the origin, the matrix Q should be biaxial. And if you take theta to be the S muth angle, and you can also represent And you can also represent the director field near the origin by this way. So now you can see as your S mu's angle changes from 0 to 2 pi, the angle of this director field only changes by pi. So this is a typical example for half degree director field. So this example tells us that the regularity is not sufficient to rule out the disclinations, though we can have very nice Though we can have very nice matrix here, however, its director field can still have singularities. So now in the following, I wanted to introduce the Landau de Gene theory. So the Landau-Degene theory basically is a phenomenological model for liquid crystal material. So this energy contains two parts. So this is the elastic part, which describes the distortion. Part which describing the distortion of molecules. This is the bulk energy, which dictating the preferred state. And you can add them together to get the full energy of the Lambda gene theory. So for the elastic energy, its general form is given by this way. And L2, L3, and L4 are the anisotropic elasticity. And for the bulk energy, the simplest one used in physics and numerical analysis. And the numerical analysis is of Ginsburg Lambda type. So, this kind of potential energy can explain the pneumatic and the isotropic phase transition. And Catrill, Ventel, Lukurst, and Starkin in 1986, Bohr and Majanda in 2010, they also introduced another physical bulk energy based on the Meyers-Sov theory. Theory. So these are the two potential energy popular used recently. And the Landau gene theory has been developing fast in recent decades. So now let me review some results. So the first result I want to tell is the result due to Majenda and Zanescu in 2008. So in this paper, they verify the limits from the Landau gene theory to the The Landau gene theory to the Ossian-Frank theory by taking the elasticity L goes to zero. And in the second work by Ignai Nguyen Slastikov Zanescu in 2014, they studied the stability problem of the Hedgehog solution. And they found that if the parameter A is large enough, the Hedgehog solution is unstable. And if A is small, then the Hedgehog solution is stable. H2 hot solution is stable. And in 2016, Adama, Brunsard, and Lamy, they also verified the dipole and the quadruple configurations in the large and small particle limits. And their study is for single particle case. Basically, they show that in the large particle limit, a hyperbolic hedgehog singularity occurs. And in the small particle limit regime, there is a certain ring. Regime, there is a Saturn ring comes out, and the topological degree of this Saturn ring equals to one-half. But this work for the existence of Saturn ring is for small particle limit case. Recently, they show that the certain ring-like defects also exist for large particle case, but this certain ring stays on the equator. So, the length of the gene theory is progressing. So, the list of Progressing so the list of the results here is far from being completed, and I will show more works later on. So, now in the next, let me introduce the one constant limit. So, the one constant limit basically is the energe where the L2 and L3 and L4 are taken to be zero. So, this is the normalized land of the gene energy, and the domain here is on the ball. The ball. And the Ola-Lagrangian equation associated with this energy is read as following. So we assign this equation a dirati boundary condition, or you can also call it the strong anchoring condition here. So on the boundary, this matrix Q is positive unit axial, and this is constant, positive constant, and this ER is the radial direction. So you can see on the boundary, the director. Can see on the boundary, the director field is given to be ER. And for this model, the Schopho and the Slacking in 1988, they firstly studied the Hedgehog solution. So for Hedgehog solution, the matrix Q is of this form, and F is a radial function. And then they found that this F function basically equals to zero at the origin. So you have an isotopic core. So you have an isotropic core at the origin. And for all the rest points, the direct fields are radial. And right after 1988, in 1989, the Penzen Stutter and the Tremin, they show that in some parameter regime, the Hedgehog solution is not stable. The isotropic core here can be broadened horizontally to a discrimination ring. And this discrimination is a very important. ring and this disclination ring also has half degree so they call this solution the biaxial ring solution it is it was until 2000 that the third solution comes out so garland and my cardin in 2000 they showed that instead of broaden the isotropic core horizontally you can also split the isotropic core vertically and then you can get a split core here Get a speed core here, you can get a segment disclination, and they show that this segment disclination is of strength one. So, these are the three solutions found up to now for this model. Since the above mentioned numerical studies, the theoretical studies of the ring and the split core solutions in the Lambda-Belgian theory have been left open for 20 years. So, in the next, we are concerned about. We are concerned about the existence of solutions with ring and split core disclinations and the structure of director field near disclinations. In particular, we need to assume some symmetry for the solution, which is the axial and the reflective symmetry. And we also assume the exact hedgehog strong anchoring condition as shown before. And now in this work, we assume finite A, but we take this. A, but we take this A to be large instead of the limiting case where A is taken to be infinity. So in this case, the size of the singular core is positive and of the order given by this way. And in the limiting case, where A is taken to infinity, the singular core is shrunk to a point singularity. So the axial and the reflective symmetry is important. The reason is the Important. The reason is the following. The Counter Russ and the Lamy in 2017 show that the global minimizer of the one constant land of the gene energy satisfies this lower bound, provided that the temperature is sufficiently low. So this follows from the regularity result of minimizing harmonic maps by Sean and Ulambek. So in the low temperature limit regime, it is impossible to obtain the split core solution. To obtain the split core solution by minimizing the length of the gene energy over the general finite energy space. So, we need to restrict our studies in a smaller configuration space. So, now let's talk about what is the axiosymmetric formulation of the Landau gene equation. So, the orthonormal basis of the range space is shown by, is shown as following. We have L1, L2, L3, and L4, and L5. and L4 and L5. So they are orthogonal under the inner product trace of under the inner product given by trace AB. And then with L1, L2 up to L5, we put our Q into the answer as given as following. And then we can rescale the domain and introduce the augmented operator Lv. So this L V is an augmented operator. So, this LB is an augmented operator which can help us lift a three-vector field, V1, V2, V3, to a five-vector field. So, with the introduction of these answers and the augmented operators, you can see that by the land of the gene equation satisfied by Q, the new variable W solves this kind of equation in the unit ball here. So, here, mu is a constant, SW is a Constant Sw is a three-homogeneous polynomial from the cubic term. And the three eigenvalues can also be represented as follows in terms of the U variables. And now we can introduce what is the R-axial symmetry. So the R here stands for reflective. So W is called R-axi symmetric on the ball. If W is a lifted vector field from Lifted vector field from an axially symmetric one. And meanwhile, we require the first two components, u1 and u2, are even with respect to the z variable. U3 is odd with respect to the z variable. So this kind of symmetry has already been shown in the work of Garland and Micotta. You can read from the graph here. So now we introduce our results. Our results. So, this is my results in 2019 and my recent joint work with my student Homan Tai. So, in this kind of work, we show that in the low temperature regime, there coexists the biaxial ring solutions and the split core solutions. Okay, so firstly, let me talk about biaxial ring solution. So, for biaxial ring solution, we show that there are even number of There are even numbers of isotropic locations on the positive z-axis, could be known. And meanwhile, the origin here is not isotropic. And we can also show that on the x1 axis, there is a point which is shown to be the red cross here, at where the solution is negative uniaxial. And also in the blue region here. In the blue region here on the punctured disk for points near this red cross, we show that the solution is biaxial. Biaxial in the sense that the three eigenvalues we have computed before satisfy this relationship. And we can also talk more about the director field. If you have an angle here near this disclination point, and then you can change this angle from negative pi to the positive pi. pi to the positive pi. Then you can show that the director field changed from the minus ez to e rho and then to the ez. So this verifies the existence of half degree disclinations. So if you want more analytic description of the director field, you can see that basically near the ring disclination, the director field approximately equals to the one given as follows. The one given as follows. So, this is the biaxial ring solution. We also prove the existence of split core solution different from the biaxial ring solution. For the split core solution, we have odd number of isotropic location on the positive part of the z-axis. And also, the z origin here is not isotropic. And for the phases of the For the phases of the solution, it is much more complicated than the biaxial ring case. So now let's see. So here we have a red bold line. On the red bold line, we can show that the solution is negative union axial. And on the two dashed line here, on the two dashed line here, the solution is positive union axial. And we can also show that there are two locations here, which are illustrated as a green cross. As a green cross. So at these two points, the solution are isotropic. And on the remaining points of the downbell of the z-axis, the solution is biaxial. And now here, the biaxial is different from the biaxial ring case. For the biaxial ring case, lambda 1 is less than lambda 2. But for the split core solutions here, lambda 2 becomes to be the smallest one. As for the derivative, As for the director field near the isotopic location here, we can have more explicit descriptions. So now we use the angle phi around this point. So this angle phi change from zero to pi. So while you change the angle phi from zero to pi, you can show the director field change from EZ to the E row. E row is the radio director. Euro is the radio direction in the cross section. And also, you can have an analytic description of the director field, which is shown as follows. At the four points on the red borderline here, we show that the director field equivalently equals to E raw. But you should notice that the E raw equals to the cosine theta, sine theta. Theta, sine theta, and zero. So, this E rho indeed depends on the S mu's angle. So, if you have a cross-section here and you change the S-views angle from zero to two pi, you can show that the director field also changes from zero to two pi. So, this verifies the strength one segment disclinations. So, recently, there are also other works on the Taurus solution and the split solutions. Solution and the split solutions. So, due to the DeepasQuail and the Milot and the Pisante. And their work is under the unit length constraint. And for their Torus solution, they found under the boundary condition suitably deformed from the hedgehog one. And for the split core solution, their boundary data is linearly full and suitably prepared. So I put a remark here. So I put a remark here. So, in order to obtain the above results, the monotonicity formula plays key roles in our analysis. But, however, we only have monotonicity formula in the isotopic case. Lack of monotonicity formula in unisototic case makes the analysis challenging. So, recently, there are some works along this direction by Contraz and Lemi. They studied some singular perturbation problem on the Perturbation problem on the unisotropic energy. So it would be interesting to extend our results to some unisotropic case. So now let me just show some ideas on the proof. So firstly, I will give the intuitions from the work of Garland. So this paper is, our work is motivated by this article, The Fine Structure of Defects in Radionetic Droplets. So in this paper, they So, in this paper, they basically show a numerical bifurcation diagram, which can be used to obtain the ring and the split core solutions. So what is it? To be simple, we just put our matrix Q under these answers. So they show that this coefficient in front of L4 is very important. So if the value of Q1 at the origin is positive, then you have win solution. If it is zero, Win solution. If it is zero, then you have a hedgehog solution. If it is negative, then you have split point solution. So they therefore conclude that the value here is a convenient parameter to distinguish the three solutions. So our rigorous proof is motivated from this paper. But the major difficulty in our work is to show the existence of isotropic and negative unaxial occasions. Motivated by the arguments of Motivated by the arguments of current and mikada, we introduce the following factorial signal Rainy problems. So this is an energy and these are the two configuration spaces. So what is this energy? This energy is just the lambda of the gene energy, but the reduced one under the axial symmetry. And what are the two configuration spaces? This is the configuration space FAB plus. So pay attention, we have obstacles. We have an obstacle condition here on the flat boundary of B1. So this is bounded from below. The third component, W3, is bounded from below. And in this space, the third component is bounded from above on the flat boundary here. So these are the two configuration space used in the work. And we can show that the energy EA mu gamma convergence to the energy E mu. So the E mu energy E mu. So the E mu is the limiting energy shown by this way for the unit length vector field. And the Fb plus has this kind of obstacle condition and the F C minus is bounded. The third component is bounded from above by C. Notice that this boundary condition, this obstacle condition is important. You can show that the minimizer of E mu limiting energy in Fb plus equals to this vector at the origin. equals to this vector at the origin. And the minimizer of E mu in this space equals to this vector at the origin. And we can also show that the minimizer of EA mu denoted by WAB plus or the WAC minus converge uniformly on the flat boundary. And moreover, we can show that these two solutions essentially are analytic on the flat boundary in our signal problem. So this is a little bit surprising. So this is a little bit surprising because we know in the scalar case, the signal range probably, the optimal regularity is C one one half, but in the vectorial case, we can show that it is analytic on the flat boundary here. So since this conference is for the formation of singularity, so let's see how the singularity are formed. So firstly, let's see the biaxial ring solution. So for biaxial ring solution, we focus on the solution we focus on the flat boundary. Due to the symmetry on the flat boundary, the third component should equal to zero. So now the three eigenvalues can be computed in terms of the way shown here. So now you can see there must have no isotropic allocation because on T, the amplitude of the solution should almost be equals to one. If you have isotropic location, then it should equals to zero approximately. And the second thing. And the second thing is disclination on t must be negative uniaxial. Equivalently, it should satisfy this equation. So we just need to show the existence of point on T such that this equation is held, then we can show the existence of by axial ring. Now let's see the boundary condition. So the first line here is from the boundary. The first line here is from the boundary condition. At the boundary, you can easily check this quantity equals to a positive value. And at the origin, you can show that this one basically converges to the limiting vector field. And the limiting vector field, as discussed before, at the origin, this first component equals to zero, the second component equals to one. So this value becomes to be negative. Then you can use another. Then you can use analyticity to find out a location such that on the left, this quantity is negative and on the right, this quantity is positive. So by this way, you can prove the existence of biaxial ring. And for the isotropic location of the split core solution, the argument is similar, but you have to focus on the z-axis here. So on the z-axis by symmetry, U1 and the U1. By symmetry, U1 and U3 should equals to 0. Now the three eigenvalues is reduced to the three. So now you can see U2 equals to 0 implies the isotropic location. U2 positive or negative give us positive or negative uniaxial location. So to prove the existence of isotropic location, you just need to prove the existence of a point on the z-axis at where the u2 equals. At where the U2 equals to zero. So now you go to the boundary here, but now the boundary point is the North Pole. So by using the boundary condition at the North Pole, the U2 equals to HA, which is positive. And at the origin, because this is speed core solution, so the U2 approximately equals to minus 1, which is negative. So by using this way, you can prove the existence of isotropic points on the z-axis. Axis. If you want to study the byaxuity near the isotropic locations, then you should recall the three eigenvalues here. So this is the most difficult part because you know we are studying the convergence near the singularity, near the isotropic locations. So we know that near the isotropic locations, uniform convergence of WAC minus fails as A goes to infinity. But we should note. But we should notice that in order to decide a phase, we need to compare the order relationship of the three eigenvalues. So, to compare order relationship of the three eigenvalues, equivalently, we need to compare the order relationship of the scaled one. But after you scale it, you can see after you scale it, all the scaled eigenvalue should depend on the normalized vector field of this. Vector field of this solution. But we can show in the following that this normalized vector field indeed have very nice convergence results. So this is our main results near the core regions, okay, showing in the following graph. So what is the meaning of that? Let me explain a little bit more. So firstly, you have a split core solution. So you can scale this split core solution by a small factor. The cost solution by a small factor A. And you can show that its amplitude basically satisfies the following three results. There are three regimes we have to take care. So the first regime is where the AR squared goes to infinity. So in this regime, the amplitude approximately equals to one. We can show it. So it is right at this location. So in another regime where the AR squared goes to zero, we can... R squared goes to zero, we can show the amplitude approximately equals to zero here. And in the intermediate regime where AR squared goes to L, you can show that the amplitude approximately equals to this guy. So what is F? F is basically the unique solution to this ODE problem. So this is for the amplitude and for the phase mapping or the normalized vector field of WAC minus. Vector field of Wac minus, we can show that within all regimes, the normalized vector field, normalized solution should convergence to the W infinity C2 uniformly as A goes to infinity and R goes to zero. So this W infinity is shown to be the generic tangent map at the singularity of the limiting map. So let me put some remarks on the results before. So the above The results before. So the above results relies on a non-degeneracy result, which is the equality shown in the following. So you can see this is limit inf, this is minimum, this is minimum. If you drop all these notations, so you can see this quantity basically should have a positive lower bound. This positive lower bound tells us that the WAC minus should bound it from below by C times the square root of A and the distance between 0 and A. The distance between zero and x. So, this is essentially a distance rotating service type inequality. It is this inequality that yields the uniqueness of isotropic location in the core region. Basically, we can't have multiple zeros convergence to a single singularity. The distance logistics inequality has also been applied in the recent studies of the nodal set. Recent studies of the nodal set. So, for example, the work of Fang Ba Lin this year and the work of Dedger, Endostein, and Torot recently. And our work also used the following important works due to many authors. So, the first one is the work of Bethuela Brazis and Helen on Gins-Bernandau equation and the Ling Wang broke down argument and the division treat of. And the division trick of Mihong Nei School and the Milo Pisane's work on 3D Ginsburg under functional. Okay, so this is basically all our work. So finally, let me show you two pictures. So see the use of disk lines. So this is the first picture, which is called the shadow dancing. So you can see there is an art, there is a walk located at here. So you can imagine this art as a discrimination. As a discrimination, so basically, and then on the right, there is a bulb. So, there are light shoots on the work, and then you can see an image of Michael Jackson shown on the wall. So, basically, it tells us that if you know how to control the shape of disclination and the position of disclination, then you can get different materials with various different optical properties. And the next picture is here. So, this is taken. So, this is taken from Qin Mei Museum in Taiwan. And the light is put in the center, and then the shadow is on the wall here. Okay, so that is all my talk. Thanks. Thank you for your attentions. Okay, thank you for the very nice talk. Are there any questions? Yeah, let me start by asking: in the statement of theorem you showed, Start by asking: In the statement theorem, you showed these very explicit formulas. Uh, which you know the page, you know, but uh, so you had um quite explicit formulas for that approximately characterize the um the solutions near the disinclinations. Okay. I wonder where those come from. Oh, okay, it's very complicated. Do you mean which solution? mean the which solution the either one just oh okay so basically you need to understand the limiting uh problem first so that's that's the the important thing okay i can show you a functional so uh if you remember there is a gamma convergence result so the epsilon a mu gamma convergence to a limited Gamma convergence to a limiting value, limiting energy in mu. So this limiting energy is given by gradient w squared plus the mu times something. So to understand the asymptotic behavior of the solution near disclinations, we need to understand the limiting harmonic map first. And then you have sort of explicit formulas for? Yeah, exactly. You can. So, for example, if you want to find example if you want to find out the distribution of director field near the ring disclination essentially you just need the lobby dust rule so that's very simple because the solution is uh is quite regular here so you just take a limit you write out the director field i didn't write out the director field but after you compare in the the eigenvalues you can write down the director field exactly and then you take limit so now you have zero over So now you have zero over zero four. So you can use Lobida's rule to find out the distribution. But the study for the isotopic core is quite different. The isotropic core associated with singularity of limiting harmonic map. So now you need to use, like, for example, the Brazi, Basil, and Ellen's result, and many other people's work to study. Firstly, you need to study the stability, and then you should do the blow-up and the readout. Should do the blow up and reduce the problem to a homogeneous harmonic map. And yeah, so there are quite a lot of story behind it. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, but basically the good thing is we are under the axial symmetry. So we don't have to worry about the non-uniqueness of tangent map. So the tangent map is uniquely decided. Okay, if there are other questions, feel free to unmute yourself and ask. Okay, I don't see any of this. It's actually time for the next talk already. So thank you again for a very nice talk, your results, and we'll move on.
