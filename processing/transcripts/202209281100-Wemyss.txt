Little bit about local forms of non-commutative functions, and in some sense, this has got somehow nothing to do with the kind of topic of the conference sort of invariant non-commutative geometry. But on the other hand, it's got everything to do with it. And I want to sort of explain that sort of tension. And this is an ongoing joint project with Gavin Brown, who's actually up in Glasgow this week. So it's been fun. Okay. So Okay. So the talk has a plan, and this is it. So I'm going to start by talking a little bit about the classical case of singularity theory. What is singularity theory? What do we mean by singularity theory? And what is our prejudice when we hear that term singularity theory? So, how is it defined? And what is it seeking to do? I'm going to talk a little bit about what you need to be commutative. What you need to be commutative there for things to work, and what you can get by by dropping the non-commutative assumption. And then I'm going to talk a bit about, we actually are putting forward a proposal here, quite a general proposal that this is a worthwhile intellectual endeavor, which is not clear from the outset. And we have to talk a little bit about dimension because GK dimension doesn't work, and a little bit about numerics because that doesn't quite work either. And then I'll say that the And they'll say the main results, which actually justifies somehow by themselves the idea that non-commutative singularity is a thing. And so we're putting forward that something called non-commutative singularity theory exists. And I'm going to try to sort of pitch to you that the main results that I'm going to present somehow are reason enough to believe this is a reasonable thing to do. But the fourth part is actually. But the fourth part is actually where I kind of came into this from. There are actual geometric consequences. So it turns out understanding these types of questions turns out to classify something called threefold flops in birational geometry. And so somehow this non-constant data is somehow the classifying structure of actual geometry. But you shouldn't think that you need to have those geometric consequences for this to be a reasonable thing. I think that's our viewpoint. So there'll be some people in this audience. So, there'll be some people in this audience who's heard me given this talk a few times, and my perspective changes every time. So, we'll see how it goes. Right, what are we doing? So, what is singularity theory? So, you step back a little bit and we ask ourselves, can we classify like smooth points? Before we go to singularities, can we classify smooth things? And as many people in the audience there will know, a class. The audience there will know classifying even smooth, fairly simple non-commutative things is actually quite hard. It's quite a hard thing to do. And even in algebraic geometry, the same thing is true. You've got absolutely no hope of classifying smooth varieties. And that's quite a big thing if you knew classifying even clavier threefolds. Are they definite number, for example? So classifying that, you've got no hope somehow. But if you go suitably locally, you But if you go suitably locally, you do. And so Cohen's structure theorem tells you that if you take a point of variety, at least over the complex numbers, then it's smooth if and only if the completion is the power series ring and d variables. And so there's my completion there. And so there's two things we learn from this. The first thing we learn is that we need to go local. It's a little bit of a pain, but we need to work there. And the second thing we learn. There. And the second thing we learn is that all smooth points look the same. So if we're going to classify smooth points, that's good because there's only one of them. It's unique. It's the power season in D variables. And so this slide is me setting notation. And so here is my power season in D variables. It's looking like a little bit here. And what is this object? Well, it's basically the polynomial ring, but I just allow myself infinite sum. And by just allowing myself infinite sums. So my sums can go on forever. It's just a very formal object. And so, what does singularity seek to do? Well, a few different things. But one of the things it seeks to do is try to convince you that there's less singularities than you think there are. I mean, there's still loads, but somehow in this sort of world, there's less singularities than you think. And so, what it does, it classifies. It classifies all F, so hypersurfaces, so elements in this ring, up to some isomorphism. We'll talk about that later, but usually, you know, isomorphism or hypersurfaces is a pretty decent geometric notion, satisfying some fixed numerical criterion, which you can choose. And depending how you choose your numerical criterion, you get different answers. And the second thing it tries to do is not just a classification sort of botany machine. It also tries to give you some sort of It also tries to give you some sort of theory for when that classification is not possible. And so it tries to give you some sort of powerful machine that at least you can say something, even if you can't classify. That's my sort of biased viewpoint on what Arnold was thinking about when this was set up. And so the key example to have in mind, I love this slide, I really do. It's just mental. So we define a polynomial F or a power series F. F or power series F in D variables to be a simple singularity. And so what can I do? I can count the number of proper ideals for which f belongs to the square of that ideal. I can count that number and I ask, is that number finite? Now, this is quite a crazy criteria, right? There's, um, you know, I'm not sure many people in the audience there would think this is the most natural thing to be doing, uh, for uh, yeah, this is a bit of a crazy thing. And so the theorem is, um, actually, if it's a simple singularity as defined above, this crazy count is finite. If and only if it's an ADE classification. So if and only if, up to changing the variables, so you're allowed to read. The variables, so you're allowed to re-index the variables. So I'm going to call them z on up to z d minus 2, x and y. And up to some horrific analytic changing coordinates or complete local changing coordinates, I can make my f one of the following five objects. I'll talk through the sort of the family and the features of the family, but somehow the point of the slide is that whether Is that whether the top numerical context is reasonable or not is somehow justified only afterwards, once you know the answer. And so, of course, this turns out to be one of many equivalent definitions of simple singularities. And you only really know it's equivalent to the usual definitions of simple singularities because everything's classified. And so the thing I have in my slide happens to be classified by ADE. Other things happen to be classified by ADA. Other things happen to be classified by ATE, and so they are the same. On the slide, it's also remarkable for a few different reasons. Really, if I look at the definition at the top, it's not clear that there's somehow not just horrifically many such F. So if I'm counting proper ideals with F in the ideal squared, it's not clear that there's only countably many such examples up to isomorphism. And that only comes out at the end. And that only comes out at the end because you've classified, and in the classification, there are no continuous parameters. There are only two very small infinite families, AN and DN, and three exceptional cases. So at the end, afterwards, at the end of the classification, you realize actually, A, this is a reasonable thing to have studied in the first place, and B, there are only countably many examples, and essentially only five. And essentially, only five, right? So AN is kind of similar, DN's kind of similar, and there's E6, E7, and there's E8. Okay. So the non-commutative change in view is quite simple, but it takes a long time to realize this. It turns out that other rings exist. And so we can be in the power sees ring in d variables and we can ask these questions, or we can just change the ring. Or we can just change the ring and ask the same question. So, all we're doing is we're taking the power series ring in D variables and we're replacing it with the non-commutative power series ring in D variables. So just pause to unpack that a little bit. So here's my notation for the power series ring in D variables, non-commutative. And so it's basically the free algebra, but you're allowing yourselves infinite sums. Infinite sums. So here's my element here. So I have lambda 4 times xy, lambda 5 times yx. And of course, x, y, and yx are now different, and my sum goes off to infinity. And this is the complete path algebra on the D loop quiver, which will come on to the next slide just in a moment. So, normally, when I give this talk, people get a little bit upset. So, somebody, the question is, you know. Know the power sees ring and d variable is quite nice from a few point perspectives. A lot of people would think the non-commutative power sees ring is somehow pathologically horrible. And somehow my response that I'm trying to convince you here in this talk, actually, the non-commutative power sees ring is significantly nicer than the non-commutative free algebra in d variables. And the reason is that by going to infinite sum, By going to infinite sums, you've increased the number of units in your algebra, and in particular, you've increased by orders of magnitude the number of isomorphisms from the object to itself. And since there are so many isomorphisms, actually things become much simpler. Also, there's a comparison thing here, right? So I've spent my whole week doing A infinity calculations and I've Doing A infinity calculations. And if people know this audience, if you spend all time doing A infinity calculations, it's like, ah, the non-commutative power seizure ring and D variables. Come back, come back. You're much easier. So here we are. So regardless of the fact you might think it's nice or not, if you want to play this singularity theory game, there are essentially two questions you have to answer. So in the classical case, the ring So, in the classical case, the ring is fixed to be the commutative polynomial ring, or at least power series. The ring is fixed. The isomorphism is usually the isomorphism of hypersurfaces and some sort of geometric thing. And there's some numerical criteria that you get to choose. And it's you choosing, it's a choice. And so, if you want to play this game, we have to come to a sort of understanding of what we mean by two elements being isomorphic. Being isomorphic. And we have to come to some idea of what numerical criterion are reasonable. And so, not my next slide, but my slides after are going to try to sort of convince you that there are some answers to these questions. So, we have to choose our isomorphism, and we have to choose our numerical criteria. But our ring is now going to be fixed. And so, our ring is going to be the free non-commutative power series ring in D variables. But it's not really. But it's not really. And so people often ask me why are we doing this, right? So, you know, other rings do exist, it turns out. And so you might want to ask the question: if you're going to non-commutative viewpoints, there are many free non-commutative objects. That's what quivers are. And so if you the only reason I'm doing the free power sees ring and devariable is because this is a talk. And so actually I am interested in the more general case. I'm interested in the more general case. And actually, perhaps the main power of this viewpoint in the commutative world, you're kind of stuck, right? The only sort of free commutative object is the powers you're doing in the variables. But in the non-commutative world, it's actually more. You've got more options. And we do actually want to do this whole talk on different quivers as inputs. So you can ignore this slide. I'm just going to sort of show you roughly where we are in the landscape at the moment. And so these are quivers I'm at. And so these are quivers I'm actually interested in. And so there's sort of essentially a finite number, but not really. It's kind of like ADE, kind of. And so the quivers I'm really interested in is these ones here are this one's A, this one's D, and this is E6, E7, and E8. And there are possibly loops. Sometimes there are, sometimes there's not. Then you have this one here, which is the sort of the free algebra and two variables sort of bound stuff on. Variables sort of bung stuff on, and you have the free Algebra and two variables bung stuff on, possibly loops, and you have some sort of exotic behavior that's kind of coming from E6E7 and Eight that's more complicated. And so each of these queries will have a very rich sort of singularity theory associated to them, but I'm just going to restrict to the case the power C ring and D variables because it's a talk and the story becomes a little bit easier. So if we want to get our idea of it. So, if we want to get our idea of isomorphisms, when are two hypersurfaces isomorphic? Well, the classic Matherial theorem tells you that two hypersurfaces are isomorphic if and only if they're Milner algebras are isomorphic as algebras. Now, in this non-commuter world, Milner algebra is not actually defined, and so we have to go to the Jacobi algebra instead. So, let me tell you what the Jacobi algebra is. So, we have our So we have our elements in the parameters ring, d variables, and we can differentiate it with respect to the variables. And so we have to be a little bit careful because we're non-commutative now. But here's either you've seen this or you haven't. But if you haven't, then x cubed y, if you're going to differentiate that with respect to x, it sure sort of should be related to 3x squared times y, really. And it is. Really, and it is, and so here it is: it's some x squared y, but you're non-commutative, and so you have to cycle through. So, you take this x over here and get xyx. You take this x over here, you get y xx. So, essentially, this thing here is 3x squared y sort of thought of correctly from a non-commutative viewpoint. And you do have to think, get your coefficients correct, but this is true in general. And if I wanted to differentiate x cubed y with respect to y, indeed, I just score it off and I get xxx. XXX. So there's a general rule, there's an idea of differentiation, and it's a very simple rule. That's all I'm trying to communicate on this slide. It doesn't really matter what it is, it's just a very simple rule. And so once you have that rule, you can play the classical game. And so I have an element in my ring, and I differentiate it with respect to all the variables I can see. So the first variable, the second variable, up to the dth variable. And so in the classical case, And so, in the classical case, I would take my ring that I started with, the Power Series ring, and I take the ideal generated by these, and that's classically called the Jacobi algebra. But one thing you have to be careful with here are these sort of pathologies that happen. One of the pathologies that happen is that you're not an Ethereum. And so, ideals aren't closed. And so, you have to take the called the closure of the ideal. And this is this double bracket business that we have. So, you can round the That we have. So you can rightly ignore this from the viewpoint of most things, but it is quite important that you take the closure of the ideal. And that just means that you can do things that you want to do infinitely many times. And so if you have xy minus yx in your ideal, that doesn't mean the quotient is commutative. But after taking the closure, it becomes commutative. That's the idea. So here's my favorite example. If I take the f to be x. f to be x4 plus xy squared. If I differentiate with respect to x, I get 4x cubed plus y squared. If I differentiate with respect to y, this cyclic thing, I get xy plus yx. And that's my Jacobi algebra there. And it's not obvious from that presentation, but that Jacobi algebra is a nine-dimensional algebra, which is not kind of, it's a bit surprising, it's possible to be finite-dimensional anyway. Okay, so that's our Jacobi algebras. And so our isomorphism type is going to be determined. So two things are going to be isomorphic if and only if the Jacobi algebras are isomorphic. And so now you want to say what your numerical criterion are. And so the first thing you have to think about is how do you measure dimension in these types of rings? So the first problem is they're not. So, the first problem is they're not commutative. And the second problem is that the obvious solution, which is GK dimension, doesn't work because you're complete local. And so something that's often skipped over, rightly so, is that the GK dimension of the power seized ring in one variable, which is commutative, is infinity. That's because this is a very, very large algebra, and g k dimension is somehow measuring sub-algebras. Sub-algebras and you can fit many many many sub-algebras into the power season of one variable and that's why the gk dimension is infinity and so you go back to essentially like what the community of algebra people were doing in the 1920s and you say no no no what we want to do is we want to measure the dimension of our ring not by sub algebras but by quotients and this is a reasonable thing to do precisely because we are suitably low Precisely because we are suitably local. So we're in the power series ring in D variables, it's a local ring. And this Jacobi algebra, because we've taken the closure, is also local. And so in particular, it's got a Jacobson radical, which is well-behaved. And this Jacobson radical gives an intrinsic filtration. And by intrinsic, I mean that if you have an isomorphism of Jacobi algebras, this filtration is also an isomorphism. And so what is the dimension of And so, what is the dimension of my Jacobi arser I want to use is the growth rate of this chain. And so, um, I always get this wrong. You can tell I'm not actually an expert in growth rates. And so, what do we do? We look at those r's, um, such as a constant. So, as this grows with n, it's growing as a polynomial to the degree r. And we take the minimum. And just to calibrate ourselves, this dimension, I'm calling it the JR dimension. This dimension, I'm calling it the JR dimension, the sort of Jacobson radical dimension. It is actually one for the Power C's ring and one variable, which it pretty much should be. I mean, it's you should be alarmed. The dimension of that ring should be one. And in the setting we're after, this GR dimension of the Jacobi algebra is zero if and only if the Jacobi algebra is a finite dimensional algebra. And that's sort of so the intuition to have is that this GR dimension basically is GK dimension. Dimension basically is GK dimension, it's behaving as you want it to, but just that you have to use this JR because you're in the complete local setting. So, this is going to be the dimension function we use. And so here's what we're all about. So, a non-commutative singularity theory, we have two elements f and g in the non-commutative power series ring in d variables. And we're going to view them as being. And we're going to view them as being the same, so f is the same as G, so F is isomorphic to G, if and only if their Jacobi algebras are isomorphic as K algebras. There's no further structure just as K algebras. And so with this ring fixed and this equivalent relation fixed, where aim remains the same, we want to classify all elements that satisfy some numerical criteria. Numerical criteria. And so as a first pass, what is that numerical criterion? Well, it's the dimension that was on the previous slide. So for every n, it looks like n is an integer, produce a set of elements, Sn which realizes every single possible Jacobi algebra of JR dimension n up to isomorphism. So again, to calibrate ourselves. So, again, to calibrate ourselves, S0 is a complete list of all possible finite dimensional Jacobi algebras that you can obtain from the non-commutative power seizuring in D variables. And you might step back and ask yourself: do you really think that's something you can classify? So, there's an awful, awful lot of elements in the non-commutative power series. In the non-commutative power sees ring in d variables. And each one of them carries a scalar. And so you might ask yourself: do you believe that that set is countable or do you think it's uncountable? And there's a tension in this story. And the tension is between there's lots and lots of elements in the power C's ring and D variables, but there's also many, many isomorphisms. And the question really is who wins? And the question really is: who wins? Do the isomorphism trump elements, or do the elements trump isomorphisms? And also, before we go on to the next slide, we want to make the problem a little bit harder. And we're actually going to insist that the elements in this set are in normal form. So often it's quite easy to find a set which realizes all possible x satisfying numerical criterion, but Arnold and others realized back in the 60s, you want normal form. Back in the 60s, you want normal forms, which means in our setting you have to solve the isomorphism problem. So you have to look at these two algebras, both of mentioned nine, and you say, I only want to keep the ones that are non-isomorphic. And so you actually want to solve that isomorphism problem. And so we, normal form means if the two different things are different as elements, then the Jacobi als are definitely not isomorphic. And actually, this. Isomorphic. And actually, this key turns out to be by far the hardest part because you can whittle down to some sort of elements, but then you have to work out which and which are not isomorphic. And as some people in the audience will know better than me, it's a pretty grim question. Okay, and so what can we say? This is basically where we're at. And there are reasons, I mean, before you go into the calculation, is tension. In the calculation, is tension, it depends where you sit in the landscape where you think this is a reasonable question or not. And so there are heuristics to believe that this is a reasonable question, and heuristics to believe that they're not. So why should S naught be a reasonable thing to classify? Well, you're working in the non-commutative power seizuring in D variables. That is growing larger than you can possibly imagine. And so to have an ideal And so, to have an ideal, or at least a closure ideal, generated by only D things to be finite dimensional, those D things better be an extremely small degree to start killing off the growth of the factor. So if you've got a quotient of something which is growing, exploding exponentially, for that quotient to be well behaved, that quotient better contain many small degree terms. So you kill off the exponential growth before it gets going. Growth before it gets going. So, if you believe that as an intuition, you should be able to classify all five-dimensional things because you'll need to put in as many, many lower-degree terms, which you can then control. But the upshot is, it's not clear whether that intuition is correct. And the second thing I want to flag to you, which comes important later, is that let's say you could solve the problem for S0. You could classify all things of this JR dimension zero. JR dimension zero, would you expect that solution to have anything to do at all with the set S1? So the classification of GK or JR dimension one? And that comes up later. Okay, so this is the proposal. And when I first wrote these slides about a year ago, one is something which is so it kind of gets progressively more outrageous as we come down the slides here. But I want to, but I want to summarize the most. But I want to summarize the most outrageous thing is that there are now theorems that are true in one, two, three, and four. And so, you know, it's a little bit outrageous, but it might well be true. It's the Moakle thing. So for small n, and by small, I really mean zero or one, but there are reasons to believe that two, I can talk about maybe at the end, that we're proposing that such vacation is desirable, which is not clear from what I've said already, Shizad. What I've said already, you should add. Actually, you want to have such a classification, and the first thing is it's possible. So, there is a reasonable answer to this question. The second thing we're proposing is that there are no continuous parameters. We're proposing that the solution is countable. So, in particular, we're proposing that the isomorphisms win versus the number of elements. So, just very, very few, very few kinds. So, just very, very few, very few Kentucky families. The third thing we're proposing is the classification as A, D, E, in a way that I have to explain later in the talk. When that's quite remarkable, because nothing I've said so far has got anything to do with A, D, or E. And the fourth thing we're proposing, which is part of conjectures that we're known already, well, this completely algebraic thing that I've been describing actually is the classification of threefold. The classification of threefold flops and of something called Crepant visoral contractions to curve. So they're classifying certain surgeries and operations in the minimal model program in dimension three. So roughly speaking, what four is telling us is that classical singularity theory, these simple singularities, are somehow to do with Kleinian singularity. So something to do with two-dimensional virational geometry. And the non-commutative version has got something to do with three-dimensional. Got something to do with three-dimensional birational geometry. And four has been proved very recently in the Flops case. I'll come back to that later. So, this is the proposal. Okay, so we need a little, so we want to have these classifications of these finite dimensional Jacobis and these things of sort of GK1 or JR dimension one. And so, what we want is to sort of subdivide those into ADE families. So, how are we going to do that? And so, you need to. To do that, and so you need to find some sort of number that comes out of Jacobi algebras. And if you think through, actually, it's quite hard to get intrinsic numbers out of local rings because local rings don't really have much things that you can get numbers out of. And so, basically, one of the only things you can do is you can leave what's called the co-rank of this F. So, remember, the Jacobson, J is the Jacobson radical of the Jacobi aspect, it's a local thing, and so I can. A local thing, and so I can look at successive factors in my filtration, and those are all finite-dimensional, and so I can just take that dimension, and that gives me a whole heap of numbers. So, the first co-rank is the radical over the radical squared. That's the number of variables you really need for your algebra. And then you have the higher versions, which have less good interpretations. But the positive thing is that these numbers are preserved by isomorphisms, so they are somehow. So, they are somehow a reasonable numerical criterion. And so, here's the first theorem of the talk, which in the algebraic setting is due to Yudu Shikarin, and this sort of complete local situation is due to myself and Gavin in the appendix. Is that if this Jacobi algebra, the dimension of it, so it's what's GK dimension suitably interpreted, is less than or equal to one, then To one, then actually you have very very strong control over what these numbers can be. So either the first co-rank is one, which means you're really in one variable, and so being in one variable, you know, gk1 is not unreasonable, and the second co-rank is one, or you're in co-rank is two, which means you're really in two variables, and you've got two cases, two or three. Three and just to pause to unpack that a little bit. I'm going to declare the first family to be A, I'm going to declare the second family to be D, and I'm going to just declare the third family to be E. At this stage, it is just a declaration. I'll have to intrinsically get that information out later after the classification happens. happens. So in particular, something which is very uplifting from this theorem is it's very similar to the simple singularities earlier. In the simple singularities, there are essentially only two variables. And here, what this theorem is telling you is the same is true in the non-commutative setting. There are essentially the core rank being two less than equal to two is telling you there's essentially only two variables happening. Only two variables happening. And so it's already a very good sign that a classification might be possible. Okay, so type A is when the core rank is one or zero. And the proposition, which is really very simple, just called the splitting lemma. It's in Dirksen, Bremen, Zelovinsky, and in various other places too, is that if the coranc is less than or equal to one, after some analytic change in coordinates, you can actually make F exactly as it is. Exactly as it is in the commutative case. Either it's a sum of z's with a little bit of x squared, or it's a sum of z's with a little bit x square here. So this looks incredibly good in the sense that it's mirroring the commutative case in a very beautiful way. And in all cases, the j dimension is less than or equal to one. And that sounds like a very abstract, crazy thing, but it's not. It's just telling you here, this algebra is the power C ring in one variable, and here it's Using a one variable, and here it's ky mod y to the n minus one, and both of those have dimension less than or equal to one. So, type a is very, very easy, as it is in the commutative case. And really, the sort of big test thing whether this is a reasonable thing or not is in type D. And so, this is the theorem in type D is that type D basically behaves like the commutative case, except it doesn't. So, here's the theorem. Except it doesn't. So here's the theorem that we have something, an element, in the power setting in d variables. I'm just going to re-index the variables z1 up to zd minus 2xy. And that's just because we want to make it artificially look like something which is similar. And the core rank is 2, and the second core rank is 2. This is the thing I declared to be time P D earlier. Then you have some options. So either the Jacobian. So either the Jacobi algebra of F is isomorphic to the thing given. So this Z squared is the sum of the Z's all squared. So either it has this form or it has that form and you like an even term or it's that form and you like an odd term or you have both. So I'll go through that again. The point is in the commutative case having both isn't an option because you can get rid of it. Then the non-commutative case you have to. Have to. It is what it is. So let me talk to you again. So either you have z squared, some plus xy squared, or you have that with some bit of oddness, or you have that with a bit of evenness, or you have both in which, let's get the right rounds, the even bit is smaller than the odd bit, or you have both where the odd bit is smaller than the even bit. And so there's five families there. And so there's five families there. And that looks all good. And so that's true. So this is a theorem. So it's in particular true that F is one of these options. That's it. There's nothing else. And remarkably, there are no continuous parameters. It's a countable object. But you notice it's countable in a slightly larger way. Well, that's a bit ridiculous. It's still countable. But there are two parameters, M and N. So it's somehow countable. M and N. So it's somehow countable, but it's a little bit larger. And if you want to solve the isomorphism problem, you have to start staring at these and wonder which of these are non-mutually isomorphic. And that's where the pain comes in. And the pain is exactly realizing that this can't be too much larger than this. And this condition here, just to get the non-isomorphisms of families. And the theorem is that those are normal forms, and all of them happen to satisfy this GR. All of them happen to satisfy this GI dimension is less than or equal to one, and so this is a credibly algebraic structure theorem, right? We're not doing any geometry here, we're not using any geometry, it's a purely algebraic object. You have an element in a non-commuting ring satisfying some numerical criterion, and you just go away by hand, change variables a bit, and you work out it can only have a few options. And this is it. And we've solved the isomorphism problem here, too, and that all of these are mutually. And that all of these are mutually non-isomorphic. And so that is the answer. They are the normal forms. Good. And there are no moduli, which makes me immensely happy. There are a reason to suspect there should be no moduli. You might think I have a bet to somebody that there's no moduli. So, here's the summary of the families. And I want to do some typesetting trickery here to keep you awake. It's late here. You're awake. It's late here at least. So here's the GR dimensions. This is finite-dimensional algebras. Yeah. And so the theorem in the finite dimensional algebra is I'll try to summarize it on one slide. So if your Jacobi algebra is finite dimensional, then you're isomorphic to one of the following. So you have AN, which we talked about already, which looks like that. And then we had these. So in the previous slide, some were finite dimensional and some weren't. So I was just pulling out the ones that are finite dimensional. So you have these two things. So, you have these two things that happen in the normal forms from the previous slide, the ones that are finite-dimensional, and you have some conditions which you can roundly ignore. We have this infinite family of E6, which I haven't told you about yet, which looks like this. And you have some various cases that we're yet to fully sort out because it's a bit painful doing normal analytic change of coordinates. But it's looking, so it's looking very good. We have this type A, which is basically the same size as before. Type D, which is a bit larger than before, but Which is a bit larger than before, but still countable, and type E6. And it's interesting because you've got infinitely many things sitting here in E6, but before in the classical case, you only had one single example. And there's heuristics to believe that this set here should be very small, and there's heuristics to believe why this should be very large. And so it depends on which heuristics you believe. So this is the summary of where we are so far. And the question I asked you maybe 20 minutes ago was that do you 20 minutes ago, was that do you believe there's anything that compares the GR dimension zero with the GR dimension one? And it's quite a strange question, right? So, should somehow, why should, I don't know, yeah, I don't really have a philosophy why these should be related. And the theorem is, if I take this object and I send n off to infinity, what happens? Trickery here, let's see. So when n goes to infinity, this should disappear. This should disappear, this should disappear, this should disappear, and that should disappear. Let's see if I've got it right. We are. Let's see. So, just to check, I haven't pulled the rug onto your fluke. So, there we are. So, there's the J dimension zero. The ends are going to disappear. So, this is disappearing. This is disappearing, and this is disappearing. Kaboom. Yep. And that's the theorem. The theorem is that they are exactly the GR dimension one objects. That you can take this limit. That you can take this limit, and you get in the limit, you're getting the GR dimensional in objects. And we've got absolutely no conceptual reason why that should be true, but it is a theorem. And in some sense, this is trying to make non-commutative sense of the visoral contractions to curves being limits of flops. But that also doesn't make any sense. And so we're a little bit confused as to why this is true. But it is. And it also mirrors other things which don't make sense either. Arnold's sense either. Arnold has this limits of simple singularities, so these tame co-Macaulay types A infinity and D infinity. And so this does have an analog in the classical case. But again, here, just notice that these limits, the families are larger. So in the classical case, there's only two examples. And here there's infinitely many because there's an infinite family here of. But again, there's not that many. That's up. That many, that's the upshot from this slide. And actually, we think this thing at the bottom here is empty. And so we think there's three examples in one infinite family. And I said to you at the beginning of the talk that we can classify Jacobi algebras of GR dimension in the power seizure ring and D variables. And there's only three examples and one little infinite family. I'm not sure you'd have believed me. And so somehow it is, yeah, it's some, yeah, and that's what we're up to. Okay, so I've Okay, so I have 10 minutes left. I want to say a little bit about how did I get out of this? Good. So at the moment, I've just declared, and these are AD and E, and that's just me declaring it. I've just called them ADNE. And you should be a little bit upset by that because ADE actually means something in that. And so I'm going to try to convince you now that there's an intrinsic way that. That there's an intrinsic way that does not involve choice of extracting algebraically ADE from these Jacobi algebras. And it's modeled a little bit on the sort of motivation from the geometry, but it doesn't need that geometry. It's actually this joint from it. So here are some Dinkin diagrams in front of you. A, D, E60, 78. And I've only drawn the diagram, so I've drawn the diagrams together with a high. So, I've drawn the diagrams together with the highest root. So, here's 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 3, 4, 2. That's the highest root. And A1, there's only one root there, it's there. Or positive root. D4, here's the highest, the longest, sort of, was it longest, the highest, I was getting the name wrong. But these are the numbers that you associate to thinking diagrams. And what's the rule? The rule is that the circled vertex, that's the first. That's the first time that number appears. So the first time the number one appears is in A1, the first time the number two appears is in D4, the first time the number three appears is in E6, four is in E7, and five and six appear in E8. And so to each of these one, two, three, four, five cases, we can associate the pre-projective algebra, which is an algebra which is finite dimensional. And it's something that's an algebra. So, this is a bit intense. So, let me talk you through this. So, what we're going to try to do, we want to say that in each of these Jacobi algebras that we classified before, there is a central element which slices you, so the quotient gives you essentially these pre-projective algebras up to some item potentially. But the problem with saying that is that involves choice, because I've chosen the central elements. Because I've chosen the central elements. And that's very bad if you want to intrinsically extract information. And so, what I have to do is convince you there's a generic way. So, a generic central element in this Jacobi algebra. The quotient is E pi E for one of these pre-projective algebras, and the ideempotent E corresponding to the dot. So, let me talk you through that definition. It's a bit intense, but let me talk you through it. So, we have these Jacobi algebra. So we have these Jacobi algebras and we look at the center, which is curly Z. It's not obvious the center is non-trivial, but it turns out it is. And so we say that this Jacobi algebra has type X, where X is going to be A, D, or E. If for all finite dimensional vector spaces, the surject, this is essentially all choices of generators, roughly speaking. But you don't know that's an Ethereum a priori, so you can't quite say that. But you know, it's essentially all. It's essentially all possible generators. You can find a Zariski open subset such that for every element in that Zariski open subset, this quotient is constant and furthermore is isomorphic to E pi E, where pi is one of these p-projective algebras and E is one of the chosen item quotients. So basically, think about it like this, these E pi Es are just six intrinsic algebras, and I'm saying for every finite dimension. Saying for every finite dimensional Jacobi algebra, you can find a central element where the quotient is one of six things. I'm saying something stronger, I'm saying generically that is true, a generic central slice. And so in geometric language, it's a general hyperplane section satisfies the quotient, it's EπE. This is motivated from the applications. So it's a bit intense. This slide, let me move on to something which is slightly less intense. Which is slightly less intense. So, here we are. So, the previous normal forms, we have an element S. So, here S is Y, it's quite an easy element. This is X squared, it's quite an easy element. G6M, which is not an easy element, so I've not said it on the slides. And the theorem is that these elements are central, so in particular, the center is non-trivial. And for those particular chosen elements, the quotient is what you think it is. It's EπE, where pi is. It's EπE, where pi is this A1, D4, A6. It's one of three options. It's quite remarkable. And so you might object because that's me choosing a central element, and you'd be right. That's not a generic thing. And the second part where all the content is really, is that actually a generic central element satisfies that condition. That for each choice of generators, you can find a Zariski open subset for which this is true. And so since Zariski open And so, since the risky open subsets always intersect, this is why you get your type as intrinsic, it doesn't involve choice. It's also true in type E, but we haven't written that because it's not particularly pleasant at the moment. But again, this is one of those things that only comes at the end after classification. We have no idea how to even approach this theorem without the normal forms. So, the fact that the center is non-trivial is somehow remarkable. We just, yeah, yeah. Just um, yeah, yeah, but then generically, it's connected, and so here's the application. I've got five minutes, uh, bear with me, this will be a little bit fast. And so, the reason we came into this, why are we doing what we're doing? Why do it's an existential question? So, um, we're really I'm trying to classify flops and divisible contractions of curves in baraso geometry. And the proposal I put forward with Will Donovan a few years ago now is that these are classified by non- These are classified by non-commutative data. So, let me talk you through that. And so, something called contraction algebras arise in Barrational geometry. And here are two cartoon pictures. So, X is a smooth threefold with a single P1 in it. Well, there might be more than one P1. There's a contraction morphism that takes that P1 and squishes it to a point as an isomorphism away from that point. This option. The option is that X is a smooth collabi threefold with a curve in it. And when I squish that curve to a point, I also contract this bit of paper. So this bit of paper kind of squishes. And so this is a divisor because it's a surface, a bit of paper, it's a surface, and it's contracting, squish, to a line. So this is divisor contracting to a curve. So these are two situations. And today, the assumption. And today, the assumption is that x is smooth, and that's going to be so it's related to Jacobi algebras. And one curve above the origin is because this is a talk, and we've already decided we're only going to talk about the power seizuring and d variables. And so if you change the quiver, this is when you get interesting things to more interesting geometries. So if you have two curves, you should have a quiver with two vertices. And this is why you actually need all this to be more genuine. Actually, need all this to be more genuine. Anyway, to this simplified situation, you can associate what's called the contraction algebra. And it's something you probably don't really want to know in exactly three minutes. So it is an object, it's an algebra, which is intrinsically defined using non-commuted deformation theory. But in practice, you never think of it that way because you can't calculate anything. And so the only facts we're going to need, which don't have essentially nothing to do with deformation. Which don't have essentially nothing to do with deformation theory is that since there's only one curve, you're a factor of the power season in two variables. And since you're smooth, you're a Jacobi algebra. And so essentially, if you're interested in contraction algebras, you're forced to be interested into this problem of when contraction algebra is isomorphic and when do algebra have this form. And so the theorem which motivates why on earth we're caring about this JR. Why on earth we're caring about this JR dimension? Is that you're in two situations you're interested in. The first is the curve goes to a point. That's if and only if this contraction algebra has got GR dimension zero. And the second case is when the divisor is going to a curve, the second cartoon picture is if and only if this GR dimension is one. And that's why we're caring about this numerical criterion. And this is why for us, this dimension being 0, 1 is so important. Now we're interested in the 2, 3. You know, we're interested in the 2, 3, etc., but really the geometric motivation comes from 0 and 1. And this is exactly motivating why we're subting these F's as satisfying this condition, why this talk exists. Okay, and there's two conjectures I want to just rattle through. The first is that contraction algebra is classified. So you have two of these objects, X1 and X2 down, and you have suitable. And you have suitable assumptions which you can roundly ignore the first time through, then the geometries are the same. So, this is three-dimensional birational geometry. If and only if these algebras, which are smaller and easier information but are non-commutative, they're isomorphic. It's a conjecture I made with the world some time ago. And it's now true, this is now proved in Flop's case, at least. It's not proved in the other case, but at least in the sort of the first cartoon picture, this is true. Cartoon picture, this is true. So, this is somehow these commutative rings are isomorphic if and only if these finite dimensional algebras are isomorphic. So, flops are classified by non-commutative data. And the second thing, which is more outrageous, and yeah, if this is true, okay, I'd be amazed. But so, um, the basic point is that the contraction algebras are Jacobi algebras. There are no Jacobi algebras that exist that cannot be obtained from geometry, and so if you find one. And so, if you find one, if you find an F with suitably low dimension, then you can find geometry which realizes it. And so, when we started the project about seven years ago, of course, we thought that couldn't possibly be true. But having run computer algebra simulations with millions of examples, we kind of feel like if it wasn't true, we'd have found one by now. But that's not very good evidence. No, it just means that we maybe haven't got computer arsenal running quite as well we wanted to. Running quite as well we want it to. And so, type A, which we're going to ignore, type A is geometric. But the point that I want to say is classification of type D is the theorem here: you take any smooth flop of type D, which is geometrically something, or the order of contraction, then the contraction algebra is one of the ones on our list. And so, in particular, the slides that I showed you earlier is exactly the classification of contraction algebra of type D. Contraction algebras of type D. So, in particular, is exactly the classification of type D flops. There's a whole load of bucket loads of other geometric sort of corollaries, but I'll stop there. Thank you very much. Thank you. I got one, I got one page. One page, one page. Can you say how the contraction algebra is defined? Yeah, sure. So let me try to share my screen again. Here we are. So you have a curve here or a curve here, the red one. And so it has a structure shape which lives in coherent sheaves on X. So then you form what's called the, well, there's a class. What's called the well, there's a classical commutative deformation functor of that sheaf. And so you don't deform X, you just deform that sheaf in the abelian category of unit sheaves. That's due to Golden Deak. There's a classical commutative deformation functor. And what does that do? It goes from commutative Artinian local rings to sets, and it's got some definition. And how the contraction algebra is defined is that you look at that functor, and instead you just enlarge the source category a bit. You say, well, The source category a bit. You say, well, the functions should go from non-commutative local Artinian rings, suitably interpreted to sets. And then you just work out what that makes sense. And it's pro-represented by some object. And the object that controls that functor is called the contraction algebra. That's one way to define it. But it's really a terrible way to define it because nobody has any idea like how to really control that. And so the second way it's defined, which is probably better, is that you have some sort of cluster. You have some sort of cluster tilting object in some sort of coheren-Macaulay module category, and you're looking at the stable endomorphism. So it's this cluster-tilted algebra associated to this object. That's nice, and you need to know a lot about cluster-tilting theory for that to be a good thing to do. And the third way is defined is that you have a non-commutative crepum resolution in this situation, and all you're doing is killing an idempotent. And that's making it somehow easier. So there's somehow three equivalent definitions. Depends on what. Uh, depends on what you like, it's what your favorite is, uh, but um, nobody really likes deformation theory, and so I'm probably one of the latter two. Yeah, makes sense. I noticed that you were also considering papers outside of the ADE case in one of your slides. Forget actually. Yeah, anyway, keep going. Yeah. Oh, they're back. Back. Back. Back. Back. I have so some S not. So anyway, keep going, keep going. Yeah, I'm confused myself there. Okay, yeah, here we are. No, but there's no slide with that. I'm sorry. I think we were interested. Oh, the quivers. Yeah, very good, Jerry. Yeah, here. Yeah, can you consider some that are ADE type and then also some that are outside of ADE type in a way? I mean, how is there a reason why we position the quivers or are we just yeah? So the um there's well there's like I say there's two separate things to say in the slides. That if you if you choose this type A quiver you think of it's type A, but in terms of non-commutative singularity theory other types of Jacobi algebras exist that aren't type A in a meaningful way actually. In a meaningful way, actually. So, if you take this quiver n equals three, there are definitely type D phenomen that happen from the Jacobi asteroid potential. So, you can't just read off the quiver that you'll only see type A phenomenon because we're looking at a type A quiver. So that's a bit confusing, but sort of it's a thing. And the second reason is why do you have these kind of crazy things that aren't ADE essentially? And it's because how we're getting these quivers is that we look at the dual graph of all possible flopping contractions of threefolds, and they're classic. And contractions of threefolds, and they're classified. And essentially, the geograph can be a little bit more crazy. And so, in threefolds, you can have three curves meeting at a point, and the geograph looks like this. And so, because of that, you get this sort of slightly more crazy behavior, three curves meeting at points. And the two loops is a bit more crazy for different reasons. The normal bundle behaves a bit differently. But yeah, that's the reason. And the geographs happen to be classified. But yeah. Thank you. Thank you. A nice talk. All right, well, that's it. And we might stop.
