Especially thanks for the opportunity for all of these co-authors to be here this week. So, my talk is going to follow, in some ways, Charlotte's talk from yesterday. In other ways, it's going to be kind of a different direction. So, I'm not going to talk too much about co-cycle twists or gene twists. But I am going to talk about preregular forms. So, let me first tell you an outline of what I'm going to talk about. Of what I'm going to talk about. So, the first thing I'm going to do is explain the words in the title. So, I'm going to tell you what is a preregular form. We already saw that yesterday, so I'm going to go through that fairly quickly. And then what is a co-groupoid? The second thing I'll do is the main construction, which is the title. So, I'm going to tell you how to construct a particular co-groupoid from the collection of preregular forms. From the collection of preregular forms. And lastly, I'm going to tell you why is this interesting, why should we care about this, which is constructing Marita-Takuchi equivalences between the universal quantum groups of superpotential algebras, but in particular, AS regular algebras. Okay, so let me recall what is a pre-regular form. So this is just an. Form. So this is just an M linear form, which is non-degenerate. And so that there exists some matrix where if you apply F to a collection of vectors, this is the same thing as if you just rotate the vectors around and apply P to the first one. And from a preregular form, we can define a superpotential algebra, which I'm going to denote by AFN. Going to denote by AFN, and this is just generated by a basis of the vector space b. And we have some collection of relations where I'm always going to use these subscripts on F to just mean F applied to the basis of V. So we saw examples of this in Charlotte's talk. We saw the Jordan plane as a superpotential algebra, and we saw the Sclianen algebra as a superpotential algebra. As a superpotential algebra. So, since we've already seen some examples, I'm not going to dwell on it too much. So, we of course consider it as a graded algebra. And so, the only example I'm going to say is really a whole class of examples, which was proved by Dubois-Violet, which is that if you have a graded algebra, which is Azul, finite global dimension, and Gorenstein, then there exists an f and an n such that you can realize. f and an n such that you can realize this as a superpotential algebra associated to f and n. So I'm also going to talk about, I'm also going to recall universal quantum groups, which are going to play a major role in this talk. We also saw these yesterday in several talks. So I'm going to start from a little bit of a different direction though. So there are different classes of these universal quantum groups. Universal quantum groups. Roughly, you want to choose some kind of universal coaction, or co-action which preserves something. Where I want to begin the story is with Dubois-Violette and Launer, who defined in 1990 a universal Hopf algebra, a universal quantum group which preserves a bilinear form. And later, in work of Buchanan and Dubois-Violet, they gave an explicit presentation of this universal quantum. Presentation of this universal quantum group. And these were generalized even more recently by Chervasitu, Walton, and Wang to quantum groups which preserve a pair of bilinear forms. And of course, then we also have the universal quantum groups in the sense of many, which we did see yesterday, which starts as an input, some kind of graded algebra. And this is just defined to be the Hopf algebra, which codes. To be the Hopf algebra which coacts on A in a universal way, so that all Hopf coactions factor through odd A. I'm going to denote this by odd A. I think in Charlotte's talk, she specified that it was odd RA, so a right coaction. I'm not going to be so careful, so you can just pretend that everything is a right coaction, and this is odd RA. And when A is, as long as A is locally finite, so each graded piece is finite-dimensional, this always exists. It doesn't exist for any arbitrary algebra. There are examples where there is no universal quantum group. But in all the cases that we're going to care about, each graded piece is finite-dimensional. So it's fine for us. And it's a theorem with Shira, C2, Walton, and Wong that as long as your superpotential algebra Your superpotential algebras n-Kazool and AS regular, then if you take the Dubois-Violet-Launer universal quantum group, which is this quantum group that preserves a bilinear form, then this coincides with the Manin quantum group for AFN. And as a note on convention, so whenever I say AS regular in this talk, I don't care about the GK. I don't care about the GK dimension, so GK dimension can be infinite for me. Okay, so the last word in my title that I need to explain is a co-groupoid. So a co-groupoid, so what is a groupoid? Maybe first of all. So a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. So a co-groupoid. So a co-group void should be a co-category. So let me tell you what that is. So of course we have a set of objects and in a category then we have hom spaces between each object. So I'm going to again take what I think of as like a cohom space between two objects x and y. And this is all, I'm all doing this in the k-linear context. So I want this co-hom space to be a k-auth. To be a K-algebra. And now in a category, we have a composition map. So in a co-category, we're just going to want a co-composition map and a co-unit map. And of course, these are going to satisfy write down what the associativity diagrams are, write down what the unit diagrams are, and turn all the arrows around. And we get a K-co-category. And a K-co-category is going to be a K-group co-groupoid. Well, the way we want to think about this is a groupoid. Every map is an isomorphism. So there's something like an inverse map, which goes from a Hom space to the Homs in the opposite direction. So this S is going to play the role of, it's like the inverse map for homomorphisms. And we simply write down some. And we simply write down something that looks like what does it mean for an inverse map to actually provide an inverse? And we turn the arrows around and we get a definition for what S should do, a coprupoid. So it's a theorem of Bishon, and here, this is, of course, a typo. I'm off by about 18,000 years. So it's a theorem of Geshan in 2014 that precisely if you have two Hopf algebras which have a monoidal equivalence between their co-module categories, this happens if and only if there exists a co-groupoid with two objects x and y, so that these co-hom spaces of x is the first Hopf algebra, Y is the second Hopf algebra. Y is the second Hof algebra, and the space between these two objects is non-zero. So it's fairly clear. You can see from the axioms that if you have a co-group void, each of these co-om spaces for a single object is a Hop algebra. To see why the non-zero, why the non-vanishing of CXY matters in this context, I want to recall. I want to recall some of the theory of Galois objects for Hof algebras. So, a Galois object is just an H-comodule algebra such that if we take this composition where we do the co-action and then we multiply on A, this should be an isomorphism of vector spaces. So, this is what it means to have a left Galois object. And, okay, we can define right Galois. And, okay, we can define break-Galois objects in exactly the same way. And if you have a co-group void, and this Koham space is non-zero, then it turns out it's a Cxx, CYY, by Galois object. So in other words, it's a bicomodule algebra. So it's a left comodule algebra for CXX, right comodule algebra for CYY, and it's a Galois object for both of these. Object for both of these. So in a co-group boy, as long as it's non-zero, it's always a by Galois object. And it's a, so now one direction of Bichon's theorem, so the direction that if you have a co-group void with these Hopf algebras as the cohom spaces, that that implies that the co-module category is, the co-module categories, these Hopf algebras are equivalent, follows from this classical. Folllows from this classical theorem of Schauenberg, which is that precisely two Hop algebras are Morida-Takuchi equivalent if and only if there exists some Bai Galois object which goes between them. So it kind of gives a concrete way of realizing a monoidal equivalence between co-module categories. Okay. Okay, so that's what I want to say about background. So now I want to say, what do we do in our paper? So what we're going to do is construct a particular co-group order. So if we take two M preregular forms on vector spaces, now we define GLMEF to be this following K algebra. So we have basically a K by L matrix. A K by L matrix and an L by K matrix of generators. We have D plus minus. And we're going to set the following relations. So we have the E times this particular product of A's is equal to F D. We can go kind of the other direction. So F D equals E, some kind of sum. And these relations exist for any choices of J. exist for any choices of j, of the j's. And of course, dd inverse is 1. And then if you do this matrix multiplication of A with B, we want this to be an identity matrix. So for each, so we're going to construct a code group void for each positive integer. And okay, I've kind of already told you how we can. I've kind of already told you how we construct it. So the objects are just M preregular forms. And the cohom spaces are exactly these algebras, G L M E F that I defined in the previous slide. And I can tell you what the structure maps are. So it's basically the structure maps that look like what you would expect from like coordinate rings of matrices. And we also have And we also have a co-unit map, which on the A's and the B's gives a Kronecker delta, and on the D plus or minus 1, it's 1. Okay, and then we also want to define, so to make sure it's not just a co-category, but also a co-groupoid, I have to tell you what these antipode-like maps are. And these are going to precisely just kind of And these are going to precisely just kind of turn the A's into B's, turn the B's into some kind of multiplication of A's. So here, P and Q, I should have written this down, but P and Q are the invertible matrices that come from the definition of a preregular form. So they're the matrices that correspond to E and F. And then to D, it just inverts. And okay, so now one can check. And okay, so now one can check that if you have a single preregular form E, then this GLMEE is just exactly the universal Hohmann group that preserves E, which was defined by Dubois-Violet and Launer and studied then by the people I mentioned before. Oh, okay, so then I've kind of already told you that it's true, but okay, we check that this is actually a Okay, we check that this is actually a co-group boil. And now I want to say this is the main theorem that I'm going to talk about, which is that actually if m equals 2, so for two preregular forms, if you take arbitrarily any two preregular forms that you want, GL2EF is always non-zero. So in other words, in the terminology of co-groupoids, you would call this connected. It's a connected co-groupoid. Connected. It's a connected co-group board. Okay, so it means that, of course, these universal quantum groups are Mori-to-Takuchi equivalent. And so we can use this to obtain as a corollary that actually, if you have any two AS regular algebras of dimension two, then their universal quantum groups in the sense of minine have equivalent co-module categories. And this partially recovers a theorem of Radschilders and Vandenberg, which really proves this corollary in a much wider generality. So they prove it for arbitrary AS regular algebras, not just to mention two. Theo and Michelle, do they assume like that? Right. Yeah, they they. Right. Yeah, they don't also. Right, so their theorem is very deep. So, what's involved in the proof? They construct a monoidal category and then use kind of Tanaka-Crime reconstruction results to build these quantum groups as the coens of certain monoidal functors from this monoidal category. So, what one benefit of our approach is that we really just construct these Bai-Galois objects concretely. By Galois objects concretely. So I can, if you hand me two superpotential algebras, I can hand you back what's a Bai Galois object, which gives an equivalence between the co-module categories of their universal quantum groups. Our heart was blue and metals. Exactly, exactly. Right. So I want to say one example. So if we take two preregular forms, okay, we can fix. Okay, we can fix bases for V. So I want these two preregular forms to be on the same vector space V. I'm going to write a matrix by just taking the values that this form takes on the basis vectors for this vector space, and likewise a matrix F. And I want to look at just the special case where E and F are defined by the identity matrices. So the nicest, or maybe. So, the nicest, or maybe in some sense, the nicest preregular forms you could take. Then, the relations for this GL2EF are given by, okay, so A transpose should be D times the identity, A transpose A is D times the identity, and of course, D and D inverse are self-inverse. This is a quotient of, you might recognize, of the Levitt algebra, which has generators A and B, and we just And we just, they're just inverse to each other. So, this is a really classical example, just a foundational example from ring theory that shows that there's no consistent notion of rank for a free module. So the algebra that we obtain is just a quotient of this because we need actually to quotient by b is like a transpose d inverse. And in this case, we can. And in this case, we can show concretely that this is non-zero by a Grubner basis calculation, which is similar to what's done in the classical case for the Levitt algebra. So I'll just show you what the Groebner basis is. So we have the kind of the relations that we expect up top, and then we end up having to add a collection of these degree 3 relations, which are quite unpleasant. But it can be checked that this is actually. It can be checked that this is actually a Groebner basis. So the algebra is non-zero. So I'm showing you this not because I think that these relations are particularly enlightening, but just to say that even in the easiest possible case, it's not so easy to show that this algebra is non-zero. So I want to sketch the proof with just the couple minutes I have left. So the first step of the proof is to reduce to the case. Of the proof is to reduce to the case where the dimensions of the vector spaces for E and F are the same. So the way we do this is if we have an arbitrary F, then I'm going to pick a particular E, which is just this 2 by 2 matrix, where Q satisfies this condition. And EQ is just going to be the preregular form corresponding to this matrix. And now we can deduce that. And now we can deduce that this algebra is non-zero by a theorem of Bishon. So actually, Bichon proves that a different algebra is non-zero, but we can show that our algebra, or that Bishon's algebra, is a quotient of this algebra. So we can deduce from Bishon's work that this GL2EQF is non-zero. And now we can reduce to the case where the dimensions of V and W are the same. Dimensions of V and W are the same by another theorem of Bishon, which is that if you have a co-groupoid and you have CXZ and CZY are non-zero, then so is CXY. So really we just go down to the dimension 2 case. Now if we can show that all the dimension 2 Koham spaces are non-zero, then we can go back up and we get that between any two of these objects, the Koham spaces are non-zero. Okay, so Okay, so now I want to do the last case, which is the dimensions are equal. So to do this, we're going to construct a non-zero representation. So I'm just going to take an infinite vector space indexed by the integers. So one dimension in each graded component. And now I'm going to take, I can just take an arbitrary invertible matrix over V and define inductively using the matrices E and F. Using the matrices E and F for the preregular forms, define matrices going up and going down. And what I'm going to do is define the action of A on the graded component to just be scalar multiplication according to the map md. And B will just go down by the md minus 1 inverse. So the picture, oh, and D will just go up. Oh, and D will just go up to as the multiplication by one. D inverse will go down to by multiplication by one. So the picture here is just this. We have an kind of infinite vector space. A moves us to the right, B moves us to the left. And by construction, these linear maps satisfy all of the defining relations of GL2EF. So we have a non-zero representation. Have a non-zero representation. And so GL2EF is zero. So this completes the proof of the theorem. And let me just remind you what is the payoff for this. The payoff is if you take any two arbitrary A S regular algebras, or really any two superpotential algebras, but in particular A S regular algebras, we can realize them as superpotential algebras. Superpotential algebras. And then we've constructed kind of explicitly this Weigal law object, which goes between these universal quantum groups. So in other words, using the theorem of Chirba, C2, Walton, and Wang, which says that actually these universal quantum groups are Menines quantum groups, we have an explicit equivalence here. So that's all I'm going to decide. Is there any questions for Kent? Do you know of any sort of deeper connection with the theory of what it half algebra is? Or was this one example just... That's a good question, and the example is all that we have. Yeah, good question. We looked into it for a little bit because we thought we're kind of getting one of these original motivating algebras for Levitt path algebras. Algebras for Levitt path algebras, maybe there is some kind of connection, but we haven't seen it yet. So you're this applies when the potential doesn't give a AS regular algebra. Exactly. Does it help distinguish when you do or do not get a regular algebra from a potential regular career from potential? Good question. Not to my knowledge. Not to my knowledge. And yeah, actually, I'm probably not the person to ask about this, but I thought maybe there are, I think that that's a wide research area in general, is when do superpotentials or preregular forms actually give you an AS regular algebra? So maybe other people could answer this better than me. Any other questions? I see them in the chat as well, so let's thank Kent. Our next talk will be at 3:30. There's coffee now.
