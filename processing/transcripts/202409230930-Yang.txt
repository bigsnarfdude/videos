So I would like to start with something maybe more to us, to people, more basic, but something is also quite important. So this workshop is called non-commutative geometry needs topological recursion. Topological recursion. So I actually, among yeah, among people, I think I'm when I was in the car, I was just thinking, perhaps the only one in this topological recursions area. I didn't publish any paper in topological recursion. Yes. So, but so the topic I want. So, the topic I want to describe is called to Broadway for business manifolds and inverse systems. So, I hope from the discussions and these studies about for news manifolds, we will finally arrive at some connection to topological recursion. Of course, Of course, there is already an important result by Dunin-Bakowski, Nobri, Ahantang, Pobolitov, and Shadderin. So it's about developing super potential as global spectral curve. So there is already a nice connection. But the main expectation is that there will be Be more connections, even in semi-simple for Wins manifold. Yeah, so to blog in for Bins Manifold and into system. So I think this mini course will be with three parts. So the first part, as I just explained, is some basic notions about the Broadmeal for MIS manifold that many people are already quite familiar with. And the second part will And the second part will be about EDEs, partial differential equations of hydrodynamic type. And there are deformations or say perturbations and the third part. And the third part will be a particular partial differential equation of hydrodynamic type is called principal hierarchy. And the Bongjong hierarchy And applications. Yeah, so let's start with the first part. So I will start with the definition of the Forebins manifold. So we first start with the definition of the Furbins algebra. Fourier's algebra. So a Fourier algebra is a trifle. So where A is a commutative Associative associative algebra with the unity E. E is a particular element which is the unity of A and this bracket is a Is a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear product they satisfy the following in that. Invariance properties is A B C equals A B C for any A B C in A. So here everything will be over C for simplicity. So this is for B algebra. So then So then in the beginning of 1990s, Boris Brovin in his study of Woody topological field theory, he introduced the so-called the notion of Furbines manifold. So a Furbins manifold, so a Furbin structure now we call it Now we call it Dubrovin for this manifold. So I have to use Dubrovin for this structure on a complex manifold and And uh it is a a family of forbidden algebras H S is F A S. So a family of forbidden algebra on the tangent spaces so. So, so since the Fabin's algebra is a triple, so it's this the tangent spaces dp is the unity and that's so satisfying a certain certain set of axioms so the first axiom So, the first axiom is that, so you see, since we at each point we have a bilinear product, actually, we also require smooth family or say holomorphic family. We will not consider anti-holomorphic parts. So, smooth, actually, in this setup, it's just holomorphic. So, if we have a bilinear product on each point. linear product on each point of the some manifold which is on the tangent spaces so then it's if this mostly depends on the the point yeah it is by definition a metric because our bilinear product is also non-degenerate so so so the first axiom is that the metric is flat Is flat. So we require this metric to be flat. And so at each point of some manifold, we also have a vector, E P, right? Ep is some vector on the tangent space. So then we also require smoothly depend on the point because here smooth family. So then this becomes a vector field. So E becomes a So E becomes a holomorphic vector field. So we require NABLA E is identically zero. So which means we require this vector field to be flat. So here, here, NABLA is the laggy trip top connection. Of the metric. So, this is the first axiom. And the second axiom is that since at each point we have a multiplication, because our now the tangent space is also algebra. So, there is multiplication at each point. So, we can define a So, we can define a three tensor field. So, define a three tensor field just a three tensor C T N by so C this is little C C X Y Y Z we define to be X multiplication with Y and Z. We define in this way. So here X, Y, Z are holomorphic vector fields. Yeah. It's over C, yeah. We only require non-degenerate. We didn't consider it's a positive definite, or yeah, because everything is over C. So we just call it a metric. Yeah. So if we define a three tensor C in this way, then you see because X, this multiplication is commutative. Is commutative, right? It's commutative, it's by definition, is a commutative algebra. So, because this multiplication is commutative, and because this invariant property, we know that this three tensor must be totally symmetric. So, what we require then axiom two said we require that. The four tensor field Naples is totally symmetric. So, this is the second axiom. And the third axiom. Is about certain homogeneity, so there must exist a holomorphic vector field. E which is or satisfying zero and such that is required there exists certain holomorphic vector fields such that they The interaction between this vector, the vector field with the metric and the product is homogeneous, so which means we require that y minus x y minus. X minus T this is the homogeneity for the metric, so for some constant so here for any X Y. X Y and also the multiplication. So it's a minus 3. Um x equals x y. Y Z for any X Y Z which are holomorphic vector field. So this gives the complete set of the axiom for Miss Manifold. Sorry? Yeah, for some constant D. Yes. So the So this is the structure of this condition I write is too strong, too weak. So I need sorry. So this one and So this one and just um E X Y. Yeah, so sorry, we just need to get to uh the the magic Okay, yeah, so So, a complex manifold endowed with a forbid structure for going forbid structure. Inscribed for mixed management. Sorry, it's coded to borrowing for mixed management. So here we will call E the Euler vector field and we call this E the unity vector field and this constant T is called the Is called the charge. Yeah, and a for this manifold is usually denoted by m with this multiplication and the unity vector field, Euler vector field, and this metric. So, this metric is also usually called the invariant black metric. Yeah, uh, so because this set of axioms is quite abstract, so let us give some explanations of the axiom to make it more understandable. So, so far, any questions? Yeah, okay, so yeah, so let's continue and Yeah, so let's continue. And so since this metric is flat, so we can choose local coordinates a set of coordinates, let's call it V1. V1 to VN to be flat. So, which means the between the coordinate vector fields, the metric is it just become the component becomes a constant. Becomes a constant. And since they eta, so this eta alpha beta are these constants. So since this is a symmetric and non-degenerate, so it means this eta, the matrix is now symmetric, it's a symmetric matrix, and also it's invertible. And also, it's uh invertible. Right? So we will use the upper eta alpha beta to denote the inverse of this eta. So this matrix. This matrix you see is covariant to tensor. So now it's become contravariant tensor. And since the first axiom says nabla equals zero, so we can choose in predictable, we can choose one of the coordinate. Coordinate whose coordinate vector field is just E. So we can choose let's see such that let's see iota equals the unity vector field this for some so you So, usually, people choose this iota to be one for simplicity. Okay, so now let's consider the multiplication. So, we use C alpha beta gamma to denote the multiplication, the three times are in this coordinate vector field. So, it's given by Right. So, yeah. And the second axiom says the nabla C is totally symmetric. So this three tensor is already totally symmetric. And the second axiom. The second axiom says because we are in flat coordinates, the nabula just becomes the usual partial derivative. So let's say delta C alpha beta gamma. So yeah, the second axiom says this is totally symmetric. Right? So, and this fourth, this derivative suggests that so C alpha beta gamma is totally symmetric, and its derivative is also totally symmetric. So, it suggests that locally, there exists a function f such that this C alpha beta gamma C alpha beta gamma, it becomes the third derivative of f. So we will call this fun this function f, the potential of m or in different literature it can be called the brines potential. For Ben's potential, or the problem for Benz potential, plate potential, and/or some gen zero primary potential. Yeah, so now let's go to the third axiom. So, in the third axiom, it says that nabla nabla equals zero. So, this means in flat coordinates, e is at most linear. So, it means e has the following form equals to some, let's see, v alpha v theta, some number q alpha theta. Yeah, sorry, so here we will usually for three Greek indices is always always from one to n. And for repeated Greek indices, we will use Einstein summation convention. Yeah, so here I will just sum and plus. And plus some constant. So this alpha, they are also constants. Yeah. So and then the axiom for the homogeneity is in terms of f it's just e f equals e minus e. equals a minus d s plus quadratic at most quadratic function of v yeah so so this is uh essentially the um uh the meaning of the for miss manifold but there's actually the most important equation because here Here is not in the axiom, but it's in the beginning. We said each point is a Fermi's algebra, so which means this multiplication must be associative. So let us denote C alpha beta gamma is the multiplication table. So it can be defined in the way eta alpha rho C rho eta gamma. Gamma. So then we know that V alpha V beta equals C alpha beta. So these three tensor field, the components C alpha beta gamma, so they give they one up and two downs will be become the multiplication table for this multiplication. Multiplication. And the associativity written in terms of this C will become C alpha beta rho C rho gamma sigma equals exchange alpha and gamma from the left hand side. So and in terms of written in terms And in terms of written in terms of f it will become the following equation f v are theta rho and eta rho sigma equals Yeah, equals an exchange parameter. So this set of equations, so how many equations? So we have one, two, three, four, four, free Greek indices. So it consists of n to the fourth nonlinear equations. So this set of nonlinear equations is called Witten digraph. Believe in the equation of associativity. So Yeah, so also called W D V V. So these are the equations appeared at the end of 1980s and was then described in a coordinate free way by Duborin to make it manifold, becomes a differential geometric structure. Okay, so let us see some examples. Okay, so let us see some examples. So the first example is in dimension one. So in dimension one case So, in this case, there is only one for this manifold, the problem for this manifold, which is given, the potential is given just by this. And in this case, E equals zero, and the Euler vector field is V1, Dd V1, and the unit vector field unit vector field. Unit vector field is ddb1. Okay, this for this manifold it will govern the form of written invariance of a point and they it also corresponds to the miniversal deformation. First of all, information of the A1 singularity classified in the sense of Arnold. So, this singularity, this deformation, mean verse deformation, has the following forms: just that lambda equals p squared plus. equals P square plus B1. B1 is our coordinate under Fermi's manifold. So this gives the area curve and the topological recursion for this curve. For this curve, we'll give the Gomo-Witten invariance of a point. Okay, now let's look at the second example. F is the, so this is so-called genus zero primary free energy, and starting from this. And starting from this free energy, you can uniquely construct all the invariance, GW invariance of a point. Yeah. Okay, so let's look at the second example. So, I think in the whole mini course, we just studied the following four examples. So n equals two, we have f equals one over two, where we two. Sorry, five examples. So in this case, So, in this case, in dimension two, there are already many for this manifold. So, for example, we have this f and then e equals one-third, and the Euler vector field is v1 dtv1 plus two-thirds v2 dtv2. And the unity vector field is still ddv1. So, the Euler vector field is. So, the Euler vector field is actually quite simple. It's just you can give a degree V1 of one and give V2 a degree two-thirds. So, then you can check that this F is homogeneous of degree three minus D. So, this for Benz manifold corresponds to universal information of A2 singularity. Of A2 singularity, again, in the sense of R node, so which has the form lambda equals P Q plus V two P plus V one. So if you run the topological recursion. Yes, a very good question. So this is precisely the miniversal deformation of the A2 singularity. So on this miniversal deformation, you can construct a flat, two flat A flat two-flat matrix. And of course, because it's a singularity, if you consider the corresponding Jacobi ring, you can also obtain a multiplication. Yeah, and then you can check that the multiplication and the metric, they will satisfy the axiom of the Fermi's manifold. The copyright, yeah, yes. will uh so you it it will induce uh multiplication on the on the deformation on the deformation space so we have the base space which is c and here we have also c2 is the space you have the deformations and in v1 v2 so in this space the the vector field is given um so the corresponding um uh vector field will uh so so it's c So it's C C two C. So here V1, V2 lives in this C2. And this space you can give for me multiplication is induced from the multiplication structure from the Jacobi ring of this singularity. So I didn't, yeah, so Yeah, so this construction, of course, is also very nice, but since I want to explore about inverse systems, so I didn't give the construction of this from singularity, how to get the Fermi's manifold. So, yeah, as I mentioned, in the beginning, if we use Dunien Bakoski, Norbury, Auchin. Not very often count of bit of shattering their result. So, if you run topological recursion associated to this curve, you will obtain three-skin invariance. Whitton three-spin invariance. Okay, so this is the second example. This is the second example. And the third example. Yeah, all these are very beautiful. It's the construction actually, it was based back to Huji Saito. Okay, the third example. So also n equals 2, and in this case, f equals 2 square v2 plus exponential v2. So in this case, b equals 1 and the Euler vector field V1 E dv1 plus 2 E dB2. So and in this case the And in this case, this Foreman's manifold will determine uniquely the so-called GW invariance of the complex projective line. Okay, so the next example is also n equals two. In this case, f equals one over two. equals one over two v1 square v2 plus one over two uh sorry that's in this case let's do it uh v2 square v1 and v1 square blob v1 minus three-fourth v1 square. So in this case, the charge equals minus one. equals minus one and the Euler vector field is two V1 d dv1 plus V2 d dv2 and the the unity vector field in this case is ddv2 so this example actually somehow is also very famous so it's even appeared earlier than GW invariants than example one and example Than example one and example two. So, this is the so-called Gaussian unitary ensemble. So, this for Brins manifold it governs it determines uniquely GOE. Yeah, so and from this picture, we can understand that it's this for this manifold, there is multiplication cognitive on the tangent spaces, but actually it also relates to somehow non-commutative geometry where we have the matrices, they are not community. Where? Yes. You can get rid of it, but it is nice. Yeah, there are some reasons you can keep it. Yes, yes. So you start from this for Bince Manifold. You can reconstruct. We construct a partition function. And that partition function equals to the GUE partition function with all couplings. So usually in GUE or in random matrices, when people say partition function, we get rid of, we take all the coupling constants to zero. But in this case, we can keep all coupling constants. And in particular, this In particular, this term comes from so in the expansion of GUE, so if you take log, you get free energy. You have partition function, take log, you have the free energy, and this term is just the volume of the unitary group. And when you take a larger limit, the first term is this. first term is this that that's why we keep this term because in the large gene limit you have this minus minus three fourth v1 square so so essentially speaking from this approach you will get an efficient way to compute all uh go e correlators in and in the sense of all uh counting ribbon graphs so so it's a counting ribbon graphs Liben graphs. Yeah, so these counting numbers are all included inside just this simple function. So the hope, as I said in the beginning, I want to, at the end of the day, to go to also topological recursion, but that is my future work. My future work, but in the sense that I can use the same province manifold, this one, we will not just arrive at GUE. It also uniquely governs the Laguerre unitary ensemble and the Jacobi unitary ensemble. All these ensembles are uniquely just given by all the information are inside this. Are inside this simple function. So, this is because from topological recursion, we will be able to directly if we use if we use this result of, sorry, I didn't write down to Ninbakovsky, Norbury, or Hontang Publitof Shadowy. If we use their result, we will directly get GUE. But my hope is that, not hope, at least I can already show. And this I can already show is that this will also give Laguerre and Jacobi. So how many minutes? Ah, okay. Let me say 15. Ah, okay. Yeah. Oh, oh, thank you. So now let's go to the fifth example. Fifth example. So, this example is supposed to be the most difficult example in all this theory, but this most difficult example actually appeared in the quite early days. So this example size, essentially, due to, I mean, in the beginning, due to, in the very beginning, defined by Konsevich. Defined by control three-dimensional for this manifold. So, these nd are called conceived numbers. So, they are counting of nodal curves, nodal rational curves of degree with degree D passing through. Passing through 3D minus one points in general position. So 3D minus one general points. Oh, sorry. You are right. Yeah. Thank you. So passing through 3D minus one general points. 3d minus 1 general points on the plane. So these are some ancient questions that it was completely solved by Kuncevich. Yeah, so the answer is, let's first go through the ancient ways. We know that if d equals one, so we ask two points in generic position, so they are not the same. In generic position, so they are not the same point. So, two points in generic position, we ask how many lines passing through two points. This is one. So, n1 equals one. And d equals two, it also very famous by Greek mathematicians, so ancient Greece. So, it's asked in this case, D equals In this case, D equals two. And so we ask how many code conics passing through five points in generic position. So five point generic position, which means there are no three points on the same line. So the answer by ancient Greece is also, sorry, I didn't anyways. The answer. The answer is also one. And it starts to get very difficult when we consider d equals three. So in this case, n3 equals 12, n4 equals 620, and so on. So, in this example, the answer given by Konsevich. The answer given by Koncevich is that this generating function is satisfied by the WDVD associativity equation. So I already used this third order nonlinear partial differential equations. And that equation will uniquely determine all these numbers with one input is n1 equals one. So in this case, WVB of association. PVB of associativity will be equivalent to now it becomes an ODE because there is homogeneity. Because of the homogeneity, we already killed many freedoms, so it becomes an ODE. So it becomes this ODE. So f is just this function. So this function, we call it will be f v two plus three log v three. log V3 divided by V3. So in this way, we have the definition of F, and this F must satisfy this nonlinear equation. And this nonlinear equation will give the answer to Konsavish counting of nodal curves. So it's another name of this is a GW invariance of Q2. Okay. So yeah, small is the generating function of the numbers. Yes. It's the so because here you see v3, if we drop this minus one, this v3 to power three and e to the v2 will combine. And e to the v2 will combine as the power d. So then it gives this generating function. So essentially, it's the generating function. So it's actually a function of one variable if after we divide by v3. Yeah. Oh, this is a very good question. I think it is possible. Yes. So we had some. Yes. So we had some recently some kind of hard computations. So behind it is modular forms. So it's a surprising link to modular forms because Borvin in 1999 shows that the monodromic group, I will say later what is the monodomy group. Later, what is the monotonic group? The monotonic group behind this story is DSL2Z times Z2. So it's two copy of DSL2Z. So behind it, there is a modular form story, which means the super potential can be written in terms of modular forms. Written in terms of modular forms. So we have some recursive computation of that curve. But the question is: so far, we don't have a global meaning of that curve. So it has three critical points, three critical values. And yeah, the three critical values is actually just the cubic root of one in the circle. In a circle. So, yeah, we still, I think it's, yes, it's a very good question, but not yet. Yeah, no. Only gene zero primary, yeah, yeah. Yes, all genera, all genera, any marked. All genera, any marked points. Yes. Yes, yes, yes. It's possible, but my point is that, so I will not talk too much about the topological recursion, as Professor Kassarian's lecture will on that. But I will talk about Dubai Mingjang approach. That approach already gave a way to compute all. Way to compute all genera, all descendants, GW invariants. Yeah, but yeah, I'm not sure I can for this example, I can give the detailed computation, but at least for those two, so P1 and GUE, those are I want to give more emphasis. Yeah, but the strategy essentially is the same. So maybe Maybe we can end up this first part with a very important notion for this manifold theory. So let M be a boggling sorry about this competition of the This competition of superpotential and the modular forms with actually with the student Chung Fi Fuang here and also with Dang Zagir. So about P2. Yeah. So let M be a tobacco for Minsk Manifold. So a very important subject on top. Subject on the boring manifold for this manifold is the so-called Bolving connection. So the devolving connection is we will denote it by Nabla Tu V on M is an affine connection on the On the tangent bundle. So actually, I find it's a one-parameter family. The parameter is called is the so-called Z is a one-parameter family of affine connections on Tm, the tangent boundary. T n, the tangent bundle, defined by, because we only consider the holomorphic part, so actually, it's a holomorphic part of Tm. So defined by black field z, x, y. So it is essentially a deformation of the original Lebesgue data connection of the invariant flat metric in the following way. So, for any vector field on n. So, yeah, so the connection is defined by using this multiplication between vector field. And the important lemma says, here, the important lemma. Here, the important lemma says this I find connection is flat for any z. So we already know that this affine connection is flat when z equals zero, because by definition, the axiom A1 is that this Labuta connection is flat. Is flat. So, and the lemma says for any complex number z, this connection is also flat. So, let us give a proof. I just maybe give a short proof of this. So, we know that from Riemannian geometry, the curvature tensor, of course, we can directly compute the curvature tensor, but we know that the Tensor, but we know that the curvature tensor is the abstraction for the existence of flat coordinates of the manifold with metric. So it suffices to show there exist linearly independent flat coordinates for this Nabla Z, for NAZ. So if we denote, as before, this V alpha to be flat coordinates, our notation, the V alpha. Our notation: the VR phase flat coordinates of the original Levi-Chibita connection. And then now we want to deform it. So the section we will use is this psi. So we want psi to be flat, right? So we want to show there are and And linearly independent solution of flats, flat sections. So let's compute the alpha psi beta. So this will be the alpha because now it's a differential form. So there will be a minus sign for the connection. So we want psi to be flat, so which means this equals zero for beta from one to for beta from one to n, it gives the set of equations, and we want this linear equation has n solutions, right? So if we want this linear equation has n solutions, so it's the maximum rank of Rank of the solution. So then we just require this equation to be compatible. So it's equivalent to the compatibility. And the compatibility. For compatibility, we want to compute the so we want to compute the second derivative of psi beta with respect to alpha. So it's To alpha. So it's so this will be. So the first term is z c alpha beta. Comma rho is the derivative with respect to v rho and gamma and psi gamma plus z c alpha beta gamma e xi gamma e And we substitute the first derivative, it will become z square. Now it's c rho gamma sigma psi sigma. And we want this compatibility, which means so it should equal to equal to when we exchange alpha and rho and we want to want it to be true identically in z so if you compare the coefficient of z and z square you will obtain two equations uh for the for this compatibility and the one equation the the from the coefficient z we obtain is precisely the axiom a2 and the other is the associated And the other is the associativity. So this gives the proof. If you compute the curvature tensor, the Riemann curvature tensor, you get the same. So it's also some linear part of Z, some second square, Z square term, and compare the coefficients. It is precisely axiom A2 and Axiom A2 and associativity. So this two axiom is equivalent to the for any z, it is flat. Yeah. So I will, sorry. This connection is different from Gauss Manning connection. I think I will have some time to talk about Gauss Manning connection. Yeah. Thank you. So I will stop here.
