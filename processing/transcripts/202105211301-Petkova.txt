Never. Oh, all right. Well, we can just cancel the talk and end the conference then. No, no, no. My tea time is not until 4:45. Let's do it. All right, we're good then. All right, the last talk of the conference will be Ina Petkova, who will tell us about annual linkomology in GL11. Thank you very much for having me. And thanks for a really fun conference. Really fun conference. So, um, gonna talk about a project that's ongoing with Andy Mannion and Mike Wong. So, um, Mike is teaching right now, maybe division of labor. I'll try to talk. Andy's gonna look at the chat and Mike's gonna answer questions after, but don't tell him I said that. So, okay, what are we inspired by? Well, we have these two very familiar, two of our favorite Nazi invariants, link invariants, Cubanohomology and Link invariants, covanohomology, and not floral homology. And recently, a lot of relations between them have been explored and established. And yet, they're defined in two fundamentally very, very different ways. We heard a lot about that and even more about Kubano homology, which is naturally defined using the representation theory for SL2. Whereas not floor homology, it's a Hager-Floore invariant. Floor invariant. And so it's defined as a certain Lagrangian floor theory. It's very geometric analytic in nature. And so one interesting thing to ask about is to what extent can you see the one kind of nature and the other kind of invariant, right? So they both categorify not polynomials, the Jones and the Alexander polynomial. And while there's many different ways to define the Alexander polynomial, Many different ways to define the Alexander polynomial. There is kind of one construction that we're going to focus on in which you can see both the Jones and the Alexander polynomial. It's this so-called Reshitikin derived construction. Okay, so this goes back to a few decades ago, and I think we heard a lot about that already. So maybe some names up to the right to give credit historically. Give credit historically. And now, what is the general idea here? So, suppose you have a link, this here in green, and so you want to fix yourself a quantum group and a representation of it. And so, what you're going to do is you're going to decompose your link in elementary pieces, and you want to cook something up for that. So, every time you cut, what you see, you see a zero manifold. And so, to the cuts themselves, you're going to To the cuts themselves, you're going to associate a tensor product of representations. Maybe you want to track the orientation, so maybe your chosen V if the cut is going upwards and the dual if it's going down. And to the actual elementary events that go in between, you want to associate maps of vector spaces. And you want to do that smartly so they satisfy certain radiomized relations and they end up giving you something useful. You something useful. All right, so you start from nothing and end with nothing. And so, you know, what is your quantum group? It's some algebra over C of Q. And so you end up composing all your maps. And if you've done it all nicely, you're going to get some map from CFQ to CFQ and check where it sends one, it sends it to some polynomial. It ends up being a link invariant because you cooked it that way. Okay. It that way. Okay, so great. Our two favorite examples: the Johns polynomial is gotten by fixing SL2 and taking the standard two-dimensional representation U. And the Alexander polynomial sort of is obtained from GL11 and the standard representation V. There's a little bit of something you got to do there. So if you compute it on a closed link, you get zero. You got to open the link to a 112. zero you gotta open the link to a one-on-one tango but more or less that's what that's what happens okay and um so this is a very broad things to to to say but what is the general goal people have is we want to categorify this construction um what do we really mean we mean take your special case that you like best so take j11 and v and you want to replace your vector spaces with categories and your linear maps with uh with functors Maps with functors and get something more exciting. Many reasons why you might care about that. Great. So this is all familiar and old, and maybe pushing to a few years ago, we kind of started working in that direction with Vera Vertici and defined an invariant of tango that we called tango floor homology. So my tangles, you're going to think of cobordisms between You're going to think of cobordisms between sets of points, maybe in R2 cross I, if you like. So, like this. And so, what does this invariant look like? Well, to the two boundaries of a tangle, we associate differential graded algebras. And to the tango itself, a differential graded bimodal. And the construction uses bordered floor theory. So it's a Floor theory. So it's a version of Hager floor homology for manifolds with boundary, and I'm going to say a little more about that in a moment. So I will say something about what this looks like. Great. What is that kind of invariant? Well, it's something that recovers not floor homology. So it doesn't depend on the construction for one thing. If you concatenate two tangles, the derived tensor. The derived tensor product of your bimodules is invariant for the concatenation. And if you have a closed tangle, a tangle without boundary, you get linked floor homology, tensor, some predictable piece, some two-dimensional vector space. Okay, so throughout today, I just kind of want to give a general idea of the kind of stuff we've been wondering about and investigating. And so I'm going to be telling a lot of, hopefully, white lies. Hopefully, white lies. So, for example, really, the modules we work with are ANFINITY modules. And I'm going to write the right tensor products because they're maybe the most familiar looking thing to write. But one thing to keep in mind is that throughout this conversation, a lot of our constructions are very combinatorial in nature. And there's algebraic objects that we work with instead of A infinity pi modules. And there's a model. And there's a model of the derived tensor product we work with that's a lot smaller and a lot more computable. So, but I will not say anything about that. So, that maybe would sound somewhat familiar if you've attended recently boarded four talks. Okay, so just kind of a visual definition. I'm not going to define these invariants, but the rough idea is they're Hager diagrammatic inspired. And so, the main ingredients that go And so, the main ingredients that go into being able to do something like that are what is Hager floor homology for a closed manifold? You start with the Hager splitting of your space, you look at the compressing disks for the one handle body versus the other, and then you do some version of Lagrangian floor theory in default symmetric product of your genus G-Hag splitting surface. So, you count holomorphic curves with certain. So, you count holomorphic curves with certain boundary conditions that they gotta lie on the two toroide that you get when you lift your compressing disks. Okay. And so, ingredient number one is that this type of construction doesn't naturally carry to the setting where you have boundary. And so, in 06, Robert Lipschitz translated this idea, this construction, to a setup where you count certain holomorphic curves in a four-dimensional space. Dimensional space. Johager surface, cross I, cross R. I will not say much about it, but hopefully, if that's something you've seen before, just think the tango floor homology is gonna use that. And in fact, it's gonna be a sort of version or modification of bordered floor homology, which was introduced by Lipschitz, Auschwitz, and Thurston around maybe 2008 first. Okay, so now you have a Hager surface with boundaries. Hager surface with boundary. So you sort of could think of: I have a Morse function on a three-manifold with a parameterized boundary, and I could look at an analog of a Hager splitting for it and count curves in sigma cross I cross R. Instead of defining it, I'm just going to say, all right, well, in tangle floor homology, the diagrams we play with are combinatorial, and maybe you can think of your holomorphic curves as certain regions on the diagram. Certain regions on the diagram. So, generators of your bimodule are going to be certain intersection points between your, I guess, compressing curves. And the differential is going to count certain regions that connect up different generators. So how do I get a DG by module? If I'm investigating, if I'm looking at polygons that touch the boundary of the surface, I'm going to record that as some sort of algebraic action. That is some sort of algebraic action. Okay, so I'm going to pause. I know I'm kind of rushing because, well, some poor decisions were made, but any questions? I'm not expecting to convey an actual definition, but I still want to pause for questions. Okay. So, great. How does GOWM? Great. How does GL11 come into play here? Well, how did it come into play? So, someone suggested it's natural to think about that. And we started thinking about that. And with Alex Ellis and Vera Vertici, we showed that, well, I guess tango floor homology, so I'm going to write CFF for floor, CFT for the tango floor bimodule, categorifies in a certain sense the Reshitikin derived construction for GLM1. On one. And it's kind of a big word, so what do we mean by that? Let's unpackage what we've actually shown so far. So maybe this looks a little heavy and maybe you don't want to look at everything that's written down, but we show that K0 of the category of modules over A of P. So I'm going to write this capital P a whole lot, and by it I mean assigned sequence. So this is points that have like maybe pluses and minuses, points with the Like maybe pluses and minuses points with direction, so this is what the boundary of a tangle is going to be. Right, for each boundary of a tangle, I have a DGA, and so we show that k0 is a Frisi-Ajohn QQ inverse module with a basis given by in correspondence with the primitive idempotence of the algebra. And we also exhibit a correspondence with a basis for a certain tensor product of representation. Certain tensor product of representations. So let's maybe do an example. Suppose this is my tango like that. So I don't know, minus plus plus plus is my sine sequence. Then I'm going to look in order and two positive points I'm going to associate the standard representation v and to negative points it's dual. So this is what I've attempted to write here in slightly different notation. To write here in slightly different notation. And for a technical reason, once that's all done, we're going to tensor with one more two-dimensional representation. And it's going to be required to have highest weight so that when you add up all your weights, you get epsilon one, in case that's a familiar something. But let's just say we tweak what you might expect by a little bit. Okay. All right. Andy Manion. All right, Andy Mannion talked a little bit, maybe mentioned this in passing on Wednesday. The basis we get is not the standard basis, it's a different basis. But in any case, so we exhibit this bijection. And so in that way, you could think of K0 of A mod as decategorifying to a tensor product of standard representations for G111. So then, what about the bimodules corresponding to tangles? Well, turns out that they decategorify exactly to the Reshitikin to Rifin variant for the tangle. And again, when I said maybe now I'm writing in pink, but that we also tensor with this one additional representation, okay, we actually decategorify to the Reshitik and Turif invariant for our tango together with just the Rectangle together with just a trivial strand running all the way along it and colored by this additional lambda weight. So what happens? Okay, so far we've just kind of shown that we have upstairs a version of this fresh chicken to rife construction for tango floor homology. But where does UQJ11 come into play? So you got to think and you got to create, you got to study. Think and you gotta create, you gotta study your morphisms now. So, we also explicitly construct a couple of functors that correspond to the action of UQJ11 downstairs. Okay. What I mean by that, we construct bimodules. I'm gonna call MathCal ENF that have Hager diagrammatic descriptions. So, in other words, here's, I've just drawn them for you, whatever they I've just drawn them for you, whatever they mean. Here's bordered Hager diagrams that, if you run your typical Hager boarded Hager floor package on them, you get bimodules. And these bimodules are analogs of or decategorified to these two special elements, ENF, in UQGL11. So, see, I'm not defining UQGL11, but let's just say we have two elements in it, ENF, that I want to track for the rest of today, that obey the following properties. So, they commute with. Properties. So they commute with the Reschettik into Rif map. They each square to zero, and EF plus Fe is one. Okay, so what do I have upstairs? I have an analog of these relations that we've boxed up here. In particular, well, we exhibit home top equivalences between the bimodule for each. The bimodule for E tensored with the bimodule for a tangle and the bimodule for a tangle tensor E. So the bimodule E as well as F commute with the tangle floor homology. They square to zero and further we have an exact we have this distinguished triangle that we design by exhibiting a map from each answer F to the algebra as a bimodal over itself. As a biomodical over itself. And so these are our upstairs relations. So I'm still hiding a lot about them. So this is what we have so far. And what I want to talk about for the rest of this talk is, all right, so let's annularize this idea, backtrack to these categorified relations, understand them a little better, see what we can get out of that. Out of that. Okay, so what do I mean? So we have a two-category we are looking at right now, right? The objects are our differential graded algebras that correspond to a sequence of points. The one-morphisms are bimodules. Two-morphisms are bimodal homomorphisms of some sort. And what I want to do about that. What I want to do without um, so first thing I can say is let's take cautial homology. Okay, so suppose I have a bimodal for a tangle like this that I could identify its ends together to itself. Then I could take the Hoch-shield homology of that bimodule of tangle floor homology. And it turns out what I get is, I guess I'm going to. Is I guess I'm going to call it annular link floor homology. We get the link floor homology of the closure of the tango together with, let's keep track of how we close, together with, I guess, this tango axis, additional unknot that links around it. Okay. And similarly, you know, two morphisms, you can take their partial etymology. So think of this as a functor to the category of chain complexes. But, well, But, well, from a category theoretical point of view, partial homology is just a way to concretize a more deeper notion introduced recently by... So tell me if I'm correct. Was this introduced by Anna Beliakova, Habiro Lauda, and either Zhipkovich or Zipkovich, maybe around 2014, called horizontal trace. Called horizontal trace. And I'm going to go to that in a second. What is a horizontal trace? It's a way to make yourself a category starting with the two category. So I'm going slightly anachronistic here, but let's postpone defining horizontal trace for a moment. One goal then we might have is we have tango floor homology and we have these two morphisms. Morphisms in our category C here related to the bimodal ZNF. And we want to show they satisfy certain sort of expected or desired conditions. So this is the first thing we did recently. And we want to use these conditions to obtain a GL11 action on the objects of this horizontal trace of C so that the morphisms in the horizontal trace that come from the tangle. Come from the tangle world, from say tango cobordisms, are going to be J11 equivariant, right? Just how we have it in the Russikin draft construction. And once we've done that, okay, we really want to get a little more concrete now. So we're not florists. And so what we want to do is ignore this symbol, but okay, so we've got an action on some of the objects of the horizontal trace. Objects of the horizontal trace with certain properties. And we're going to use a familiar recipe to get an action on the Haushield homology of link floor homology, essentially, that has the same properties. And so to spell this out as concretely as I can, our goal is at the end in this kind of category theoretical natural way, we obtain an action, a J11 action on link. Action, a J11 action on link floor homology, and we want to understand what it is on annular link floor homology and want to understand what that is. So we want to interpret it in some floor-theoretic way, and it turns out it's a certain base point action base point on a Hague diagram. So these are sort of our goals we're working through, and of course, at some point, we want to have something even a lot more general, as Andy alluded maybe on Wednesday. We want to do this for. Say we want to do this for everything, not just for our tango floor homology. So, this is a good moment maybe to pause for a second and say that since there's been other similar definitions of Hager floor type invariants for tangles, and maybe the closest to ours is by Auschwitz and Sabo. So, as Andy mentioned, one should expect some kind of causal duality between the two worlds. The two worlds. So, okay, what was the first goal? We have two morphisms that give us categorified relations for ENF in the world of tango floor homology, and want to see, we want to use something we know about them to get something in horizontal trace. So, the horizontal trace of a by category is going to be a category whose objects are one. Whose objects are one endomorphisms from C, and whose morphisms, okay, a morphism between F and G is going to be given by, it's going to be a class, an equivalence class of writing P sigma. So P is going to be a one morphism in C. Sigma is going to be a two morphism from P of F to G of P. And this is best. And this is best digested graphically. Okay, like that. So you start with P of F, you want to end with GFP, and I'm going to represent sigma, the two morphism, as a box. And so when I'm saying equivalence classes, I want to have the following equivalence relation. So if I have maybe a two-morphism from P to P prime, I want to be able to grab it from bottom left and drag it to top right. And drag it to top right. So just written graphically is best. Composition also best done graphically for now. Okay. Okay, so this is where I want to look. Okay. Um, great. Any questions? Should I slow down? Slow down is there reason why you're working on an annulus as opposed to just any Riemann surface with boundary? Well, so what does that mean? Okay, so in principle, your story exists on any Riemann surface with boundaries. I mean, maybe not the specific question about the trace, what have you, but right. You mean annulus from this perspective right here, or are you talking about the Hager surface? Something I think about a Hager surface, right? Oh, yeah, okay. It's not an annulus. I just kind of tried to draw it kind of pretty and straight, but it's a genus anything. So here it goes. So I'm sorry, these were very tiny and hard to see. Why do we work like that? We wanted to have something kind of cutesy and combinatorial. Something kind of cutesy and combinatorial that you can compute, program, and so on and so on. And so we said, all right, break your tango into cups, caps, crossings, and we just kind of made it all have these comprehensible chunks for each of those. And certainly of whatever genus. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for backing up to that. Where do I go now? All right. So uh-huh. Okay. So, um, what do we got here? What are the properties we want to have in order to get us this JL11 action on these objects in horizontal trace? So we said that, and I'm going to kind of shortcut myself here and just write M for a few minutes. For M is going to be the bimodule given by. Is going to be the bimodule given by that is the tangle floor homology of some tangle, all right. So as we said, we we can show that um E and F, the bimodules, commute with M's. Okay, and so we specifically exhibit maps both directions that I'm going to call, I guess, H of E, M, right? It depends on both. Why am I calling them little H's for the Hager florists here? Because they correspond to handles like. Because they correspond to handle slides on a Haven diagram. So they are counts of holomorphic triangles that come from handle slides. And what we want to show for these guys, it'd be nice if these H maps commute with, so backtrack, we're not in horizontal trace yet, but even in C, it'd be nice to show that they commute with two morphisms that correspond to tango borders, right? So a tango. Cobordisms, right? So tangles described by a Hader diagram, and you could describe a cobordism by some triple and solved by a count of some holomorphic triangles. I want to show that these E commutes with M maps commute with those two morphisms. I want to show some other stuff, but I'm just going to kind of give a glimpse at maybe this one property for today. Okay. All right. So, what are we doing here? So, what are we doing here? Just to lay out some notation. In horizontal trace, let's call by gamma the pair P alpha. So what do we have again? P is a bimodule, M is a bimodule. We're going to have them so that P tensor M is some bimodule corresponding to a tangle, right? We're restricting to these guys. And alpha is a two-morphism that corresponds to a tangle cobordism. So think Heger does. So, think Hager diagrammatic kind of two morphism. I want to claim that if I look at the pair E and H E M, which is a morphism in horizontal trace from M to M, I want to show it commutes with gamma. Same for F. I want to show F commutes with gamma. I want to show E square is zero. I want to show all that stuff. Square is zero. I want to show all that stuff. Okay, so how do we show that? Oh, you just bring Mike one over for dinner and you ask him, all right, do this. So let's see. What did we say graphically? So E of gamma, I could denote in the following way. I don't know if these pictures are big enough to be visible. Are big enough to be visible. All right, so the box I'm highlighting right now is the one corresponding to E-commutes with tango bimodules. And the highlighted box to the bottom right is some two-morphism for a coordinate. And I'm going to just start shortcutting because these boxes are very annoying and just represent these maps. The H's, I'm going to represent them just by crossings. I'll just keep the strand for E yellow, and you can barely tell the difference on my computer. So, let's do something about this. Let's make it green. Is this better? If anyone is watching, oh no, shaking head. What do you want to make it? Gonna make it super dark purple. Now it's not visible. Holy. Visible, holy crap, what do we do? Well, we just pay attention. Come on, you start as an E and follow the smooth path, and it continues to be E. Are we happy with this one? Look at that. Come on, tell me this works. All right. Hideous color, but that's very visible. Just yeah, fashion-wise. Okay, that's very. Okay, that's very visible. Wonderful. So I'm not going to write these dots, but I was just reminding to myself that this crossing right here corresponds to the handle slide map from EM to ME to get there. I'm going to show a picture in a moment, by the way, but just take it for now that it's a Hager diagrammatic map. And so, what I want to do with this, all right, these are homotopy equivalences we've got. So, I could We've got so I could introduce. Now I'm gonna have to keep doing this, don't I? Okay, this is not the color we wanted. Okay, so I'm gonna introduce two crossings at the bottom, which is I'm introducing H of H, right? Like that. So that's allowed. It's the same two morphism. And now, well, I'm working in horizontal trace, so I'm allowed to grab the I'm allowed to grab the bottommost one and move it to the top right. That's my equivalence relation to get the one morphisms in the horizontal trace. Sorry, my tablet is very sticky. Okay, let's just highlight the very end of where we were. We were here and now we're here. Yeah. So this is, I can do this. This is a relation in horizontal trace. Trace. Oh, and now what do I want to do? Well, I wish I could grab this green strand and move it past alpha. Okay. And in fact, I can do this, and there's no reason why this should be true until you show it. So here's my part of that strand, and I moved it past alpha. Why can I do this? Because of Hager floor theory. So what am I trying? So, what am I trying to do? I'm trying to show that the two morphisms corresponding to commuting the ENF bimodules entirely past tango flow homology commute with two morphisms coming from tango comportisms. This is in C. And the proof is just schematically. Is just schematically kind of a standard. Standard doesn't mean easy, by the way, but it's a floor-theoretic argument that has appeared in a few places in literature related to holomorphic triangles, naturality, and so on and so on, and dating back to early 2000s. So, the point is: let's see. So, what I've schematically tried to sketch here is: let's pretend that this is a Hager diagram that corresponds to a tangle. That corresponds to a tangle. And here I stuck in a piece that maybe you don't see, but here I have a one-handle and some curve, beta curve that goes over it. And this is a Hager diagram whose Hager floor bimodule corresponds to F, is F. So what I can do is I can run a handle slide that eventually moves my blue curve to the green curve, and that's this map. And it gets me, that's my commuting. It gets me, that's my commuting map from tangle floor, from F tensor, tangle floor to tangle floor tensor F. And I can then investigate in here where all the business is happening that gives me a tango cobordism. So holomorphic triangles for a Hager triple. Or instead, I could do that first and then kind of slide my handle over it. And the very vague idea is, you know. The very vague idea is you're doing these two operations that they're kind of disjoint, and you can use a floor-theoretic argument to argue that you get the same map going the one way or the other. I'm not trying to give an idea of how that's done. I'm just trying to say that it actually takes some Heger 4 thinking to argue that. Okay, like that. Okay, like that. And so once you have that, you have slid your green strand where you want it. And of course, you can undo your double crossing because we have, again, here, a homotopy equivalence. And these are just the two maps for it. And so you get exactly to where you want it to be. So, right, we started with something that was E of gamma. What is this? E n of gamma. And we end. n of gamma and we ended with gamma of E m so basically the gist of it or like where you got to get creative is to make this argument here and so similarly using similar Heder floor tricks and just being careful what you're counting you get all the other relations you might want F commutes with gamma where gamma is a morphism in horizontal is a morphism in horizontal trace coming from a tangle coordinism. E square is zero, F square is zero, E F plus F E is the identity morphism. So it's pretty cool. I think it's kind of cool. But a little abstract. So what was our goal was again to actually understand concretely what happens to annular linkal homology. So that's what we want to do. And so now we want to go from horizontal trace to chain complexes in some sensible way. This concretization business. So I guess as a start, and this is just some very standard stuff for I don't come from a world of algebra, so I like to remind myself how this works every time. Myself, how this works every time, but this is standard in literature. So, say you have an object in horizontal trace, so the one morphism from x to x, and you can represent it as a circle, right? I mean, what is my goal? I'm trying to have some graphical representation that I could think of as hot-shield homology, right? Blowing a bimodule to itself, certainly circle is a good way to draw that. And for a morphism, so a pair P sigma in horizontal trace, I could draw it as, well, what am I really doing, right? Sigma itself is a two-morphism from P of F to G of P. Okay? And just for fun, if I'm drawing F and G is blue circles, might as well draw this whole business on an annulus. Whatever the hell that means. Whatever the hell that means, right? So, close your strand for aesthetics and like that. Okay, that's not very satisfying. So, what does this really mean? Like, I'm drawing these cups and caps, but can I attribute to them a more sensible meaning other than it's a doodle way to represent two-morphisms? Yeah, I can. So, if P has a left dual, so I'm gonna do P. So I'm going to do P upper left star. Then we can think of these cups and caps as evaluation and well, co cup, co-evaluation and evaluation. So maybe as a quick review, what do I mean by dual here? And apologies if someone's unhappy with terminology, because holy, I mean, yeah, okay, so we've seen left and right used for the same concept in different pieces of literature, duo and adjoint being used. Duo and adjoint being used, so whatever. So a morphism from Y to X in C is a left dual of F, a morphism from X to Y, if we have two morphisms, one from F F dual to the identity and one from the identity to F dual F, so that the following two compositions are actually equivalent to one. Actually, equivalent to one. Okay. We like this graphically a lot better, don't we? So we sort of say that we can isotope things. Okay, so if we have that, we can actually design a well-defined map to chain complexes. If everyone had a left duo, you'd get a legit functor and a Left duo, you'd get a legit functor and all that stuff. And this is in one of Anna Chris and Stefana's papers. But okay, so if I have that, then I can slice up my annulus into a few more pieces, so to say, and I could think of each of the slices as something in as the Hawkshield homology of the corresponding one-morphism in C. And I'm zooming in because I really didn't have enough space to do that. But so for space reasons, But so for space reasons, every time you see yellow parenthesis, think CH. So you've applied the Hawk shield functor to your bimodule. Okay. And so then I have this slice here that is co-evaluation tensor identity on F. I have the next slice, which is identity on the dual of P, right? This was my P. Identity on the dual of P. Identity on the dual of P, tensor sigma. I have this slice here, which what does it do? It doesn't seem to do anything. So, this is just that I can rotate things around on the Hochshield level. And then I finish with this cup, which is that I evaluate. And so, yeah, you get a map from Hochshield F to Hochshield G by doing that. Okay, so this gives me a well-defined, this gives me a map from the morphism. From the morphisms in horizontal trace to morphisms of chain complexes. So we want to have left duals. And luckily we do. So E and F were the the things we wanted to care about and indeed these bimodules have left adjoins tools, whatever you want. Adjoint stools, whatever you want to call them. And proof by picture, what you do to get that, you invite Andy to give a seminar talk and then you start drawing together. And so remember, I had sketched out these two, they look slightly visually different, but that the same Hager diagrams that I'd shown for my bimodule for E and bi-module for F. Turns out, and you can prove it using floor theory, you can prove your adjunction by counting polygons. By counting polygons again, curves, it turns out that F is the left adjoint of E. Just have to work at it a little bit to show that. And it turns out that there is a left adjoint to F that looks very similar to E, just kind of turned upside down-ish. And E also has a right adjoint, and for a mysterious to me reason, Mike Wong likes to call these the four horsemen of the apocalypse. The apocalypse. Don't know why he does that, but yeah. So here they are. And so I have that set up. And so I can actually compute the image of, remember lowercase E was the two morphism for E commutes with tangle floor. I can compute the image of these ENF from horizontal trees to chain complexes. And I have a Hager floor set up to make geometric sense of floor. To make geometric sense out of it, floor theoretic sense out of it. So, um, so let's do that. Before we do that, just a quick glimpse into it's a very natural reason why the Hochschild homology for tango floor homology is the link floor homology of the tango together with that unnot. Okay, so here we have a Hager diagram for our tango. Hager diagram for our tango. So the tango is something I can glue to itself, maybe like that. If I identify the left and right edges of this Hager diagram together, just glue them up. That is not quite a legit Hager diagram, but and I never mentioned, we have two arcs that we let run along my diagram, and we do not count holomorphic curves that project. Curves that project to the region that contains the arcs. If we glue the two ends of the diagram and surgery these two arcs, whatever that is, we get a legit diagram for the closure of the tango. Where's my color? For the closure of the tango, together with maybe with a different color, this additional component. So this is just something you could visualize and believe. But the combinatorics of the two Heger diagrams are in a correspondence. Hager diagrams are in a correspondence in the sense that you really just look at the curves that you are counting after you glue up, and it corresponds to the hot shield equivalence of, you know, you have your bimodule and actually gluing things to itself. So I should say that to see this best and most directly, you are using, you're not really thinking of the floor structure you get. The floor structure you get for this, you don't think of it as an infinity bimodule. But what, if you've heard any of these border talks, what you would call a dA bimodule. This is maybe the most direct way to see this correspondence. But so this is your graphical way to construct your Hager diagram for the closure of the tango together with this extra unknown. Why am I drawing that? Because what was our goal right before? Our goal right before. Our goal was to compute this action of E and F on tangle. Okay, what does this whole circle stand for? It stands for actually maybe CH star of C of T of T, right? So I'm computing the action of T of E whatever on it. So I wanted to know what the Hager diagram looks like that I'm going to work with. Diagram looks like that I'm going to work with. And here's a crazy picture. Okay, so what's on this picture? You have these thicker-looking curves, and if you ignore them together with this curve, what you roughly see is, remember these concentric blue circles and these red circles. So if you ignore the bold ones, you see a Hager diagram for your tangle. And so what if we say identify the two ends, glue together, put some base points where you're going to. Put some base points where you're going to be doing surgery on the arcs. Get a diagram for the tangle. What are these extra curves on it? If you look at the blue one together with the red one, you want to think of it as roughly having nothing because I'm going to want their intersection point to always be occupied. And if you take this blue curve and slide it over this pile of green of Over this pile of blue circles, you get a Hager diagram with all the old curves, but this time a bold green curve. That turns out to be a Hager diagram for E-duo, tensor E, tensor CFT. There is no reason to, this is just a crazy picture, and every time I look at it, it takes me forever to believe myself. So, this is just kind of like a visually appealing way to convince you that something exciting happened. You don't have to. You don't have to follow it. So, your first Hager diagram, the one that prefers the blue curve, you want to think of it as a Hager diagram for the tango. After your handle slide, you want to think of the resulting Hager diagram as a Hager diagram for E-tensor E, or whose bimodule is E-tensor, E-dual tensor E-tensor CFTFT. But what is the map that corresponds to that handle slide? Corresponds to that handle slide. Turns out that map is exactly coevaluation tensor identity on the tango floor bimodule. How to prove that? Mike won't do us. So what do we do again? And so this handle slide, I mean, I count this map counts certain polygons, and I've shaded one instance of it here. Let's keep going. So I'm here. So I'm here, and what was next in that annular visual picture is that I had to commute past the tangle. So commute past the tangle, I'm starting with the green circle and well, the two edges of the diagram are identified. I'm sliding it over the blue curves for my tango and I get this purple curve. I get a new Hager diagram and this new Hager diagram is a diagram for E-tens. For e-tensory dual tensor tangle floor, I secretly, I guess, what did I do secretly? I grabbed this duo and put it on the right, which is, I'm in Hartio homologist, so I can do that business without actually counting anything. And so that handle slide is a count of polygons of sorts. And now I'm all the way here, and let's see. Let's see, my annulus looked like this, didn't it? So I just have to cap now. So I want to map from this bimodule to simply tangle floor homology. And while this is one more handle slide, it's realized by sliding the purple curve over this set of blues to an orange curve. And that's yet another count of polygons in belief. And believe me, if you're patient, you can show that that's the identity for tango fluoro homology tensor evaluation. So, this is some unfortunate epsilon for evaluation and MathCal E for E, but such is life. Very cool. So, you have this sequence of counts, though, on a Hager diagram. It's very explicit. And it turns out that that sequence of counts. Turns out that that sequence of counts, the composition of these maps, in other words, the image of Te, T was my map from horizontal trace to chain complexes, exactly counts polygons through whatever base point we have when we pass into the Hager diagram for the closed link together with its tangle axis. It counts things that kind of go here. This is reminiscent again of pictures that Andy showed us in his talk. That Andy showed us in his talk of strands going kind of up and into the nothingness. And so we get this count. And if you repeat the game, play it again for lowercase f, which was our morphism in horizontal trace corresponding to commuting, you get a count of polygons through yet another base point. Again, remember this is cut and pinched. And so you get a count of polygons through this. A count of polygons through this other base point on the diagram. D, Z, and W, they're base points for that tangle axis. I'm not. You just, by construction, automatically get all the relations you want. You get T square, T of E squared is zero, T of F squared is zero, T of E T of F plus T of F T of E is one, because you're just constructing this to come from the horizontal trace relations. But what's really cool is Is that you can interpret that as this geometrically seen base point action on annular Hager floor homology, linked floor homology? And it basically tells you that counting disks that pass through the one base point for your tangle on not first and the other versus the other order around is homotopic to the identity. This is a fact that you may see somewhere in Lipper. You may see somewhere in literature, for example, in this pointed paper by Baldwin, Levin, and Sharkar, they definitely comment on that, where your base points are related in a certain way and associated to the same link component. And so this is where we stand. And I guess we hope to make more general sense of this phenomenon and maybe for other kind of bordered. For other kinds of bordered stories other than tango floor homology, maybe for the Ajawatsabu version of tango floor homology and so on. But I'm just going to stop here. Thank you. All right. Thank you, Ina. And maybe we should just thank all the speakers of the conference and the organizers. Thanks so much for putting this together. All right. All right, you're welcome, but we're not done yet. We still have to take questions for Ina's talk. Oh, Melissa, go ahead. Hey. Okay, so here's a thought process. And let me know if you've already mentioned this. Okay, so annular cavano homology, not like, sorry, SL2 is just SL2 is just a regular Lie algebra, so it has this biology, and you can actually see, I mean, okay, so there's an SL2 action, so there's the involution, right? But GL11, as far as I understand, doesn't have like valve group. But I'm wondering if, according to Sergei, we should have like the annular grading going to the spin-C grading. That kind of makes me think that involution should sort of be analogous. Should sort of be analogous to like the involutive involution, which like switches the spin C structures. So is there a way for you to change the MathCal E piece to the MathCal F piece by like box censoring some kind of a Ruzarev piece so that we can possibly see some sort of C2. File groupish action. I just kind of want to see the analog to the file group action on Annula Khovanov on your side. I don't know. Mike, you missed the part where I said I'm going to give the talk. And he's going to answer chat questions, and you're going to answer questions. Chat questions, and you're gonna answer questions after the talk. You missed me saying that. Well, I am here, but I'm not sure if I have anything useful to say. I don't think no. I guess it also is. I can't immediately see a piece that can turn E into F. But yeah, so the answer is, I guess, no, not immediately. There's something that kind of speculatively looks That kind of speculatively looks kind of like it. If you don't look at F, but one of its duals instead, there's this sort of Z2 symmetry of the Hagar diagram. You could think that flipping front to back does something for you. Doesn't interchange the E and the F that we're talking about. But if you look at these other four things, well, I need to think about it, but that's more possible. Symmetry, if you have a grade, Andy, or something else like that, because oh, I'm just talking, well, okay, yeah, maybe. Okay, yeah, maybe it gives, yeah, maybe it's not symmetric, but at least there's this diagram for the identity grade or something. Um, so maybe something like this. So I don't know if you, sorry, I had to, I missed the earlier part, but E is F and E are adjoint to each other. And then F, but it's only one-sided, right? And F's other adjoint is different from E. Different from E. So maybe there could be an involution that twists the Hagar diagram exactly, you know, like by pi over two, and that sort of flips the front and the back and up and down. So maybe that might be an idea. I don't know. Wouldn't it be natural to expect Z2 to be related to the double cover, actually? That's what I would think it is. I'm not sure if that's double cover of what, like the tangle or in that spectral sequence, if you're referring to the Hebrew fluoride homology, at least in that context. I'm not sure what it is here, but oh, I was just referring to analogy. Oh, I was just referring to analogousness, not like a sequence. Yeah, yeah. Another very natural question to ask, I guess, for I don't know why I'm asking questions, but another question to ask might be, what is the annular version of the of NAIT's spectral sequence from phylophomology to not phlohomology? Not phlemology. So, and how does that fit in with the story? That is something that we haven't looked into. That I don't know if it's relevant to your question, Melissa. Who's here? Sam Tripp, have you thought about that? Called Calling a Student. This is how it's done. Oh my God. Sorry, Sam. Zach and I, like, at some point, thought about it a little bit and then. Thought about it a little bit and then made no progress and moved on. What is the order here, Jake? Maybe? Okay, so if the annular homology is a representation of GL11, then it's going to have an Euler characteristic that lives in the representation. Characteristic that lives in the representation ring of GL11. Is it easy to describe, like, you know, is there an easy way to calculate or describe that Euler characteristic? So, for example, if I have a braid, is it determined by the Burau matrix? I think when so this problem was how was this problem born? Robert Lipschitz suggested this problem and I think he had in mind exactly your question and the answer is no idea we haven't looked yet and we're just still kind of recap you know hashing out proofs and it's it's a good idea to look into that. Maybe we should point out that the computation of out that the computation of decategorifying E and F are pretty hairy. So what does that mean to decategorify E and F? E and F are bimodules, right? Upstairs, and downstairs they are mapped of vector spaces. So they are matrices. Spaces, so they are matrices. That computation is already kind of hairy. And so if you try to, yeah, so I'm not sure what when you, you know, I'm not sure what analyzing it would, yeah, how difficult that is. I mean, for example, if I had, you know, if I had an annular brain. Know if I had an annular breed, then it would have sort of you know its annular Homphley homology or annual SLN homology would have an Euler characteristic that lives in the vector space of, you know, that's spanned by partitions of the number of braid strands. And like, for example, could I recover, I mean, should I be able to recover the Euler? I mean, should I be able to recover the Euler characteristic from that, or is it somehow orthogonal to that? Okay, maybe the answer is just who knows. Okay, thanks. Nice talk. All right. So maybe we can go to Paul. So, maybe we can go to Paul. Yeah, nice talk, really. I wanted to ask you. So, I got the impression that the way you show that these E and F somehow induce an action on the trace is by showing that they're central or at least somehow centralizing the relevant part of this category. So, when you say they commute with bimodules, and then you can push all the alphas somehow through that you see coming from Hager diagrams. And now, I was wondering if you can. If you can, so basically, you're giving an interpretation for the horizontal trace. Can you give a similar conceptual interpretation for the entire center or spinifold center of this thing, or at least the centralizer for the stuff that comes from Heger diagram? So I'm not sure if sorry, I'm not sure if. Sorry, I'm not sure if centro is the right word because E and F don't commute with each other. I see. Okay. Yeah, right. You mentioned that. Sure. But they centralize tango stuff, right? I think a better way of saying that is that they commute with tango stuff. And so that makes the tangle bimodule. The tangle bimodules, so to speak, equivariant. But is there a hope of classifying all the stuff that commutes with tangle stuff? I would just say no directly, but who knows? Just look at how special these ENF are. I mean, all that's going on, if like say if the rest of the picture is familiar, this is really almost like you grab a Hager diagram for. Almost like you grab a Hagier diagram for the nothing, for just an identity tangle, for the algebra or whatever. And then you suddenly stick in this one handle with one curve over it. That is the only modification. So to express that they commute with tango floor homology, you're just grabbing this one little curve and saying, okay, my tangles contained within some like beta-bounded thing, and I'm just sliding over it. It's just so lucky and special in a way that, I mean, In a way that, I mean, yeah, I don't know how you would classify all the everything coming from a Hager diagram that would do that. Okay. Thanks. And Mina, did you still have a question? I guess I had a comment. I think that the story I told in my talk, the second part of it, With my talk, the second part of it, would like to generalize this for any LE algebra. So I think Andy, Andy. Andy wants to generalize this too as much as possible, but I mean, parts of it generalize. Parts of it, having the E and the F here is sort of special to Tangle Floor. But. But other parts special having both the E and F rather than the positive half, like I talked about, you have the positive half and a lot of generality, but having both the E and the F with this mapping cone relationship between them, that's something that I only know of in this particular pickup of agency construction. So, I actually have a maybe kind of very naive question, which is: you know, when I think about this annular homology, if you, you know, if you have a construction where tangle gives you a bimodule, it seems to me like the natural thing to do is to take vertical trace, not horizontal trace. So, why not take? Why not take vertical trace? Do it. Okay. We just kind of converge to having this idea. We wanted to do this. I don't know. This is a horrible answer, Ben, but one, I think, one issue is that before you take the vertical trace, maybe you want to write down the tangle bimodule. Bimodule homomorphisms associated to tangle cobordisms. And those are, I mean, I guess we have guessed for what they should be, but those have, I don't think, as far as I know, haven't been written down yet. Sorry, why do you need those to take horizontal, to take vertical trace? When you take vertical trace, you're gluing. You're gluing two morphisms vertically, right? But what are the two morphisms themselves? They are the tangle bimodal homomorphisms corresponding to tangle cobordisms. Well, that's not what I would have said, but maybe I have horizontal and vertical mixed up or something, but Yeah, okay, let me think about this. Anyways, I'll need to think about whether I'm mixing a horizontal and vertical or something. Okay. I'm sure we'll talk about it more. You guys promised me an email. All right. Are there any more questions? All right, are there any more questions? All right, well, then I guess we can thank Ina again and declare the conference over. Thank you all for coming. Yeah, well, I hope to see you all in person at some point. We need to have like massive super conversation. We need to have like a massive super conference when we're all allowed to go again. Thanks for organizing this. Thank you very much, all the organizers and participants on behalf of Burst as well. Stay in touch. Yeah, thank you guys for organizing it in these difficult times. Those difficult times. Thanks for speaking. Thanks again. It was nice to have it even virtually. Yeah, it's just sad to not go to ban. I've been looking forward to it. Never seen it without snow, actually. Oh. It's nice in the summer. Thank you, guys. All right. All right. Thanks for organizing. It's a great conference.
