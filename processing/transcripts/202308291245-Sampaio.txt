Recording in remote rest. Okay, so we continue with the session, morning session. Jose Edzon Sanpayo will talk about the proof of the Fukui-Curdica-Faunesco conjecture. UNESCO conjecture. Okay, thank you very much for inviting me for to participate in this nice event. It's the 61, but it's my third one. So it's a pity I could not participate in person, but maybe next time. So let me start. I want to To let me see, yes. My presentation is organizing has followed. I will say some introduction, motivation, and I will give some preliminaries, and then I will give some hints how to prove the conjecture. So, the initial consideration is the following. In fact, essentially, the results present here. And essentially, the results present here are in the article on the Fukui Kurica Panelis Conjecture, published in Composita Mathematica, in Nawuk jointly with Yellonek and Fernandez, Alexander Fernandez and Isbigno Yellonek. You can find this article and the other article which is related with this article in my ResearchGate web page. Gate web page. You can see the link here, but you can also type my name in ResearchGate, and you can find it. Also, you can find it my web page. I did not put here, but you can find, I try to keep papers updated there. If you cannot find in the journal, you can find my web page. So please go on. So Um so let me say some let me state the conjecture in fact I state this conjecture at least twice the conjecture is the following if let X and Y be two germs of the at the origin of irreducible real analytic subsets so if H is a germ of a subanalylic archanaly and bi lip sheet R canalylic and pi Lipschitz homomorphism from Rn to Rn, sending x to y, then the multiplicity of x is equal to the multiplicity of y mod 2. I will define everything here. So I will define what means the multiplicity here. I think it's not well known. The notion of multiplicity of real sets. I will give a definition here. Here. So, this, of course, is related with a well-known conjecture, the famous Zariski multiplicity conjecture, which says if you have two reduced complex analytic functions f and g, if you have a homomorphism from Cn to Cn sending the zeros of F to the zeros of G, so the multiplicity of F is equal to the multiplicity of G. In this case, the multiplicity of F and is. And is of the zeros of f is well known. In fact, if you write the tailor development of f, like something like that, fm plus fm plus one, etc., such that each fn is zero or homogeneous of degree m. And of course, fn is not zero. So we define, in fact, we can define in. is we can define in a geometric way but you can prove the zeros of the multiplicity of the multiplicity of the zeros of f is exactly at m that means the order of f at zero of course we have a more general notion i give this here for sets which are not hypersurfaces i'll say later so I say later. So you have some, this is still, this is an open problem, but we have some partial answers to this. For example, Ephraim and Trotman, in fact, these are two works. In fact, Ephraim proved this in a paper published in Duke Mathematics Journal. Journal and Trotman also proved this in the same year. So, this is why I'm calling here Ephraim Trotman's theorem. So, the theorem is the following. In fact, the conjecture of Zaris conjecture is true when the homeomorphism is a C1 diffeomorphism, as is stated here. So, if you take, if you assume the homomorphism phi is a C1 diffeomorphism, so then. Is a C1 diffimorphism, so the multiplicity of F is equal to the multiplicity of G. And this theorem was generalized by Gavin Liebman just some years later. And I call here Gau-Lippmann theorem for high co-dimension. Here, the Frain and Trotman theorem only tests even the proof only work for hypersurface, but Carvin Liebman presented. Uh, Carvin Liebman presented a very nice proof for hypodimension, even in a weak sense. For we don't we only need the phi and the inverse have derivatives at zero. We don't need the C one difficulty fact. Uh the frank proof also does not need C one diffimorphism, but he stated the theorem has C one diffimorphism. Theorem has C1 toomorphism. So the Gaul-Ligmann theorem says that if X and Y are two complex analytic sets, and if you have a homeomorphism from Cn to Cn sending X to Y, such that phi and its inverse have derivative at zero, so the multiplicity of X is the multiplicity of Y. We also have some relation with math geometry. With metric geometry or Leapshape geometry, this we have the following metric version of the Zaris conjecture. If X and Y are two complex analytic sets with the same dimension, if their germs at zero are bilipsitz on a MOF, then they're multiplicary. This also has a global version of this. Have a global version of this conjecture. If you have now two complex algebraic sets instead of analytic sets, and if x and y are bilips homomorphic at infinity, that means outside of compact sets, they are bilips homomorphic. So the degree of x is the degree of y. And bilips here means we have mapping from x to y. Mapping from X to Y is by Lipschitz. Of course, X is a subset of some Rn and Y is some subset of some Rm. For example, here Rn, here some subset of Rm. And of course, we identify C with R2. So a subset of Cn we see has a subset of R2N, for example. In, for example, so this is by Lipschitz. Here, for me, if there is a constant, such that if this is a homeomorphism, there is a constant set that there is a constant C greater than or equal to one, such that this is true. For any x and y in x further. This means what this is the definition of Barleypsche, a homomorphism from x to y, which satisfies these two inequalities. So we have some answers to the metric version of Zarisk conjecture. The first one, which I have in mind, is in fact. In fact, it's not in chronological order. In fact, these two math versions of Zaris multiplicity conjecture are equivalent and they hold true if d equal to one or d equal to two. That means the dimension of x is one or two. It was answered by Javier Fernandez and Bobagini and Alician Fernandi and myself in this paper which is appearing here. Paper, which is which is appearing here below. In fact, before of this result, we had the result of Kunt. He proved that these conjectures go true when they involved the Lipschitz constant are close enough to one. In fact, I could define the notion of by Lipschitz. By Lipschitz, in putting two conditions, C and C and C prime, and here I put C prime here. And if I put C prime here and C here, the condition was involved here. The assumption was if C times C prime, the two constants are less than than equal to one. Then equal to 1 plus 1 over m 1 2 d. This is the dimension, the 1 over 2d, and m is the maximum of the maximum of the multiplica of x, multiplista of x, and the multiplicita of y. This was the condition imposed by Kant in this paper in 19. In this paper, in 1998, this paper appeared here. This was why we believed that the math version of Zaris multiplicative conjecture was true, because in fact that conjecture was true when the constants are close enough to one. This inequality is saying more or less that, right? And of course, we discovered that conjecture has a negative answer when the dimension is greater than two. We present Vibra, Fernandez, myself, and Verbitsky in 2020 in this paper here. We present quant examples of Quanta examples of two sets which are by Lipschitz, Homer Mov, but has different multiplicities. In fact, the sets were cones, so that the multiplicity is the same of the degree. I think. Let me verify if you can hear me. Yes, very good. Okay, nice. Sorry for that, but. Sorry for that, but it happened, right? So, um, so this we have also, this is why we had another conjecture for, in fact, the real version of the metric version of the Zaris multiplication conjecture, which we called Fouqui-Kuwi-Kapan-Lis conjecture. In fact, this was posed concretely in two thousand four. Quickly in 2004, but as you know, there are even results proved about the bilips invariance of Rionalit sets even before of 2004, as we can see now. In fact, this conjecture, okay, just to this conjecture is saying that the multiplicity for real Reanalyt sets multiple mode 2 is invariant by sub-analytic, arc-analytic by leaf homeomorphism. This is saying that, right? And this was answered positively by Risley in 2001 in this paper when the dimension is two. In fact, the ambient dimension here. So when X and Y are crossed. So, when x and y are curves in Rn is solved by Griesler, and in the same paper where the conjecture was posit, the authors for quick, quick, and pawnisk answered also for n equal to two, but even with equality. In fact, even with equality, but without mod two. They could prove even the multiplicity of. proof even the multiplicity of X is equal to the multiplicity of Y without more truth. And after that, this was that the conjecture was proven as well when we have quadrimission one for hypersurface by Guillaume Vallette in 2010. I also gave some Partial answers to this conjecture. One of them was the fact the real version of the Gaul-Lippmann theorem. That means when the homomorphism involved and its inverse have derivative at zero, I could prove the multiplicity involved are equal mod two. are equal mod two and then uh since this this e ten two the the the for n equal to two uh the multiplicity is even equal right when the the conjecture is true even for equality without mod two we could think if the conjecture is is we can obtain equality without mod two in general but then In general, but then we discovered the conjecture failures for equality without more two. In the same paper, the composite paper with Alexandri, Fernandez, and Yisbyne Jelonek, we found the following example. In fact, there is a type here. It's 2021 here. So, the idea of these two sets, you can see X and Y are something. You can see x and y are something like I did not define what is the multiplicity, but I can say the multiplicity is the multiplicity of its complexification. So if the set is an hypersurface, the multiplicity is just the multiplicity of the function which appear here, the reduced function which appears here. So as you can see, the multiplicity of As you can see, the multiplicity of X is equal to 3, and the multiplicity of Y is equal to 5. So they are equal mod 2, but they are not equal without mod 2. And if you can also check, for example, this function y is a y cube over y x squared plus y square. Is a Lipschitz function defined, of course, outside of zero, but zero when it's zero, for example. The same for this function. So we can, if these are two Lipschitz functions, this is a Lipschitz function. It's not hard to verify. The inverse is just change the sign here. So it's a homomorphism, it has an inverse, and the inverse is. Are inverse and the inverse is the same, more or less. So, these are bilips homeomorphism, which of course is semi-algebraic. And we can also verify this are acanalytic because these two functions are arc analytic. So, these are acanalytic functions, super-analytic is semi-algebraic, then super-analytic, and bilips, and sends x to y. So, the conjecture of Fouquiku-Lapanois conjecture does not hold with equality. The idea here is more or less x outside of the origin, for example. The set x is the graph of a Lipschitz function, the same for y. For Y. So the idea was to find two such sets. And then we could extend this, since they are more or less graph, we can extend for the whole space, the whole space. That's by Lipschitz function. Okay. So, but then we answered. we answered even in my more general with a more general statement we we answered the for quick with foundation conjecture without impose x and y are germ of irreducible sets and also without assume 8 comes from a palips homomorphism from Rn to Rn in fact X and Y In fact, X and Y can live in different Euclidean space, like here. X is in Rn, Y is in Rn. And if A is a bilips homomorphism, which is superanalytic and arcanalytic, then the multiplicity of X is equal to the multiplicity of Y mod 2. And then, in fact, we also obtain some, in fact, a global. In fact, a global version of this theorem. And I will not prove it here. I give a sketch of proof of this theorem, but let me state that global version. The global version was the following. If 8 is in Rn and B is in Rm, B real algebraic sets, and let me denote 8 bar with the closure of 8 in the Of 8 in the projective space. So let 8 from A to B be assembled by in bile homomorphism. So if A is arc analytic at each point of the closure, then the degree of A is the degree of B mod 2. I will not define everything about this statement here if you want to. Statement here. If you want to know more about this theorem, you can read our paper or you can discuss with me if you want. Okay, I just want to say that we have a global version of this theorem, but I will not prove it here. Okay, so let me state some preliminaries about it. The notion of tangent cone, I think. I think this is well known for much of you, many of you, but let me say the precise definition here. So if X is a subset of Rn and P is in X, in fact, P only need to be in the closure of X, so we say V is a tangent vector of X at P if there is a sequence of positive numbers TJ and a sequence of numbers. And a segments of numbers x, j, and x, such that the limit of tj is zero, and we have this limit as well, it's equal to. And we denote by cxp this set of all tangent vectors of x at p, and we call it the tangent point of x at p. Another important definition is the strict transform of x under the spherical blowing up beta given by. up beta given by this way beta of x r is r x is just the restricted sum is just the prime the closure of the prime edge of x set zero and the boundary dx prime of the street transforms the intersection of x prime with the base x n minus one times zero just the A step shown out device of this oring app, right? And please see that this d prime, dx prime is just the length of the tangent cone, which was defined here, times zero. You can verify this in a easy way. So Uh so I denote by C prime X the closure of the set the set of all the points X in the in the boundary of the strict divisor strict transform sorry such that this set is a germ with odd number Odd number of connect components, and of course, the odd number of manifolds with the same boundary. But if you add the part here, the part which is in the boundary, we have stuff like a book, right? This you can see this more less. If you have, you are in dx, has a dx prime is here. dx prime is here and the set is something like that. Let me I think I wrote a bad way. Let me draw first the first leaf and then the second leaf and maybe the third one so for example here So for example, here all the point all the points here are in C all the points here are in C prime X because we have three three pages in the book. So we have three main folds with the same boundary and then we are pointing, we are taking account these points here in the DC experiment. For example, another another For example, another set which is not there. For example, if you take, for example, y square equal to x cubed, something like that, right? Maybe it's not exactly this, but why is here, right? Why? Here is why. And so if you take the blowing up of this, this index here, something like that, the ceiling. Here, something like that, the cylinder. And this, after blowing up, this becomes more or less something like something close to some parabolo, something like that. And then here we have only one point in dx prime, which is the link of the tangent cone, which is only the tangent cone is a half line here. This is an a real equation. This is a real equation, okay? Sorry, I did not say, but this is a real equation. So we have two components and two, and so this is not in C prime because the number of manifolds here are even, not odd. But if I now I put another one, I multiply by y equal to zero here, and then appeared another. Another object here. So, this point now for this set, this point is in CA prime X. I don't know if it's clear, but I don't have time enough to say all the things. Okay, this is more or less what is happening. So this is very important. This set is very important for me. The multiplicity for me is the following. If X is a complex analytic set in CN with dimension K. Dimension K. In fact, I could assume that multipiece is well defined. In fact, I don't assume the dimension is pure here. Of course, the definition of multipiece is well known for pure dimensional sets, but this definition here works for any set of pure dimension. So then for orthogonal projection from CN to CK, select the kernel of this projection intersect the tangent cone only at zero. And for you, being a sufficiently small open neighborhood of zero, we have that this cardinality of some pre-major some t outside of some analytic set. Of some analytic set sigma in the some open set P in the image. This number is not dependent of this P and also we can prove this doise not dependent of T of the projection and this is just the multiplicity of X at zero. This is a well-known definition. Just I remind the notion. And then I defined And then I defined so now if x is a real set, and you look at the idea of real analytic functions which is zero in x around zero. Okay, so and then you take the complexification of these functions. This gives an algebra as well. This gives an algorithm as well in O in, and then we take the set of the generals of set given by the zeros of that idea. And then this I call the complexication of X. And I define the multiplicity of X to be the multiplicity of the complexication. This is our definition of Of multi-piece for Rionalit sets. And then let me define some notion of degrees. For example, we know that the homology groups of the real projectivity space are the following: are Z2 for NI from 0 to N. So this guy is generated by some. Guy is generated by some line with this of this dimension, where L is an hyperplane of this dimension, okay? And we consider it as an algebraic cycle. And then every dimensional homological cycle alpha can be described by some number D times L, for example, as a cycle. For example, has a cycle. And we define the topological degree of alpha to be this D, this number D. Of course, these are numbers in C2, okay? Class of number. And then we say that X is an idimensional Z to a homological size if there exists an isolation of A nice classification of X such that it gives on X a structure of a Z to homological cycle, which we denote by X between references. In this case, the topological degree mod 2 of X D, which was defined here, satisfies the following. D is equal to the cardinality of X intersect with some line mod 2. Line mode 2 for in L which intersect X transversally outside of course of the singularities. This is a well-known interpretation of topological degree. And another, sorry for I have a lot of definitions, but I have to do. N minus one dimension of spanelic set C is set an Euler cycle. An Euler cycle, if it is closed at set, and if for a stratification of C and hence for any stratification which refines it, the number of n minus one dimensional strata contain an even n minus two dimensional strata in the in their closure is even and we say asset is a invariant if it it Is A invariant if it is invariant by antipodal mapping? That means if A is the antipode mapping, A of C is C. So we can, for example, verify the closure of an A-invariant OLS cycle C in Rn, the closure in the projective space, is a Z2 homological cycle. So if it's a Z2 homological cycle, it has a degree well-defined, a degree mod 2 well-defined. Defined the degree mode to well-defined topological degree mod to well-defined, as I explained in the last slide. So another one, I think I almost finished the definitions. So let X, let A and B and C a subset of A be super analytic sets and B from A to B be a continuous map. If this kind of If this cardinality is constant mod 2 for a generic set X in V, we define the degree of C with respect to P to be this cardinal, of course. And we denote by tag of C P here, like that, right? For a generic X. And of course, if X is a superanalytic set, the degree. The degree of x is defined and does not depend on the generic projection. When this happens, if it does not depend on the projection, instead of we write dag of x subscript p, we just write dag of x subscript 2 because this well-defined mod p. And of course, when just a comment about When just a comment about the real algebraic sets, when x is a real algebraic set, we can define also the degree of x just by taking the degree of the complexification of x. And we can prove, for example, the notion of degree is well defined, has here for generic projection, and the degree here defined. Here, defined in this way for genetic projections, coincide mode with the degree given by its complexification. We have the same for the multiplicity, more or less. Just now define what means analytic. If you have two analytic manifolds, X, M and N, and X a subset of M and Y a subset of N, P analytic subsets, we say that a mapping from X. We say that a mapping from X to Y is acanalytic if for n are analytic gamma from minus one to n to x, then the composition is academy. This, I think, is a well-known notion. Then I think I can state the theorem again, just to be sure. Could you hear me? Yes, very clearly. Okay, thank you. Then now I want to state again the theorem and then to give the proof. The theorem is the following. If let X in Rn and Y in Rn be germs of real analytic sets and let 8 from X to Y be To Y, Ps are subanalylic, arcanalylic by League-fit homomorphism. Then the multiplicity of X is equal to the multiplicity of Y mod 2. So I think we are ready to prove it. So first of all, let a projection from CN to CB. From CN to CB, please please remark that just to you have X in Rn, right? You have X in Rn. So the complexication of X, the complexation of X is in Cn. So it's well known. For example, we have projections from CN to CN. From CN to CB, such that the kernel of the projection intersects the tangent cone of the complexification only at zero, only at the origin. We take a projection like that. For such a projection, we can now define from Sn, which is in Cn outside of Outside of the kernel to the shear S D minus minus one. Here we identify, of course, the projection of R in these R this is a real linear space with dimension D, and I'm identifying it with Rd. Is I'm identifying just. Is I'm identifying, just identify. And then we have an issue here. If I R D, we are calling the sphere here has S D minus one has I define it because I'm calling this just by R D. So we have a mapping from S N minus the minus the kernel to S D minus one given by this way P prime of U is given by P of U over the divided by the its modules this is well defined and of course this gives we can also verify for example Verify, for example, for this mapping, this degree is well defined. That means the degree is well defined. That means that P prime minus one of some point X, when you intersect with C prime X, this cardinality mod two Right, is constant for a generic x in the sphere. This means this is where this is defined because I define this when this is constant mode two. I just remind. We can prove that. In fact, the way to prove that is this projection give to us give to us uh the the the the notion of multiplicity of of the the set x um xc so i think i have to i want to just a moment i hear i need i um bit more sp I need more space just to write what I want to say. The following, we have the following. That we have if we have the following. In fact, we know the multiplicity of x, the complexification of zero, is just the cardinality of the projection minus one of some t intersected with the complex cases. Maybe inside of some neighborhood, but I can change x by x intersection with the neighborhood. This is a way. This is a well-defined number for a generic t. In fact, we can prove, for example, when I take t in that in the image of Rn. In fact, we can prove these also are generic. There are generic points for this projection, which gives the multiplicity, which are here. List which are here. It's also a calculation. And then, since we have a generic point here, we can assume t is in Rd. So we can prove, for example, now this by definition is the multiplicity of x at zero. But then what we can prove is this also is equal to now the carbon. The cardinality of the projection some T intersect with C. Now more. The reason is the formula. If the roots here, the points which appear here and which not appear in X are conjugated. In other words, we have the real. That we have the real points which are in X and the points which are not real. But it's well known that the solutions which are not real appear in pairs. This is why this number is equal to this number mod two. And then it's not hard to calculate now when you consider this cardinality, we can now. We can now prove with this assumption. Now, we can prove, for example, when we consider p real, this number is constant mod 2, because this is equal to the multiplicity mod 2. And we can prove as well, this number is equal to this degree, the degree of the C prime X. So then we prove that the degree of the odd part of the tangent cone. The order part of the tangent cone is definite and moreover is equal to the multiplicity model. We have some calculations to do here, but I can see the details in my paper, for example. I did this in all details. And then what was proved as well by, for example, this was proved by This was proved by Guillaume Vallette. The odd part of this guy is an oleocyte. So, and also, this was proved by him as well. The odd part is invalid, but also we present a proof here, a different proof, which says this. Which says this guy is also invariant. A invariant, just remind, a invariant means is invariant by ancient automatic. And please remember that when a set is a noise cycle and also a invariant, its closure in the projective space is almost. Is a homological cycle, a zip to homological cycle. I remarked that some slide ago. In fact, I'm not interested in this guy, but I'm interested in the con of this guy. The con means we are taking all the half lines which pass through points of the odd part, C prime X. I'm calling it. I'm calling it C prime of X at zero. So if this is another cycle, this also is another cycle. Of course, if C prime is invariant, the con is invariant. And then I'm taking the closure of this guy. And the closure of this guy is an oil cycle. But for example, I could prove it, I could use it, but I use it now another. Use it now another thing. We started with a mapping from X to Y, which are which is bilips, and superanalytic and act analytic. But I prove it. For example, when 8 is a bilipsheet map from X to Y, it induces a mapping I call I will call P C from the tangent cone X to Y tangent cone here tangent con and of course even more than the tangent cone I I can when I restrict the mapping from the tangent cone to the tangent cone I when I strict to the And I stick to the affine part, the odd part, the C prime. This also gives a mapping from the odd part to the odd part. I had proved it in several papers. And you can find it, approve of it in this paper, paper nine. The reason is I did not define what means. Find what means relative multiplicities, but I prove it that there is a biolips map from the tangent point to the tangent point. When we have a biolips map from x to y, there is a biolips map from the tangent point to the tangent point which preserves the relative integrities. And the odd part of the tangent point is just the points where the relative multiplices are odd. So, but the relative multiplies are present, so we have a mapping from the So, we have a mapping from the tangent coin to the tangent coin. And also, we have another thing which is not easy. This is easy when the mapping, when the mappings is defined from Rn to Rn, when the original map, 8, from Rn to Rn, is by Lipschitz and analytic. So, its derivative, Lipschitz derivative, satisfies that. But our map is. That but our map is only defined from x to y, and then I prove we prove it as well that the mapping, the derivatives as far as when you take my, since this guy is O invari, if V is there, minus V is there as well. And moreover, which we proved was the C of minus V is minus. Of minus V is minus P C of V when V is in the tension, the odd part, when it is in the other part of the tension coin, maybe this cannot happen. Okay, but the reason I have, I think, five minutes maybe. The reason, very quickly, the reason is the form. When I take some V prime, I have the project. I have the projection P here, and I take some V prime and I take the curve given by the line with direction V prime in, of course, R D, for example. These are real analytic mapping. So the prime measure of this analytic mapping, let me call this for a moment maybe C. C, the gray image of C is a set intersected with in X, for example. It's a curve, a rionalic curve in X. So a Rionalic curve, when you consider the branch of the Rionalic curve, we have two kinds of branches. One is like a curve. It's like a curse. That means you can parameterize each branch by something like that: minus epsilon to epsilon to the branch gamma i, for example. Maybe you have many of them, but we can parameterize like that. This real PUZ parametrization, and we have two options to gamma i. The tangent cone of Gamma i the tangent cone of gamma i is a half line, or the tangent cone of gamma i is a line. And what I proved is because the tension we are in the part which the the we are v prime in fact is in the the odd part of the tangent cone. The relative multiplicities are odd, so we have to. odd so we we have to uh to obtain some some branch which the the tangent cone is aligning so this since the the mapping is uh a canalic mapping the tangent cone must send the the the the tangent map must send the tangent cone of the the the gamma i to the the image like that some something like some alignment like that some something like some align as well so this this means a gamma pc of minus v p c of the line given by v is the some line so it it have to change sign this is why pc of minus v is minus pc of v i did not say all details but it's more or less something like that we have to to show this because we are in the we are in the points which the tension We are in the points which the tangent cone is odd. We have to obtain at least one arc here, which is that which is which the tangent cone is a line. Yes, just and then just to now I consider the gamma, which is the graph of P C which is an oil cycle as well, because it's a homomorph to an oil cycle, because the graph of P C is homomorph to C prime of X, and this A invalid by this assumption. This assumption. So is infinite in a cycle? So the closure of gamma in the projective space is a z2 homological cycle. So if it's a homological cycle, it has a degree well defined, degree mod 2, and satisfy is not hard to prove the degree is just the multiplist of x because the degree of this guy is the degree of the c prime and the degree of c prime is. And the degree of C prime is the same of the degree of the odd part of the tangent point, which is the multiplicity of X here, right? So the degree of gamma is the same of the multiplicity of X. But please see the degree of gamma. Gamma is the graph of, of course, I can see gamma with graph of Of PC, but I can see also graph has a graph of the inverse of PC. So by the same reason, the degree of gamma is the multiplicity of the same reason this is the multiplicity of y, sorry. That's zero mod two. So So this implies that the multiplicity of X is the multiplicity of Y. So that is all. Thank you very much. Thank you, Etson. Is there any question? Online, is there any question? No question. Well, you gave a very clear and complete exposition. Thank you very much, Edson. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye.
