So, this talk is going to be about vertex rings. And as you all know, vertex rings are solutions to the Euler equations in axisymmetric form. What I've put up on the screen right now is just the evolution equation for vorticity and Poisson equation for the stream function. And I'm showing you a schematic of a vortex ring here, which is Vortex ring here, which is a torus-shaped region of vorticity, and it's got these two length scales, A and R. And this talk is mainly going to be about Kelvin rings. So it's going to be about thin vortex rings where epsilon, this ratio between A and R, is very, very small. So I've just drawn it large for exaggeration. And for these vortex rings, as we all know, the speed is going to vary according to this formula. Is going to vary according to this formula that was first written down by Kelvin, and epsilon is going to be relatively small for most of this talk. Now, interacting vortex rings are a really interesting phenomenon because of a lot of different reasons. And one of the reasons why I find vortex rings interesting is because if vortex rings approach at an angle, that's considered to be one of the candidates for finite time singularity in the Euler equations, which has implications. Which has implications for the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the Euler equations. There's a lot of exciting work being done in this area. Also, when vertex rings interact with each other in this coaxial fashion and hit each other head-on, you have a lot of interesting instability and reconnection features that you see. There was a very nice paper in Nature in 1992 about this, and the video that I'm showing you is, I think, from some other research. Showing you is, I think, from some other researchers who recreated that paper and put the video on YouTube. So you can go and see that. There's also a lot of interesting things that are happening with arrays of vortex rings, which I'm going to talk about today. So for example, in this paper, this third figure on the screen, these authors used successive arrays of vortex rings to feed a blob of turbulence. And so they could tune the properties of the turbulence. Tune the properties of the turbulent blob that they're creating based on the properties of the vortex rings that they would use to make it. And you can see that they're using these successive vortex rings that are going to be the subject of this talk. Now, next I want to switch to giving you some background on wakes and jets. So, this first figure on the screen is a screenshot of a paper by Henry Bernard, which is one of the Henry Bernard, which is one of the first observations of what came to be known as the one Carmen Street. So Carmen was actually three years later than Bernard in describing these, although I think Carmen did the first full mathematical description. And in this, this Bernard von Carmen street is like a model for many different kinds of wakes and jets. And over here, you just have point vertices or Here you just have point vertices or vertex lines in a plane, but you can also have vertex rings that model wakes and jets. And so you have axisymmetric flows in which you can model the wakes as vortex rings, as you can see in these figures from some old papers. There's also some interesting work that has been done with animal locomotion and vortex rings. So this first figure is So, this first figure is from aerodynamics of hovering insect flight. And you can see that they're using these successive vortex rings that eventually become periodic as you go further down in this model to model the wake of a hovering insect or even a hovering bird. Similarly, for animal marine locomotion, vortex ring arrays give you a first order model of the fluid dynamics of the array. Fluid dynamics of the array of the wake of something like a squid or a jellyfish and a few other marine organisms. And then on the second figure here is from Kruger and Gharib. They have a nice model of wakes and jets that uses vortex rings as well. And once again, they use these successive arrays of vortex rings. Now, on this slide, I've put a video or two different videos of the two kinds of Videos of the two kinds of motion that two coaxial vortex rings are known to have. And so these two regimes were first identified by Lord Kelvin, I think. One of them is called pass-through. I'm calling it pass-through, and the other one has always been known as leapfrogging. And we know that these are two of the behaviors that two vertex rings could show. And this talk is going to focus on what We're going to focus on what would happen if you had two arrays of vortex rings instead of two single vortex rings. And once again, these are still Kelvin rings, so they're still behaving as these singularities. And in these two videos, I'm just giving you two samplings. We don't yet know what all the different regimes might look like. And I'm just showing four images here. But you should imagine that there's an infinite array of blue vertex rings and an infinite array of... Vertex rings and an infinite array of yellow vertex rings. And at this point, we don't know what regimes might exist. I just put some random numbers in my simulation at this point, and I will do it in a more systematic way later. So in order to analyze this phenomenon, we have to start by looking at a vertex ring in a single vertex ring in a co-moving frame. And so just to recap how a single vertex ring works, you've got this stream function. You've got this stream function that's a function of Z and R in axisymmetric space. It's composed of two parts. One is a time-dependent term. And so this term moves together with the vertex string. And then we add to it this half UR squared term that allows us to transform the overall psi into a co-moving reference frame, where this U1 is the same speed that I showed you on the very. Speed that I showed you on the very first slide with Kelvin's formula, right? So, this is how you would put a single vertex ring in a co-moving frame. And it's long been known that as you change the epsilon, the stream function, the stream lines look different. And you can have either these fat vortex rings, or you can have these thin vortex rings. And the value of epsilon at which this transition happens was first found by Hicks. First, found by Hicks in 1919. And here I've just redone something that's been known for a long time. Let's see what happens when we add an additional vertex ring to the picture. So of course, we no longer have a privileged co-moving reference frame. Instead, we have a dynamics problem. We've got a Z1, a Z2, an R1, and an R2. All of them could be functions of time. Could be functions of time, and you can have many different regimes of intervortex motion, right? And the most comprehensive treatment, I believe, of this subject is by Borisov, Kilin, and Mamaev, and I'll be using a lot of their notation in today's talk. But instead of having just two vertex rings, what if you put an infinite array of identical rings, right? And it turns out that in this case, you do have a privilege. You do have a privileged co-moving frame that's moving at a speed u infinity. And the fact that this happens was independently discovered by two different writers in the early 1900s, Vasilyev and Levy and Forsdyk. The Vassiliev paper is in Russian, and that might be why it hasn't been noticed much, but it was then redone by Levy and Forsdyk, that's in the Royal Society. And although these authors don't necessarily use this terminology, this phenomenon can be characterized by two non-dimensional numbers, epsilon and lambda. Now, let's look at the stream function for this periodic flow. So, once again, we can write these two parts, right? We can have a time-dependent part. And in this case, the time-dependent part arises, once again, from a Green's function. Arises once again from a Green's function and we have this half U R squared term where instead of the Kelvin formula, you have a correction to the Kelvin formula that arises from the fact that there's lots of these neighbors. And if you do this correction, then you can get into a co-moving reference frame in which everything in which you're moving together with the array of vertex rings. Now I said that it arises from a Green's function, and I'm using the notation g infinity for that. notation g infinity for that g sub infinity and that's just the sum of many of these g's and each of these green's functions are just what was written down by maxwell and i'm using the notation of boisov kilin and mamaev for this and so we make many copies of this in order to construct our green's function so now let's look at what this stream function looks like in the co-moving reference frame and it turns out that there's three different topologies Turns out that there's three different topologies that occur. And I have on the slide here in an axisymmetric space. So Z is on the X axis, the Z axis is the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis is the radius. And so you're just seeing sort of like a half slice of a vertex ring. And the plot here has lambda and epsilon, the two non-dimensional numbers that I said characterize this problem. So if your lambda is very high, So, if your lambda is very high or your epsilon is very low, then you have these thin-bodied vortex rings. Right? So, each individual vertex ring has a small cloud of particles that surround the core. And that cloud is what I'm calling thin in this case. Then if you decrease your lambda or you increase your epsilon, you will eventually get these thick vortex rings. This is very similar to the behavior from before. This is very similar to the behavior from before, and the transition happens at what I'm calling epsilon C1 in this diagram. And at very large lambda, what I'm calling epsilon C1 will just converge to Hicks value for the critical value of epsilon. Next, if you keep decreasing your epsilon or sorry, increasing your epsilon or decreasing your lambda, then it turns out that you can also have this other topology of connect. You can also have this other topology of connected neighboring vortex rings. So now the cloud of particles that are carried together with the vortex ring becomes very thick until it's connected to its neighbor by a homoclinic orbit. And you can interpret this last bifurcation that I showed you between the thick bodied and the connected as being like an interaction length. Right? And so if we put this bifurcation, if we think of lambda as our bifurcation parameter, then what I mean by interaction. Parameter, then what I mean by interaction length is that there's a certain value of lambda at which neighboring vortex rings, clouds, start touching each other, right? So that's the case that happens at this panel number five. Okay, so at this point, I've characterized the stream function of an array of vertex rings, a single array at this point, and the self-induced speed of this array depends on epsilon and lambda, and there's two different. On epsilon and lambda, and there's two different parts to it. One part depends only on epsilon in the simple logarithmic fashion, and the other part depends only on lambda that I'm calling this correction term u infinity star. And what you find is that the speed induced along the z-axis for this array of vertex rings looks slightly, looks of course different from what it would for a single vertex ring, right? So when lambda goes to infinity, you have a single vertex ring, and when you've got a finite And when you've got a finite value of lambda, then you've got this periodic form of the speed induced along the z-axis. And the local minima here all occur right inside the center of the rings. And the local max, sorry, this is the local maxima. And then the local minima occur right in the midpoint. And this one tends to zero as lambda goes to infinity, and so on. So at this point, I've fully characterized, I believe, the single array of. The single array of vortex thin vortex rings. And I'm ready to talk about interacting vortex ring arrays. So, just to zoom out a little bit, this is what the picture looks like when you've got just one array. And I'm going to add another array and see what happens. All right, so in order to look at this problem, we've got to write down the equations for interacting vertex rings first. And so these are the equations for This is these are the equations for the behavior of just two coaxial vertex rings. There's a Z and there's an R, and the Z and R relate to each other through this Hamiltonian. And the Hamiltonian has a self-interaction term and a term that has to do with the interaction of the vortex strings with each other. And there's one more integral of motion other than the Hamiltonian, which you can call it an impulse P, and that allows you to transform your variables from Z's and R's to xi's and etas. To xi's and etas. And xi and etas, it's a canonically conjugate system. So I'd like to see what happens when we add an array of vortex rings instead of a single vortex rings. So now we're in a periodic domain. And it turns out that you can still write down a Hamiltonian. Your Hamiltonian will have this self-interaction term. And then it will have one term that represents the influence of... represents the influence of vertex ring J together with all of J's images on vertex ring I. So that's what this first term is. Next, it will also have an additional term that is the influence of all of vertex rings i's, vertex ring number i's neighbors on itself. So you need this additional term to take into account all of the mutual interactions. All of the mutual interactions. And once again, we have an integral of motion that doesn't go away just because you added arrays. And so you can still transform into psi's and etas instead of z's and r's. And so that's what we have here. And just to recap what I mean by this Hamiltonian, let's look at what it looks like for n equals 2, right? So this is an n-vertex ring problem in the periodic domain. And for clarification, I'm explaining what n equals 2 looks like. I'm explaining what n equals 2 looks like. So you've got the self-induction of ring 1, the self-induction of ring 2. So these two terms are easy to understand. Then terms number 3 and 4, so where my cursor is right now, these represent the stream function at one of the rings due to the other ring and all of its images. So that's one part of our Hamiltonian. And then the last two. Hamiltonian. And then the last two terms are going to be the induction due to the neighbors of a certain vortex ring at its own location. So that's what term number five and six, where my cursor is right now. That's what these are. And this apostrophe here just means that it's a deleted Green's function. So it doesn't include the self-induction term. Otherwise, you would have a singularity there. Okay, so now that we've put this Hamiltonian together, let's remind ourselves. Hamiltonian together, let's remind ourselves what these variables z and r and xi and eta mean. So, on one hand, we have the real space, and I call this real space because the z and the r have a clear physical interpretation, right? One of them is the axial location where a vortex ring is, and one of them is how big its radius is. This other set of variables, psi and eta, is what I'm calling a phase space. Is what I'm calling a phase space. And it's defined with these equations. It's not very easy to see what some of them mean, but I think psi zero is kind of intelligible right now. So psi zero is sort of like a center of vorticity. And this is going to be a cyclic coordinate. It's not necessarily going to enter into our dynamics. Psi i, as you can tell, is some sort of difference between one vertex ring and the center of verticity. X ring and the center of vorticity, so you know the relative distance from the center of vorticity along the z-axis. And eta i is related to the difference in the squares of the radii of the ring. So it's kind of harder to interpret. Let's look at what it looks like for n equals 2. So like I said, psi 0 is just sort of a weighted sum divided by gamma 1 plus gamma 2. And so it's just the center of vorticity. Center of vorticity. When n equals 2, you only have one ψ and 1 eta. The xi that you have is just the difference between the two vertex rings. And it makes sense that into the dynamics should only enter z2 minus z1, because z1 and z2's absolute values don't really matter, right? And so the difference between z2 and z1 is what matters to the dynamics, and that's what shows up in xi. And like I said, eta is going to be proportional to the difference in the radius. Be proportional to the difference in the radii of the two vertex rings. So, this so right now I'm specializing to the case of n equals 2, and that's the case for which I'm going to show you some results. Additionally, there's some other notation that we can use. So if you recall, is a constant that parametrizes how thick your vertex ring is. How thick your vortex ring is. And gamma is, of course, the circulation of one of the vortex rings. So, to facilitate comparison between different regimes of motion, we can just specify B1 and gamma1 to be unity. And then we have these beta and lowercase gamma as some parameter. And so finally, we can think of the Hamiltonian at the bottom of the screen right now as being a function of two coordinates, psi and a. Coordinates psi and eta, and here n equals 2. And in the conjugate, in the canonical system, we have one less degree of freedom, and so you just have one psi and one eta, and then it's parameterized by this beta and the p and the gamma and the l and so on. So that's the Hamiltonian that we're going to work with. Now, for this Hamiltonian, you can either think of this Hamiltonian as a function of xi and eta, but originally it starts out as a function of equation. But originally, it starts out as a function of z's and r's, right? So the equations of motion can either have these four different, it can be a four-dimensional space for the two for the n equals two problem, or if you transform it to the csi and eta space, it can be a two-dimensional problem. And in this two-dimensional version, you have the usual Poisson bracket, and you can recover the full system by looking at the cyclic coordinate ψ zero and the conserved coordinate TP. Quantity P, and you can use this last equation that I've written down on the screen at the bottom right to recover the full dynamics of the Z's and R's. Okay, so just to recap, the n-vertex problem on the plane, as many of you might know, is integrable up to n equals 3, right? So n equals 1 is not an interesting thing. It doesn't do anything at all. It doesn't do anything at all. And n equals two, you have very trivial motion, or you've got just motion in a circle. And then n equals three is very interesting and it's still integrable. And n equals four is chaotic. So that's the situation for point vertices on the plane. Now, if you've got coaxial vertex rings, then instead n equals one is the one that's cyclic, right? Because all it does is it moves in a straight line. Or sorry, n. Or sorry, and n equals two is still integrable, but you see a lot of interesting behaviors. And then at n equals three and onwards, it becomes chaotic. Now, because the same integrals are available to us in the periodic version of this problem, we see that n equals 2 is still integrable, and then anything greater than 2 is chaotic. So this line sort of demarcates the boundary of what integrable systems we have. integrable systems we have and I believe this n equals two periodic vertex ring array problem is one of the last few integrable problems in this classical vertex dynamics situation. And so this is the integrable problem that I propose to tackle in this talk. So here on the screen, what I'm showing you is the Hamiltonian as a function of the two variables. As a function of the two variables in the phase space, ψ and eta. And the figure that I have on the screen was shown, was calculated using L, a very large value of L going to infinity. And it recovers the Hamiltonian force to individual vertex rings. However, when you use a finite value of L, then you get some more interesting behavior. And as you change L from infinity to some finite value, you find these neoclub. You find these new equilibria arising, and you find the whole space showing some new behaviors. One of these is a saddle center bifurcation that happens between, happens as you saw, right? Two different equilibria were created. And this does indeed behave like a typical saddle center bifurcation. And next, to conclude this talk, I'm going to show you some regimes of intervortex motion. Regimes of intervortex motion. So here I've labeled, I believe, one through five. And the separatrices are shown in bold. And there might be a couple more regimes that I haven't actually looked at in detail. One of them is up here and one of them is down here. And the gray areas are regions where you can't actually get to. So what we find is that the first one that I'm showing you here is just the classic leapfrogging. Showing you here is just the classic leapfrogging, right? And so it's not any not really very different from the regime that's available to a single pair of vortex rings. Then regime number two has what I'm calling pass-through. So there's a little bit of a slowdown here, but eventually you'll see that the blue vortex ring is going to go past the red one. Let's wait for that a little bit. And there you go. And there you go. So the blue has passed the red one, and I'm calling it secular in the sense that then next time it's going to pass through the next red vertex. In regime three, you've got the same general behavior because it's going to be able to go all the way around, as you can see, but I'm calling it retrograde because it does sort of go back in phase space for some time before going forward again. And you can see here that it passes through. And you can see here that it passes through. And then for four and five, we find that the motion circles around some other equilibrium points, not around each, so the vertices never approach very close to each other. You can see that they're trapped by the separate rices. And regime five, you have the same thing, except that they can get very close to each other. And then you can also see this very nice. Also, see this very nice retrograde behavior where they almost go backwards in real space as well. Now, finally, there's six relative equilibria that show up here. You've got equilibrium A, B, and C that are centers, and then D, E, and F that are saddles. A looks like this. B doesn't actually exist because it's a singularity in the Hamiltonian over there. And then C looks like this. Uh, looks like this, and then you can look at some of these other relative equilibria that might be interesting: D, E, and F. So here I've characterized the phase space for a particular value of lowercase gamma and lowercase beta and p. So, there's still some more work to be done to fully characterize this space for all the possible values of the parameters. And here, here I was just showing you a sampling of what I've seen so far. Just showing you a sampling of what I've seen so far. So, in summary, I'm looking at arrays of coaxial Kelvin rings. So, you can think of this as the periodic n-vortex ring problem. I showed you the stream function in a co-moving reference frame for a single array of vortex rings. And then I looked at the Hamiltonian dynamics of multiple arrays of vortex rings. And then I showed you specifically the example with n equals 2 and these values of the parameters. And lastly, I showed you. Parameters. And lastly, I showed you some relative equilibria. That's it for my talk. Thank you.
