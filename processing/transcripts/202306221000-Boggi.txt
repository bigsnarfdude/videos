Hello, Marco. Could you please unmute yourself? Otherwise, we can can't hear you. Okay, now can you hear me? Yeah, yeah, perfect. Thanks. Okay, so I thank the organizer for the invitation. I hope everything works fine. It's the first time I give a talk, someone's streaming this way. Okay. Streaming this way. Okay, thank you. Okay, let's start. So this talk is based on a joint work with Woodman Salter and also with Sanfreton and Segovia. So, okay, let's start. So, I want to study the following problem. So, let's consider a finite cover of a closed Riemann surface. Riemann surface. So I so I want to so one problem which received attention recently is to see whether you can generate the homology of the top surface by means of curves which are lift from. Curves which are lift from the base surface. So I switch to this picture. So you can consider a simple closed curve on your surface, like this one, and you take the inverse image on the covering surface. So this one on the bottom is SG, and this one is S. So the question is whether you can generate You can generate the homology of the top surface with some coefficients by means of curves that you get as inverse image a simple closer curve on the base surface. So this is called simple closed curve homology. So this is the definition. So the question is, so Richard, Is so originally studied with integral coefficients with rational coefficients. So, what are the results? This was a few years ago. So, now we know that for integral coefficient, there is a negative answer. This was done by Roberta, Santa Robani. And later, Malestein and Putman showed that even if And putment show that even if you take rational coefficients, the answer is no. But they assume that the branch locus of the core was not empty. More recently, there has been a paper by Grukovsky, where he also set this case. Okay, so this was the original problem about generative homology of coin. So, this is the easiest way you can think of. Of generated the homology of your colour. Maybe I should also get some motivation for this problem. So, the reason people was interested in this is related to some mapping class group conjecture because people are interested in studying the action of the mapping class group of the base surface on the surface above. On the surface above it. For this, it is useful to have an understanding of the generator of the top surface in terms of the standard generator of the bottom surface. So since you can see, you can imagine that a simple closed curve is just what you get when you consider annulus on your surface. On your surface. So, a generalization of these questions is to consider instead of simple cross-curve, whose regular network corresponds to annually, what we call the pan's homology. So, in this case, so okay, so let's make maybe also. So, if you take a simple cross-curve, you take a nebulous. Cross curve, you take a nebulous, this is just some animals, and this is the only kind of curve limiting curve you can get on an analysis. So the next surface, which is more complicated, is a pant. So this is a pant. So of course, in this case, you can get much more complicated curves on your pant. Curse on your path, but it still makes sense to consider the following problem. So you want to see whether you can generate the homology of the surface by means of cycles on S, which are inverse images of simple cross-curve on a pant on the on. Pant on the on SG. So this is what we call pansomology. So actually, it was Kent with asked this question. Actually, he asked a much weaker question, but in particular, if you show that the pantomime is all the surface, you answer this question. So he asked this question with integral coefficients. This question with integral coefficients, and where we were able to give a positive answer when you take rational coefficients. So, actually, we can prove a slightly stronger result, which is the following: so let take any multi-curve one as G, so any minus. S G. So I remind you that you have this covering here. So you have S over S G and B is the branch locus. Okay, so you take uh uh some multi curve, I mean uh at this joint union of simple closed curve uh on S G minus the branch log. minus the branch logus then you define uh sigma with this so you you define with this symbol the the set of all simple cross curve on your surface sg which are of the same topological type of the curve of the osan curve of the multi curve so there there is this holomorphism Homeomorphism. So then you define on S H1 sigma S A, this group here, to be the submodule generated by cycle, which are inverse images of some curves here. So this is okay, so maybe it's what I explained that this. Worta explained that this, of course, is contained in what we called before the simple closed curve homology, but in principle is smaller because you are only considering inverse images simple close curve which are of a given topology or type. Okay, so you take this module here and then you take this other. Take this other submodule of the homology, which is the one generated by cycles, which are inverse image of closed curve on gamma, which are support on the complement of the multi-curve and the branch logus. Okay, so the result, the stronger result, actually you can generate. Actually, you can generate the homology of S by means of elements which are here and elements which are here. So, this is stronger than the previous theorem because it's easy to see that both of them. So, this is containing simple closed curb homology. In particular, it's contained in so this is containing the simple closed curve homology as explained here. As explained here, and it's also contained in pansomology. This, of course, is just a sum module of the pansomology, the submodule which corresponds to a given composition of the surface. Okay, so this is actually the result that one proves. So one should also say that this result Say that this result depends strongly on some other result. Well, okay, so this one also can be formulated for simple close curb homology, but also for this stronger version. So for this one. Okay, so in general, we know that simple clause. Simple close curvomology, and in particular, also this module here is a proper space of H1SQ. But one might ask if it is a non-degenerate subspace for the For the simpletive form on S. Now it is quite a deep result that this is the case. So, this space here generated by inverse synergy of simple closed curve of the given topological type is a non-degenerate symplectic space of H one SQ. And this result is fundamental for the proof of the previous result. Proof of the previous result. And it is actually the only result when one use some deep mathematics, some really diffuse mathematics. So this is a consequence essentially of OG theory. This is proved by means of OG theory. And okay, I should mention then a result we were able also to prove with Eric and Carlos, also in the previous result. So I know that there also have been other thoughts in the conference which address the Which addresses this problem so to characterize the action on a Riemann surface, which can be extended to three manifolds. In particular, one can ask if a given action on a surface can be extended to one dead body, which is the simplest example of F3 manifold in a sense. And okay, so what one can prove is that. One can prove is that if you're given coven in Galois and the G action on S can be extended to another body which has S for boundary, then actually you have this strong property that all the homology of the surface is generated by this inverse image of simple closet curve. Actually, one gets A stronger characterization of the homology of the surface in this case, which we'll see later. So, this theorem C has some interesting consequences because there are concrete examples where we know that the action on the surface can be extended to under body. So, in particular, thanks to some previous results. Some previous results by Rainy and Zimmermann. We know, for instance, that if G is a Diedra group or G is an abelian group, we check with in pairs with a post-monodromy. So, okay, this is a technical condition one needs in the abelian case. Well, okay, so in this case, you have this property. Property. So for a billion Ramified Covin, this was already known. But for the error group, for instance, the result is new. And I think it's an interesting result. I mean, it's really difficult if you want to prove just by combinatorial methods whether the homology of the gorilla is generated by by this this subspace. This space you can do that in the abilian case, but I think it's the only case you can do that way. Okay, so this was the introduction of the talk. Since most of the proof are, I think, rather elementary, I want to give some idea of the proof. So I start with the proof of theorem B. So, TRMB, I remind you, is I remind you is this one. So is the result that this submodule generated by elevations on S, a simple curve on Sg, which belongs to the same topological type of the given multi-curve, then this space is non-degenerate. Okay, so how does the proof? Does the proof work? So, the proof uses the theory of the mapping class group. So, one consider the mapping class group of S, which is defined in this way. And then we consider a subgroup of the mapping class group, which is the centralizer. So, we suppose that the coin is Galois. We can always reduce to this case. So, from now, we always assume that the coin is Galois. Is yellow, and in this case, we can consider inside the mapping class group the centralizer of the group G. So we identified this way. Okay, then we can build some special element of this group. If you take a simple closed curve on Sg, you take the inverse image on S and you take. On S, and you take the product of all dense twists about the curve of the inverse image. Okay, this is a commuting set of dent twists and it's easy to see that their product is an element of this centralizer. Actually, this is a lift or a suitable power of the dent twist on. twist on SG. Okay, then next I consider the subgroup of the centralizer generated by all such then multi-twists. So then multi-twist means product of commuting then twist. Now it's easy to check since we have this standard identity for then twist that this Then twist that this subgroup, and this is the crucial step in the proof, is a normal subgroup of the centralizer. Okay, then one consider the representation of this centralizer here on the homology with rational coefficients of the swift. So you have this representation where Presentation where SPH1 SG is the centralizer gene in the sympletic group. Okay, here is where Och theory comes through. So there is, so now, since this group here can be geometrically interpreted as the monodromy group of some family of curves or some quasi-curves. Or some quasi-projective variety, well, at least this is true virtually. So this is true for finite index to group of these, but this is enough to get the result. So by using a theorem of the linear, we know that the image of this monodromy representation, well, okay, more precisely, the connected component of the damage. The connected component of the identity is a semi-simple algebraic group. In particular, if I take the Zariski closure or the image of this group which I've introduced before, so this group here, if I take this Zariski closure, this gives a normal subgroup of this group here, and in particular it is also a semi-simple algebraic group. Simple algebraic. So this is the deep mathematical theory we use in the proof. Now, okay, there is a non-trivial fact, I don't give detail this, but it's not too difficult to prove that you can characterize the orthogonal complement. So inside course H1 SQ. S cube, you can characterize the orthogonal complement of this module here as the space of invariance for the action of this group. Now there is a lemma of linear algebra that if you have a finite dimensional vector space with a semi-simple action of a group H and H invariant non-degenerate. And H invariant non-degenerate linear form, then the subspace of H variant is also non-degenerate. So this implies that this space here is non-this space here is non-degenerate, and this space here is non-degenerate, and then it's this implies that it's orthogonal complement. It's all of this and is also non-degenerate. So this concludes the This concludes the proof of here and B that this space is non-degenerate for the symplectic form on S. Okay, then we can explain theorem A. Maybe I need to go back to theorem A prime if you don't remember the statement. So this was theorem A. So I wanted to prove here that the homology That the homology is generated by these two modules. So, this one, which is the space we just proved that is non-degenerate for the bilinear form, and this other space, which is just the inverse image, the food space generated by cycles support on inverse image on the compressor. Image on the complement of the fixed curve. So, how do we prove this? So, okay, I think also this is interesting. So, we introduce a graph that we can associate to the multi-curve sigma. So, there is a graph, this one, that you can associate to the multi-curve sigma. Multiple sigma. So, how is this graph defined? Okay, I give it as a one-dimensional simplicial set. So, the vertex set is just the set of connected components of the complement of the inverse image of sigma on S. So, you take the inverse image of sigma here. You take the complement, which is a union of surface. Of this union here, and you take as vet except this set of surfaces. And the edge set is just the connected component of the inverse image of sigma. Then, when two vertices are connected, so two vertices are connected if one of these simple closed curves is in the boundary of both surfaces. Okay, maybe it's better. Phase okay, maybe I it's better if I give some example here. So let's take so how do we construct this graph? If for instance, I take just one curve on Sg, then I take the complement. So these one are the two ers, which correspond to this and this. And then since the gamma is the edge. So if I have this situation here. If I have this situation here, so here this was a separating curve, this is a non-separating curve. In this case, when I take out gamma, I get this surface. So this is the vertex, which is this one, and then I have one edge, which is this one, which corresponds to gamma. So let's take a pan decomposition of a genus 2 surface. So here I have sigma, which consists of three curves. Three curves. So I consider the composition of the surface when I take out this sigma. So I have two vertices here which correspond to this and this. Then I have one edge which corresponds to this boundary component and two loops which correspond to this boundary component. Okay, so I did oh, I do this for For S, so for the top surface. I take sigma here, I take the inverse image, and I consider the graph I call gamma sigma. So, okay, so this is not consistent with the notation in the picture because this would be gamma p minus one sigma, but okay, never mind. So, this is. So, this is the graph which corresponds to the decomposition of S induced by inverse image. Okay, now there are some nice results on this. This is a situation which is well studied also because basically when you consider multi-curve, when you consider the singular surface that you get Surface that you get contract in this multi-curve. This is the topology, a topological model, what is called a sub-curve. And then this graph here is what is called the dual graph of the subcurve. So this is well studied. So in particular, you have this description given by the lemma of the isotropics module. generated by the cycle support on the inverse image of the multiverse. So actually you can see that the edges of the graph corresponds to connected components of P minus one. So you take one edge A, which is containing P minus one sequence. Minus one sigma. You give an orientation to A, and this defines a cycle. So you define this map which sends the dual of A, which is an element of the cos chains, the one co-chains of the graph, and you send it this to this. So this is the map. Now, one can Now, one can prove this is actually not difficult that this defines a monomorph. In this case, it's G, G module, because everything is act, you born in equivalent way by G. So it's a monomorphine or G module from the first homology of the graph and the homology of the surface. In this way, you define what is called the monirophase. What is called the submodule vanishing cycles? So, this is isotropic submodule of H1S. Okay, then next step. Now, you can also consider the image. So, you have this decomposition, you have that S minus P minus one sigma is the union of all this surface. This surface, and you can consider the image of the sum of the homology of this surface in S. Okay, this is actually what we call the H1P sigma S zero. This would be another way to define this subspace here, actually. And this, of course, is the orthogonal complement of the cycle. Complement of the cycle generated by P minus one sigma. So this one here identifies with the orthogonal complement of the image of the comology of the graph, which I identify with some submodule here. And in the end, for my elbiatoris, you get this short text sequence. So you can see. So you can send the homology of the surface to the homology of the graph, and the kernel is exactly this space here, which is the orthogonal complement of this. Okay, one should say here that this map from this map here can be described in term of edging. In terms of a G equivariant continuous map. So I don't know if it is, so let's try to explain this in a simple situation where it's not one surface. So let's take really the simplest equation. So how can I retract this surface to this graph? So the idea is simply that I take a tubular Simply, that I take a tubular neighborhood of the simple closure curve. So, this is this tubular neighborhood, this is cylinder. So, the idea is that I retract the cylinder to the edge, and each of these surfaces is retracted to a vertex. This is a simple example, but explain that you have this map here, and this actually is also J-Pivariant. Or GP variant. So this map can be described in a very concrete way. Okay, now let's continue with the proof of theorem. A. Now, by the previous lemma, so let's go back to the previous lemma. So we have that, so this space here is just H1 P sigma as Sigma as said, now I'm working with that coefficient. Of course, I want to switch to rational coefficient at some point. This is important. Anyway, the image of this is just this module. So it's part of the space which you want to prove that generates the homology. So you see that in order to generate the homology of H1. Of H1S, you just need to show that if you restrict this natural surjective map to the simple homology, which is this one, you get still a surjective map. Then in this case, you have proved that this one is generated by the kernel of this map, which is part of our generating set and this simple homology. Okay, now this is. Okay, now this is where we apply theorem B. So the fact that this is non-degenerate for the intersection form. Okay, so this is probably the most difficult part of the proof. So, okay, so we have that this space here. So this is the space of H H one oh no over H one s Q which is generated by the inverse image of the curve in sigma so this corresponds to this to this general of course this is part this is contained in this This is contained in this space here by definition. But we said that this is non-degenerate for the symplectic form. Then this by elementary linear algebra, it means that inside here there is some Lagrangian complement of this space here. So what does it mean? That there is some space here such that if I take the sum of That if I take the sum of these two spaces, I get a non-degenerate space for the intersection form. But now, this implies immediately that the intersection of this V with the orthogonal complement of this space is zero. Okay, but this was the kernel of the map. Let's so let's remind that we had this example. Excellent sequence and the kernel is really this orthogonal complement. Okay, so this has a trivial intersection with the kernel, but also since this is a common But also, since this is a complement, of course, this has the same dimension that this homology group, but then has also the same dimension that this homology group. And then, of course, the restriction of this map to V is surjective. And so this this completes the proof because uh of course uh V is a subspace of uh this one. Space of this one. Okay, so this is the proof of theorem A prime. Okay, let's go back now to theorem C, which was the theorem which is part of a work in progress with Eric and Carlos. So this is the corollary. So we want to show that if we can. Want to show that if we can extend the G action of C to handle body with boundary S, then we have that the simple classical curve homology is all the homology. Let's go forward to the proof. Okay, yeah, I'm going to use a result something which is mentioned in the paper by Rene and Zimmerman extending group action from surfaces to underbody. I mean, it is not formulated as a separate lemma, but it's a very interesting result. I mean, that if you can extend the G-action on S, you can apply the Ebivarian then lemma and then find And then find some G invariant wants to manifold the surface S such that S minus A is a disjoint union of puncture sphere. So what I do then is just what we do, just take the C for sigma, we take the image of this set of this joint simple curve A and then curve A and then of course the inverse image of sigma is again A but now since the complement of A in S, so if I take S minus A, this is a union of S E, which are punctured sphere. So you see that all the homology of each connected component Connected component here is just part of this space here. So in this case, sorry, it's part of this space here. So in this case, you see that actually H, so the homology of the graph coincide with its own orthogonal complement because this space here just coincides with this, because the surface With this, because the surface themselves do not contribute to the homology. So, from the Meyer-Bietoris lamb, it follows that you have a natural Lagrangian decomposition of the homology of S in this case. So, you can write the homology of S as the direct sum of the homology of the URL graph corresponding to A. Actually, this one I should probably write. Much probably write A because this is really the graph associated to A and its homology. And actually, you can recover the intersection form by the fact that this space is the dual of this one. So you know that this is linear algebra, that if you take the direct sum of a space and its dual, then you have a natural symplectic form on this. Symplectic form on this space. And this is actually coincides with the symplectic form on the homology. Okay, but now, as I explained before, this space here, so the submodule generated by the cycle support on A, of course it's contained in the simple homology, but this is non-degenerate. This is non-degenerate, but if so, since this is a Lagrangian space, then it means that also is a Lagrangian complement H lower one is contained there. And then this is everything. So this is actually how we prove theorem C and I think there is also an Also, an interesting remark that we can have here. So, actually, we can observe the following. So, when we consider this map, which retracts the surface to the graph, actually, it's not difficult to see that in this case, by the description that we gave. So, we know that S in this case. In this case, S minus A is a disjoint union of Puncher sphere. So, one can see that this also this retraction map can be extended to the under body. So, actually, and actually, the extension to the under body is homotopy equivalence. So, you have this nice characterization of the homology of the surface in case. In case the G action extends on the body, actually, you can describe fully actually with integral coefficients also the homology of the surface in terms of the homology of the handle body. So you have this symplectic isomorphism of 3G model. So the homology of the surface is the direct sum of the homology of the underbody and the homology of the Body and the homology of the surface. Everything is natural because, of course, you have this inclusion of the surface in the under body, and this induces on comology a map H1 H Z to H one S Z, but then my by one. Z, but then by one correct duality, you can identify this with H1SZ. So this is how you identify this module, this space, which has space here, by considering this composition here. And then you are saying that you also have a splitting, so you have a natural map from have a natural map from H1S Z to H1HZ now since the kernel is a primitive submodule because this one is torsion free so you can split this map and you get this submodule. Get this submodule, yeah. So, well, in the case you can extend, you have in a sense that the all the topology of the surface, in a sense, is determined by the topology or by okay. I think I can stop here. I don't know if I was too fast, I hope not. Okay, thanks. Thank you so much, Marco, for a nice talk. Do we have some questions in Zoom? Okay, no questions from Zoom. No time for questions for all Hakub people. Okay. Hi, Marco. It's Eric. Marco, Derek. So, just a thought crossed my mind. Would it possibly still hold the theorem, the last theorem you discussed? Maybe if we didn't know the action extended to a handle body, but it extended to a three-manifold that had the homology of a handlebody. Ah, okay. I didn't consider this possibility. Yeah, this sounds interesting. So, you say that whether in this case we can. That whether in this case we can still have the same result above generation by simple process. Yeah, it's more of a question, but it seems feasible. Yeah. Oh, yeah, that sounds really interesting. So do you also have example where you know that you can extend the action to such a free manifold? Because of course, in the end, you want some concrete example, you want to show that this gives you something in your This gives you something new, so to speak, right? Yeah, no, I don't know. It would seem like the question of extending to a homology handle body maybe has more hope of having like an easier construction theory than the question of extending to an honest handlebody. So maybe there's a cleaner characterization, but I'm not sure. Yeah, because of course, stand into underbody is so you have a motophy of structure. Have a homotopy obstruction. Have you extended to homology and the body? You can characterize the obstruction in an homology way, and then it could be feasible to show that for some new class of group you have this extension. Yeah, actually, that's quite interesting. Okay. Yeah, we hope we discuss this later, probably. I hope something. Something come on, hi Marco. Nice talk. Thank you. Okay, um, so maybe I missed something, but I was wondering, you said that this question of generating the homology by these lists of simple closed curves. The answer is no, if the point locus is non-empty. And then you are giving now with Carlos and Eric an answer, a positive answer. positive answer if the branching if the branching locus is empty and you know this with uh no with carlos because uh yeah i was a bit weak so okay so the the result that our report is so this for us for the result with uh eric and carlos it doesn't matter actually if the power is ramified or not but there is this very strong condition we are asking namely that the We are asking, namely, that the G action on S extends to a handle body. So maybe I misunderstood the result. The negative result. The negative result is that there exist examples. The negative result, the negative result, let me go back here. Okay, so let's seek to rational coefficients. I think this is the interesting way. So, okay, so put my Okay, so Woodman and Malisign approved that you can construct some peak overing. Actually. So is it a particular example, not a general example? Yeah, you can construct a peak overing such that this is a proper submodule. This is a proper subspace. So, for technical reasons, since they use basically Magnus calculus on the fundamental group of SG, for technical reason, they restrict to a ramified covering because in this case you work with three groups. So, recently, using some more sophisticated technique, Technique, Glukhovsky also was able to settle the unramified case. Okay, okay. It's more difficult because then you have to work with one relatal group instead of a free group. This is essentially the question. I mean, their proof, both Malestine, Putm, and Kuwaitski is purely group theoretical. Because actually, they prove some slightly stronger results in terms of groups that which. Of groups, which in particular implies that this answer is no. So, what's happening is that there are examples where the answer is negative, and then you are finding examples where the answer is positive in both ramified classes. Yeah, that of course, when the answer is positive. So, I didn't talk much about this virtual linear representation of mapping class group. Sensational mapping class group because I mean this would take the talk. I mean, I would need more than one hour on them. But in the end, the reason why this is interesting, because you have this virtual linear representation mapping class group, so you can take some subgroup gamma of mod S G which act, so you have for which you have this representation. For which you have this representation here in the homology of S. So, in case that the homology of S is generated by is simple, then you understand much better this action. For instance, you know that all the non-terial orbits are infinite, but okay, this gives you a web view. In the end, what you really understand well in the mapping class group is then twist. Class group is then twist section that have the yeah, I mean, you can put really your end on. So, this is the reason why, which motivated originally the question. So, actually, is it still interesting to know if for some class of cohorts you have this property here that the homology is generated by simple classical, because then you can this gives you a way to describe this, and this is related also to. Related also to put Manville and conjecture, which is in the end equivalent to this question about abelianization of finite index group of the mapping class group. So, I mean, this has a lot of ramification, this theory. So, it's still quite interesting to know if from some particular covenant this property here, this question here, as a This question here as a positive answer, but actually, if you work with integral coefficients, okay, this is also basically in the paper with Putman Sutter because actually there was also here some result by Ilmer which didn't get much publicity. But actually, what she shows is that you can find if you work with integral coefficients, then you can find counterexamples which are just Counter-examples which are just given by metabilium covariance. So it's quite, I would say, quite easy to find counterexamples with integral coefficient. The question becomes much more difficult, of course, with the regional coefficient because then you are killing the torsion. And actually, you can also show that in this counterexample by Elmer, for instance, you it's really the torsion which prevents these. Prevents this identity from being true. So if you work with Z, it's easy to get some torsion which is a proper inclusion. Thank you for clarifying, Michael. Nice talk. Okay, thank you. Do you have more questions here? Marco, could you clarify me the definition of pans homology in the role in your talk? If I can explain again pansomology, you say, okay, yes. So, panthomology is the following. So, okay, maybe I clear this page so I can make Okay, so you have uh your colouring. So yeah, you want to consider, so you have your surface down there, so you want to consider cycles here in the surface. So this is S and this is S G and this is the map P. So you want to consider curves here such that the image Such that the image by the covering is contained in some parts of the surface below. So, here, of course, you can get a very intricate curve. No, I'm not very good at giving picture, but you can see that you can have curves which are not simple in this case, okay? But just containing a small surface of Sg. Sg so this generalizes in a natural way the previous question because in the end a simple close curve, so a simple closed curve on the surface you can really characterize as basically the generator of the anulus, which is a tubular neighborhood of the simple crystal curves. So when you pass from cylinders which are Cylinders, which are surface or genus zero with two boundary components, to the next more complicated thing, which are surface or genus zero with three boundary components. These are all pens. So you ask, okay, I cannot generate by taking inverse symmetry occurs containing cylinders. Maband B I can generate by taking closer curve, not simple Closer curve, not simple, of course, generated containing pens. But of course, the truth is that this is in the end that one question has negative answer, the other as positive answer is not that surprising because, I mean, while if you take a covering of a sphere which ramifies into points, you always get another sphere, of course. Another sphere, of course. It's clear what kind of covinear you can get. But if you take a covinum of a sphere and we five over three points, then you can get anything. I mean, every Riemann surface can be realized as a... Well, actually, there is this belight theorem, which is stronger than that. They say that if a curve is defined by a number field, then you can find a map to p1 minus zero. P one minus zero, one infinity. So when you pass from two points here to three points here, is a very different situation. But still, hopefully for some application, it may be interesting to know that you can generate just taking this cycle with image is containing a small surface now step. Surface non-step. No, I get it. Yeah, thank you. Nice talk, Marco. More questions? No, so let's thank Marco again. And to resume a tense
