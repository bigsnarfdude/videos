And uh, prospects, all right. Are you all seeing my slides? Okay, yes, excellent. Okay, well, um, thank you to Francis and the other organizers for rescheduling this workshops could actually take place, and of course, for inviting me to talk. Uh, so my talk is based on current uh joint. Current joint work with Mark Fells. And it's kind of a sandwich of old stuff and a little layer of new stuff and then some more old stuff. So anyway, hopefully you'll enjoy both the bread and the filling. So I'll talk briefly what Darbu integrability is in more detail. Of course, Mark already brought that up and how this generalizes to a lip. How this generalizes to elliptic systems, mostly of which will be elliptic PDE, second-order elliptic PDE in the plane. So that's the sort of the basic case we want to handle, first of all. And then I'll get into some detail about Mark and Ian and Peter Vesilio's work on uncovering the Vesio algebra, the invariant that Mark mentioned already, associated with a Darboux integral system and what we're going to do. Integral system and what we know so far about the how that carries over to the elliptic case and how this canonical integrable extension, which can be constructed for hyperbolic equations, how we think it extends to the case and why, at least in my case, why wouldn't be one would be interested. And the questions heading at the end, I'm basically going to look at how How connections to between Darby's systems of the elliptic type and certain isometric embedding problems. And that's, I should mention that's based on work with Jean Clauland, who's here, and Peter Vassilio, who I guess is not. Anyway. Okay, so this is a talk essentially about special varieties of exterior differential systems. Let me remind you that an exterior differential system is a system. Let me remind you that an exterior differential system is an ideal inside the algebra of differential forms on a finite dimensional manifold. That's an algebra under wedge product. And EDSs specifically are ideals that are closed under exterior differentiation. We require that each graded piece, it's going to be graded by just degree, one forms, two forms, and so on. One forms, two forms, and so on. And each graded piece essentially consists of sections of a particular vector bundle. So, for example, the one forms of a given EDS will be sections of a vector bundle I1 and so on. And essentially, one can rephrase the problem of solving any partial differential equation or system of PDE as the problem of finding an integral manifold of the core. integral manifold of the corresponding EDS and an integral manifold is simply a sub-manifold to which all the differential forms in the idea you'll pull back to be zero. Now, here's a definition that you'll find in Ian and Mark's paper from 2009. ADES is decomposable if it's generated by one forms and two forms, algebraically. Generated algebraically. And moreover, there are certain sub-bundles of the cotangent bundle such that the one forms generated are consists of sections of the intersection of those two bundles, and the two forms are either sections of the second exterior power of one bundle or the second exterior power of the other one. And these are called, these sub-buttons are called the singular systems associated to the EDS. And I'll give you an example in a second. An example in a second. Okay, so interesting little swimming here. Like I said, I want to focus mainly on second order PD in the plane. And let's say we had a second order wave-like hyperbolic equation. So I'm going to think of that hyperbolic equation as defining a sub-manifold inside the space of two jets of functions from the plane to the reals, where my coordinates on Where my coordinates on that jet space are u is the independent vari as the dependent variable, x and y are the independent variables, u1, u2 are its first derivatives, and uij are its second derivatives. So that's an A-dimensional space inside which the equation cuts down a codimension one submanifold. And solutions to the PDE will give rise to submanifolds inside this jet space by taking what's called the two graph of By taking what's called the two graph of the solution, namely where you let u be the function value, u1, u2 are the derivatives, and so on. And we can characterize the two jets of solutions by saying they have to lie inside this submanifold, and moreover, these three differential forms have to pull back to be zero to that surface. So, in this way, we sort of get a one-to-one correspondence between solutions. Corresponds between solutions and solutions to the PDE and integral surfaces to this EDS that's generated by these three one forms and another pair of two forms that are generated by just taking the exterior derivative of these generators. So one thing about this, the wave-like nature of this PDE is that one gets two decomposable two-form generators, the EDS. And I'm sorry, my slide does not tell you what. These are just simply the total derivatives of the right-hand side with respect to x and y. So this is an example of a singular system because we've got these two two-form generators, which are based on sections of, let's say, v hat, which has dx, du1 minus dx, minus the total derivatives times dy, and the fact that Derivatives times dy, and the factors of the other two form go in the other singular system, and they have in common the one-form generators of the ideal. Now, we say that a decomposable EDS like this is generated by, is integral by the method of Darbou, if every each singular system has enough first integrals. Now, a first integral would be a function that whose exterior function that whose exterior derivative is a section of that singular system. You can calculate these because you can calculate the derived flag of that singular system. And the terminal derived system in the derived flag, known as the terminal derived system, is where all the exterior derivatives of any function have to lie if they lie in v. And so we call these first integrals the Derby invariants. If there are enough Darbu invariants. If there are enough of them, the symptom is known as Darbu integrable. So, what does enough mean? Well, the definition you'll see in Mark and Ian's paper is that the cotangent bundle of the underlying manifold has to be spanned by either sections of one singular system plus the terminal derived system of the other in either way. Okay, so this doesn't have to be a direct sum. There can be overlap. Doesn't have to be a direct sum, there can be overlaps between those bundles, but we do require that the terminal-derived systems for both of them intersect in zero. So there's no exact one forms in the ideal. A nice subclass to work with that simplifies things somewhat is where these sums are, in fact, direct sums. And we call those leanly Darboux integral systems. Darboux integral systems. So, Mark mentioned the example of Liouville's equation in our discussion at the end of Archer's talk. In that case, the singular system, which I defined above, turn out to have two exact differentials in each of them. And that's for this reason, since the terminal derived system would be spanned by, I guess I can't. I guess I can't write here, but these two exact one forms would be sections of the terminal derived system of rank two. So we'd have a rank two plus a rank five spanning the five dimensional, spanning the seven dimensional, the rank seven cotangent bundle. And if you think about what it means to be an integral surface of an EDS, it means that all the one forms and two forms. It means that all the one forms and two forms in the EDS, all the differential forms, pull back to be zero. So, in particular, the two form that's given by the wedge product of these two one forms would have to be zero on the surface, meaning that these two functions would have to be functionally dependent on the surface. So in any solution, there will be some functions such that u11 minus 1 half u1 squared is phi of x, and u22 minus 1 half u2 squared is phi of y. Of y. Moreover, the classical sense of Darbungability says, the classical understanding, I should say, means that we could impose these restrictions, impose these functional relations in addition to our original Euphels equation and get a Frobenius system. In fact, more is true. And as Mark mentioned, in fact, when you do that, what you have to solve is essentially an equation. Have to solve is essentially an equation of Lie type. But for this particular equation, Liouville's equation, it's an equation of Lie type with SL2 as the group, and so it's not solvable by quadrature. Cauchy problems are not solvable by quadrature. But again, the general idea of DARPA integrity is that you can impose extra conditions and get a Frobenius system. So essentially, you're solving ODE. Essentially, you're solving ODE in order to produce solutions to a PDE. So, in theory, it's an easier problem. Now, but more is true about Darbyndrick Bull systems. And I want to get to talking about what more is true thanks to work of Ian Mark and Peter Vasilio in the hyperbolic case. But first, I want to talk about what we can say about elliptic equations. About elliptic equations. So, for example, we all know that Laplace's equation is essentially the same as saying that you're taking the real or holomorphic part of a real or measuring part of a holomorphic function. But if we want to define a companion notion of Darboux integrability for elliptic equations, notice that the construction of the singular systems was based on looking at Was based on looking at, here we go, at factors of decomposable two-forms in the EDS. Well, when you go to an elliptic equation, you don't have those decomposable two-forms. You only get them if you allow yourself to make complex linear combinations of the two forms. All right, so for example, let's take the elliptic analog of Liouville's equation. Laplacian nu is two times e to the u. So you can again So, you can again say that corresponds to an EDS using the same kinds of generators on a seven-dimensional submanifold of the two-jet space. And you can compute the two-forms here, and they are not decomposable. But if you take complex linear combinations of these, then you do get a decomposable two-form. So, matters being so, it seems appropriate to define a singular. Seems appropriate to define a singular system which is now spanned by complex-valued one-forms, and so is a sub-bundle of the complexified cotangent bundle. So, this and its complex conjugate are now our singular systems in this sort of analog of decomposability. So, we'll call that elliptic decomposable. So, more firmly speaking, we'll see an EDS, we'll say that an EDS on a manifold is elliptic decomposable. If only we look at the quote. If when we look at the quotient of the cotangent bundle by the one forms in the EDS, complexify that, we can split that as a direct sum of some sub-bundle and its complex conjugate. So this is sort of the analog of identifying 1,0101 forms on a complex manifold. And we'll define the singular systems as simply. We'll define the singular systems as simply the inverse images of the two terms of this splitting. And again, we'll require that v hat intersect v check is then the one forms of the system. Again, but those will be complex coefficients. So it'll be the tensor product of the one forms with C. You can, an analogous geometric construction, if you think about the distribution on the manifold that's annihilated by the one forms. Manifold, it's annihilated by the one forms the ideal, then this splitting essentially is going to define for you a complex structure in that distribution. But don't think about this being a defined on an ambient complex manifold. For example, it could be a seven real dimensional manifold. And so there's only a complex structure on the distribution annihilated by the one-forms. Anyway, we'll propose the analogous definition that a system is a Definition that a system is elliptic Darboux integral if the terminal derive systems of each of these singular systems, together with the other singular system, the sum of those span the entire complexified cotangent bundle. So for example, in the case of the elliptic Liouville equation, we have these complex valued one forms that are exact and span the terminal derives system of rank. Span the terminal derives system of rank two. And so that together with V check, which is just the complex conjugate of V hat, together span the whole complexified cotangent model. And the system is what we call leanly W integral since this is a direct sum. Okay, so I've been talking for a while. If you have a question, please go ahead and chip in. I don't mind if there's. I don't mind if there's any sort of interruption here. So, by the way, Jen and I wrote a paper a while back, kind of about the same time as Mark and Ian's paper came out, where we looked at the whole, there was a classification of hyperbolic second-order PDE done by Gursa more than 100 years ago, published more than 100 years ago, and then kind of redone by Vesio in the late 1950s. In the late 1930s. And you can easily take some of those hyperbolic equations, since Gorsau's classification was over the complexes. You could take some of those hyperbolic equations and say, well, here's an elliptic version easily for a real, for a real-valued dependent variable. And so, you know, that's how we get, you know, here's the elliptic Liouville equation, and there's several others on the Several others on the Gorsa-Vesio list that have easy elliptic analogs and are easily, for the same reasons, are also Darboux integrable. So to get over to what was brought to the new development in this field of Darwin integrability from Mark and Ian and Peter Vasilio's paper. And Peter Vasilio's paper. As Mark mentioned, the key thing is discovering this thing called the Vesio, that they call the Vesio group. It's revealed by a series of careful co-frame adaptations. So, hey, we're at a moving frames workshop. I hope moving co-frames are allowed. So, and the action of that corresponding Vexio group is what allows us to make an integrable extension. Make an integrable extension that splits into simpler systems. So that's what Mark and Ian called it a superposition map. So it's easy, easiest to explain in this case of lean hyperbolic Darboux integrable systems. So again, the construction is you have two bundles, V hat and V check. They intersect in the one forms of the ideal. Let's say that N is the rank of the one forms. The rank of the one forms, and so V hat and V check don't have to have the same rank in the hyperbolic case. So let's say V hat has rank n plus P, V check as rank N plus Q, and let's take these index ranges. So the basic coframe adaptation is like this. You take some thetas that span the one forms. You take some pi hats that span the terminal derived systems that are complementary to I1. To I1, V hat and V check. And of course, you can take these pi hats to be closed because it is the terminal derived system. It's spanned by closed one forms. And you can look at the derivatives of the thetas and say, well, we have to have pi wedge pi two forms. That's part of the decomposability condition. But when you don't mod out by theta, you're going to have, in general, theta wedge theta. In general, theta wedge theta, theta wedge pi hat, and theta wedge pi check, two form terms on the right-hand side. But the theorem is that you can either get rid of the theta wedge pi check or the theta wedge pi hat. You can't do both necessarily. And that's why I call these theta x and theta y's as two possible adaptations. But moreover, the important part you should focus on is that the coefficient of Is that the coefficient of the theta wedge theta term is a bunch of constants, real constants? They're the structure constants for a Lie algebra, and that's the Vesio algebra. All right, and of course, by the way, we can, since the pi's are closed, we can find locally find functions such that they are derivatives of those. We can take coordinates of the pi hats are derivatives of x's and the pi checks are derivatives of y. And the pie-checks derivatives of y's, and maybe a third set of coordinates that aren't necessarily complex. Now, moreover, when you look at the structure equations, you can actually get rid of more terms in here, but the price you pay for that is actually leaving the ideal, adding stuff that's not in the ideal. So, if we add some pi hats to the thetas or pi checks, we can get. Or pi checks, we can get rid of some of these terms and just have terms the right-hand side, which are theta, which theta with these structure constants, and either pi check, which pi check, or pi hat, which pi hat terms. The point of these structure equations is they start looking like these thetas live in a smaller dimensional space. You think about what we'll have, we'll see in a moment, is that the vest. Moment is that the vection of the Vesio groups allows us to decompose the manifold as a product of a certain slice on which the x's and y's are coordinates cross the Vesio group. This is all just a local construction, I should say. And this structure equation starts looking like these theta hats are just depend on the group and the y's. And these thetas depend only on the group and the x's. So morally speaking, So, morally speaking, they live on smaller dimensional spaces. And you can even get rid of more terms in these equations if you allow yourself to add some other one forms, some more pi hat or pi check, and you finally get just a pair of sets of one forms that satisfy the pure Mauré-Cartan equations for a Lie group. And this is, in fact, how we construct a decomposition of the manifold as a product. Manifold as a product. Namely, we take some vector fields that are dual to these one forms and are killed by the pi hats and pi checks. And they're, of course, a Lie algebra vector fields. They realize the Lie algebra G on the manifold, and they generate a locally free G-action. You can take a slice that's an integral of these one-forms omega hat, and that lets us locally identify. And that lets us locally identify the manifold as the slice product, cross product, the Vesio group. And moreover, the pullback of these omega hats and checks are irrespective of the right and left invariant one forms on the group part of the factor. And the x's and y's actually pull back to be coordinates on the slice. So we've kind of split the manifold as a slice across the group. That's the essential idea. idea. And the superposition principle that I mentioned earlier is simply the following idea. So we've got M as S cross G. Now you think, well, let's actually put in a second copy of the same Vesio group. So take S cross, let's say, G1 and G2, and define this is define a map from N to M, a submersion, where we take, let's say, Submersion where we take, let's say, an element of group one, an element of group two, and just multiply C one times C two inverse. So to get this is a map from n to m locally a submersion. And it's in fact, clearly, as you can easily see, it's the quotient under the right diagonal action of g on this product of g1 and g2. Now, what I'm going to do with what well, what Mark and I have discovered in our work in this. In our work in this year, was that there's an easy way of thinking about the superposition as simply building an integrable extension upon this product of the slice across two groups, two copies of the Vesio group. Namely, now in any Lie group, there are functions that relate the left and right invariant one forms. Let's say the functions are called capital Lambda ij. capital Lambda ij. And let's say on copy, on group copy one, we have the left and right invariant one forms to call them tau one and mu1. And same on for tau2 and mu2 on the second copy of the group. And then what do we claim is that the Fafian system on this upstairs manifold n is that's generated by on group copy on group poppy one by the tau ones and group poppy two by the mu2s. group up e2 by the mu2s and some one forms depending on y and in the second case some one forms depending on x then that's an integrable extension of of our original system so what the has has this so what an integrable extension is this is kind of something was mentioned in the previous two talks indirectly is it's a um additional system kind of like a uh like the lax pair we can talk about where um the uh the e The EDS upstairs is generated algebraically by pullbacks of one forms downstairs and simply sections of this line of this vector bundle. So in other words, we add some new two forms, sorry, we add some new one forms, but no new two forms, and we get something that's closed under exterior differential system on the larger dimensional space. Closed under exterior differentiation, excuse me. So that means. So that means, for example, that if you had an integral manifold downstairs, you look at an inverse image, then you get to solve a Frobenius system to construct one upstairs. But moreover, any integral manifold of the downstairs system I is actually the image of an integral manifold of the upstairs system E. So what this system E does for us moreover is it splits into a product of two Faffine systems. A product of two Fafian systems, one of which lives on G1 cross the Y variables, the other one lives on G2 cross the X variables, and each of which is moreover of Lie type. And, you know, by the way, the way you see it's an extension is, for one thing, the pullbacks of the one forms of I, which remember our theta x's, are linear combinations of the one forms in E. And the two forms that you get from differentiating these one forms. That you get from differentiating these one forms are going to be pullbacks of the two forms of the system downstairs. So, this is the hyperbolic picture. We have a canonically constructed integrable extension, which splits into two smaller pieces. And we can write the solution to the Darby integrable system as basically kind of a product or superposition of solutions of those two simpler systems. Of those two simpler systems. So, what can we do in the elliptic case? Okay, well, what we know so far about the coframe adaptations is we can take now complex value of one forms theta and pi hat, such that the thetas span the complexification of I1. And since I1 is itself just a real sub-bundle of the cotangent bundle of our underlying manifold, both the thetas and the theta. Both the thetas and theta bars span its complexification, and such that the pi hats span the terminal derived system of v hat. And because of the integrability condition, the thetas, the pi hats, and their complex conjugates together form a coframe. Moreover, when we look at, of course, the pi hats can be chosen to be closed. Chosen to be closed and hence locally exact, we can adapt so that the structure equations for the thetas again don't have any theta wedge pi check. In other words, theta wedge, the conjugate of the pi's, and the end. Moreover, let's call this an adapted coframe, but what we find is, well, let me not get ahead of myself. These are all complex coefficients now. Now. And moreover, if you take some local coordinates, such that the pi hats are derivatives of some complex coordinate ZA, then the A's, C's, and M's are all holomorphic functions of those C's. Now, here's where we go off to conjecture land. Okay, every example we've calculated, including several of those Gorsa classification equations, you can Equations. You can moreover adapt so that these C's are real constants, and consequently, their structure constants are real Lie algebra. And so when we can do this, let's just call that a Vesiotype adapted co-frame. We conjecture this always happens. And in that case, we can follow the same procedures, only now with complex coefficients, to form the theta hats that have these. Hats that have these simpler structure equations but are not in the ideal. And these omega hats that have even simpler structure equations and they span a real Frobenius system between, you know, between them and their complex conjugates. So we can play the same game. Let me maybe, okay, we can play the same game. So in the hyperbolic case, we found some vector. Hyperbolic case, we found some vector fields x that realize the Lie algebra. Well, now we're going to have some complex vector fields z that are dual to these omega hats and killed by the pi and pi checks. And because of structure equations, these z's, which are complex vector fields, commute with their complex conjugates. So you get for free a Lie algebra of real vector fields on M. Let's call them the x's and y's. They're the real imaginary. X's and Y's, they're the real and magical parts of the Z's, that span a two-end real-dimensional Lie algebra. Let's call that Lie algebra K, which is the complexification of the real Lie algebra V G, that's the Vesu algebra. And so let's call K the complexification of the corresponding group. It has a non-free action on M. And given a point on M, we can adapt so that, let's say, the Can adapt so that, let's say, the x's are the isotropy algebra at that point. So, under this, we take the non-free action of k, and we can analogously use that action to identify m with the product of s cross the homogeneous space, not the group, but a homogeneous space k mod g. So, what we don't have in this situation, we don't have two copies of the group running around and then taking the quotient by the diagonal. And then taking the quotient by the diagonal, instead, we end up taking basically k mod g as our decomposition as part of our product decomposition, local product decomposition of the manifold. So where is this canonical integrable extension supposed to be coming from? Well, we simply go up to s cross k. And this would be, of course, the quotient by the right action of The quotient by the right action of g, but k also acts on the left on this product simply by left multiplication. And that left action falls to k. And in turn, it's identified by our previous mapping with the k action on m. And this is just sort of general Lie algebra stuff. I think I will skip over this. Okay. But here's our main conjecture in this case. Our main conjecture in this case. So, up on K, you define right invariant, left-invariant one-zero forms, which are dual to the Z L's and ZRs. And of course, there's analogous function of relating these one zero forms on K. And we conjecture the form of the canonical integrable extension is spanned by taking the one-zero forms upstairs and these functions of z that come out of the. Of Z that come out of the adaptations we did earlier and their complex conjugates. So the upshot is our conjecture is that we can make one canonical integrable extension that is in terms of one zero forms and holomorphic coordinate z, and this will enable us to describe the solutions of our original PDE downstairs in terms of holomorphic data. Of holomorphic data. Moreover, this will be a Lie equation again on K, where the solution will be described in terms of holomorphic functions of these C's. So I've been in conjecture land for a couple, maybe three slides so far. I next want to tell you why I'm interested in elliptic Darbundra building in the first place. So this goes back to some work on my last sabbatical. Work on my last sabbatical. Gosh, I hope I get another one. It's been so long. Done with Jean Clawland and Peter Fasiliou, looking at isometric embeddings of surfaces into just plain Euclidean space. So why is that? How is that related to Darboux integraby? Well, you can set up an EDS so that the isometric embeddings correspond to integral surfaces of a certain EDS. The rest Certain EDS. The recipe is as follows. You start with an abstract Riemannian surface and define an orthonormal frame field on that surface. It doesn't really matter which one you pick with its dual one forms, eta one and eta two in connection form. Now let F be the Euclidean frame bundle, which you can think of as points in Euclidean space plus triples of orthonormal vectors, oriented orthonormal vectors. And that frame bundle comes naturally with canonical forms and connections. With canonical forms and connection one forms. And any isometric embedding of our surface B into Euclidean space induces a lift by simply saying that, well, E1 and E2 are the push forwards of your orthonormal frame field, and E3 is E1 cross E2. And that lift will be an integral surface of these four one forms. Now, the first two simply are saying that the duals, that the E's correspond. Duals that the E's correspond to the V's. Okay, the third one is saying that E3 is perpendicular to the surface in the image surface in your cleaning space. And the vanishing, the fourth one form simply says the connection one forms on the image surface have to match that on your starting surface. And conversely, any surface on which these four one forms vanish will be the graph of an isometric embedding. Of an isometric embed immersion, I should say. And so we think of this as the isometric immersion system generated by these four one forms. So there are four one forms on an eight-dimensional manifold. And question B, if you look at its structure equations that I deal, do we get anything we can sort of identify as like a decomposable system in either hyperbolic or elliptic case? Hyperbolic or elliptic case. Well, when you look at the two, there's only two generator two-forms of this system. And in the elliptic case where the Gauss curvature is positive, we can identify two complex-valued decomposable two-forms in this span. You need to sort of adjoin a square root of the Gauss curvature as something you're allowed to use. And so, matters being so, we define singular systems that are spanned by our. Singular systems that are spanned by our one forms, the ideal, and the factors of these of one of these decomposable two forms. So, Jean and Peter and I kind of went to work on this on this system and identified exactly three metrics up to scale for which this system is Darboux integrable. And they're all very simply described in terms of elementary functions. You know, so g1 is cosh squared u du squared plus since. squared u du squared plus n squared u dv squared. They're all described in local coordinates like this. And pretty clearly from these equations, they all have a lead, all have a killing field given by d by dv. So question is, if we look at the corresponding isometric embeddings for these three metrics, what are the Vesia groups that we say exist? What are the canonical extensions that we conjecture exist? Extensions that we conjecture exist. And if they exist, then how do we express isometric embeddings in terms of holomorphic data for these three metrics? Well, it turns out the answer to the last question we already knew, because we can define a certain kind of Gauss map from this eight-dimensional manifold M into three complex dimensional space. This is defined using the frame vectors. Using the frame vectors, but with complex coefficients. The coefficients are certain functions q such that if you put the metric into canonical coordinates, the q where the dv is, of course, our killing field, and q prime is just a function of the arc length coordinate in the other direction. And the c, by the way, is just the parameter differentiating these three metrics, 0, 1, or minus 1. So we have a generalized Gauss map. So, we have a generalized Gauss map that maps into a certain quadric inside C3. And moreover, the image of this map is holomorphic with respect to a complex structure on the surface. And we can recover the isometric embedding by simply taking the real and imaginary parts of the image of that mapping and doing this integral. And this is discovered, this is unpublished work that was discovered by myself and Ben Mackay. And Ben Mackay. So, this is cool. We have what might be called a Weierstrass representation for these isometric embeddings. It would be really cool, except that it turns out that all the isometric embeddings, these surfaces of these particular three metrics are affine minimal surfaces. Now, this is a concept from the long dead field of affine differential geometry. Well, I, yeah. Well, it's been a long time since it was important. And this viostross representation for affine mineral surfaces was discovered by Wilhelm Blaschke about 100 years ago. So not surprising that such exists once you identify these as affine minimal. In fact, for one of these metrics, Chern commented in a paper published in the 80s that every isometric embedding of it is as a It is an affine minimal surface. We discover that after the fact. So we have these two, well, one definite and one plausible description of these isometric embeddings in terms of holomorphic data. What's the relationship between the two? So, this is the question I want to leave you with. Here's the picture we had from our work on isometric embedding. From our work on isometric embedding, we have this EDS which lives in an eight-dimensional manifold. We have kind of a classifying map into a certain quadric, and such as the image of any solution here will be a holomorphic curve. On the other hand, from the work with Mark, we think there's this picture over here where we local identify M with a product, we pull up to a product of a slice in a homogeneous space, we pull up to We pull up to the product of S in the complex Lie group. And we think that the solution will be defined by holomorphic solutions to a Lie equation up here. What's the connection? I will conjecture right now that the way the dimensions are, so by the way, whenever you have a rank four, let's say in this case, the rank four system, if it's lean, which it is in this case, then four is also the dimension of the Vesi. Four is also the dimension of the Vesu algebra. And so in this case, G is four-dimensional. K as its complexification is eight real dimensional. So this is 12 dimensional. And so my conjecture is that somehow this space here is where the graph of the classifying map lives. But I don't know. So that's a question for another day, maybe another year. Maybe another year. All right. Thank you much for very much for your attention. And let me know if you have any questions or comments. Yeah, I have a question. Can you hear me, Tom? Yes, I can. Is that Francis? Sorry? That's Robert. Robert, Rob Milson. Oh, hi, Rob. Yeah, I can actually switch, like, like how I see, I don't know, like. I see, I don't know. Like, do you hear me okay? Are you hearing me faintly? I can switch to, like, I can switch to Zoom. Actually, maybe I should just switch to Rob. Go ahead, Rob. I can hear you. Okay. Simple little question. So what happens if your Darbutical PDE has like some other symmetries, like point symmetries or contact symmetries? Do those show up as symmetries of the EDS? And does it, and can you see it in the structure equations, for example? Equations, for example. Hmm. Okay. Actually, in the media question, you had that fuel electric field, right? Yes, that's right. And, you know, a great question is, is how does that, you know, how do the, you know, in this, for example, in this situation, that's another good question that I don't know the answer of. Oh, so first, two comments, actually, Rob. So as Mark mentioned, the vast UI. Um, the vastio algebra is not the symmetries of the EDS, it's kind of right, but so there. But a good question is: you know, for this EDS, I'm talking about isometric embedding, A, the metrics have their own killing field symmetry, and B, there's also the external symmetry of just Euclidean motions of Euclidean space that will take one isometric betting to another. Where does the Vasio algebra fit into either of those? Into either of those. I don't know the answer to that question, but it's a good one. It seems to be unrelated. That's the problem. Well, you know, for the you would see those like external symmetries somehow showing up inside the structure equations? Well, yeah, you should, but they're not, they may commute with the VesU algebra, but they're not the same as the VesU algebra. As the Vesu algebra. One interesting thing, though, is for you know, for these three metrics, I think I have calculated the Vesio group for the simplest one, the one without any hyperbolic functions involved. And I think it's SO3, it's a four-dimensional extension of abelian extension of SO3. So, you know, the intrinsic So, the intrinsic SO3ness of the isometric embedding system morally shows up in the vessel algebra. Because we can do this, so for example, if we do this, we can do this whole thing in the Minkowski, into Minkowski space instead. And there, the vessel algebra for the analogous metric system is again an extension of SO21. Extension of SO21. So there's something to be teased out there. I think a good answer to that question can be given, but it would be a tough thing to do in this exact, you know, without being there on the board, I would say. Maybe we could do it in a breakout. It's something that I. It's something that I would like to ask you. You don't have all affine minimal surfaces in this way. No, no, but all affine minimal surfaces have this kind of virus rust representation. Sure, sure. They have, but those are special somehow. Right. Yeah. They're, you know, you know, I mean, one of them is just simply the paraboloid of revolution. And Chern's commenting his paper with. And Chern's comment in his paper with one of his papers with Turn was that any isometric embedding of the paraboloid will be an affine mineral surface. Okay. You're just kind of an aside, you know, in the in the paper that's about the integrability, like a lax representation for affine. I can't remember the title anyway. No, I can't remember the title anyway because you can try to do the same game by taking the affine group, you don't have the isometric embedding problem, it's something different. Can you clarify that, please, Emilio? You can build the invariance. You take the second fundamental form, okay, essentially. Oh, right. Okay, affine isometric embedding for the yeah, for the The yeah, so the ask essentially the same problem given a surface with a Riemannian metric. Can you realize these as a second fundamental form of the immersion? Right, yeah. So affine isometric embedding. Sure, yeah, that's a very classical problem. And yeah, that's a good question is what are the metrics for which that is our Bundrick bullet? That is the Arbundricle. I mean, we'll also look at, I think, you know, harmonic maps. I mean, no, there is no hope to compute the second fundamental forms of these surfaces. You just have information on the first fundamental form. In this example, I mean. Right, right. Okay. Well, I mean, you know, the second minimal form will depend on the choice of embedding, but it is expressed. But it is expressible in terms of, I believe it is expressible in terms of this generalized Gauss map for these, for this, if that's what you're asking for for these particular embeddings. Yeah. To understand if they fit in a possible, a fine generalization of your approach of these particular Okay, well, I think I'm not. So, I think that. So, are you asking? Are you proposing that one could class look at the affine asymmetric embedding problem and ask when is that Darboux integrable for right, right, right? Okay. Right. This kind and ask if guess that they are a fine minimal, I don't know, or something like this. I mean, it should be more, you should have more. It should be more, you should have more examples, right? Yeah, and presumably the Vesio groups might be Vesio algebra might be related to SL3 in that case. I don't know, I just guess. I have no idea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good, that's an interesting problem. Hey, Tom. Tom? Yes. So your psi there, that's the Darbu invariant, right? The Darbu invariant, right? Um, it's yes, yes, it is. Yes, that's right. I mean, it's it's it's living in if you took complex coordinates on this quad on this quadric, yes, it's the Darbo invariant. It's the Darboon variant. So it's going to be the differential invariant up on the uh the 12 space. Okay, so there should be a lift up here from here. Yeah, okay. Yeah, if it's the Darbuin variant, then it is. If it's the Darboux invariant, then it is almost by definition the differential invariant on the upper space, eh? Okay. We'll crank it out. Okay, excellent. All right, nothing like doing this in public. Okay. Lunch time again. Yep. Maybe we'll talk a little later. All right. Thank you all again. Thanks.
