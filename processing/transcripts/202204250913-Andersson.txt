And so there were around 1970s, around 1970, early 1970s, several major conjectures were clear in some sense. So strong and weak cosmic censorship, black hole unique to sensibility, and the Penrose inequality. And what's really behind that is the end-state conjecture that, you know, Conjecture that you don't only have stability for a curved black hole, but you have for generic initial data, the end state should be a collection of curved black holes. And from that, the Panros inequality was deduced. And that's still, and all of these are open problems, even though. Problems, even though black hole uniqueness at least is now on the horizon, so to speak. And so the conjecture is, of course, that the maximal development of Cauchy data close to Kerr data is asymptotic to the future to a member of the Kerr family. So here is the Cauchy data we have. We're close to Kerr, so there is a horizon. A horizon, there is the non-infinity scry, and as you approach time-like infinity, the geometry should settle down to a member of the Kerr family. And there's lots of numerical evidence and a lot of mathematical results that point in this direction. Um and so there's been uh you know lots and lots of work. I'm leaving out probably a lot of important names, but this these are some names at least. And so some of the major steps are the Tukowski equations and the mode stability, the fact that you have mode stability for these. And there's the Moravitz estimate, so basically local integrated energy Basically, local integrated energy estimate for the Tokowski equation. And that has a consequence that you can prove decay of solutions as in, you know, that the solutions of the Tukovsky equation decays or goes to zero at a certain rate for large times. And then linear stability is known. And there are steps towards non-linear stability, although there's no complete proof in the literature. And all of these are these three things here are only known for small A, for slowly rotating black holes. Even though, I mean, the techniques that we have, you know, basically you can prove the Moravits for the full. For the full sub-extreme family, and that's underway, so to speak. And that will also have, as a consequence, linear stability for the full sub-extreme range. For non-linear stability, that's a lot more difficult. And there are also other results on stability of Schwarzschild in the polarized case and in some other situation. And also, there's a foolproof of. There's a full proof of Kerr-de-Sitter's stability of the Kerr-de-Sitter solution for also again for slowly rotating for the slowly rotating case. And I guess, yeah, so there should be some condition here on the cosmological constant as well. And so an important point about the curve stability problem. Kerr stability problem is that the parameters in the Kerr solution, they're the two scalar parameters of mass and angular momentum per unit mass, but the black hole is really more like a spinning particle. So the momenta sorry and so it's And so it's really, you have really the momenta lying in the dual of the Poincar√©-Elli algebra. And so the mass is actually related to the norm of the four momentum. And the angular momentum is related to, it's actually, those two scalars are actually Casimirs. And they pick out. And they pick out an orbit in the dual of the Lie algebra. So you have actually more degrees of freedom of the curved black hole, which are global in some sense than these two Lorentz invariant scalars. So the metric, as it's usually presented in Boylinquis or Eddington-Finkerstein coordinates, represents the black hole in the rest frame. The black hole in the rest frame and with a line rotation axis. But so there are, in some sense, both local and global gauge degrees of freedom that one has to consider. And local gauge has to do with the hyperbolicity of the field equations. And the global gauge has to do with the sort of alignment of the black hole as far as rest frame and rotation axis is concerned. And rotation axis is concerned. And so, if we look at the dynamical back hole, then I mean, in the for linear gravity, you have mass and angular momentum are quasi-locally conserved. But for non-linear DR general relativity, angular mass and angular momentum will radiate. So, you can't determine the final parameters from the initial data. From the initial data. And also, the apparent horizon evolves. So there's an event horizon, but that cannot be known until you know the whole space-time, so to speak. And in addition, there are the well-known features of trapping and super radiance, which will always be present, so to speak. Yeah. Yeah, and so in the work that I've been doing, we've been using the Geroch-Held-Penrose formalism. And there are several groups working on the problem. So each group uses a different technology, so to speak. But this is what we're using. So there's a complex null frame, two real and two complex null legs, normalized like that. And if you predict on the tetrad, you construct from the fields, the tensor fields and so on, scalars. And they will be so if you allow the legs to be rescaled. The legs to be rescaled, but preserving these normalizations that gives you the spin and boost rotations. And the scalars that you construct that way, most of them will be properly weighted. They will satisfy a law like that. And the boost and spin weights of the fields are related to these, the type here, P and Q. And by eliminating the boost weight, you get purely spin-weighted scalars. And then this, the modulus of the field, is then a true scalar. And this is more or less necessary to be able to do estimates. So this can all be done systematically. And in the GHP formalism, there are operators, Thorne and Thorn and F related to the derivatives along the tetrad legs. And so you construct connection components. So these are called spin coefficients. And so those are the those in addition, those are 12 complex numbers. And in addition, you have the five complex scalars representing the curvature. Curvature. And they can all be arranged in a nice diagram like that. Okay, so Kerr is algebraically special, so it's petrol type D, so there's a principal null frame so that the real null lengths correspond to shear-free null directions. And so, because of this, of the properly weighted fields. Properly weighted fields, only these ones remain non-zero. And so the prime here refers to switching ln and mm bar. And because of this, this has a lot of important consequences, as I mentioned earlier. So there's a Carter-Killing tensor, symmetries, decoupling, integrability, and so on. And now if you look at Linear's gravity on If you look at Linear's gravity on the Ture space-time, this is the field equation that we're trying to solve. Instead of diffimorphism gauge degrees of freedom, there is now a linearist diffomorphism, which is just a symmetrized covariant derivative of some unknown vector field. And if you look at the solutions of the linearized eigenvalue. The linearized Einstein equation on the curved space-time, you can classify the gauge-invarying quantities. So there are basically four scalars. There are the two extreme curvature scalars or linearized curvature scalars, and there are two additional ones that essentially represent the parameters in the type D family. So these extreme curvature scalars are especially important. Especially important. So the fields that we have then are the linearized curvature scalars, linearized in coefficients, and metric coefficients, so the components of the linearized metric in the given tetrad. And these extreme curvature scalar solve the Tukowski master equation and the Tukowski. Master equation and the Tokovsky-Sterinsky identities. So the TME are spin and ghost-weighted wave equations, and they're separable because of the existence of the Carter symmetry operator. And the Tokovsky-Sterbinsky identities relate psi naught and psi 4. And this diagram illustrates why that happens, because the The operators thorn and f and thorn prime, f prime change the weights in this orderly manner. And so you see you can see easily that there can be such relations. And indeed, those relations can be worked out. And so this is automatically satisfied if you have a solution of the field equation, of the Asian equation. Okay, so the Tukovsky master equation, which I'm not writing it down, but it can be separated. And the separated form is a confluent Hoyne equation. So it's a second-order differential equation, which you can think of it as an equation in the complex plane with rational coefficients. Rational coefficients, and it has two regular and one irregular singular point. And so there's a whole literature on those type of equations starting from the 19th century. And so you can use, in particular, you can use various transform techniques to analyze those. And so Bernard Whiting was then able to show. Was then able to show mode stability. So, this means that there are no exponentially growing modes, and modes are ones which satisfy reasonable boundary conditions at the horizon and at infinity. And so that rules out sort of essentially linear instability. But to really do To really do the proof, we need also more stability for real frequencies. And this was first proven by Jako Slopento-Krotman for the spin-zero case. And then later on, we proved it for general spin. And there's also some interesting work by Rita to share the costa on this topic. On this topic. And so once you have that, and you have, and then you can use the fact that you have the Carter symmetry operator to prove a Moravitz estimate. You can construct a multiplier that will give you the Moravitz estimate. And so this was done by Xian Ma in 2019. By Sian Ma in 2017 and also by the Fermos et al. in the same year. And later on, Sian Ma and Zhang have proven that price law, you have actually price law decay for these fields. So the formally expected decay actually holds in that case. Right, okay. So, yeah, so if you know, if you then look at linearized gravity further, you can construct solutions of the linearized Einstein equation given a solution of the Tchowski equation or actually the adjoint equation. So, that constructs for you, so you can construct sort of this. So, you can construct sort of this. So, the field has essentially the same amount of degrees of freedom as a complex scalar field. And so you can construct basically the full set of solutions of radiative solutions of the field like that. And these by construction will be in outgoing radiation gauge. There's an ingoing version as well. But so, this is the interesting one for us. But so this is the interesting one for us. And so this has actually five gauge conditions satisfied. So there's a these are four conditions, but there's an additional trace condition that that's satisfied. And the interesting thing that was proven by Price, Schenker, and Whiting is that a general solution can be put in ORG or outgoing radiation gauge. And so these four are they basically correspond to the diffomorphism degrees of freedom. And the additional trace condition can be satisfied by using residual gauge degrees of freedom on the Cauchy surface. And then, due to the special geometry of char, you can show that these additional conditions actually propagate. So that's very important. So, this is a very strong gauge condition, so to speak. And so, it kills off five of 10 degrees of freedom in the linearized metric, and three of 12 spin coefficients are killed off, or linearized spin coefficients. Right, and so then if you And and so then if you write the if you impose this gauge condition on the linearized Einstein equation, you have the Tukolsky equation and then there is a hierarchy of transport equations. And these are basically sourced by the linearized, one of the linearized via scalars. And the transport equations are sort of along these ingoing principal null directions. And if we look at linear gravity, then the mass and angular momentum decouple. So we can put those to the side and you can write sort of explicit solutions for those in ORG. Right. And so this leads to quite lengthy and complicated. Quite lengthy and complicated systems of equations. And so, this is, I think, this is an invariant feature of gravity in this curriculum. The currometric is already fairly algebraically complicated. And when you start taking it apart and so on, then you're led to You're led to these lengthy lists of equations. And so it's important to be able to use symbolic computer algebra to derive and to manipulate these equations, because that makes it at least easier to avoid simple computational mistakes. And so what we're using is packages based on exact. Packages based on exact. So that's a publicly available package that runs under Mathematica. And there are two packages in particular that were developed by Acksteiner and Bechtel and by Thomas Bechtel that have been very important for this work. So all of the equations that you see here, which you, I mean, probably you can't read it, but those were. But those were all derived and typeset automatically, so to speak. Right. And so the Tukowski equation is the source for the decay. So once you have proven a good decay estimate for the Tukowski equation, then you have these transport equations and you have weighted Hardy estimates for those. And you have weighted hardy estimates for those. And so that allows you to pick up the decay for the fields from the decay of the source, which in this case is coming from the curvature scalar. And so it's not actually that simple because you need to do some special, you need to treat the fields near null infinity. Feels near null-infinity in a special way because of the scaling in these transport equations. So you need to sort of remove some of the, you need to do a Taylor expansion at Skry, and then you need to remove some of those terms and treat them separately. And so in order to do that, we had to use the Tukowski-Slerbinsky identities to derive certain interval identities for fields along Skry. Scry. But that can all be done. And so, one aspect of this proof is that it's modular in the sense that if you have a Morrow's estimate for the Tokoski equation, then you get stability for linear X gravity. And so this means that if you have a proof of the Moravitz estimate for the Tokovsky equation for the full sub-extreme range, then you Full sub-extreme range, then you automatically get stability for linearized gravity for the full sub-extreme range. And as I said, so this is more or less now, you know, it's a technical problem that it can be done and it's being done, so to speak. So this restriction on the small A case will soon be removed from the linear stability. Linear stability problem. Okay, so there, I mean, this is just one approach to this problem. So there are many other or several other approaches. So if you look, so it's quite natural to think about harmonic gauge. The problem is that this gives you a complex or complicated system of wavy. System of wave equations which makes it less easy to get decay and so on and so forth. So there's one approach which does make use of harmonic gauge, and that's the approach of Hafner, Hintz and Vasi. And so this basically, what they do here for the small A case is basically the perturbation argument from the Schwarzschild case. So that So, that has no direct hope of being generalized to the large A case, but this doesn't say that you could not use harmonic H. In fact, that can be used also for the large A case. And there are other approaches using the Chenosecker transform and to get a Reddy-Wheeler type equation. And then you do estimates for that Reddy-Wheeler equation. And also, double null coordinates has been, it comes up in this work. Yeah. Right. And so now, okay, so this is about the linearist gravity. And so that's sort of more or less under control. And so if we now look at the non-linear problem, then what what What I have been doing together with Thomas Bechtel, Peter Blue, and Sion Ma is to try to generalize this radiation gauge approach to the full non-linear problem. And so if you have a char background and you pick an ingoing principle in all direction in that background. Background and so here and let's look at this difference difference field, which is the difference between the kind of physical metric and the background metric or foreground and background metric. Then we can impose this algebraic condition. So that's four conditions on the field. And then an additional condition which says that the Says that the trace of this difference field is small. So it can't be set to zero like in the in the curve for linear gravity, but we can make it small by using up more of the sort of this residual cage degrees of freedom. So these four conditions can be solved using that uses up the diffomorphism group, so to speak. And what the effect of that is that in the foreground, in the actual physical metric, the ingoing null directions or the ingoing null geodesics will be sort of painted along the flow lines of this background field. So, this is now both another action now, both in the foreground and in the background. Foreground and in the background due to the scate condition. And so you can then show. So, in general, it's true that the Bianke identities imply a first-order symmetric hyperbolic system for the curvatures. So, we then introduce difference variables for the metric, spin coefficients, and curvature. And introduce, in addition to the diffomorphism gauge. In addition to the diffomorphism gauge described here, there are frame gauge degrees of freedom. And by using, by specifying a suitable frame gauge, you can show that you get a system which consists of the Bianca identities and a transport system where there are no derivatives on the right-hand side. So this is then can be. This is then can be put in first-order symmetric hyperbolic form. So it's a stable, well-posed system for the Einstein field equations. And now the Bianchi identities, from those, you can extract a non-linear version of the Tukowski master equation. In this system, there are quadratic and higher-order couplings, as can be expected. As can be expected. So we get a couple sort of wave transport system for the Einstein field equations. And this is the system that's now of interest, so to speak. And so this has a lot in common with other approaches like Kleinemann and Saftel and their collaborators. And the difference, or one difference here is that there's Here is that there's if you compare this to double null folations and so on, we're only looking at one null direction and focusing on that and only evolving in that one direction, so to speak. There is only one type of transport equation involved now. Okay, so yeah, so that's now Now, so as I said, there are several groups working on the problem. There is no complete solution, and I mean there are lengthy papers on the topic. And I would not claim that we're closest in any way to solving the problem, but our approach is. Our approach is different from the other approaches in the ways that I've described. And it remains to be seen how difficult it is to complete this project. So I'll just finish by making a few remarks on the challenges in the black hole stability problem that one has to face up to. So there's a, we don't know, you don't know. You don't know the background. There is no a priori given background because you cannot determine the final parameters of the limiting curve solution. And so most approaches, you have a couple system, and most of the time you will lose regularity in the estimate. The estimate. So it's, and one way out of that is to use a tame estimates, a national sort of type estimate. So this was done, for example, by Hintz and Vashi in the Keral de Sitter case. And they also formulated the problem as a kind of fixed, infinite-dimensional fixed point problem. And Kleinemann said. Kleineman, Kleineman, Stefel, and Georgi, and they have they're using quite a different technique. So it's double null freation. They're using Tukowski-Sorbynsky and a certain gauge condition, GCM sphere condition. And there's a bootstrap involved in their approach. And yes. Yeah, so it's a priori, it's not far from obvious which is the most effective way of approaching this problem. And so in this nonlinear outgoing radiation gauge approach, so what the situation is that you have now a non-linear or Tolkovsky equation, Tokovsky type equation, but on a dynamical Equation, but on the dynamical background, this is coupled to a transport system. The decay is coming from the Tukowski system because even though you have a dynamical background, you can still prove Moravit's estimates and so on. And then the actual field, the actual space-time metric is reconstructed using the transport system, or there's a hierarchy of transport equations. But in all approaches, the reduced field equations depend on the unknown, or at least in this approach, the reduced field equations depend on the unknown final curve parameters. So one has to set up a coupled system involving these unknown final curve parameters. So it's natural to think of that as a kind of a fixed point problem. Right. Yeah. And so that's all I have to say. So thank you very much. Okay. Thank you very much, Lars, for a very interesting talk. Is there any questions from the audience, either virtual or in person? Actually, I got a question if I can ask. So, I don't know. Can ask so I don't know if it's just a feature of the diagram of the Pentros diagram that you were using, but I see that the initial hyper surface doesn't reach spatial infinity. So this is the case in your work? Or I mean the initial? Well, I mean, this was just for illustration, so to speak. I mean, of course, you have to. I mean, you have to set up data on a slide. Data on a slice that goes out to spatial infinity. And that's where you pick up. I mean, so the decay properties of the field at spatial infinity are closely tied into the decay at future time like infinity. So this was more for illustration. And I mean, so there's you can convert statements about decay at Decay at space-like infinity to regularity statements at where this hyperboloidal slice crosses scry. So there's, in principle, you can start like that, but the Cauchy data that you're actually thinking about, so to speak, originates on a slice that goes out to space-like infinity. Okay, I'm asking because, I mean, like, Because I mean, like some people in the audience, including me and Juan, are interested in the problem at spatial infinity. And we know this is a really a hard problem from the point of view of conformal methods. So we were wondering, I mean, I'm wondering if part of that problem is sort of resolved within this setup. No, no, I mean, I think this is those that goes, that's at the level that's... That's at a level that's sort of beyond what we're doing here. I mean, you need good decay. I mean, the field equations sort of restrict the type of decay that you can have. And of course, if you try to push, you know, if you analyze regularity at spatial infinity, there are all these. There are all these long terms and so on and so forth, which you're faced with. But I think those that level of detail doesn't really figure into what we're doing. So yeah. Thank you. But we do, I mean, in the work on the linearized problem and also here, I think, you know, you have to have a certain amount of regularity at null infinity, for example. Example. And that's closely tied into the, I mean, there's a price law basically, there's an upper limit to how much the rate of decay is strictly limited by the field equations, right? So for the linearist field equation, there's a certain rate of decay that you can get for generic data. For the non-linear field equation, For the non-linear field equation, due to the non-linear interactions and so on, there is another rate of decay that you can get. But those are to so and those correspond to certain regularity properties at SCRI. But these problems that you're faced with, like, you know, if you look at what Juan and Helmut Friedrich have been doing, I think that's. doing i think that's that's that goes beyond those features that we see here right because these log terms don't start appearing until a certain a certain level so to speak yeah um any any other question Thank you very much for the nice talk. I actually have several questions. I think I missed: what are the boundary conditions for Pi zero and Pi 4? Sir, I can't hear you. Could you speak closer to the microphone? Yeah, let's try. Can you hear me now? Yes, not well, but yes. It's standard there. I'm sorry, I'm quite short. Can you hear me now? Yes, yes. Okay, nice. I was wondering: what are the boundary conditions for 5.0 and 5.4? Boundary conditions. Well, I mean, so the, I mean, there's the peeling, right? So you know what, I mean, so the boundary conditions, for example, for the psi 4, you know. example for the psi four you know that uh r times psi four should tend to a limit at scry and and r to the five times psi four psi naught should tend to a limit at scry and at the horizon there is no i mean they're just you know depending on i mean you have to be careful to use the regular frame etc etc etc but if you properly Et cetera, but if you properly rescale these fields, they're just smooth across the horizon, right? And in particular, the psi 4 sort of contains the radiation field, and the radiation field lives on SCRI, and that sort of tells you the amount of radiation that's crossing SCRI. And so, those, I'm not sure if that answers your question, but. If that answers your question, but those boundary conditions there are really consequences of the condition on the initial data on the initial slice, which I should have drawn here, which goes out to space-like infinity. Yes, thank you, itas. And also I had another question. Um how do you introduce the variations in the the you have a non-linearized Tokorsky equation? Have a non-linearized Tokovsky equation. I guess that you also have to take into account the perturbation once you compute explicitly the spin coefficients to be able to write down the equation, right? So you're asking about in the non-linear situation. Yes. You're asking about the Tokovsky equation. Yes. Yes. So I mean that of course that's an equation that you can write down. That's an equation that you can write down in terms of foreground fields. And it's an equation not for the psi 4, but for the well, actually, it's the yeah, so it's a psi 4 because the psi 4 in the background is zero. So the difference field is the same as the field itself. And this nonlinear Tokovsky equation. And this nonlinear Turkowski equation is then sourced by a big mess of fields, which involves curvature components, spin coefficients, and so on and so forth. I'm not sure if that answers your question. My question was more on how do you take into account the change for the spin coefficients? How do I take into account the? How do I take into account the variation on the spin coefficients? Because you will also need that to the knowledge. Yes, yes. So, so those are those are governed by this transport system. So, this means that, I mean, so you have to really think of this as a coupled non-linear system where you have the Tukowski equation or the Bianchi system, I mean, which in some sense implies the Tukowski equation. And then this is coupled to And then this is coupled to this transport system. And there are lots of problems with that because you have derivatives of fields in the Tukovsky equation, so you can't really close estimates, but you can do tame estimates and so on, right? So this leads you to think about Nash-Moser-type approach. Approach. So, but you could think of, I mean, so it's not that you have really a couple system that you have to solve once at once, but in a certain sense, the spin coefficients and so on are governed by this transport system. Thank you very much. Yeah. Any other questions? Any other questions? Yes, hello. Do you hear me? Yeah, perfectly. Please go ahead. Okay, thank you very much, Lars, for this very nice talk. I had a follow-up question on the boundary conditions, but more at the inner boundaries. So how, I mean, for the non-linear system, you don't know a priori where the horizon, that the event horizon is. So do you somehow make sure? I mean, how do you construct the solution? Do you make somehow? Solution, do you make somehow sure? Do you integrate a little bit inwards? Do you make sure that you are well? Let's see here. So, yeah, so if we look at this, this, I mean, so since you don't a priori know where the horizon is, let's see here. So, yeah, so if you look at this picture, so I mean, you don't know where the horizon is, but you have to then go a bit inside. You have to then go a bit inside. So, and because you know the apparent horizon is stable, right? So, you know, you and so you can, and since this apparent horizon is going to be a space-like surface, so that's an outflow surface. So, so the field can only cross in one direction. So, you go a little bit inside, or you can even stop at the apparent. At the apparent horizon, and then evolve like that. But that's more of a practical issue. So the actual surface that you want to look at is something that crosses, I mean, you want to avoid the bifurcations here. So you cross the horizon or apparent horizon sometime to the future of the bifurcation sphere, and then you go out to a space-like infinity. Out to a space-like infinity. But you know, by then using the Cauchy problem, you can essentially think about hyperboloidal surfaces like that. Thank you very much. Yes, any other questions? I'm sorry, but I just am confused. I thought that we were starting now. You started an hour ago. Is that right? Started an hour ago. Is that right? Yes, we started one hour ago. Yes. I'm terribly sorry. So, are Lars' slides going to be available to other people like you? Yes, and I have you recorded as well. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. I'm sorry about missing this. No problem. Any other questions? Well, if there are no questions, then maybe what we can do is have a small font, yes, yes, perfectly. Yes, I don't know if you can. But probably you have to get closer to the microphone. Can you hear me better now? Yes, it's getting better. Okay. So I have a vague heuristic question for Lars. A heuristic question for Lars. You have mentioned that, well, have insisted on the fact that because of being the draft D class, so it's a very special space-time, and in particular, you have commented that this has implications on separability and integrability. So the vague question could be, do you expect that the fact you are studying the stability of a system which is integral? Which is integral could have could play a role in controlling the stability. Or the question would be: what would be the role of integrability in the study of the stability of central that the stability for the The stability for the Tukowski equation is really tied into the separability and I mean, you know, this is deeply tied into the black hole uniqueness problem as well, right? Because you expect the only stationary solution to be cur and so. And so the final state conjecture is then also another manifestation of the same thing: that the only stationary, the only limiting states have to have all these special properties. And that's, in some sense, quite mysterious why it is like that. Quite mysterious why it is like that. And I think this is also something that manifests itself in many other situations. Like, you know, if you look at other steady states, I'm sure they have special properties, but I don't think they're not of the same nature. I mean, if you look at Newtonian gravity, stars, Stars, you know, Einstein-Vlassov, steady states always have some special property, it's, but it doesn't manifest itself in the same way as in this pure sort of vacuum gravity situation. And I mean, I think, so I didn't mention this in the talk, but of course, I mean, now, once the stability is under control, the next, there are many, many other The next, there are many, many other problems motivated by astrophysics, like the self-force problem and black hole scattering and so on, and also many problems related to scattering on black holes that are still not solved. And so I think there's a huge, basically a huge feel that's opening up. opening up due to the due to the so or which will be opened up due to the solution of the black hole stability problem that's only like a you know small warm-up problem in some sense can i complement the question we have time you're muted uh so we have sometimes still say like uh three four minutes Like three, four minutes, yeah. So, just coming back to this integrability thing. Um, so if I think naively in an integrable system, uh, so the fact that you have an infinite number of conserved quantities, uh this plays a role in protecting the system, not doing crazy things, so to speak. So, in that context, uh, I'm trying to make a link with it.
