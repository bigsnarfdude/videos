And so, as we learned this week, mathematicians are storytellers, so I present the story today. This is based on a joint work that we recently finished with Arata Comio, Frank, and Masaiko Saito. And it's about canonical coordinates for mobilized bases of irregular connections on curves in rank two. So we have heard in many talks that actually the kind of canonical data coordinates are very important for many of the topics of this workshop. Mainly they are needed to find tau functions and they are also needed to kind of other other things of this workshop. Themes of this workshop. And so I would like to show you how to find algebraically such command of ordinates and mobile spaces. Okay, so first, this is just the outline. So I will start by a short introduction, settling up the stage. Then I will The stage, then I will come to assigning a certain normal form to any operator for regular connection of rank 2 with certain irregular behavior at the features that I will fix. And then I will turn my attention to the symptomic structure of the normalized cases and basically. And basically, the main point of my talk is to show you that we get canonical coordinates, we get diagonal coordinates on the Moonlight space of connections this time. And well, depending on time, I will maybe show you a very concrete example where everything can be that And can be specifically. But of course, I'm aware that maybe more people to get there, or we'll have to rush through it. And then I will finish by some open questions or further directions to study. Okay, so let me start by some general kind of motivation or background for this study. So essentially So essentially, well, one could start this story from many different directions. And one very natural direction is that of isomorphismations. So they arose early in the 20th century as some natural framework actually to get new transcendental functions. As was studied by Pelvi and others, and there's a list here, Penvi Vani and With Annie and Zinger, etc. And then around the 80s, it was the interest was revived by Gubrovin, Stadojimo Daweno, and so on and so on. So this is a very old topic. And essentially, it was realized very early on that actually to study, for instance, primary equations, it is a very natural framework to study. Framework to study isomorphic problems of irregular connections. So that's one motivation for what I'm doing. And also another motivation comes from kind of a study of sheaves on surfaces, which has been done by many people, starting with Mikai and then Ron Donaghy and the R Mark one. Well also known on this topic and I know many others. I may omit many important contributors. Sorry about that. And so, well I hope that during the talk you will realize the resemblance to sheaves on surfaces, but it has been also already pointed out by several speakers in this workshop, for instance by Poloja, the end of his For instance, by Bologna, at the end of his talk, one can basically pick G points on a surface and then one gets a unique spectral curve through it. So that kind of an argument is very relevant to what I will present. And it's also very closely related to separation of variables for the teaching system, which is another old topic in integral systems that dates back to the system. Systems that dates back to Political Skillion. And there was the seminal work of Borgia Norseman and Ramana in the framework of Xmandels, which has been explained by several authors this week. And there are many other contributors to this story. I would like to emphasize the contribution of Bibliography and Manzokov. Because much of what we are doing has been carried out by them as a generic framework of CP1. For instance, here we take the genus G curve. So it's our work is kind of a generalization of the work to arbitrary curves. And okay, some another topic that is quite relevant to what I present is that of operas. Those of you who have already come to Lopers will realize that that's very much what I'm doing here. This was developed by Nick Kaz, even though he didn't introduce this notion of OPER. The notion of OPER was gained by Berlins on Albert Grinfeld, but of course this is also a very classical topic because OPER stands for essentially for differential operators. For differential operators, so higher-order scalar differential operators. It goes back to the work of Foots, essentially. Okay, and then there are further... Nick Katz, what the Nick Katz was working on that? Ah, so I will show very soon that actually he gave an argument showing that every connection, maybe logarithmic connection on a curve. Loganic connection on a curve can be on the Zadiskioten set can be represented as an oper as a scalar differential equation of higher degree and by choosing what is called a cyclic vector. So cyclic vector gives one an open, but the point is that it only holds over Zariski openers. So that's I see. Yeah, so that's where you will realize this Zariski Open substance. You will realize this is the risk-looking subset in a second, this talk, but it's very related to ideas. And there are many other interesting related areas. So, for instance, one can actually allow some of the architects to collide and form higher levels than previously. That is called Confluence, has been studied, for instance by Ryan Hatto Polo and Plimash, many others. So like PMASH, many others. And of course mirror symmetry and cluster algebras are very much involved in this study or related study. Essentially in local ABI surfaces, one essentially does very similar operations to what I'll do here. Okay. Um okay. The relationship to cluster algebras is uh maybe not so immediate, so maybe some of you may uh uh point it out somewhere in the talk or think about it later on. So this was kind of general motivational background and now let me just so this all sounds very uh a lot of material, but I will just in my talk I will just focus on some very simple uh setup where I ha I will possibly Setup where I would possibly rank two irregular singular connections. So R is 2 and we take GL2C, so generally we are blue. And H, we know the standard cut. H0 is its regular part, so I basically don't allow the two area values to coincide. And e each each time you see a theta in the talk, you will see many of them. You will see many of them. They are elements of GI to C, and they have two angle values, one and by plus and minus. And then there will be many subscripts. Because for irregular symbols, one means more. Use many subscripts. One of the set of subscripts is a finite set which capital I which stands for essentially it will label the uh irregular singular point. Irregular singular points connections that we consider. And then some further notations. The notion of an irregular curve was introduced by Him Bolsch. And so what is it? So one fixes a smooth projective curve of some genus. One may actually even vary that, but let us assume that. Very bad, but let us assume that it's fixed in this talk. And then one fixes an effective divisor on the curve, which is not necessarily reduced. So I allow some positive matrix Mi. So in the case when Mi is equal to 1, we call that point the logarithmic point. Otherwise, it is the irregular point. Okay, and we, well, I mean, usual notions, we pick local. Usual motions, we pick a local coordinate chart center at Ti, we denote it by Zi. And then at every such point, Ti, we consider an irregular part, so an Mi minus one tuple of matrices, elements of the carton, so diagonal matrices. The point is that the first The point is that the first one, or the ma the one with label minus i m i must be irregular, that's all. And in addition, we fix also for each point I, we fix one more element of the carton which will serve as a residue, essentially. So this is the theta sub I here, you know the irregular part of the connection. of the connection and the just theta minus one theta i minus one denotes the recipe in a second you will see this and then there are some natural assumptions that I want to impose here first of all that there are not too few points this assumption is it almost always holds and then there is the residue theorem which tells us that basically Theorem which tells us that basically the sum of the traces of these residue matrices must be equal to negative 2g minus 1. I will work over a vector bundle of degree 2g minus 1. And then, okay, just for ease, I will actually also assume some irrelevant signal condition that essentially this will imply that there are no sub-objects at all, that actually the none of Uh that the actually the none of the eigenvalues, if if I add the eigenvalues of theta i as the residues, uh I I may choose them arbitrarily a plus or a minus one at every point and I don't want to get any integer. That basically implies that everything is irreducible, so I don't have any issue with stability or anything like that. And then there is an additional non-resonance condition. Additional non-resonance condition that I have to impose for all logarithmic points. I even assume that these eigenvalues of the residue don't differ by an integer. Okay, so this was the notion of a meromorphic, sorry, an irregular curve, and now for the notion of a meromorphic connection line or an irregular curve with residues, very simple motion. After all, this After all, this preparation is just a holomorphic rank to vector of this degree, and then metamorphic connections with something that satisfies Leibniz's rule essentially. But it may have poles that are bounded from above by capital D. And again, this is irreducible by the assumptions that I have made. And the very important condition is this one that actually. Condition is this one that actually so up to so the polar part essentially of Nabla with respect to some trivialization must be given exactly by this form. So here we have the matrices that we fixed for the regular curve play the roles of coefficients in the expansion, the Lohran expansion. So I fix essentially the I fix essentially the polar part of my problem. Okay, and then one can consider a model I problem of such objects once that I listed up to engage transformation. There's a natural gauge compacting on this. And this moduli space has been constructed first architectural in 2004 by means of gauge theorem. or by means of gauge theoretical methods and then by NABA side or certainly using GIT methods. So there are two two constructions so it really exists and okay so let me so the okay so again point of my talk is to introduce uh Darby coordinates for M Duram, this DRAM mono aspects with these all these uh irregular simulations. Irregular signal elements. Okay? For that purpose, I will first show you that it is somehow possible to reduce every such connection to a canonical companion normal form. So every such object has a canonical representation. That's what I will show you next. And what is the the main idea? What is the main idea? This is the idea of a cyclic vector. So essentially, we would like to represent, as I said, every connection by some scalar neural differential equation. And it's possible just over some zeroscopes. So, how does this go? According to Riemann Roche, it's easy to see that the generic E of the G minus 1 has one-dimensional. Has one-dimensional space of core section. So let us pick generator of H0CE and then we may take this E1, this generator, or this H0 and then apply the connection to it. Then naturally one gets or maybe something. So we have O gets mapped in E, then my mobile maps E to E tensor with omega 1 C T and this can be actually a factor by the quotient And this composition now is actually C all linear. So call this K5 album. This is all linear and so right and so essentially this whole setup shows that actually we have an X actually we have an extension of of omega one C the inverse over the regular sheaf and okay now one realizes that actually every such extension states that's just an observation based on degree so actually we have what we have is that actually these Is that actually we have a subsheaf that is generated by E1 and its image under the connection? And then these two vectors essentially define a splitting of a sub-sheaf. Point doesn't define a splitting of the the entire sheaf E, it's just a non-saturated uh maximal rank. maximal rank subshift. So it's a rank two subshift, but it is not exactly put in it's it's denoted by E zero. And question at this point? Essentially I'm just doing a very very simple thing. I take E1 and I apply the connection to it. Point is that I don't get all of a capital E, I just get a subshik. Get a subsheaf. That subsheaf will be denoted by ECO and it can be shown that it's isomorphic to this direct sum. Yes, a direct sum. And you can consider then essentially the restriction of the connection to E0 is VC sub 0 and it will be still a metamorphic connection. Correction. It will have poles there where the original connection will have poles, but in addition to have further single points that I know by capital P. They are called the apparent singularities of this Tapla. And okay, a trivial computation shows that essentially the length of this B is just 4G minus 3 per second. And it will And you will turn out in a second that this is exactly half the dimension of the space. Every dimension is a complex dimension. So we actually, so we learned, so this construction already gives us a bunch of nice coordinates which are commonly defined, namely half as many as we want. Namely, half as many as we want. So they will form natural, I mean, they will form the Q coordinates of a natural coordinate system of the moduli space. So from now on I will assume some genericity assumptions, namely I want that this apparent singularity divisor B should be reduced and disjoint. Should be reduced and disjoint from the uh the actual uh irregular balls D. And I will denote these points by q1 to qn, capital N, and of course they are only defined to order me, so it's more a subset than or it's a divisor essentially. It's not not naturally ordered. Okay, and then uh with this, yes, sorry, can you please not like a It's very please just not like in the importance of taking Otherwise uh otherwise you don't you you may have uh many cyclic vectors or none at all. So that's the only degree where you have a single such a cyclic vector. Very good question. It's very important. That is the nature of degree coefficient. But of course, okay, there's a a more A more kind of sophisticated answer to this is that actually it is possible to change between various moduli species of the same parity in the rank case just by tensoring by some abelian irregular connection. And then one gets one identifies essentially at least the least open subsets of one by space. Of mobile spaces of same parity. So the crucial point here is that I want odd degree and then I can just tensor with a suitable line bundle to get degree 2G minus 1, which most convenient for me. N has to be also all in this case. N has to be also S. N which N uh wait. We chan uh wait. I don't think oh no, I don't think so, it's just I mean this is you mean that this number is not necessarily even, it's just because it has the mot dimensionalized space. So in the example that I will show In the example that I will show, capital N will be 3. Oh, sorry, yeah, sorry. No, that doesn't mean it's sorry. So the yeah, 2 capital N, so 8G minus 6 plus 2n is the dimension of the RAM state. Okay, so so far so good. So the point is that actually with respect to this frame, E1 and nabla 0, E1, essentially nabla 0 can be written in the form of form that it's In the form of form, and it's uh first common is just uh uh the image of P1, so that's just P and one, essentially, with respect to this basis, and then something and something, so beta and delta. Delta must be actually a connection because it is on the diagonal, so it cannot just be a it must transform as a connection. Actually, delta is the trace connection of Mabel. Mabla or Mabla zero each other and okay but beta beta is on the upper right entry and it is a metamorphic quadratic form and its how to say its poles are bounded from above by 2d plus 1 times p and well what is this one that I had here is just One that I had here is just the identity map from omega 1 C E D inverse omega 1 C D. Good. And then what do we know about these deltas and P tas? Delta must be a connection, as I already said, and it has its polar part over the irregular device or is determined by the irregular curve as it used. Curve residues. We have no choice for the irregular part or the polar part of delta over D. But theta also has poles over the apparent similarities and they are logarithmic and the residue must be equal to plus one. And essentially these two conditions are the only conditions that we a priori that we know about delta. So About data. So data is a torso over H, the set of all data is a torso over H0 or affine space over H0 C omega 1 C. So essentially to choose data we can select from essentially G dimensional complex G dimensional family. So delta is Let's so delta is the easy part. Quadratic differential is a bit more complicated, but let's look at what it looks like. So at the irregular poles, beta must have a pole of order at most 2 mi, and it has some certain Lauren expansion. And it turns out that we can control the irregular curve controls or determine. Curve controls or determines these coefficients from minus 2mi all the way to minus 2, but not minus 1 further on. I'm no longer determined by irregular curves. Irregular yes. Those are three parameters essentially. Everything that follows here. So these are uniquely determined by the irregular residues, but not the rest. And that the irreg And at the irre at the at parent singularities, the everything is a free parameter essentially. But we want to take this Lorentz expansion and we want to take the residue part and want to take this guy, the coefficient of this well, essentially the residue. We want to promote it to dual coordinates. Coordinates in the Mockwai space. It's a free coordinate with beta j minus three, but we promote it now to double conjugate coordinates to Qj's. And that's the main idea. Unfortunately, it's a little bit more involved than this, but I will show you why it's more more more involved than this. But essentially, I will Essentially, I will set zeta j dz j to be the residue at the apparent singleton source of beta. And I would really like to say that it's the conjugate variable to Qj and it's true up to a twist that I will introduce a little bit later on. But so, to sum up, actually, the residue at the apparent simulation. You at the apparent similarity points look like this. First column 0, second column 1, and zeta j, zeta j. So this can be thought of as actually in E2 an E at Q J. This is a line and we have we consider well it's a sorry, it's a plane and we consider this. And we consider this y such a j something called quasi-prographic structure at the point qj. Okay, so that's the geometric kind of way of understanding these parameters zeta j, dzj. But now, so first Now, so first of all, there are there are two questions actually to study at this point. So I kind of haven't stated anything yet, but I'm kind of hinting at the fact that Q j's and zeta j's, zeta j, these are j's, will form a coordinate chart for wide space of irregular connections. And then one needs to study, there are two very interesting questions, whether this Are two very interesting questions whether this is really kind of irrational morphism, so whether Qj's, Zephyj, Zj's are really determined and also determine the irregular connection. So that's birationality question. And also there's the question of whether this map is symplectic for the nature of symplectic structures. These are the two questions that I would like to discuss now. Questions that I would like to discuss now. So, first, I would like to discuss the fact that this is a directional morphism. So, here is the proposition. First of all, this bold D is just the total space of the line bundle, the twisted canonical line bundle. So, this is a surface. It's a rude surface. Root surface, well, essentially it's a root surface. And now, okay, the parameters zeta qj, zetaj, dzj live actually, all live in this total space, right? By the very construction. But so I pick m of them in the symmetric product of this surface. So, surface is two-dimensional. I take capital N's symmetric products, it's a two-m. Symmetric words, it's a 2n-dimensional variety. And I claim that if I fix any such data, then there exists a unique beta, unique logarithmic connection beta, such that nabla 0 gives rise to a connection on the fixed direct curve, such that the nabla 0 has apparent similarities exactly at this point. Balancing varieties exactly at these points, such that delta has residues plus one and b, and also that the residue at qj of the quadratic differential is exactly what we want. So this is kind of can be solved as a birational statement. And I would like to say a few words about the first first why so first Why, so first, okay, let's do a dimension now. Why this is possible at all is because we have so essentially beta choices of possible betas with the right residue is a torso affine space over these quadratic differentials with poles at capital D. So there are. So there are 3G minus 3 plus M three parameters, and then there are G three parameters for delta. All in all, we have 4G minus 3 plus M three parameters, and we have this is exactly capital M and we have the same amount of conditions. The conditions are that the QJ must be apparent, so it's possible to remove them to pass back to NABLA so that NABLA has no pole. Nabla has no pole. Because Nabla initially didn't have a pole at these points. So when I want to construct a Nabla out of this tambourine zero, I don't want to get a pole there. So those are linear conditions actually. And then we can just write what these equations are. Very interestingly, the equation of epidemic singularity is something like saying that some like saying that something like somehow this one zeta j lies on the spectra of the earth at the point because this equation beta is the determinant essentially beta is the trace so this here is just the characteristic polynomial of of uh polynomial of of the companion model four. So Modern form. So, well, and then we made that. I mean, this is kind of classical algebra geometry that one can actually expand betas and deltas in terms of some bases and then form some huge linear term, and then it's possible to solve it. Essentially, that's that's all. So, I don't it's not the argument itself is not so It's not the argument itself is not so interesting. What is interesting for me is that the condition is precisely such a spectra of function. Okay. So now I will pass to studying the syntactic structure. Actually, there are two syntactic structures that I will study. And so I would like to very much say that Zeta and Zeta and Qj and Zetaj form canonical conjugate coordinates for the run modelized space, but it's not true. Now I will show you how to make this true. Essentially, zeta j would be the good choice for the moduli space of Higgs binaries. But now we are considering moduli space of connections, so difference between Higgs binary and connections. Difference between Higgs bundle and a connection is that basically Higgs bundle is something like all linear, and connections form an affine or are sections of an affine bundle over endomorphisms. So to get to to get to natural twist, to get to uh right uh definition, one needs definition one needs to add a kind of twist to the how to say to the already at the level of of omega one the cotangent shift cotangent shift one needs to actually so there's this very natural notion that one has some a vector space and maybe in a bigger vector space and then In a bigger vector space, and then one can consider some translated versions of B, and that they are affine spaces. So, this is what I'm going to do, but in a bundle now. So, okay, so first of all, how do we need to twist this whole story? It's because the fact is that actually we need to take into account a condition. Actually, we need to take into account the connection data essentially, connection on kind of degree 2G minus 1 vector bundle. So let us take the determinant of E. It carries a trace connection from MABLA and that will be naturally a section of some twisted version of the Version of the NMO, of the gisted contingent, for example. So, how does this go? So, first of all, let C sub D denote the first joint class of E, but that that is that lives naturally in H two of C, of course, because it's C. We that's that's also X one of D C over all C. T C over all C. So actually this C D gives rise to such an extension of sheaves, a non-split extension of invertible sheaves on the surface. And then, okay, in T C we may, because actually we have to work with things that are singular at irregular singular at the divisor D. So it's nature to take a PC tensor. To take a T C tensor with negative D and take its pullback under this map, then we get something called AC C D D. This is what is often called a TR3 algebraid. We've seen it in some talks before. And okay, so the point is that now I have this I have this extra direction O I just added it add in it and then I have this D secretly my somehow my omega one C D and then I want to twist it I want to kind of shift it by something translate it by something and the way to do that is to consider omega so the set of covectors whose pairing with the canonical section of all is equal to one. Is equal to 1. So if I had 0 here, then I would have just the vector subspace. Now I put the 1 here, I have this fine subspace. Probably it's possible to put h-bar here and get something related to this. Now I would like to introduce Daddy coordinates. So essentially Ah, essentially, uh so as as soon as one fixes uh one vector V or W but for me W will be essentially the trace of maplam intuitively then essentially there is a there is enough an isomorphism between these two surfaces that goes like this to Q P, we met to Q P plus trace of mapping. And let me call And let me call that Qp tilde because it's already shifted. And then this surface has a natural symplectic form, which is just dp tilde of HDQ tilde. It's the same argument as for the Liouville form on the on the node, this need the cotangent sheaf. Okay, and then Okay, and then well, okay, for now let me do some terminology. P tilde j, which is the residue of q j, the residue at q j of beta. So this is just what I used to call zeta j, essentially. But now I have to add to it trace of nabla q j. So this will be called the accessory parameter at q j. And and this will be the conjugate. And this will be the conjugate parameter, the diaphragm conjugate parameter. And it's called accessory parameter and the tuple qj pj tilde will be called canonical coordinates or target coordinates. Okay, and now I would like to at least state the main theorem is that basically say I don't like this slide so much. So this is just that actually I need to restrict to some open subsets where I take into account all the non-degeneracy assumptions that I have made. All the points are disjoint from each other, etc. And okay, so I think. And uh okay, so I do on both sides of the symmetric uh symmetric uh product of this twisted uh total space contangent sheaf and also on the side of the moduli space. I do I restrict them to some suitables that is subsets over which all the construction goes through and then I get a natural coordinate map and Natural coordinate map F for F stands for F and which maps essentially E nabla from the modelized space to the symmetric power and of course again suitable Miltzariski subsets and E nabla gets mapped to Q J. This is the natural map that I have introduced now and the point is that this is symplectic. So ah yeah first Ah, yeah, first, again, we need to show that this map is irrational and proof is just as for Zeta J, except that here there's a tricky point. Maybe you understand this point, some of you understand this point better than me, is that kind of this spectral curve equation no longer lives in a just tension shift, but in a twisted coaching tension. Maybe this is related to spectral. Maybe this is related to spectral curves. I don't have this. But the same equation uh gives it and then we can show that it's a independent uh system. And uh yeah. So this is just directionality, just as previously. And now there is a natural symplectic form that I haven't yet told, but aren't on the on the side of the Duran mobile space. It is a homogeneous. Space. It is a holomorphic symplectic manifold of this dimension, h minus 6 plus 2m. And I will denote by capital omega during its omega 4. And of course, on the symmetric product of the surface, the surface is symplectic, solids, and symmetric. We also have a natural symplectic form, which looks like this. looks like this. And the uh theorem is that the map that I just previous slide uh is uh polymorphic symplectic for these uh these two structures. There are two major structures. One of them is just product of the structure on surface, contangent shift. The other one is given by by has a long has a long history, actually. Atia and Both defined it very rigorously, but also an earlier paper of Marasimon already it appeared. And then it is essentially the same as the Poisson structure, okay, the Poisson structure, uh the symptomatic fields of the Poisson structure of what touching a map similar structures, etcetera. Bulge defined it, uh Bolt defined it in Bolt value in the case of irregular singularities. Okay, so I didn't tell you what omega the Ram is, I told you what lowercase omega is, and I told you the theorem is that this is a syntactic isomorphism, and maybe now I would like to at least show a little bit what the omega duram is. How is it defined? I'm not going to give much details of the proof of this theorem, but at least I would like to show you what the syntactic form is, the nature of the symplectic form of the theorem alloy space. For that, first one needs to define the tangent space of the OI space, and then one needs to define a pairing of the tangent space. Tangent space. Tangent space can be defined in terms of lines similar to what we see in Marina's talk, for instance, but except that here we have higher order poles. So essentially we must take a look at endomorphisms that whose MI jet preserve uh the eigen line. LI is one of the two eigen lines, maybe the Tita I plus. Maybe the theta i plus, for instance. So we want endomorphism S to preserve this line up to order MI, not just evaluation, but up to up to one, order strategy one. And we have similarly an F1 and then essentially we get so this F0 is essentially F0 is essentially uh consists essentially of uh this is the analogue of nilpotent endomorphisms and F1 is the analogue of parabolic endomorphisms, more or less and then we get a deformation complex which reads like this and so it's the usual thing that we often have in plant tree and the tangent specific. The tangent space of the moduli space is the first hyperchoomology of this complex. That's the complex. Now we know what the tangent space is. Now we have to induce two form or an anti-symmetric pairing on it. Anti-symmetric pairing can be defined as follows. Well, it has a there is an explicit form to it. So for H1, first hyperconfigure. So H1, first hypercommology, can be of a two-term complex, can be thought of as couples. Couples. Here, nu alpha beta stands for a monto cycle in F0. V alpha is a zero cocycle in F1. Czecho cycle, and I take two such objects and I have to come up with something. To come up with something, the something will live in a second hyperchomology of omega C maps to all C maps to omega 1 C, which is isomorphic to C. And second, so I need to come up with a second hyper homology class. So it will consist of well, it will have a three a three no a two uh check uh a two chat uh chain uh as first component and uh a one check chain as a second component. And of course there are all these check complete conditions that I don't want to write on all this. Probably have seen this. So so this is the uh the run uh morphism essentially from uh Essentially, from the tangent base space, the tangent space we map to C. This will be a pairing. It turns out, of course, this is anti-symmetric and then it can be shown that it's non-degenerate and opposed. Okay, and then the only thing I would like to say about the proof of theorem is that we take such record chains. Take such coaches, but we represent them by some Meromorphic co-boundaries and then we use lessons. Very uses very classical tools. Okay, that's all I want to say. Now maybe I have a few more minutes. Are there any questions so far? Oh, okay, so maybe may I move on for a few minutes? I think I still have five minutes. So, just to show you an example where this can be worked out, like very made very specific. It's over an elliptic curve. So, this point maybe I need to go a little bit so I think. So I take elliptic curve in this luvial form and then so it is branched over four points 0, 1 it's represented as a branch double cover of CP1, four branch points, 0, 1, lambda, infinity and then I take some point t so these are the branch points. So these are the trench points, 0, 1, infinity. And then I take point T this is this is C P 1. This is the analytic curve, of course. And if I take T and T does not agree with any of these four points, and it's giving these two disjoint points, then I have a situation with I have a situation with elliptic curves with two logo elliptic arctures, but it is also possible to study the situation what happens when T converges to one of these points. Then I will just have one such puncture, but with the matrix CT2s, then I get an irregular situation. So in this example, Uh so in this example both are studied both of these uh situations are studied uh okay and uh well okay I mean we get some natural natural parameterization of the connection matrix forms by some parameters zeta here is the zeta Deta here is the detaj that appeared at the very beginning of the talk, and then A on A2, A3, A4, and B1, B2, B307 parameters. And essentially they account for all the freedom here in this problem, but we have to impose certain conditions on them, basically, that this problem. This uh problem. Oh, sorry. We are too far on the first page. Um I have good. So all in all, yeah, what I wanted to say, like R, capital M is equal to 3 in this example. So this is a complex six-dimensional space. Complex six-dimensional space. So we accept. Dimensional space, so we accept we expect kind of three q j's somewhere. And then of course you also expect to have the conjugate conjugate coordinates. And well okay, there are some, there is a natural matrix form for this nabla, and then so. And then uh sorry I so here uh in the logarithmic case we need actually to fix um we need we need to fix uh complex numbers at the first uh so T one is one of these sorry T one is one of these points and T two is the other uh point and we need to fix some uh data. Some data both of these, theta1 plus minus, theta2 plus minus, and then we want to impose that the eigenvalues of the residue at theta1 should have eigenvalues theta1 plus, theta1 minus, and the same thing for t2. So essentially, we impose four conditions on the seventh parameter, a1, a2, a3, a4. We are left with. We are left with three parameters, so that's what we want to get. And okay, then it's there's a unique way to as soon as one fix the old zeta j's, there's a unique way to find A1, A2, B1, B2, these guys in the expansion. So these ones here, these ones are uniquely determined by the irregular curve. Three parameters will be A3, A4. Three parameters will be A3, A4, and E3. Point is that it can be very worked out very explicitly. But another interesting feature is that the same kind of description essentially remains valid when we let these two points coincide into just one point of irregular one irregular similarity of point array. Similarity of point array around one, and so we get a completely parallel description in both cases. So, the point is that with this approach, it's possible to study both the logarithmic case and the irregular singular case simultaneously, in parallel. So, that's what I want to point out here. I don't want to get into the details, time is running quickly. Essentially, let me Actually, let me just come to the question session. Of course, it would be very natural to extend everything over the divisors. So, well, I imposed some genericity condition on the apparent singularities. It would be natural to remove them. So, to allow two of these QJs to collide or Or for one of them to converge into one of the irregular singularities, that would be very interesting to understand. And then, of course, to generalize this to higher rank, we have an ongoing joint work with Masai Kosaito, where we kind of have the details of a similar construction, but of course, some things are a little bit more complicated. For instance, the normal form is not. Normal form is not as simple as here. And then there is, of course, also the corresponding Hitching moduli space, the Higgs bundle, the Dorbo moduli space, where there is a... Some people have studied this. So I wrote an article in 2017, but it was based on some paper of Montevich and Sorbana from 2017. Surbama from 2015, where they essentially sketched the ideas of similar construction for irregular similar situations. And we have a ongoing joint work with Ibrani, Bisvas, Marina, Oares, and Anna Peonieto on the same topic. So essentially this description of mobile space of Description of mobile space of irregular Instagram laws with some extra decorations sometimes. And finally, uh a thing that uh this may apply very well to is the isomorphations. So we haven't done any work on isomorphism yet, but uh we hope that this approach may be uh useful to studying the isomorphism equations. Alright, so I think uh I think I will stop here and I will thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Any further questions? I do believe that if you consider give us fewer points of this bundle, some locations may actually Patience lay up, but then also your capital N is very large, then apparently, whatever you call the spectral curve would be uniquely determined. So, in some sense, a big bundle of picture may be appearing over there. So, very thanks, very good question. So, probably indeed when we actually remove these generic CT conditions, then we will get a point nominal in symmetric spacebar. No longer in the symmetric space, but its resolution, which is the Hilbert scheme, with capital N points on this twisted surface. We have some indications, we have some partial results that are already proven in this direction, and it would be very interesting to understand this thing. Then when Keptane is large enough, it should sit on a spectral curve. So spectral curve would be probably negative. Spectro Cohen, you probably need as well. Which description will be. Well, somehow geometrically, yes, I agree completely. It's just uh yes. So I think you don't even need to take capital N very large, just R capital N does exactly the job that you mentioned. Yes, so there are okay, this is intuition coming from the Higgs side. From the Higgsman Boe side, that as soon as you fix this number of points on the surface in general equation, then they realize it exists a unique spectral curve that you have. But very interestingly, I had a remark on this, but I didn't really mention it in the talk in this this remark here, very button. So there always exists some special choices. Exist some special choices such that the determinant vanishes. This means that there always exists capital and purpose of points to which there exists no spectral curve. Some discriminant variety, there is some indiscriminate variety within the realbel scheme, essentially of symmetric product over which there exists no. And then there are within this is a discriminant This is the discrete divisor, and then there is another discrete divisor which intersects this. And on the intersection, intersection is two-dimensional two. On the intersection, we have not a unique divisor, but a one-parameter family of curves. So it's some kind of so the point is that maybe with this approach one can say something very precise also. Something very precise also about the independency locus and the image of the map from the RAM space to Gyova skim. Something like that. Questions? Okay, well that's thank you. Okay, well that's thank you. Before we street, as the last speaker, I have the honour to thank the pleasure to thank the organizers, Motoitbo, Mlase, and others, Elva and Alex, and Laura and Olivia. and Olivia. And I think that since the organization went very well, I think that they deserve our hands. I'd like to thank all of you, and then I have to apologize that uh I wasn't a hundred percent, so I had to listen to most of your talks uh uh on bed. On bed. It's a very high figure, but all that talks are fantastic. And then I wanted to ask any questions, but I live stream doesn't allow me to say anything. And then also I have passed apologize. I couldn't organize the discussion as I ran, but I hope you let the group behind yourselves. Thank you so much for coming. Okay, so I think we have a coffee break now. And that's it. And that says, yeah, if you I think you have to leave your time
