Thanks very much, organizers, for inviting me to give a good talk. Thanks to all of you guys for coming out and just give me talk about Glectrist. I'm on my coffee. Yeah, so the title of the talk is Doubling Belectists. This is a joint with Dave and Hannah, who are both here. So if you have any really hard questions, you just direct them to them. That'll be good. Yeah, so. Yeah, so I want to tell you about a theorem. I'm going to take a sort of a leap out of Michael Foot's book and give you sort of a very impressionistic talk. Just give me a little bit of a story. I'm going to give you a theorem, sort of maybe some ideas. So this is a story about blood twists, about homotopy spheres. Normally sort of the way those stories go is that somebody introduces a bunch of homotopy spheres, and then sometime later on, somebody standardizes. You know, later on, somebody standardizes some of them. Somebody introduces some more, you standardize a few more. And maybe that goes on forever. Maybe it doesn't. I don't know. I'll not count. But this is a story about standardization. So, luck twists. Where does this particular story start? It starts with the theorem of luck, which very succinctly says the following. Three copies of Z1. That's it. Not orientation preserving, anything like that. Two of these are not very interesting. I zero? Yeah, sure. Good call. Good call. More important things in that. Yeah, so two of these were. Yeah, so two of these are reflections. Loose that. Oh, that's okay. What's okay? Red okay? Yellow. Red's okay. Yellow is okay. Okay. Yellow? Lamb's okay? That's bad. Red's kind of big. Red's kinda okay. Maybe not red. Greens? Green is surprisingly big. Green's pretty good. Green's green. Alright. These are reflections. That's good. Hi. Okay. So certainly I can swap across an S1 factor or an S2. That'd be fine. But the interesting one is this like Twistmat, Joe Wolfram, right? If you want to write it in coordinates, you can write it out like this. So the twist of a point, let's say theta, comma, x, theta's on the circle, x is on the two-sphere. I'll leave the circle direction alone, and I'll rotate by this. So I have to do this every time I give a talk like this. Here's your copy of SM across this tube. As you go around, you rotate the two servo and the line. Really, this is coming to you from Coming to you from it's the non-tribute element in pi 1 also 3. So this makes sense in lots of places. Sometimes these get called sphere twists. Really, I don't need a circle's worth of two spheres. An interval would have been fine. It can make sense of a sphere twist. Really, any embedded two-sphere in two manifolds would be fine. And it's kind of a screw twist. Screen twist. I'll call it a block twist and I'll always pull it this down every time. Yeah, so I mean as an aside, which again is something that I've never thought of, but maybe it might sort of be surprising, tells you that two knots are not determined by their exterior. I can take a two-naught, remove it, and I could put it back in, and maybe if I got S4 back. And maybe if I got S4 back, I could come up with an actually new sphere. Okay, so two naughts. People always think of it this way, but two knots might not be determined. I think this is a paper of Gordon. I forget the year, I think there's just by knots. I forget the year. I think there's just by knots where this actually does happen. But, okay. Just like dancer surgery on knots, you can do surgery on spheres. And this is how you do it. So just to make things clear, this is the glove choice. So suppose you have smoothly embedded two sphere and the four sphere. We need everything smooth. The clock twist is, well, it's sort of the only non-trivial surgery I can really do on that screen. Clock twist S. I'll always write it as sigma sub s. That's what I get by removing an irrigative sphere, gluing it in fact in like this. Gluing it at the back thing. This makes sense anytime you have a trivial normal bundle. As long as the neighborhood looks like S2 pressed D2, you can do this. It makes perfect sense. But we'll only care about electric and S4. So interesting and relevant and important. Interesting and relevant important fact. These manifolds are homochopic force spheres. We all know this. How do you sort of guess that you would prove such a thing? Well, first of all, I mean, that regluing map is the identity on pi 1 on the boundary. It's really not doing anything. This map really does, it fixes a circle. This map really does, it fixes a circle. So it's plausible that you could do a van camping thing, check that what you've built is still simply connected. Okay, do a little bit better. Check that the homology is trivial. But now your four manifolds, actually, all of your homology vanishes. But now you're simply connected to the molecule sphere. Some version of Ethereum of Whitehead tells you you're all basically how this goes. That was a 20-second summary. It was a 20-second summary of paper form. Okay, and you can do even better by free then what you built this homeomorphic. Okay, that's the story. Those are the manifolds we want to think about. I think this is a conference on four and a half dimensional topology. People are pretty familiar. But that's the story. Okay, so question. Presumably very hard. They're homeomorphic, are they always diffeomorphic? Lots of people have thought about this. The answer is sometimes. So I think, let me give you a list of all of the instances where I know, at least, that neglect twister stack. I think that will be useful. It's a surprisingly. It's a surprisingly shortlist. So the standard man SSP This is actually Hinblock's original paper. I talked about this on Monday, but I'll briefly remind you, because I'll go really slow. Then I'm KKX and Minus K balance this really nice slice disc that you get by spinning. How's it orange, actually? Okay, we're just good. Alright. Very correct. Knex to minus k balance is this very nice slice disc. I think I called it DK. You can glue two of those together, and you get the spun knot. Leg twist the spun knot to stand. Okay, great. Scroll a little bit further. Roll the deformation setting. Is there any sort of self-concordance you want here? Talked about this, I talked about this on Monday. Any self-concordance will be fine. We'll give you a two-naught. You probably don't want to use every self-concordance. Maybe just a nice token would be fine. Put a trace in it. A nice token that you find. Put a trace in there. Here's one that's nice. Here's two spins. I'll describe to you the trace of the self-isotopy of kinaxm minus k. What am I going to do? I'll rotate once I'm out. I can rotate that, I mean, once through 360 degrees to get a perfectly good self-isotopy. I can do that as many times as I can. Isotopy. I can do that as many times as I want. I get the M-twisp. Okay, so blood twist of those things are standard. So this is Gordon in 76, I think. And I think independently by power in 78. Okay, so far so good. The roll spins. Very similar. I'm going to give you a self-isotopy. I said this on Monday. Take one of your summons, set it for a loop. Until it gets back to where it started. Okay, you can do that as many times as you want. Times as you want. There's of course a question of framing here. How am I rotating as I do this rolling? So maybe it makes sense to think about the twisting and spinning all at once. We know surprisingly little about what twists of roll spawn knots. So if it's a, let's say an amethyst, Rest and rule. We know this is standard when the knot has a knotting number one. And that's almost all. And the unotting number is one. And that's Hannah and myself. So that's sort of like some sort. So that sort of like some sort of complexity assumption, unlike just somehow, even though you've got lots of stuff happening, if this disk is somehow nice enough, then maybe you can say something. We actually, I'm lying slightly, we do know more cases where Lego actors is standard. Those are the cases when you roll spin up torus now. The example you gave previously, if you take a connect sum of three or more dots, Of three or more knots, there's the words in the purebrain group for how you pull one knot through the other, describe sort of what you do. Yeah, that hasn't been investigated. I don't think we know anything like that. So yeah, I mean, these are good questions. I mean, you can certainly generate some sort of concordance here. I would ask, I mean, you would need a disk on the top left left if you want to sort of build it like that, build it. But that's that's a good question. These sort of like symmetry spinning things. Taurus knot. I thought the roles one of the torus knot was already a twist. Yeah, yeah, so it is. That's the three. Yeah, I'm just being redundant. The reason we know that the standard is because they are twist pens. That's what you told us the other time. Yeah. So these are. Period. Good. Okay. Maybe that's due to Lithuan. What other cases do we know? If s is ribbon, more generally zero coordinate to the unknown. And we know this. This is Melvin in his thesis. What other things do we notice? Ribbon, what ribbon applies to anything that Melvin connects to the investment process too? So ribbon is older than Melvin. That's like what has been written off. Okay. Fair enough. No, that's that's fair. Okay. Okay, no, that's fair. Okay. Um what else? Whatever. Um satellite constructions So there's some results on this by Mark, Maggie, and someone. Never talking right at the same time. Huge favorite cues, Miller. Also, favorite of. Also, a paper of someone. Satellites have two knots, and you can relate the gluct twist of the satellites to the gluck twists to the original things. And then I'll say also certain sporadic places. There's a paper of national stipulates and also And also another separate paper of GOMP, where they sort of treat very specific two-nots. National stipsites have a very specific family. The ribbon diagrams show the collectos are standard gump. I'll say gump for the operative Kirby sphere, which is a collectos. But that's sort of maybe that's not every single possible theorem, and I've forgotten one off the list. Is there like 30 or something below like this? Okay. And again, if I've left your favorite theorem off of here, then I apologize. Sorry, I was distracted, but anything zero-coordinate to any of those is also true. Fine. Yeah. Okay, so that's, you know, that's a long list of two words of cases where we do know. But maybe this problem is like hard. I will propose a slightly, maybe easier problem. So you had ribbon before, and then you were forced to delete it. Is that the follow from you? Oh, I just know it should be on the top one of that level, not on that one. It was not really. Yeah. Paul was the one. The ribbon should be on the list. Yes. Ribbon's on the list, yes. Be on the list. Yes. Really is on the list, yeah. But it, as Maggie points out, it only follows from. Okay. So here's a maybe the other question was hard. Maybe this is like a medium difficulty question. So I'll ask the following question, which is that if you take a thread twist and you puncture it, cross with the interval, do you get B5? A reasonable thing to ask. If it really was a four-sphere, if you removed a small open ball, you'd get V4, you crossed the interval, you get B5. But it's plausible that, well, maybe this happens even when the glycosis is not really the force here. Um see why that's like a reasonable thing to try in a second. So one other thing I'll point out, this is connected to the actual title of the talk, which is that this condition about taking the product with the interval B5, this is the same as the double of the gluck twist being S. By the double, I just mean... By the double, I just mean connect some of those mirror. If you want, this is also. Any of those are S4, then this is true and vice versa. So one direction is obvious. If this is true, then on the boundary on one hand you see S4, on the other hand you see, well, this connects someone's mirror. This kind of summit's mirror, or its version with the opposite orientation. If this is true, then when you take the product with the interval, you will have built a homotopy 5 ball with boundary S4, and there really aren't so many things. Was that mistake? That's the connection to the title of the talk. But from now on, really, I'm going to think about some five-dimensional things, which is good because it's a four-dimensional. Which is good because it's a four and a half dimensional compact. But this probably stupid, but so this edge MS mine says is not necessarily river. Yeah, yeah, if you have, yeah, that's more maximum or something. There are abstractions to that too. Like, we could we can prove they're not. Cool. Okay, so why is this a reasonable thing to try? Here's a very fast example due to Mazer, which I think everybody knows. A mouthful, which is not the four ball, but has the property that when you take the product with the interval, you really do get the product. Maybe if it's the first time you see this, it'll be like, very surprising. Time you see this, it'll be like very surprising picture of it. More manifold. Found it with a dotted one handle. And assuming I've got all my crossings in clasp and stuff, right, that's the manifold code. Oh yeah, definitely from the front. Let's try that again. Oh yeah, I definitely want. Let's try that again. Statement's true, yeah. The very common process changes that you get the traditional one. Dave, you're happy with that all? Good. Good. Okay. So, very fast, what's the sort of thing that happens? This is a format fold that's built from a single zero, single one, and a single two. Okay. That's your grand. What's that? So that's zero problem. Okay. In the boundary of the one handle, I've attached a curve and asked. I've attached a curve in S1 cross S2 that it really wants to cancel, but it can't. I have this clasp here. I can't take this manifold apart. It's not like you can do some sort of light bulb theorem at S1 cross S2. You don't have it dual. This is not the four-bulb boundary slot S3. Okay, great. On the other hand, And I take the product with the interval. Well, I still get the same handle structure. I get a five-dimensional 0, 5-dimensional 1, 5-dimensional 2-handle. But I've attached a 2-handle, well, in the boundary of a 5-dimensional 1-handle, so I've attached it in S1 across S3. I claim, well, because it was homotopic des 1 cross point there, well, it's still homotopic, des 1 cross point here. Homotopy implies isotopy occurs if format folds. You attach it in S1 cross B3, right? I'm attaching it in the boundary of the one handle. So in the boundary of S1 cross B3. Handle. It's in the boundary of S and cross B4. Alright. Yeah, B2S of S and cross S4. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so okay, that curve genuinely geometrically cancels. These two handles cancel. I'm left with B4. Okay. So somehow, taking products with interval things like this makes your life easier. Ansel in ways that you couldn't hope for. Okay. So here's a more general fact. Tell you what this has to do with gleb twists. If M is, I'll say a balanced two-grammal body. Annual body and let's say pi one of m is trivial and is what I'll call Andrew's Curtis trivial. I'm not calling it that, but Andrew's Curtis trivial, then the same conclusion will hold. Okay, so I have to tell you what some of the words in that statement mean. Okay, so by two-handle body, I just mean a manifold built out of one and two handle bodies, or one of two handles, just like that. Balanced, I just mean there's the same number of them. I want them to algebraically cancel. In fact, I want the funnel mountain group to be true. So when can I do the same thing? Well, provided that I can. Provided that I can do a bunch of handle slides so that when I take the product, all of the attaching curves are, well, homotopic and therefore isotopic into something which cancels off all the line. So there's like an obstruction to this coming from the fundamental group. It's not clear that you can always view handle slides to realize this. And this is, you should call this the Andrews Curtis conjecture. Andrew's Curtis conjecture, the various versions of it, and asks whether, okay, can I get from, on the level of the fundamental group, can I get from whatever induced presentation I have to one that's just extremely nice. In which the relators really are just the generators. And so I won't write down the moves, but what are the moves? The moves are supposed to be what you get. Are supposed to be what you get by doing two handle slides. Do two handle slides that affects the news presentation. If you could do a bunch of them, organize yourself in such a way that they're homotopic to something that you cancels, you'll be in good shape. You'll get this sort of conclusion that you want. This example, there's no problem at all because the induced presentation is already of this form. Okay. I think people will say that this conjecture is probably false. There are lots of plausible-looking presentations that have not been shown to be trivializable. No one's throwing creatures at this point. But this is sort of like a, we want to make conclusions about taking a project with an involved. Taking a project with a label and getting d5, this is like a very dangerous thing to bump up against. You would not want to have a handle decomposition and bump up in against this problem. Because, on one hand, okay, maybe you're lucky and you show that it's AC. On the other hand, if it is great, you could do it. If it's not, we don't have a way of detecting or disproving. You could just get really stuck with a handling computation. In fact, this has happened in the past. So, examples of presentations. Examples of presentations, induced presentation is suspected not to be a C. You could really run into trouble. Okay. I think this is one of Marshall Cohen's favorite problems. He has some excellent presentations on this. Okay. On Android script. Yeah. Cool. Okay. So, plan. Um look at panel decompositions of well these and see what we can say. So, on one hand, this is like a super useful fact. If I can just guarantee something about the presentation and I don't mess with it too much, I'll get nice conclusions. Too much, I'll get nice conclusions. On the other hand, I have to be careful. So there's a standard recipe for getting excuse me, forgetting analytic compositions of a glove twist that start with, let's say, a vandalomic diagram. Green is okay, right? Point change. Okay, let's change. No, it's gonna be orange. That's not the response that I wanted to add at all. I wanted it like a yay. Good? It's not a yay, but that's okay. Okay. So here's, I'm going to draw a band unlike diagram. Red is to that. Or blue is the light. What does the penal diagram? Some do you not actually it's the union of two different ribbon disks for the steven or not? It's an S. Given a presentation like that, actually, so if you're bored already, so how does this work? This is a this is a drawing of S in Senor's position. Of S into the Senor's position. What do I see? I see minima up here to this unlink. At some point, I see bands attached corresponding to saddles. The resolution of all of those bands is another unlink. If you're bored, convince yourself that's an unlink. Okay. Or discover I've made a crossing change mistake. Okay. How did the name change? Your name chose going to change the data thing somewhere? Yeah. In a paper of A paper of Mark Mackey and Sungmon. Yeah, so abandoned elect diagrams. I mean, maybe people have thought about that well before. Is it Fish and Cobb? I don't remember if someone has covered that. Yeah, maybe not. Is it a table with a lot of concentrates in the fourth diagram? Is it Yoshikawa's table or that? Y Yoshikawa uses some things with basically the same but wasn't marked for the text diagrams. The the ribbons aren't there, I think. Yeah. The bands are really small. Yeah, the bands are those. It doesn't tell you how to trivialize the link, you just resolutions that are trivial. Good luck. Yeah, so you can, I mean, you can you can present this information in different ways. You could start with a knot in the middle, give bands going out of directions, you can start at the bottom, work your way up if you do anything. Okay, so there is fairly standard panel decomposition of up twist. The way this is. This is like the rising water technique in Gantt Sipschitz. So I'm going to build the complement of this first. As I go upwards, I'm going to carve out discs or disks corresponding to the minima. And then handles in the complement correspond to handles, or sorry, handles of the surface correspond to handles of one higher index in the complement. Got a picture that looks like this. Try not to draw this same thing too many times. How do you decide whether or not the kind of linkings with both one handles are over, under, under, over? Um question circle. Yeah, how do you determine the sign of the class? You pick one of the other ones to try this term basically just perpendicular to the band. Yeah, like you got the band. So you like perturb and you just pick a perturbation sense that it has kind of it choose better. So one feature I'll point out. So build most of the complement. Build all but one of the like like use the rising water chunk thing to get above all but one of the maximum. So that will give you So that will give you, at this point, I'm going to go all the way up to maybe just before the last maximum. So I'll get all a zero handle, got two one handles, two two handles, at this point one three handle, which I've not tried. So now what you're left with is, well, basically a four-ball neighborhood of the little Basically, a four-ball neighborhood of the little maximum. And there's this trick, which is that you can actually, you don't need any more three-holes. You can fill in what you've carved out from the two-sphere, with a zero frame, or sorry, with a plus one. And I claim you only need to add a four-ball at the top to get the gluck twist. The reason for this is that the gluck twist of a little unknotted maxima gives you back the b4. I don't know why we've attached that. Before from the level we've attached that. So that's like a nice, that's a nice handle presentation of this. So sort of salient feature is that you needed one viewer three handle than there were max. That's useful because three handles are sort of hard to deal with. As a sort of demo or like proof of concept, what happens when I take a two-sphere that has a single maximum? So such two spheres are called GoSpheres or maybe Suzuki spheres. Thematically, very quickly. Go spheres, very thematically appropriate. Rest has one max. Well, there are no three handles, which is great. Actually, I claim in this case that the induced presentation will be Andrew Squared's trivial eyesyl. We'll not say any more words about that. But the point is, if I only had a single band here, there's a meridian, a plus two-frame meridian, that really wants to cancel, like it really wants to cancel one of those one handles. And the other two handle comes to you as a ribbon. You can sort of use that information to do that. And sort of use that information to do the cancellation. Could you just let that one happen? You could. You could. Well, explain why we don't hear that in one. Yeah, yeah. You preempted it. Okay, so in this case, excellent. You get the conclusion that you want. Actually, we knew this already because the Gluck twist on x tax on minus s in this case is. On S tax on minus s, in this case, it's ribbon because it's a double of a ribbon, it's a double of a real disk. But, anyways, besides the point. So, great. What's wrong with other things you might try to do? One sort of standard approach to, or one approach to standardizing these diagrams is, as Claid suggests, cancel all the one handles and turn it upside down. Upside down. Or at least in general, that's what you would try to do. And that's very reasonable. You have something you want to cancel the first one with, do a little messing around, and cancel more of them. The danger is you flip it upside down, and you have no idea what happened to Andrew's creams. You don't have to. Um in fact, this sort of thing can happen. This is this famous, um, I'll just say ten gets stuck by turning upside down. By turning upside down. This famous Octolu Kirby sphere, which is the double cover of one of these Kepler Shanus and RP4s. I draw these very complicated handle diagrams, turn it upside down. Octolu and Kirby have this this lot of paper. At the end of it, they compute a fundamental group, and that's now in the list of these presentations that are not known to be interesting curves. Patients that are not known to be interested. The point is, you can turn things upside down, and it seems like it will help you because you might get stuck. So I will propose, like an alternative, don't turn things upside down. Leave things sort of as they are, and hope that you can cancel some of the happens. Maybe it's worth pointing out. So, in general, when I have a panel decomposition, When I have a handle decomposition like this, I could turn it upside down, I'd get one one handle. If, when I cross this whole thing with the interval, or if I cross that whole thing with the interval, well, I get some zero handles, I get two handles, one handles, two handles, and three handle. I hope, maybe, I can cancel the one, some all of the ones, some of the twos, using some Andrews Curtis magic. Curtis magic. Now, in a five-manifold, geometrically cancel two of people. That sort of doesn't happen all of the time, but maybe if you're very lucky, we were you actually can. I'll state a theorem and I'll say some words. And then we'll call it thing. Here again, this is trying to play the panel. Suppose you have a two-sphere union of two ribbon disks as coach in normal form and And you know something about one of the disks. So I'm going to say delta of d1 is 1. Undisking number is 1. Say what this means in a minute. And this conclusion that you want, it's the double of the bipodescal distance. So, what is this? Is it a bacterial number? It's a number associated to a ribbon disk, not associated to a knot, just associated to a ribbon presentation. Asks how many moves do you need to do if you drag a band through a minima to get yourself down to a very nice looking picture of the unknotted villages here. So if that number is one, So if that number is one, then the conclusion that you want will hold. What should I say? So the assumptions D1 and D2 are ridiculous. That's right. Drag a band through middleware. That's it. That's it. Yeah, so one thing to point out: this is not like a well-defined thing on closed surfaces. It doesn't make any sense. But I mean, that minimum, there are other bands coming off of that kind of thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, yeah. It's not just like situation. Yeah, so there's other stuff. That's right. Yeah, so doesn't make sense for closed services. Also not a property of the not It's also not a property of the knot. It's a property of the disk that I gave you in the presentation of the disk that. If you can do this in one move, the unknotting number of the knot is almost two. This does constrain knots fairly heavily. But unknown number two is better than unknown number one, so that's good. Yeah. Yeah. Would this disk on disking number depend can it depend on the choice of presentation as disk disk? Yeah. Yeah. So it's like suppose that you admit presentation into two ribbon disks and that one of those ribbon disks has been presented in such a way. So that's D1, not DI. That's D1, yeah. It's just D1. Yeah, so this is, okay, good. Just D1. Okay, five minutes. Let me see. Let me say a couple words about applications, things that are kind of interesting, and then maybe I'll say a couple words about the proof. This remaining time. Why just D1? Question. That's the first thing I was going to write down. So the interesting feature is that it does not matter what you do with D2. So I'll say a little bit about this when I talk about the proof, but. Little bit about this when I talk about the proof, but the point is that somehow this contribution from D1 is what's corresponding to the two and three handles that you need to cancel geometrically. If that's simple enough, you can do that cancellation geometrically. What's happening with D2 is all getting absorbed into Android's curves. It can be as complicated as you want, and that's fine. Great, I think you already answered that just in the next time. So it's for a diagram if you want? That's all. Yeah, I mean, yeah, or yeah, I guess if you minimize overall diagrams, no, I suppose not. I mean, I guess as of state definitely not. Yes, applications are sort of remarks. Um no condition on D2. Can you just sorry, T1, T2 has a folder? Like, yeah, you mean the point is you need one of them to be simple. Yeah. So I'm here I'm labeling it so that D1 is a simple one. Yeah, no condition on one of the two. So this is at the, somewhere in the middle that said something about a complexity assumption. It's like if you, in these roll spin examples, it's like if this. It's like if this bottom disk is somehow simple enough, then it doesn't matter what I want. It's fine. I think that's kind of interesting. What else? Not super surprisingly, this applies. Super surprisingly, this applies to many small disks for your chosen interpretation of the word small. So, for example, if you pull up, you go look at the back of Kaiwichi's book on knot theory, the list of all of these slice knots under like 11 crossings, go through the ribbon presentations for all of those disks, check them, many of them will satisfy this property. I mean, equivalently, you can make arbitrarily complex. You can make arbitrarily complicated-looking disks with this property by just threading the band somewhere in Clasp. It also applies to some of the spun disks. K is a twist knot. This will happen. In general, it almost never happens otherwise. What else do I want to say? It's also sort of interesting from the point of view of Schoenfleys. So, what this theorem does is it gives you many examples of two knots whose, like, the double of their collect twists are standard. But we don't prove that the collect twists themselves are standard. And so, you conceivably have Many pictures that look like this. They have a connected sum sphere somewhere in the middle that doesn't obviously bound a pore ball. It bounces a gluck twist to one side. All of the ghost spheres have that property, but those are sort of all conjecturally unknotted. Maybe that's a little harder to get your hand on. Here, there's a way of generating lots of interesting examples. Maybe I won't say any more about the proof other than algebraically canceled stuff with Androskirtis at the bottom, geometric on the top. I don't know more details, just bugging there a couple more. Ideally, buggy with that, that'd be good. Um, anyways, I think I'll stop there. Questions when you draw the column like you need to pick fairly specialized handle veterans. It's not that important, but do you know like I'm not in the middle of the day? Do you know like unknotting number two knots whose standard half-spong disk has undisking number one? Just to like improve on other things. Oh, yeah, sorry, but this is that again. So you guys have a role spawn thing. So you can find like an icon too, but the standard it is. I don't know of any iTel iPhone. What was the question? I was just trying to see if you could apply this to P forma. See if you can apply this to P forms quite not. So I think actually we can't. We thought about this once. It applies like in one very specific instance. And I suspect almost no others. Sorry, you said undisking number one implies a knot that's unknown number two. And you know examples where the converse is not true? No, no. So for us, we were thinking of roll spins of knots with unknown number one. So the knot in the middle slice is actually k-connect. In the middle slice is actually cave connects someone's cage. So that would have a minor number two thing has a reminder number one. Best case scenario that just doesn't have a standard number two. Does your theorem implies that every defunct span of the trefoil is actually a non-inventory ticker? Well, it's like this sound. It sounds like that's correct. So the turfoil is a twist knot, right? Yeah. Yeah, so that's yeah, so if you pick a twist knot, then it doesn't matter what you put on top of that spun disk, you'll get this conclusion. But again, it's not saying that the block twist of that sphere is better. It's the double. Anyway, but in concord with any of these lists, most of them are just icebergs. Are any of these? Are any of these examples? Yeah, in a sense, I mean, if you you pick your favorite ribbon disc, you can put it on top. Use a ribbon component and stack everything, however you want. It'll be okay. Limitations on which which knots you can get as a cross-section? I mean, yeah, presumably there's a lot of money. But I don't know how. But I don't I don't know. I don't know how to characterize that. Yeah, and again, it is a little, I mean, we haven't thought this through carefully. It is really a feature of the presentation, not of a knot. You have like a very complicated looking ribbon disc for the same, two different ribbon discs for the same knot. But maybe one of them can't be up there. My problem is I can sort of imagine taking I think my problem is I can sort of imagine taking like two circles and the simplest slice is where the band goes around like that. Do you have like, what's the second. Oh, just go around twice. Can't handle that. I don't have to pull through twice. Yeah, pull through twice. Yeah, and I mean, what's the second most complicated one with undisclamed one still? Oh, I mean, do so take your story. Take take that example with with too minimum amount of in between them. Grab somewhere in the middle of the map, do anything you want basically in class plus. Anything you want, basically, a class that's fine. Right a minimum. You can generate lots and lots of stuff like that. But yeah. Question up there. Oh, sorry. Yeah. I just want to maybe clarify the answer to a question from a couple of good questions ago. So did I understand what you were saying? That if you take the standard spun disk for a knotting number one knot, and then you take any deformation on top of that here. Deformation on top of that, you're still in this on disk number one point. Okay, no, okay. We don't, it's exactly the opposite. Yeah, okay. Generally, you don't expect that to work. So then, sorry, could you say again what you your comment about the twist knots? Yeah, so in the case that you start with a twist knot, the spun disk with a twist knot is, I think, almost the only instance where that disk has to twist problem. Okay, but then if you were to put like an arbitrary deformation on top of that. Whatever you want to talk about. Well, but this is confusing. Monetize. Well, but this is confusing because the deformation might need to introduce is it immediate, like, how do you know that the deformation plus the capping lock disc at the top is like is the ribbon disc? It's because you allowed that to be in discordance, which is long topic. So for deformation, you're only allowed to use it. That's right. I think it works. Five-minute break. Just to figure it out, we're just saying you picked this. I just agree with them. This is not nearby. This is what we're doing all the time. We have no idea. I was imagining if I had like shared stuff. So basically you should log it and you keep number one is. Oh, not general installed. Yeah, so here's someone. I want to talk to you about that later.     It's like suppose I got more accurate. Yeah, no, I I think it's gotta be a different one. It's kind of like It's gotta be a delta one. It's kinda like you can't well, but you don't want to have a lot of things. You don't want to have a space. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You don't want to space failure to address it. So this shows our code like you're saying. Oh, sorry. Do you mind if I pull the screen down?
