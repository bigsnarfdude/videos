So the next speaker is I don't know how to pronounce her name Sandra Di Ronko and she from ATH, Stockholm and she will talk about families past pointed dark varieties and the generations. Yes, I didn't write the generations, but they were might they might have. Are you writing to this? This is a pre-interview before I wish it was it. You always broke it. Are you guys ready? Let's hear a sound of voice. Thank you. Thank you for this very nice. Very nice, like rock celebrity introduction. Stage time. Exactly. Very nice. So, thank you very much. It's a real pleasure to be here, back after a few years, I have to say. I think this actually this workshop is is is interesting for many reasons, but one of the reasons is the mix of people that you actually were able to put together. Together, so it's very exciting to be here. So, I will talk about families of pointed tauric varieties. Maybe the title will become clear by the end of the talk. It's not one of my goals to explain the title, so you can see by the end of the talk. But actually, let me state what my What my goals are. And I would like to introduce and for you to get the feeling of what we call to start with 3D sums of the polytopes. I will define them in a while, but most of you probably know this kind of polytopes. Well, there is a generalization of this. Well, there is a generalization of this polytope, of this kind of polytopes called highly twisted K sounds. I will introduce yet a generalization of these generalizations, which I would call generalized high-twisted KD sums. To be short, maybe gen high. So, one major goal is for you to at least understand what we mean by that and have a feeling of which kind of geometric construction you obtain by that. And then, actually, the other goal is to see how this kind of polytopes and historic geometry dividings polytopes can explain a bit about. About, well, we start with so-called nozzle mining modular spaces that I will introduce. These are typically denoted by L M bar, and then they have an index small m plus 2 that I will define. Well, I will actually introduce and use this kind of Use this kind of polytops to say something about generalized, so some generalizations of. So by this point you can say, okay, this talk is about generalizing things. That's true. It's true about a lot of talks. It's true about a lot of in particular this talk. So this is my goal. So if if by the end of the talk you actually have a feeling about what this is and what this is, about what this is and what this is, fine. Okay. All that I almost all I can say is joint work with Luca, Luca Schaffler, who is in the audience there. So if you have any questions and wonder, ask Luca because he's the real expert here. And I was introduced, in fact, I And I was introduced, in fact, I think Luca introduced me to this part, and I introduced Luca to this part, so it was nice to collaborate on these two, apparently these joint topics. Okay, so let me fix some notation. So we've seen, this talk will be a lot about polytopes and toric geometry associated to polytopes. We've seen already Alan introduced a lot about toric. And introduced a lot about Tauric varieties and the Tauric geometry. So, my point of view is always from a polytope side. So, let me just point out that to a polytope, and usually it's always a full-dimensional polytope, say in Rd, we always associate a toric variety that I will denote by XP, but this polytop actually. But this polytop actually polytops define not only a toric variety, because they have a normal fun, and a normal fun define a normal toric variety, but they also define a polarization of this projective toric variety. So there is always an associated ample line bundle to it that I will call, I will denote by LP. Just to make sure that we are on the same page, so whenever you see a quadratic. A quadrilateral polygon of edge length one, so this is zero zero and this is one zero. Well, we should think about the smooth quadrature. So the smooth quadric in P3. So this is not normally P1 cos P1, but this is this particular value of P1 cross P1. Or if we If we have a standard simplex, but with age length 2, let's say, this for you should be the two-Veronese embedding of P2 in P5. Okay, so let's start with the first The first part, which is about this generalized high K V sums. And let me start by the definition at once. Okay, so what do we need? Well, we start with the surjection of lattices. So given a surjective map of lattices. So given a subjective map analysis and this is the pi that I refer to. So let's say pi and the latest delta 2 and that is the other way around. Let me use the same notation otherwise. I will screw up. Okay, we usually Okay, we usually, well, let's take the induced linear map. Then let's consider the number of polytopes R1, Rk in M. Inem Okay, let's consider then let's call R the convex hull of R1 Rk in this R is Is a pi is a generalized pi twisted KD sum if so we need a few things. So first we need that all the these polytopes R1RK are normally equivalent. R1RK normally equivalent. This means Equivalent. This means that there is a bijection and actually an inclusion-preserving bijection between phases of R1, R2, R3 and so forth. And the normal fan of R1, R2, define the same toric variety, so it's isomorphic. So this is what I mean by. This is what I mean by normally equivalent. So if this happens and if pi of each RI, so each RI is actually contracts down to a point VI, which is a lattice point. Okay. Then, actually usually we denote, and this is just for notation, denote by f the convex value of this V i's. So V one V K. This is just notation, it's not something that is in the definition. That is in the definition. But if we have such a construction, so K polytopes mapped by a subjection to lattice pomes, and these polytopes are normally equivalent, then we call R a generalized pi kd sum. Okay? So you don't necessarily want R I. So you don't necessarily want Ri to be the fiber, though. The fiber could be bigger than Ri. No, the fiber. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the fiber over all the fiber over Vi. So if I look at the fiber over Vi, it will contain Ri, but it could be strictly larger. Ah, no, no, no, no. That's Ri. Well, only if the Vi's, not guaranteed that the Vi's are. VI's, not guaranteed that the VIs are in convex positions. Convex positions? I mean, okay. I could have my RIs would be intervals. Interval of length 2, interval of temporary interval of length 2 mapping down to. And this guy here, it's the percentage of the convex holes. Is that. Yeah, I mean, it could have. Okay. It could have. But this is what we require. Yes. Yes. What we've quite. Yes. So I'm sorry, what is V? I get up a little confused. What is V? Vi. Vi is just... So I'm requiring that through this map, pi, pi R, I should be right here, sorry. Through this map, pi, each uh polytope R i is mapped to a point which is a lattice point. That's it, and I call this lattice point V I. And I call this lattice point be i. Okay, so let's look at some examples. So we look at some examples and actually this list of examples will hopefully clarify also this generalization of generalization. So let's start with what we probably all know, a Cayley sum, which is just a particular Particular such photo. So, example one key exam. So, if the polytop F, which was the convex hull of this di, is a standard simplex delta S Then we left, so first of all, then what we call R o and pi is is the project okay, let I will I will tell you in a second, but R R pi R one power one power K is called the K sum C S and so if Y if Y is the toric variety associated to the R i's right so if Y is the toric variety The zetaic variety defined by the normal fan of the polytopes R i's. In particular, each Ri is associated to the variety Y and the line bundle, an ample line bundle. Let me call this M. Let me call this Li. Then the toric variety defined by the K D sum, so X R Y R 1 R K is actually the projectivize bundle. Given by the sum of this Li. It's a toric variety, it's a projectivized vector bundle, so it has to split, the bundle has to split if we want a toric variety, and it's given exactly by the line bundle, the sum of the line bundles defined by this RI. Okay, so let me give you a picture, a familiar picture. bigger picture. This is the first visible surface. This is actually this defined by O P O one. This is OP1 OP1. This actually there is a projection from R2 to R and this is the if you want to take any projection take take this projection here now which maps to a Which maps to a standard simplex, this is delta one, right? So in this case, this is delta one, this is R1, and this is R2. It's maybe even better to think about it as p of O of one plus O of two. Yes, which is isomorphic to that, of course. Exactly, because this is a a a segment of length two. A segment of length two, so it's associated to an opi12 if you want, and this is opi11, but you can actually tensor this vector bundle with a line bundle and you obtain the same variety. Okay, so that's the first example and the origin of the Cayley sum in the generalization. Okay, so now example two is what actually gives the pi tweet. Actually, it gives the pie twist because this is something that was defined a bit later that's quite classical. I don't know what the origin, what is this the original KZ sound from here? It's not KZ, it's not I don't know, I I I'm first sure about that and first time went to a conference on this stuff in general today before, so I I'm sure I'm I cannot give you an exact reference for that. Exactly the reference for that. It's pretty classical. Let's say, actually, let's call it classical. It's slightly better model one. So, example two. Well, example two is when, in the definition, and this is this is actually defined by Chinese Casabrande and myself some time ago. I think it was. I think it was 2009. So now we require the map. So all the polytops, our i's, are mapped to the i, and we require that the i's are all vertices of the polytope F. So we only allow So, we only allow slices over the vertices, not on any internal lattice point. So, if this is the case, then again, R pi R one R K actually here, I should say that I should say that if we want R1, Rk, this has to be delta k minus 1, right? I should have read that this. So that this is a pi-twisted KV sum. This is how the definition was done. Now, before I continue here, observe. Observe that, of course, the scale-sound volatile being a projective vector bundle defines a vibration, if you want. So, P N1 plus plus Lk to this variety one, right? This is a locally trivial vibration. The same actually, and this is a generalization because we no longer require to have a standard simplex, right? That's the main difference here. Actually, we admit any possible polytone. The only specification here is that the slices are on the vertices, right? This also defines a vibration. So So we prove that actually there is a time map from X, let's call this R from X R to Y with generic fiber F So, if you want, this is a digit a toric, because this is actually a map with irreducible irreducible fibers. So, this is a toric degeneration of f okay variety corresponding to it. The variety of the palatal. Yes, F is the convex hull of the points where the slices are mapped, where the level of ISP is, I guess the fiber would be whatever this defines. Yes, exactly. Ah, sorry, sorry. Yes, thank you. Now I understand. Thank you that X of R, is X of R. And X of R. S. We start very early. Start very early. Thank you. Thank you. Okay, yeah, yes. Thank you. Yes. Okay. And these are actually interesting varieties because what we prove is that Tauric Q factorial varieties covered by lines. Covered by lines are given by such principles, are given by such a construction, let's say. Where this is q factorial, where the f is a simplex. Not necessarily a standard simplex, but a simplex. So example one, Kaylee sums. Example two, I twist it, because now I mean it's not it's no longer a vector bundle, it's something slightly more interesting. Yes? So you covered by line? Yes. Exactly. Absolutely. Yes, yes. Yes. So this is a Q factorial toric variety. A project. Oh, no, exactly. Projective, so embedded by a nine-point line band of L, and a line is a. And a line is a sub-variety whose degree or such that the degree of the line boundary restricted to the sub-variety is one. Yes. And do you want this to be a decomposition in the lines, or can they covered by lines? Well, no. I mean, this means that at each point there is a line passing through that point. That's a simple requirement. There could be more than one, of course. There could be more than one, of course, there could be many others. Yeah. Each of them is of this form. Each such torque Q factorial variety is given actually by if this is covered by line is given by this construction. Okay, so now let's go to the generalization of the generalization to have an idea. To have an idea of what we are bringing as extra, and I'll give you just an example. So, example three. So, now let's take that this would be like a CPN bundle, but this which did not come from M plus. This is not a CPM bundle. No, no, no, no. Is not a CPN bundle. No, no, no, no. This is not a bundle, first of all. The fiber is this. The generic fiber is, I mean, there are special fibers, but the generic fiber is exact. So that's very different. But in this case, then actually the generic fiber, since F is a simplex, so it's a Picard 1 Q factorial variety. So it is sort of special, but yeah. Okay. That was not the point of of my talk, but it was discussion. Okay, so example three. Now let's be let's be a little bit more specific. I think they are actually regarding to the to the pi intentionally because I didn't want to write too much. But let's be a little bit more specific here. So let's consider the map per pi. The map pi assigning to the pair xy the sum x plus y. And let's consider now as p is this. Okay, so it's this polytope so pi actually maps this polytope, but if we if we just look at a little bit what Just look at a little bit what happens if we consider the diagonal. So, first of all, we are going to R. This is mapped, so all the diagonal is mapped to zero, and all these four points are mapped to one. This edge here is mapped to two, and similarly, three is mapped to three, yes, because that means it is. Thank you. This, thank you. There is this, and then there is this, thank you, certainly. So here there are two points here, and then actually symmetrical here, minus three, three. So if P is this, here we have a map from P to minus three, three. This is three, this is six times the sounder simplex. Okay, this is the age. This is a generalized pi-twisted KLI. So P in this case is equal to R pi. And then actually we can take R1, R2, R3, where this is R1, this is R2. R2 and this is R3. And this would be nice. Now, what is different from before is that we are not mapping only on the vertices, but we have a central fiber from the point. So that's the main difference. Okay, so now actually you can recognize this will This will geometrically. Well, you want to view this as okay, which toic variety is associated to this polytope? Exactly. At the beginning, we saw that the quadrilateral should be interpreted by as P1 cross P1, but now we are removing two vertices, which means that we are blowing up these two fixed points. So this is the blow-up of P1 cross P1. Up of P1 plus P1 in two points. And this whole construction actually defines a map to P1 with generic fiber P1. Generic fiber P1, because there are special fibers over the fixed parts. We'll see this in a specific. Yeah, but it's also P2 blow up at three points, but it's also P2 blow up at P2 blocks. Would also be two products? Yes, absolutely. Yes, yes. You can interpret it in many, many ways. Are we all so? Now, this is the end of my first part, which I started? Yes, I started. Perfect now. So, which means that I should have achieved my first goal. So, I hope that you all understand what we mean by generalized or the generalization of a K-design. Of a K-design, right? And geometrically, that we actually want to interpret them as vibrations. Okay, so then we can start with the second part, which is about Lausanne Manny in modular spaces. So now, one thing that, yeah. So So, actually, one observation that we can make here is that in the first case, when we have a projective vector bundle, and even in the other example, with the twist, simply twisted KD sounds, we obtained actually fibrations with irreducible fibers. This is not going to be so nice, okay? We are not, so there are reducible. Reducible fibers. And actually, these are the fibers over the fixed points, the two fixed points of P1. And these are two copies of P1. So things. So things start being a little bit more interesting also geometrically. By non-interesting, I mean a little bit more complicated. Okay, so let's go to the Los Angeles Manning modular spaces. Do those correspond to like the two different rulings of the quadrant and such points? Which ones? Which one? Okay, so each of those correspond to a point of the quadrant. And is that like the two lines of the rolling epic point? But which quadrant? Before the blue? I don't know. Yeah, because I'm thinking at least in P3, this is like taking two points of the quadrat and then intersecting with a left-hand pencil. I would say that when you blow up, that's when you have the extra. That's when you have the extra. Oh, this comes from the block. Exactly. So, one of these two pieces is the exceptional divisor. I'm not sure about that. What's happening geometrically is your fibration, generic fiber, is a quadrant. Yeah. That is smooth quadric, and it's explaining for a cost of fibricity. The generic is a problem. I'm thinking you can take you take the point of the choir and you put it in the middle of the middle. Okay, so let's let's uh let's proceed. Now we are losing control of the audience just to point out that I have to introduce for you this phase and as I said this is usual for most. And as I said, this is usual to multiply L n bar n plus 2. So what is this? So let's start as before by defining it. So we take an index m, it is 1, then the Los Angeles Man in space at L M n plus 2 is the Is the fine particular is also smooth well smooth smooth projective projective moduli space and also let me point out also that it's m minus one dimensional modular Modula space of recalling chains of P1s with M plus 2 marked points marked points P zero P one P1 P M P infinity such that so this is something like this L one L two this is L two L three to L K minus one L K? Okay. So actually all all is about these points now. So such that first P0 has to be on the first line. P0 is on L1. P infinity is on the last one. And if in the case when K is 1, so in the case when we have only one line, because that's also a possibility. Line because that's also a possibility, then actually we require that P0 is distinct from P150. That's the first request. The other one is that actually each line contains at least one point, one point. And then the last one is that this point, actually P1 to Pk, just go, P1 to Pm can overlap, but not P0 and P thinking. So we always start with P0, we end with P000. We end with P infinity. These are called like heavy points, something like this. And then we actually have to distribute the other points such that each line contains a point. Points can actually coincide, and so forth. So I can have more than one, I can have two points coincide. So this is the modular space defined by loss of n by n. Of money. So why is this interesting? Well, for many reasons, I assume that I actually mostly am not aware of. But let me just give some facts. In part to me, each line contains at least a light point. Ah, one mark point among the one PM PM. Yes, for example, the extremes, they need to have a light point. They need to have an iPhone. So just let me give you some facts which I find interesting. Okay, so for Um for first um I can observe that uh L M plus two is in fact birational to M0 M, so the modular space of rational curves with m plus two points, sorry, m plus two points, right? And it's actually And it's actually a rational space, so it's binoration to P, what was it, Pm minus 1. This is an M minus 1 dimensional space. With the universal family, a nice one actually if you start with the L L If we start with Lm plus 2, we have a nice recursive picture because Lm plus 3, so if we take one more mark point, then this is actually what's happening. Then, what is important for this talk, so this is the first part of the question. So, I guess if we want to say that you just collapse. Yes. Collapse. Yes, yes. So actually, so what is important for us today is that Lm M plus 2 is in fact foreign. That makes this space interesting also from a modular space point of view, because here you have some virus or some modulus space of curves, which is the Curves, which is the total variety of questions, can they lie on the singular points? Is that allowed or not allowed anymore? Oh, you mean if they know they have to lie outside? Okay, they lie. Yes, I should have specified it. That's fine. Okay, so LN plus 2 is a correct variety, and in fact, it's fun. This fan has a nice construction. So let me just quickly tell you how to construct the fan. This is the Cauchian fan defined by the map. Okay, so we start with Rm and say the quotient. The quotient the quotient R R M by R Here we consider, so let's call this map Q in R M we consider, so it's no surprise that since we are we are uh considering chains of lines, so things will have to be related to P once, of course. To P1s, of course. So, this is M. So, in this case, it's why did I say LK because we have M plus two points. But so it's no surprise that we take the fun of the line, so sigma delta one and take the m power, so times itself m times. Times itself n times. So this is something that is included here. So let's consider the quotient fan of this fan. So this is the common refinement of the images of the cones in this fan. So the quotient fan, let's say, defined by Q, I just write By Q. I just write off of the map Q, but I hope you understand what I mean. Denote it by Q, curly Q. Now, let's see if I consider this. I want to keep the index M because it's important, and this is given by the. By the polytope delta one. And this is different. This is the home model refinement of all Q sigma where sigma is in the fan, which I will denote by sigma. That's the diagonal copy of R? This is the diagonal copy of R, yes. If you want. If you want to yeah Diana thank you Yes Okay, so that's the the fan moreover moreover this fan from a polytop point of view is the normal fan associated The normal fan associated to a very nice polytope, which is the permutahedron. Let me write it here. So this is the fan, the normal fan of the Aerial tractron Q I write here Q M is Q Q Q Q Q if M is equal to 4 that's it. Thank you for that. Thank you for the other. So, what is this? So, what is this? So, this is actually m minus one dimensional, and this is the polytope whose vertices are given by the permutations of one m and the edges. Well, you join two permutations if they differ by a transposition. Permutations differing by transpositions adjacent adjacent, yes, yeah, adjacent. So So for m equals 4 is here. I cannot of course draw it, especially in the top. For m equals 3, then we have a nice exaggerum. Okay, and I think it's a little bit more than 300. Okay. So your previous example was an execon. It's not that. It's not that exaggeration. No, it's not that. Unfortunately. But it is exactly this hexagon. Yeah. This defines. No, not the same. This is this is, if you want, this is. This is, if you want, this is a P2 blown up at three points. Yes. And the other one's nice work with P2 blown at three points. Yeah, but this is, I'm considering this with equidistance. Yeah. So okay, the normal fan, the normal fan now is that this LM5. I think it's the same. Yeah, last one is it's the same. The one you had before, all of those things. Okay, no, no. Absolutely. What I'm saying. No, absolutely. What I'm saying is that it's the same torrent variety, but it's not the same embedding. I see. And some of the links on the side. Normal fans are isomorphic. Yes. That's correct. Yes. Yes. Very good. So, okay, so this is the laws of money in space. It's a very nice phase, as I said. Nice space. As I said, it's very much related to other modular spaces that we care about. And why it's nice, because it's a Toric variety. More than that, we actually know a lot, I would say, almost everything about its geometry, via the Fern and the Ponyto. So what I would like to introduce now is a generalization of that. So we introduce Generalization via generalized pi-twisted KDSA. So, this is indeed, and we will see, this is a pi-twisted cadisum. It will not be a surprise. Actually, we have a nice The dual of this map is a nice lattice map that will induce a surjection of polygons and so forth. And we will see it now. So let me start now by defining this generalization. Okay, so definition. So first of all, some notation. So let's now we consider any polytope. So before here we played with delta one. So now let's consider any polytope. So let's be P be a polytope in R D two-dimensional polytope. Let's consider the associated toric variety to the power m. This is also a toric variety. It has a dense torus that we denote by T. And let's take a sub-torus H. So there is a nice So there is a nice construction called the Chow Possient Toric variety that here you want H to be the diagonal, subtoric? Ah yes, yes, yes. In this case, I want the diagonal. Yes. Thank you. Okay, so now what do we do? Well, we consider X. What do we do? Well, we consider xp to the m in each diagonal embedding here now and we take the so-called shao pushed to make variety and what is this? Well, child pushing variety. So this is well, we consider all orbits by age of elements in the tortoise. Roughly speaking. Actually, one point, it's kind of a pity point, but it turns out that there is morphism from xp to dm in the child. It's usually a rational. Directional. We should dot it. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's why I put this double bars on the second. But yes. So this is the torque right here. Polytope is the fiber polytope of the exactly, exactly. So on lattice, okay, so this is this is yes. So Yes. So equivalent or, how do I say? Let's let's on let me write on lattice on the lattice level. Okay, what do we do? So again, we take Rd n times. We consider R D embedded again diagonally. Argonautic and then we take the quotient of this Rdm by Rd. So we are basically repeating what I've done before, but in a more generalized setting. Motion. Here, now we have the fan of P to the M. And as before, we consider the quotient function. So we denote by Q M P the quotient function. The quotient fine by Q Okay, so this is on lattice level. Now let's dualize this figure. Now, let's dualize this picture and let's look at the audit of level, all the convex geometry level. So it probably looks like what do we have? So if we dualize that, That's called delta dual. Let's consider delta dual restricted to the polytope P to the where am I now? P to the m, because we have here, R d to m dual, right? Okay? So we have a map from P to dm to m times P. And I'm just gonna go ahead and get a little bit of a test. Alright, so what we are saying is that so every time we have the subjection at the level, at the lattice level, restricting to polytops, actually there is a very nice construction called the fiber polytop. Construction called the fiber polymer. I will not define it for you, but you can actually look at the fiber poly and this is by Q m p, right? And in fact, this so what we are saying is that this curly q m p, which was the quotient fan, is the normal fan. Is the normal value okay all right now of course I mean we have this nice space if you want historic space right we have a map here We have a map between the fan of P to the M to the fan of Q and P. We would like to have a toric map from this basis. Unfortunately, there is only a rational map. It's not a map defined everywhere. So, unfortunately, our construction cannot stop here. I have to actually get going to be able to define something. Thing, a real map, like a honest map, that actually would give us a generalized data. So, bear with me a little bit longer. We are almost there. So, what do we do now? Well, let's consider the following. So, we take the map, so from R D to the M. Well, there is the idea. Well, there is the identity map, identity, but there is also this map that we call Q. Same as before. Okay? So let's consider ID, the map ID equals Q arriving to the product. This is R D to the M quotient by R. By R T. Okay? Let's call this map I. So here we have the fan sigma p to the m cross the fan Q M P. So let's consider the pre image fan here. So I m minus 1. I m minus one of this and this is what I will call curly R MP. This is now living here. So we want to end up with a polytope and for that And for that, I need a fan and I need a polarization. So the only thing that remains to do now is for me to explain to you which polarization we want to consider on this fan. And when we do that, well, let me, and now I just erased it. Well, I write here, recall that That actually, when we define the Chow quotient, Q M P, this is a space coming with a sort of canonical polarization. So it comes with a polarization and which polarization is this? Is the one that giving This is the one that giving that will give this fiber polygon. It's the same thing. It's just one metaphor. It comes with the polarization. Let me call this M. Okay? So, where are we? Now we are here. So we have this map I minus one of this. This is phi, then this is the same thing. So here we consider the projection onto, this is the hard one, onto the second factor here. And here we have actually M, this is polyglot. This is all you're doing. Okay. Sorry, I'm very over time here. Can I just get two minutes? So here, actually, we have Pi onto this, sigma p. Pi, how many? As many as M, P1, P2, P2, and so forth. So what do we do? Well, we consider P upper star of M times. of n tensor p one the p one pullback of uh what uh lp tensor tensor p m pullback lp and then we consider i pullback of all this and this is a okay so finally i can define you i can define what i You, I can define what we mean by a generalized loss of money, whatever, a generalized construction. So, a generalized construction is given by the polytope associated to this fan, this band, let me call this sigma, and this polarization. And this polarization A. And this is something that we call, so this polytop is R M P. And the nice thing that comes out from this construction that we call in our paper is that this indeed defines a vibration. So it defines a map from x X R M P to X Q M P with generic fiber X P so this is a if you want it's not a toric generalization is a semi toric Degeneration of XP now. We prove this by proving that this is a generalized scaley sum given by actually this construction, by the map, by this map. You re reprove many things. So basically everything that I stated with the classical philosoph money and Lausev Mann in space. What it was actually, what it was nice about the Laws of Manny space was this recursive thing that we can reprove, of course, by this. We also proved that unfortunately, even for delta 2, so this is exactly this whole construction actually coincides with the Laws and Management case when P is delta 1. Just by considering delta 2, you lose all this. You lose all this nice actually recursiveness, but what we could prove is that for any simplex delta D, this construction gives you a vibration which is flat and with reduced vibrance. So it's something that at least algebraic geometers algebra like. The flatness is something that we like to have even though other than That we like to have, even though I don't approve. It's advantageous, let's say, many times, many occasions. And I think I don't have two time for more, so thank you.
