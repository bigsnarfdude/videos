This talk is going to be about sums of two rational cubes. And I'll just go a little bit. And I kind of feel that I have to justify why I'm focusing on two cubes and rational cubes. So let me just kind of justify that quickly. So the talk's really going to be about something like how many integers are or are not these. Are or are not the sum of two rational cubes. So you know, let's just start easy, start with one cube. So almost nobody, no integer is the sum of, this is kind of idiotic way of writing it, sum of one integer cube or dashal cube. So difference. Almost nobody meaning the density of integers that are the sum of one. R, the sum of the r1 integer cube is zero. And density is in the kind of natural density sense the number of integers up to x, which r cube is real small to x. Okay, so that's one cube. Good. I'm going to talk about two cubes. So let's talk about three cubes per second. So everybody is the sum of three rational. Of three radical cubes. Okay. What I was trying to do when I was waiting was remember formulas, and guess what? I didn't remember. Exponent of the Y in the numerator there? No. Excuse me minus one sixth. I guess we're not doing that. Yeah, so it should be kind of homogeneous for why is like execute. Same calculator. I don't, I mean, I could have just said everybody's the sum of three rational gifts. I like writing three things count, so I'm going to go ahead and get a little bit of a message. Okay, so you pick your favorite y, make it ginormous so that the denominator doesn't vanish, and you produce a representation of x as some free rational cubes. I'm not going to talk about how you would find this identity, and actually the best thing for me to do if you do ask about it is to direct the question to the audience because I bet there are many people in the audience who could instantly find this without issue. But the kind of underlying The kind of underlying story here, I think, has a beautiful description in a book by Meinen about cubic forms. I think that's basically the title. Okay, so that's three rational cubes and three and higher rational cubes. Everybody's a sum of three rational cubes. What about three integer cubes? Well, this is really famous, I think. I'm going to just mention it. Oh, so if I say this, excellent. For all integers, x cubed is congruent to zero or plus or minus one mod nine. Okay, so thus no n congruent to plus or minus four or mod nine is a sum. Yeah, because you know, if you add up three these with three either zeros or plus minus ones, you're never going to get plus minus one by line. Never going to plus minus one by that. Um, but it's conjectured by heat brown by now. I think everything I'm saying of these words is from the audience, but conjecture of heat brown is that that's only obstruction. So n not prior plus minus 419. Then there exist x, y, z integers such that n is x cubed, y cubed, or z cubed. Y cubed on C cubed. Heath Brown makes a more precise conjecture. He not only conjectured this, the existence of a solution, but he conjectured that there are infinitely many. And actually, if you bound the sizes of x, little x, little y, little z by, let's say, capital X, so you bound the kind of cube roots of the three terms, then he conjectures that the number of representations of n as a sum of three cubes, where each of the cube roots kind of sets size at most capital X is like Size of once capital X is like log x times a constant, which is like a product of local densities, which kind of witnesses the fact that n should not be plus or minus 419. Okay, so as you can see, I like writing big things down. And the only integer that matters, which is not plus or minus 419, is 42, of course. And I'm also showing the amazing computational power of people in the audience by writing this example down. Audience by writing this example down. So 42. There's an example of test case, which was found recently. Here we go. I'm definitely going to regret this because I bet I'm losing out. Just want a t-shirt. It's good if you want a t-shirt. That's a really good idea. I'm gonna get up. Yeah, I'm gonna hit that. Now, this is the extent to which I'm going to talk about this. So, maybe just writing this down so you have some big numbers on the board, but I like big numbers. I like big numbers. And that's another t-shirt. I don't like big numbers. Actually, there are going to be a couple more, not so large numbers. A couple more such numbers in a second. Okay, so anyway, this is very famous, very recent work. And I'm just going to kind of leave it at that. It is, I guess, natural to ask about four integer cubes, which is an open problem. It's expected that every body is a sum of four integer cubes. If you believe this conjecture. Of 400 cubes, if you believe this injection, then yes, everybody is done with 400 cubes because you just add one, and it's extra, you know, get away with the plus or minus four by nine. Um, and it's known that everybody is a sum of five integer cubes, um, and every integer which is a multiple of six is a sum of four integer cubes from some identity. Uh, then there's work of Demi and Enko, but anyway, okay, so there's other really cool work, but I'm not going to focus on it. This is just my attempt to. On it, this is just my attempt at justifying focusing on two cubes. Okay, so I managed quote unquote to get down to two cubes. Let's talk about two integer cubes for a second. This talk is about how many integers have a property. So it's time for the ask how many integers are sum of two integer cubes. Okay. Number XY Sorry, number n Z such that let me write like this: integers besides most X. This gives me an opportunity to say this means that most of the constant times X. And since for me, almost always constants don't matter, this just means like. Constants don't matter. This just means like at most x, so I'm going to read it like that. But anyway, constant end x such that there exists x and y such that x cubed is n. The number of n's, which are some of two integer cubes, is most x to the two-thirds. In particular, it's density zero. It's a pretty like easy argument. So I want to give it as a little bit of a workout. Work on just writing common digits down. Um, so first, the number of like okay, so the inequality that we're kind of solving is x cubed. I'm going to put a minus sign in for like psychological purposes. This thing at most x got so the number of trivial solutions, obvious solutions, x and y, such that both of them are Most of size like x to the one-third. Yeah, it's a trivial solution because how do I get some sum of cubes to be of size of most x? Well, each of the cube roots should be of size of most x to one third. Okay, number of subtrivial solutions is x sub two thirds. Good. And then also we have this inequality. That means I'm just factoring this x squared xy. Um so just say that means uh difference of X and Y. What this is expressing is cubes repel each other very strongly. So like if I had like x squared and y cubed here or something, then this would be asking about how many elliptic curves in the more developed family of elliptic curves have an inferior. More delta family of curves have an integer point, that's a much harder problem. Um, because cubes and squares they do repel each other, but the like repulsion is coming from some linear forms of logins bound, which is a, you know, it's not that it's a bad bound, but it's a tough bound to use. Anyway, so this gives some a priori bound and thus, so you just, you know, fix x and some, how to say this, fix x, so number of So, the number of y's given x is at most. So, first off, this little x's we conclude at most x to the one half, just going extremely fast to finish this. Include this because this difference, we might as well assume at least one. And then the number of y's given x is therefore just divided by x squared. And when you sum this, starting at x to the one-third and ending at x to the one-half, you also get x to two thirds. Ending at x to one half, you also get x to two thirds. Okay, so hopefully, just a quick overview of why sums of two integer cubes in the density sense are not well anyway, not that not that integer. Okay, so very few integers are some of two integer cubes. I guess I should mention that if you give me n, so give an n and And the number of representations is at most some constant to the number of prime factors of n. And that comes, for example, from balance to do with two equations. Okay, good. Quickly got through, I think, the questions that are not the question of the talk, which is about some rational cubes. All right, so we're going to. All right, so we're going to talk about some of the which injuries are some of the two rational fields. And I want to finally comment because it came up in Bernard's talk that if you give me n, there's no at least unconditionally known way to determine whether or not n is a sum of two rational cubes. Yeah, because this is like this is a question about whether or not an elliptic curve has a rational hole. But anyway, we obviously know how to do it using Grecian Surinthire. Version certainly there. Okay, I just wanted to comment that. And if we were asking about integer solutions, then I quickly said some kind of operatory bound that makes it okay for integer solutions. There is an algorithm that's easy. The last thing I wanted to write, because I like before I actually get into the meet, is I like writing big numbers. So not every integer that is a sum of two rational cubed, as I'm going to show, is a sum of two integer cubed. And some examples, an example is six. An example is six is 1721 cubed. Don't worry about numbers about that, big smallest integer that's not the sum of two integer cubes, but is the sum of two rational cubes. And if you're saying, oh, this is not so big, I thought you liked big numbers. Serious 51 is 6217. I like the fact that we can in our field produce big hundreds. Okay, so now finally, after all that, I can state the main theorem. And I'm actually just going to erase this board so I have it up a little while. Question: Is it a coincidence that a lot of the six and 51 and 21 and then that other denominator are divisible by lots of threes? I don't know off the top of my head, but can you ask me after? Just my brain bored, I guess, is not plotted out. But yeah, okay, I'll think about it. Okay, so, but I guess if anyone in the audience sees a reason that. I guess if anyone in the audience sees a reason, then just shout it out. So, the theorem, the main theorem, is the structure with Banjal Bhargava and Arish Nimbin. Okay, so it says it's, you know, it was already kind of abstract, but it says I'll write it like this: the probability that an integer is not the sum of, so there is no way of representing it as the sum of two. Way of representing it as the sum of two rational cubes. And it's x cubed, it's y cubed. That probability is at least the sixth. Only thing I care about is that there's a positive constant I can write on the right-hand side. And probability that an integer, which is odd, inside of the argument, there's some kind of good reduction hypothesis at the end. Anyway, the probability that an odd integer is the sum of two rows. Probably that an odd integer is the sum of two rational cubes also at least the sixth. Okay, that's the main theory. So it's producing lots of elliptic curves which do not have a non-terrified point, a non-identity point, and lots of elliptic curves which do have a non-identity. Okay, I guess I should write down here somewhere. We expect Half-half split, meaning we expect this number to be half, and this number, even when you erase odd, to also be a half. And that's kind of governed, I guess I should say in this corner. The equation x cubed plus y cubed equals m and fixed is an elliptic curve. Yeah, it has a pointer at infinity, you know, homogenized and exist. At infinity, you know, homogenize and execute zero, and one minus one is the point at infinity, so it's a genus one curve point. This is for psychological reasons, like finding the Mars transform squared. So this is a family of elliptic curves, and I'm going to explain very quickly why this is really about like whether or not these elliptic curves have positive or zero rank. This is this question. And the rank is kind of 100% of the time. Rank is kind of 100% of the time should be governed by really just the root number. And the root number, you can show, like not that, it's not that difficult, you can show the root number does vary and is distributed. And that's where you get the expectation that there should be a half-half split. Okay, no more numbers, I guess. Okay, so Okay, so let me focus on the first part of the theorem where we show that there are not solutions. I'm assuming probably the vast majority of the audience is more interested in the second part of the theorem where we produce solutions. And I'm going to get to that. I just, it's a little bit easier to start from scratch to get to the first part of the theorem. And then I'll add a little bit at the end of that part, at the end of my explanation to explain how we produce. To explain how we produce teachings. Okay, so yeah. So we want to show, so we want to show lots of the ellipses curves. My square is excuse minus 432, which I'm going to write as 27 times 16. Lots of these elliptic curves. Um, lots of these elliptic curves have I'm going to write rank zero. Um this is actually the same as saying that the elliptic curves don't have any like that there are not solutions to this equation. I am thinking about whether or not I should explain, but yeah, kind of the point is, I guess I'll just quickly say this is three isogenous, so there's a degree three isogeny between this curve and exit plus. And x to the plus four m squared. Yeah, this is a fact about any Mordell curve, or domain x, y squared equals x equals k. There's always three I thought n is the y squared equals x squared minus 27k. And this curve has an obvious three-third point at x equals zero. And then you go and look at Mazer's Dorikin theorem, and that means that the thorium subgroup of this curve is either z mod three or z mod nine, and then you can just rule everything out. There's no, this point doesn't have a rational. This point doesn't have a rational letter under the express question. So there's no torture, there's no interesting fortune on these verticals. Now, there's an interesting subgroup, obviously, giving me isogeny, but that's not going to be a rational torture point. I should say outside of cases like n is a cube or n is twice a cube. That's zero notes. Okay, so this is a question about showing lots of curves have rank zero. And yeah, how you know, lots will have, I'll write like this, lots will have. Lots will have rank zero if lots have of course two thumb around zero two thumb around group batches and lots will have so this we're going to produce a kind of by a prophylistic method type argument lots will have two summer group size one or two summer group vanishing if like the average size Like the average size of the Tucson group is strictly less than, well, what are the possible values of the size of the Tucson group? It's the power of two. So one, two, four, eight, et cetera. So if this average is less than two, then we're just done. So the question to ask is, what is the average size? And the average size very much complies with our wishes and works out to be three. Great. And you know, it's an equality. It's really inequality. So there's nothing we can do about it. So it looks like we're not going to be able to produce lots of curves with two summer group of size one by just staring at this theorem. Okay, but now, okay, so this is this theorem is actually kind of like the, I think it's, I think it would as kind of the meat in the argument. I don't know how I call it things. Anyway, the point. The point of the argument, or something. But it's technical, and I don't want to go into it and then explain how to conclude. I want to first explain how to conclude using this theorem, even though look three is still doing two, and then explain the technical points at the end so that you can kind of check it out if you don't want to get the technical points. Okay, so here's the theorem. Remember it, I'm probably going to erase it so that you don't think, oh no, technical stuff. Oh no, technical stuff. And I'm going to conclude from this. Okay, so this turns out to get erased. I smell this result. So, how are we going to kind of manage? You know, this average. Vantage, even though this average, you know, is not working with us. I guess I should mention: so here, I already said the two summarizes is the power of two. I'm not going to write the powers of two out to a big number. Sorry. Anyway, and so like an example kind of enemy is enemy distribution is, well, we want to produce lots of two summer sizes of one, but the average managers could be free. But the average managers could be three. So, for example, an enemy is that we have to rule out: well, what if 50% were two, the 50% were four? Then the average would be three. And if that's all the information we have, we can't conclude that there are lots of ones. So that's an enemy. How are we going to rule out this enemy? Or, you know, all the enemies. Okay, so the observation is so that's the point, but somehow this is like a key thing. So that's the point, but somehow this is like a key thing that makes the whole thing run. I don't know. Yeah, anyway, observation is the following: the root number of these beautiful look to curves, x cubed plus y cubed, equals n, is, in a very technical sense, garbage at two and three times minus one to the number of prime factors. This little omega always means number of prime factors, the number of prime factors. The number of prime factors the number of prime factors p dividing n such that p is two mod three. So the number of two mod three prime factors dividing n without multiplicity. So this is really just the number of elements in a set. Okay, so I'm going to ignore, I'm going to throw the garbage out, ignore it, and I'm only going to focus on this like this function minus one for the number of two mod threes. function minus one for the number of two mod threes. So for example, now literally like just doesn't exist anymore. So for example, L C G, if n is square free, so then I can ignore this multiplicity comment that I quickly made, then root number is congregant to n mod three. Yeah, imagine factoring n, this is like the number of non-ones. This is like the number of non-ones, the number of minus ones. It has the same, it's like minus, you know, n mod three is minus one for the number of two mod three primes. So we can somehow detect, we managed to detect the root number, which is a complicated quantity in general, of these elliptic curves. Okay, it's a twist family, cubic twist family, so maybe it's not that crazy, but anyway, we managed to detect the root number by just knowing, you know, for example, for square free ends, what n is mod three. So we can force the root number to be plus one on square free ends by just On square free ends, by just saying n should be one mod three, for example. Okay, I ignored garbage, and the garbage makes me have to change that statement about something being a determined mod three to something being determined mod like 27 or something like that. Some constant, some little constant involving small power of two times small power of three. Okay, but the key point is here, and I'm going to modify what I wrote. And I'm going to modify what I wrote in that theorem by adding a little bit. The key point is here that somehow we forced the root number to comply with us by just imposing congruence conditions. There are infinitely many congruence conditions hidden in this word square free, but they're not like deadly congregations. They're not scary. It's not like, you know, if I didn't know anything about the root number, I said, oh, let's restrict to all curves with root number plus one. That's a terrifying prospect because, you know, maybe not in this family in general, that's a very complicated set of curves. A very complicated set of curves, but this is, you know, this subset, for example, is just basically just square periods. Okay, so why do congruence conditions not scare me? So, in this theorem, the average, I didn't specify what we're averaging over. So, the average is three even over subset, the subset of z fined by finitely many. Congress conditions. So the three persists, even when I started opposing the craziest Congress conditions I can imagine, still the average is still three, which is good for the argument you're going to see in a second. So I said finally many congregations conditions, but here I said you have to impose infinitely many, somehow not serious congruence conditions, to get the integers to be square free so that we can ignore this multiplicity. We'll see. I'm going to show you how to do that now, or why that sounds scary. But okay, so I'm going to show you that the average, even over a set like this, like for example, the set of square free integers, the average is still at most three. And actually, let me just do it very quickly. So the average over n, let me just say square free. Just forget about, I can also force this, you know, n to be conquered to one, mod three, for example, but I just don't want to write like an notation when it doesn't matter. Like a notation, but it doesn't matter to average over such a set. Well, okay, that's a numerator divided by a denominator. I'm averaging the size of two somewhere over square three n divided by the denominator, which is average, you know, summing one over square three n. Okay, secretly, I'm supposed to say n onto x everywhere. So the numerator, I impose infinitely many congruence conditions. I impose infinitely many congruence conditions. I'm summing some kind of positive quantity. I can make it slightly larger, or you know, potentially larger, by imposing only the first bajillion congruence conditions. So impose, so n square free, sum over n square free at all p and most of t. And that's the only congregation you impose. Numerator went up. The denominator, I can count precisely. I know exactly how many square free integers there are up to x. How many square free integers there are up to x, and I also know exactly how many square free integers, sorry, integers that are square free and only the first bajillion primes there are up to x, and they're basically the same, like asymptotically, but they're basically the same. So I'm going to write it like this, unchanged denominator doing two steps. I'm going to say this is asymptotic to the average over n square free at p at most t of the two summer size. Okay, so what we get is that, so this, you know, this is an asymptotic as this capital T goes to infinity. But what we get is that this average over this set where I impose infinite many Congress conditions is controlled above at least by averages where I impose the first, you know, T many Congress conditions. And I say here, that's only five minutes conditions. And I say here, this average is always three. It doesn't move the Congress conditions. Okay, so this shows. Okay, so this shows so this shows that this thing is at most three. So this average, even over square three integers, which is some complicated looking set, is still at most three. Okay, so a little bit technical, but now why does this like win for us? I have to start to tell what we miss. I'm not going to erase the sport, I'm going to erase it from the boat. That works out. So, the reason that this gains us something, the average is still at most three, and we can kind of imagine that this set is where we impose the root numbers plus one, for example. And the average still is at most three, but you know, the parity conjecture falls or is known. Theorem of Eclavage, probably, I don't know, but I think we can. I don't know. I think that we do. Oh, that's my function two. I'm going to write it in a strange way. Log base minus one is the root number. It's congruent to log base two of the two summer size function. So, for example, if the root number is plus one, then the two summar size is two to an even number. An even number okay, if the root number is minus one, that's two summer size is two number. Um, okay, so I'm gonna write this thing again one, two, four, eight, seven, slow power two. Okay, so we managed to show, I didn't write it in that same notation, but we managed to show using this theorem, which drives things, that the average, let's say, I'm just going to write it abbreviated over root number plus. Abbreviated over root number plus one curves of the size of two somewhere is at most three. So this average is at most three. But because of this theorem, when the root number is plus one, the only possibilities for the two summer size are even powers of two times. That's a stupid way to squares that are powers of two. One, four, sixteen, or larger. Yeah, but the average is still three somehow. Yeah, that's an amazing thing that happened. That's the amazing thing that happened. When we, if I had said respect to general, you know, in the general family to root number plus one curves, the average might have jumped to six, and then I wouldn't have been able to conclude. Somehow here, because I only impose confidence conditions, that doesn't change things by much. The average is still amounts to three, but now I'm only averaging ones, four, sixteens, and higher. And so for the average to manage to be three, there have to be plenty of ones. So that's how you conclude, assuming this, that's how you conclude. This, that's how you conclude that there are lots of curves, you know, by this probabilistic method thing that there's a decent density of curves where the two summer size is one, and therefore we should have rank zero. I could have done this too for I could have also averaged, you know, root number with minus one curves, yeah. That exact same argument, because I'm just imposing argumentations that average is ultimately well three, but an altitude summitized by disparity detector and the fixed detector. By this variety vector, it's fixed to be 2, 8, 32, or higher. And somehow, again, that average works out to be 3. Therefore, next possibility is bigger than 3, there have to be plenty of twos. Okay, so that's the root number minus one case. I'm not, you know, done with that, but okay, so that just shows you how we produce lots of two silver size ones and lots of two silver size twos. And the two silver size ones, of course, have ranked zero. And therefore, that shows you at least without the consequence. That shows you at least without the concept one six, how we get the first part of the theorem. How we produce plenty of curves around structure. I just mentioned the beginning of how we get lots of curves with which have a solution. So, okay, let me erase this. Okay, so now I'm going to talk quickly about the second part of the theorem. I said I just have to add some stuff, but there's a serious input by other people, experts on PFTL functions and Steve Assal. On the page, so I don't get the exact segment wrong. Okay, so we produced, so So we produced, so by this root number minus one stuff, we also produce just how I explained, lots of bins with two columnar size. This Z mod two, two summer Z mod two, a little lower summer. Yeah, the two summer group, I mean. Yeah, a two-somber group. I mean, you know, there's the defined exact sequence. Okay, so the two-silver group is a Zmod 2. Suppose we knew that SHA is finite for these elliptic curves, for example. Well, if SHA is finite, SHA, the entire group is finite, and the Calci-state pairing is alternating. And so SHA is not only finite, it's a square as a group. A group. Well, how can you know how can it contribute to a Z mod 2 if it's a square as a group? The only, if it were non-targeted were non-zero, it would have to be at least a Z mod 2 square. So that means, so if Shallow is finite, then this is zero. So if we knew Shallow is finite, this would be, this C mod 2 would be coming from the rank part, so to speak. So this would be producing, we would have managed to produce solutions of these equations by just reasoning about. Equations by just reasoning about the finance of Shaw. Of course, we don't know that Shao is finite. However, here's the following theorem by Ashe Berundai and Kurt Skinner. Okay, let P be a prime. P is two, fitting in slightly more, you know, in more generality because they do. Let P be prime, let E be a left curve over Q, C M, which I always write as potentially C M, just ignore that. Let's ignore that. And with good super singular production at p so at two. In our case, we have x cubed plus y cubed equals n. So just the fact that I said good reduction means that n should be odd. I mean, sorry, it doesn't anyway, it's implied by the fact that n is odd. So that's why I had the word odd in the theorem statement. Okay, so. Okay, so the good supersene reduction of P, this is like a serious, no, this is a serious hypothesis. I would say this. Anyway, for our curves, it's immediately satisfied, but this is a brand new theorem because of the hypothesis of supersingular reduction. It was known, this sort of thing was known for quite ordinary reduction, but it's a very serious advance because of the hypothesis of supersingular reduction. I think, anyway, maybe also this, I don't know. Anyway, I think that's it. So such that. So such that sentence that one group is a Z mod P, which is, it holds in our case. Number two, some little hypothesis that, okay, it's a Z mod P, but it shouldn't like vanish. You localize a P, the definite defining property of the elements of the two subgroup are that they go to the kind of. kind of local points when you localize a B. And this map should be it's non-zero as a map. So this generator, so one generator here goes to something non-zero here. Okay, so that's my clause. So I just walked with my sitting theorem. Then everything we want holds. You know, challenge my rank is one. rank is one and the order of the all function i'm just gonna write order equals one the analytic rank is one also so that's really and i'm definitely not going to talk about this because i have no expertise in pietic l functions or any of the solid theory but um they like one of the key inputs is a pietic prozagi so kind of you know you you this i'll just say this for our curves we have odd um there what is root number minus one What is root number minus one is the curves that we're dealing with have root number minus one. So, from this hypothesis, anyway, it's immediate that the p to the infinity self-worth group is a qq mod CP, so co-rank is one. And so, you can imagine that you're looking for a Higner point to not vanish. And one thing that they use is Gatakrosagi formula, and one reason why that might be relevant. So I guess I missed what this condition too was. Yeah, some slightly weird condition. So the condition is: okay, it's not that it's weird, but anyway, here's the condition: the map, localization of P, which is, you know, the standard map where you take a Calvoc homology class and you localize it P. So you restrict to the, anyway, localize the P. The defining property of the self-group is that this image lands inside the p-adic points, you know, because anyway, because. Um, yeah, anyway, does that make sense? Yeah, so the image lands inside the theater points, and the hypothesis is that this map should not be zero, meaning that this mod p should not all go to zero when you localize the p. I think I feel like there are too many p's here, but anyway. Like anyway, if you take a generator and you produce a local point out of it, it should not be a multiple p. This is some like small group. I'm definitely going to get it wrong, board, but let's just save size four in our case. Anyways, size at most four. Case, anyways, size at most four definitely. Um, it's some small group through the conclusion that shar is finite, the rank is one, and order is one, the order of the L function at, yeah, yeah, let me write this better. The order at s equals one, order vanishing of the l function is one. Anyway, everything that you would want. Everything that we want, certainly. So, yeah, there's this second hypothesis. I almost zoomed forward and didn't mention it. Let me put it here. So over q2 for n odd, x cubed plus y cubed plus n, this curve is isomorphic to, this is all over q2, x cubed plus y cubed equals one. Because I write it in my strange way, every unit in z2 is a cube. Okay, so um Okay, so these Q2, which is kind of the relevant thing here, PS2, all these curves, these curves aren't moving. So this kind of group is not moving, whereas the Selma group is kind of moving inside of it. Let's just say it's size four. I hope I don't get that wrong. It's some size like four or something two group. And the Selma group is kind of, in principle, moving around inside of it. So you can imagine how we might attack it is by proving an extra distribution type result by saying that the Selma group or the image of this map. And the self-man group or the image in this map distributes in this group, so that therefore there are plenty of ease for which this map is non-zero. Okay, so anyway, that's that is how we do it. I guess I should also say somewhere kind of right in the corner, this goes all goes through, I'm not going to say why, but all goes through for the family y squared equals x cubed plus dn squared two where you know. Where you know, in our case, I wrote like minus 432 here, or equivalently 16, but um, you could pick your favorite D, not zero. Kind of a cute trick. I'm just now gonna, all right. So, okay, I want to kind of pause, and now we're gonna get into the weeds, so to speak. Um, I yeah, so how do we just maybe say again, how do we get? I just maybe I should say again how we get uh plenty of curves with with a solution. So, how we get plenty of curves with a solution for actually going to produce plenty of curves with rank one. How do we produce plenty of curves with rank one? First, we produce lots of curves with similar rank one. Then we walk over here and look at this theorem. Just ignore this hypothesis for a second. This theorem kind of basically says that those curves, at least when n is odd, so you have production, those curves actually have shaw being finite. Have SHA being finite, and if SHA is finite, then we concluded because SHA is therefore squared, that this C mod 2 must be coming from the rank apart. In other words, that this thing should not be zero. It cannot be zero if SHA is finite. And if this thing is not zero, well, that's because there's a non-trivial point. Okay, so that's how we get the second part of the theorem from this series input and then the thing I'm about to explain a little bit about. Okay, any questions about how to conclude? Any questions about how to conclude before I start talking about the circle method? Very good. Okay, so yeah, underlying this is a use of the circle method. And now, I guess I'm going to erase this, even though this is the theorem I'm talking about. Let me just rewrite quickly at the top: average equals three. Right, so the thing I'm talking about is average of G summer over the family like XQ plus YQ plus N. I have to write that inside the GSOM. Sorry, again. Average summer of XQ plus YQ equals N, and this thing over Q is the break. That's what I'm talking about. And okay, you will have to trust me that it doesn't move to Irish conditions. New cryptoverse conditions. Okay, so you know, average size of cellular type results are, I guess, pretty well known now. So, you know, you can imagine how it starts. So let B V, I'm going to write it in a strange way. AKA, the space, pairs of F1 and F2 pair of. Of binary cubic flux. So, what is the binary cubic form? Binary means it's a polynomial in two variables. Cubic form means that it's homogeneous of degree three. So, each of these has four coefficients. A typical one is like sum of AI, x to the i, y to the three minus i. This sim lower three is saying something Congress condition law three is just sorry, it doesn't matter. Eyes, but I'll just doesn't matter. So that's B, that's my space. And G is basically SL2 squared. It's basically SL2 squared. SL2 acts on these. Let me just say this is like f of xy. SL2 squared acts on these pairs. There are two actions of SL2 that commute on these pairs. One action is kind of like on the outside. You can take linear combinations. You can take linear combinations of a pair of binary qubit forms and produce another pair of binary qubit forms. So it's kind of like the outside on the outside, as I'll put it. That's like action on the two here. And then you can act on like the inside. You can change variables. You do linear change to the variables, and that preserves being a cubic form. So this action is, you know, SL2 cross SL2. This one acts on the outside. I don't know if this is helpful for me to write that. This is actually an insightful change where it just linear combos up to MY. Okay, so good. So GX on B, the space of polynomial invariance. So I'm going to write it like this. Take, I'm going to write it in shorthand. Polynomial invariance. Polynomials in the coefficients. Polynomials in the coefficients of these two binary cubic forms. There are eight coefficients. Take polynomials and those eight coefficients, which are invariant under the action of SL2 cross SL2. This is generated by two polynomials with no relations between them. So I'm going to call I2 and I6. And this is like degree two, homogeneous to two. And patient suggests this is homogeneous to degree six. I'm going to write this one down. Ignoring constants. I'm going to write it down. Okay, so having set that up. Okay, so having set that up, there's a parameterization by Monde Bordova and there's two summer elements of okay, you're gonna maybe say why are you talking about this curves y squared plus a2 xy plus a6 y equals x cubed. y equals x cubed. A cubed number element of that is in bijection with locally, I'm just going to ignore this equation, but I have to write it because it's like the Selmer condition. Locally soluble pairs of integer binary cubic forms. So that vector thing is a pair of binary cubic forms such that I'm always ignoring constants twos and threes or whatever. I2 is specified. I2 is specified. I'll just say it. I2 is specified, and so is I6. So, kind of like you took the totality of all these elliptic curves, this family of elliptic curves, and you took the totality of all their two-selling elements. That would basically just be the totality of all pairs of binary cubic forms. However, to get a particular curve's two-selling elements, that's restricting these two invariants to be these two coefficients, basically. Okay? Basically. Okay. Okay. So now you're going to say, or maybe you're thinking, like, why am I talking about this other family of Liptic curves? I guess I can write it quickly here. So this is kind of the universal family of Liptic curves with a Mark's 3 torsion point, namely x equals y equals 0. And we have a family of Liptic curves. Time to write it. So our family of Liptic curves was x cubed plus y cube equals n, which remember was isomorphic to. Which remember was isomorphic to y squared equals x cubed minus 4/32 and squared. Still not looking like it has a three-torn point, but remember that was isogenous all over q to y squared equals x cubed plus 4n squared. Now this has a three-torn point, x equals 0, y equals, for example, plus or minus 4n. So it should fall into that family. How does it fall into that family? I'm going to write it as y squared plus zero times. y squared plus zero times xy plus a n and uncomplete the square times y equals x change okay so this is actually our the family that we're interested in okay i should also say i'm trying to show these lots of these have rank zero for example but the rank doesn't change when i you know run an isogeny so i can show lots of these have rank zero or deal with the average size of two solar groups of these curves um and to show that well here's this family this is the same family of loops curves This is the same family that looks occurs, and I'm looking at this parametrization. And what do I see? I'm not really ignoring the eight, ignore constants. I'm not really restricting this sexic invariant, but I am restricting the quadratic invariant. So for this family of cubic twists, I somehow have to manage to count two summer elements where the quadratic invariant vanishes. Okay, so I'm actually going to write the quadratic invariant, but I'm just going to say catchphrase. That's a quadric in arithmetic statistics. Logic and arithmetic statistics. So, you know, and turns out good. Okay, so I'm just gonna keep erasing. I'll leave this little thing up because it doesn't take much space. Okay, so yeah, so let me just state the, so to speak, full family. So, to speak, full family counting theorem, Bargava and Ho. Using this parametrization, we're able to say that the average size of two Selmer, I'm going to write it slightly more precisely, AI, there are only two of them, A2 and A6, it's most like x to i, let's say. So, two Selmer of the full family, excuse me, curves, A2 XY, A6Y, X cube cube. This average is three because I wrote a little parameter x. Um, this is it's three in the limit, three plus a little. Um, okay, so they were able to count using this parameterization. Like I said, you look at the totality of all elliptic curves in this family, maybe with bounded invariants, like here, or boundary coefficients, and then you have to deal with binary cubic forms, pairs of binary cubic forms with bounded invariants. About our nerves. Okay, so this is kind of like counting in V of Z, where you're allowed to use using G of Z to get your two cell variants into decent, or your pairs of binary cubic forms into a decent normal form. So that you have a chance of counting. So that, you know, the coefficients aren't like incredibly skew. One coefficient isn't like a bajillion, the other is. One coefficient isn't like a bajillion, the other is all at once. So, this is by counting in V of Z. Okay, so now I've said in the family that we're interested in, we want to count where this quadratic invariant vanishes. Just for concreteness, may as well write it just so something sensible is written. Yes. The i next to the i, three minus i, and this i. And this I2 invariant is A0B3. There's always like an invariant bilinear form on pairs of pairs of binary X, A3, B7. So we're trying to count pairs of binary cubic forms, meaning just A's and B's. So eight tuples of integers, where this particular quadratic polynomial vanishes. Okay, so we're counting, that's what. Okay, so we're counting. That's what I mean by counting in V of C. This is like a c to the eighth, just maintain the tuples of as will be coefficients. Um so how much more do I want to say? So if you're counting, I guess I do have managed to go fast enough that I actually have time to say a little bit more technical stuff. So I apologize. Okay, let me just write something. Just correct something? So, for the analytic number theorists in the audience, you know, this is like I'm trying to impose a quadratic. I'm trying to count points on a quadric in eight dimensions, or I'm trying to count points on the quadric in eight variables over the integers. That sounds really easy for analytic number theorists. You just say, oh yeah, the circle method will eat that up, spit it up. Method will eat that up, spit it out, you get your everything you want, great and return, etc. Um, okay, so that's why I specify exactly what the counting problem is because it's not completely easy, I think, but uh, I guess it is easy, but you don't use a circle method to make it easy in total generality. So the actual catting problem, counting problem pretty much. It's pretty much trust me. You have to count the number of A's and B's. So there are eight troops of integers, C to the A, such that, okay, this quadratic invariant should vanish. Okay, by the way, if anyone checks on the computer, oh, it's invariant with SL2 growth, SL2. I omitted some threes. This quadratic invariant should vanish. Vanish and the AIs to be bounded by okay, there are going to be three parameters. So the A's are going to be bounded by T1. T1 is kind of going to control how skewed the AI is allowed to be. Like A0 is going to be allowed to be a lot smaller than A, or anyway, A3's are going to be allowed to be a lot bigger than A0 is. And this lambda parameter is going to control how big they are allowed to be in general. I'm only kind of writing this in case someone wants to kind of see the actual analytic issue. So, lambda is like bigness, bigness parameter. And the t's, I'm just going to draw the standard bundle on the domain, SL2G acting on SL2R mod that's maximum compact. So, I'm just going to act like this is like SL2Z acting on SL2G. See acting on SL2R. So 2R bound expects to move back because I'll craft play. So the T's, the T's are kind of like in this picture, you know, because our group is like SL2 plus SL2. You can imagine there are two T's. And in this picture, they're kind of controlling how high you are in the cost of this fundamental domain. In other words, like the imaginary part. So that's what they control. But anyway, in more concrete terms, they control how skew this box is allowed to be. So we're trying to count, this is the counting problem. We're trying to count the numbers. Is the counting problem we're trying to count the number of solutions of a quadratic homogeneous quadratic in this kind of box where it's allowed to be some of the skewed and this is okay if the box is approximately a cube by the circle method so when I said oh the circle method will eat this up and spit it out easy peasy that's if the box is a cube or you know in other words if the skewness parameters If the skewness parameters, the ti's are less than like lambda to the you know 0.001, some little tiny power of this bigness parameter. And it's also okay. How to say this? So when I say okay here, I mean you get the correct asymptotic. So get, so this is asymptotic to the constant, the number of such solutions times lambda to the sixth. You know, there are lambda to the eight possibilities, ignoring the skewness parameter, length of eight possibilities for the a's and Left and eight possibilities for the a's and b's because there are eight of them and they all go up to lambda. And the number of solutions of a quadratic, which is the left-hand side is of size like lambda squared. The probability that this thing of size lambda squared is actually zero, it should be like lambda to the minus two. So the number of solutions should be with lambda to the sixth, and that's what the circle method gives you. It gives you a product of local densities times lambda to the sixth, and you're happy. But if the box is not a cube, in other words, if you're really high in the cusp, you're not like you know counting around here, you're counting like way high up, then you get. Then you get the number of solutions is the multiple lambda to the sixth plus epsilon if box is not is very skewable. I just wrote very skew down there if you can't see. So in other words, if one of the t's is really big, like polynomially large lambda, so the box is not even close to a cube, then there's an easy way to get within an epsilon of the correct asymptotic. Of the correct asymptotic, and that's by a divisor-bound argument, which I'm not going to explain. But basically, like, imagine you have something like this. I can actually point to this. This vanishes, fix everything but A0 and B3. That's six other coefficients of the tuple, entries of the tuple. There's limited to six possibilities for these entries. And then for this to vanish, it means this product must be equal to this number, the number of divisors of this number. The number of divisors of this number is very small. That's the divisor bound type argument. This is not the correct asymptotic. It's not sharp. However, I'm not going to write it down, but in the Arab Medicine six arguments, you integrate against Harmeasure, you integrate point counts against Harmeasure. And Harmeasure converges quickly, like very quickly, hiding the cusp is all I'll say. So the convergence of Harmeasure is much faster than this loss of epsilon. And that's why. Than this loss of epsilon. And that's why it's not kind of deadly. Like if our measure here, for this t is like a t to the minus two dt over t. Imagine integrating that where t is at least lambda to the 0.01 or something. Even if you multiply this by like a t to the epsilon, you're still going to get a power seconds. And that's all I'm going to say. Thank you. Thank you very much. Do we have some questions? Yeah. In principle, could you do the same thing for square plus fourth power? Ah, square plus fourth power. Let me think about it. Let me think about it. I don't know off the top of my head. I haven't thought about it. So just like a simple question, if you replace XQ plus YQ. Simple question: If you replace x cube plus y cube with an arbitrary planary cubic form, can you do this? Ah, uh, I think that's I mean, geometrically, every planary cubic form is not much you choose. Um, let's see. Uh, I don't want to say anything definite, but I have to think about sorry. I, we, the point is, when we started writing a paper where we were getting a result about. Where we were getting a result about every binary qubit form. And then we realized we could get this and kind of threw that paper out. And now I don't remember if this was working out for every binary qubit form. So let me just say, I don't know. And I'm pessimistic, but I'll think about it. It's reducible that you don't get to quite in complete. Yeah, yeah, for example. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. So it's not a family of elliptic curves anymore. And, you know, you're taking two Selmer, you can talk about two Selmer size of two Selma group with a. Two summer size of two summer group of the Jacobians, but I don't want to say anything wrong. And like a lot of special stuff had to happen, or I guess it could still be a twist family, I guess. But anyway, a lot of special stuff had to happen where we just like, you know, can use the circle method by reducing, by using a parameterization for some kind of whole family and just needing some quadratic invariant to vanish. So that's why I don't want to say any definite. So let me just act like this is only for sums of two cubes. Yes, Avi. Sure. So, I mean, it seems like one way you can go with this problem is you have this nice like sum of two cubes is equal to n, and then you can interpret it in this language of: I'm going to, you know, look at, you know, look at these sort of orbit parametrization results and then extract out one invariant that sort of defines this family of curves and then go analyze that with the circle method. But do you know if there's other, like, suppose you start with some orbit space of interest that maybe parametrizes families of elliptic curves? Families of elliptic curves, and then you find some nice quadratic invariant. Is there sort of a natural way to sort of look for these boxes of members with nice representation theory that do have this vanishing quadratic invariant and then find nice interpretations for those problems and then get results in the same way? Yeah, so the problem of counting probably is not such a big deal. I have a paper on the archive where it's called Quadration and Arithmetic Statistics, where I talk about like Where I talk about like counting problems where you have a project vanishing. However, the fundamental issue is interpreting what these representations are parametrizing and so, or these orbits are parametrizing. And so, yeah, I don't know, where does this come from? Not this result, but like this observation that this some family like this, you know, you can average the two-sommer group, sorry, the two-solver group. There's a paper. Sorry, the two song group. There's a paper by one of these papers, I think, by Munjal and by Bargiva and Ho, and they have some kind of table. And you know, when I was a grad student, I was like, okay, this is quadratic technique. And I went through the table and I was like, let's look for twos in the, you know, which one of these have quadratic invariants? And, you know, you have to sit and try and interpret. So I don't know. Yeah. There's one case where you get, I got kind of lucky in interpreting, and that was in my thesis. And there's here's a second case. Yeah, excellent. If I remember correctly, I think there is some work by Seguera and Rodriguez in the case of primes, right? Primes as some of two cubes. I'm wondering, this technique has something to say in the case of primes. The case of primes is very interesting. Does the technique have something to say? It's scary because when you're trying to cut down the primes, you're trying to sum like a scary multiplicative functions. Scary multiplicative functions on, or anyway, scary arithmetic functions on the sexic invariant, like you're trying to sum like a Lambda function on the sexic invariant. That's terrifying to me. Even if you have eight variables, summing lambda of a polynomial is scary. Sagi and Rodriguez Piagas, I don't, I should have reminds me that I didn't cite the root number observation, but there is a conjecture of Sylvester about which primes are a sum of two cubes. And I And I don't know much more about that than kind of Sylvester's conjecture. But yeah, I guess back in the day, Sylvester ran the... Oh man, I forgot to say this. Okay. I'm just going to first say what Sylvester did. Here's my family of elliptic curves. Alternatively, y squared equals x cubed minus 432 n squared. I already showed you. This has a three isogeny out of it. So Sylvester for primes did the kind of three isogeny descent. Three isogeny descent and realized that for primes, like he was proving that some of these curves don't have points by running a three-isogeny descent. And some of these curves look like they may have points because of three-isogeny descent. So he made some conjecture based on the answer he was given. And now I remember that I forgot to say that the entire time I was talking about averaging sizes of two somersaults, this is not part of the answer to your question. I was talking about averaging size of two somersault, the most natural thing to do in this family. The most natural thing to do in this family would have been to average the size of the P-isogeny self-group, like the three isogeny self-group, because that's what it comes with. It comes with the three isogeny. The average size of the three isogeny self-manager group is infinity. So you can't conclude. You can't do this like a game where you're like, well, three is small enough that we can conclude that there are plenty of ones or something using that. And that's why you have to, well, you don't have to, but that's why it's like sensible to go to Two Summer. But Two Summer is weird from the perspective of the family. Summer is weird from the perspective of the family because, like, the family is not like a two-ish family, it's like a three-ish family, you know. And so, the weirdness of that two-summer is why you get some weird stuff where you don't do it. Sorry, that was not before the server. Yeah, specifically, you had these examples at the beginning, so like six is the sum of two rational cubes, but not the sum of two integer cubes. So, that makes me think, like. Makes me think: like, what is the conditional probability that n is the sum of two rational cubes given that it is not the sum of two integer cubes? Ah, probably a half because the probability that it's not a sum of two integer cubes is one. Unless I did that wrong, but someone. Okay, someone's nodding their head, so I hope I didn't. The probability that integers are sum of two integer cubes is zero. So the next one is right. The probability that it is the sum of two integer cubes. Right, the probability that it is the sum of 200 cubes is zero, so the probability that it isn't the sum of 200 cubes is one. So if you condition on that, nothing changes. And so, not that I can prove the probability is a half, but the expectation is that that probability would also be a half. And that is also why I forgot to kind of mention it again. That's why I said, you know, this talk is also producing plenty of integers, which are not the sum of two integer cubes, but are the sum of two rational cubes, because so few integers are the sum of two integer cubes, but you know, plenty of integers are the sum of two rational cubes. Plenty of integers are this two rational.
