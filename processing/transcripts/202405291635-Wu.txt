I would like to start by thanking our organizers for the invitation and Professor Du's introduction. I also want to express my gratitude for this opportunity to give an online talk. And today, I would like to give a brief introduction about our work in recent years. And this talk is based. Years. And this talk is based on serious work with Dr. Yen Yu Chen from National Taiwan University and Professor Nomia from Meiji University. Okay. Okay, so as we may know that several patterns can be observed in various excitable media. State accessible media and our motivation comes from some interesting patents. So, for example, if you take this picture, this shows the wave propagation in our brand, and this is space, this is time. So you can see the traveling wave solution can be observed here. And also, we can see the spiral wave or target wave. Wave or target wave when we consider BZ reaction. And another example is so-called the V-shaped waves. So in 1995, the authors, they did an experiment in a liquid BZ reaction as the excited medium. They use this is a severe A severe wire with a suitable shape, and they put in the liquid. And they observed that the wire constantly emitted a V-shape, V-shape wave. It's like this. So of course, the free ends of the wire would be put as close as possible to the boundary of the petri dish. Otherwise, we will. Dish. Otherwise, we will see a spiral wave in the petrol dishes. Okay, so these patents appear in the real world. So mathematically, we may ask, can we consider, can we construct something like these patents in excited media? So to do that, let's start with the paper done by Chen, Kosaka, and Ninomiya. Kosaka and the Ninomiya about 10 years ago. So they consider Pizugu Nagumo type equation. We have a U and a V variable. It's a two component system. And the U here can be seen as the activator. And the V can be seen as the inhibitor. So activator can diffuse, but the V, the inhibitor, does not diffuse. Does not diffuse. And for the reaction turn here, we have a small parameter epsilon appears in the reaction turn of U. And you can see F epsilon is the defined as here. And you may see if the epsilon is zero, then the equation of U becomes the Ellen Khan equation. So with the So with the reaction turn of G, here they choose the function G1U minus the rational function of V. So it's called the Fizzun Nakumo type model because as you know, for the standard Fizzy Gun Nagumo model, the people use the linear function G1U minus G2V. Sorry. V oh sorry G2V and plus G3. Yeah, so why they use this function? Because we would like to look for patents in excited median, which is more stable system because the excitable median supports two states. One is excited states and the other one is the resting state. So it should be the monostable system. Should be the most stable system. So, with the spatial G, you can see the new of Longlinear functions can be drawn in this picture. And the red curve is the Newcland of G and of V equation in the ODE sense. And the blue curve is for U. So you can see when you drop this. See when you draw this, when you pick this spatial G, and you can see the graph is looked like this. There is a vertical asymptote. So when epsilon is very small, due to the graph of G, you can see there is only one equilibrium, which is stable. So this is a monostable system. Otherwise, if you choose the standard types, you will see for Types you will see for any small epsilon, they could have it's become bicepable case. Yeah. So this is why they use the spatial function g. And for this system, it's still difficult to study the global dynamics or try to construct the patents because there is no comparison maximum principle. So typically, when we put the epsilon here, When we put the epsilon here, we may just pack the epsilon 10 to 0. And formal analysis will give us the following limiting system. So today we will focus on this special limiting system. So the limiting system, let me show you here. The limiting system, okay, so formally you can see due to the Due to the structure of F, when epsilon is very, very small, then we have two stable states, U equals to one and zero. So for U, immediately, when the diffuse does not work at the first stage, the U will converges to one, either converge to one or converge to zero. So we may expect that there is something like an interface appears. So inside here, u epsilon. Inside here, u epsilon is close to 1. Otherwise, u epsilon is close to 0. Yeah. So this region we just call it omega of t. So you can see here omega of t can be viewed as an excited region. Okay, so the limiting system here, the first equation, we have v here, capital V here, is outer normal velocity. It's a growth speed along the A growth speed along the outer normal vector, and the direction is they point from omega t inside to outside. And the interface, if the v is positive, we call it the front. V is negative, we call it a back. All right. And here we have W V by the thing. By the singular limit analysis, we can derive that Wv equals to A minus B V. So, here A is related to alpha here. So, A actually is a square root of 2, alpha, and B is related to beta here. So, you can see this is very important. Otherwise, if alpha and beta is equal to zero, then Equal to zero, then the normal velocity without the curvature, normal velocity here would be exactly zero. Then we do not have a special temporal patterns. Okay, so for V equation here, we have a function g to describe the motion of the dynamics of v. And here, chi omega t is a corrected function or indicator function. or indicator function of omega t is defined in the usual way. So this problem is a 2D problem because a space domain is dimension is two. So what kind of patents we can observe? Okay, so here's some reference about the related work. So what kind of patents for this, what are spatial temporal patents can What are spatial temporal patents can this interface problem generate? Okay, so the first is traveling spots studied by Chen Kosaka Ninomiya 10 years ago, and also high-dimensional case is done by Chen Ninomiya and Takuchi in 2015. So they show that, so here C is wave speed. Wave speed. They show that if C is between zero, it's less than A, then they have a troubling spa. So, what is troubling spa? It's a spatial solution. So, you can see this picture. So, it's a 2D. So, troubling spa, this is a profile V. Troubling spa means there is a spatial solution that means the solution will move along the X direction. The x direction with the speed c without changing its shape. So this is called omega. This is omega or say omega 0. Yeah, this is so-called the traveling spot. So they show that when c is less than a, there exists a traveling spot. And the shape of omega could be convex or non-convex. Depends on the value of A. On the value of A. When A is 10 to 0, then they can show that the solution, the chopping spar, the shape, looks like the disk with the radius 1 over A. But when C is close to A, then the shape becomes non-convex. And eventually they will converge to a traveling wave, planned wave, locally uniform. Locally, uniformly in y-axis, yeah, in y-variable. Yeah, so a natural question is: how about those c bigger than A? So, to do that, we expect there would have a V-shaped wave because it looks like this is V-shaped wave. And when C tends to A, the V-shaped wave will tend to this planar wave. So it's quite natural. Quite natural. Okay, so to do that, we consider unbounded excitation region. We consider there is a front equation here and there is a back equation here. And between them, there is an excited region. So we put y equals to phi of xt and put into our equation. And put into our equation here, then we can see the problem reduced to a system with the quasi-linear parabolic equation. And here we have W depend on V. So this V is changing time. V satisfied the 1.3. It's actually ODE. Actually, it's the ODE. In the excited region, the V is equal to G of 1 V. So you can see G of 1 V here. We put the U equals to 1 due to our assumption, this is always positive. So V is growth in the excited region. On the other hand, if you consider X Y belongs to resting region, then Uv equals to G. Then uv equals to g0v. Then you put zero here, then you can see it's always negative. So that means v will gradually decay to zero if you consider the initial data is non-positive. Then it's graduated to close to zero in the resting region. Okay, so can we find the V-shape traveling wave? The answer is positive because Is positive because we have previous work, Ninomiya sense and the Taniguchi sense. They show that the existence of front. So let me say something more. So firstly, this picture shows the bird's eye view of the V-shaped traveling wave. So we will have a V-shaped front and a V-shaped back, and V-shaped front will And Vichy front will satisfy this equation with a plus index. And the back will satisfy this equation with the minus index. So if we put the traveling wave form in this equation, then we can show if the solution exists, then this part, the white part. This power, the white parts here above par the v should be identical zero, identical zero. So, if you consider the cross-section here, the point A in front of the point of A, the green part, the V, always zero. Yeah. And then for the continuity, you put the V equals to zero into this point, then take a look at the equation. a look at the the the equation then the the disapp the the effects of v disappear so w becomes a constant a so the equation reduce to the one studied by uh nomiya sensei and and and taninguji sensei so we can show the exist of the uh v-shaped front just exactly the the front of uh the uh of uh the one started by Of the one studied by them. And then from this value, we can solve all the because it's a traveling wave. So we can determine the back and we can determine the width of the region, of the excited region. So it turns out that we can show when C is bigger than A, then we have such kind of V shape. So the first part we want to show you is that exactly we have a V shape travel. We have a V-shaped charger when C equals is bigger than A. So this shows how the patents when C move from zero to very across A. So this is our first part. And second part is, can we study the long-time behavior of the solution? So in this case, we may need to consider initial variables. Consider the initial value problem, but to reduce the difficulty and the complexity, so we just consider 1D case. So, when x just consider in the 1d, we do not have curvature, so we just drop the curvature. So, this becomes v equals to a minus b v, and satisfy this ODE equation, and we put the initial data omega 0. When t equals to 0. Data omega 0 when t equals to 0, initially we have a finite many intervals which describe the excited region. And we give a bounded Libchus function of V naught. And for the well-posedness, we also need to make sure for each interval at the end point, the wave speed cannot vanish. Wave speed cannot vanish. Otherwise, we will have more than one solution. It's an eopaused. So, under H1 and H2, we would like to explore the long-time behavior of the solution. Okay, so from the 2D case, we can just consider the cross-section, and we can expect that in 1D, we have something like the traveling wave looks like this picture. Looks like this picture. So, this picture in 1D will determine the whole dynamics. So, we will say that this equation, this solution, traveling pulse, is very important. So, because we do not have a curvature, so in 2D, we need the C is bigger than A to make sure there is a V-shaped traveling wave. But without the curvature, we can show that such Such kind of a wave exists if and only if C equals to A. So the shape of V is moving to the right with the speed A. Okay, so let's see. Consider this, if initially we just put the two excited region, the green interval, two green interval, and then we assume initially the W sign is the negative. The W the sign is a negative, positive, positive, positive. So it turns out that initially we under H1H2 we can show the local existence of the solution. And here, because it's a classical sense, here V equals to W is nothing but these ODE equations. So we can solve it locally. Yeah. And then after that, we will meet some trouble because, for example, Some trouble because, for example, in this part, you can see if the interface does not change sign, then they probably will collide with each other, right? So actually, we can show all interfaces cannot change the direction of the propagation if the solution exists. That means these two interfaces will collide with each other. So, in that case, the solution cannot be defined in the classical sense. So, we have to The classical sense. So we have to introduce the notion of weak solution. So it's nothing but integration the equation with the test function and using the integration by par. It's just a traditional PDE argument. But it's a little bit complicated. So I would not write down the detailed definition for the weak solution. We just give you some concepts, some concept about the idea. Some concept about the idea. So we can show the local existence and we can show that each interface can be represented by the straight monotone function of t, something like this, until some interface collides with each other. For example, this case happened, then we call it the annihilation occur. And after that, say t equals to t capital A. equals to T capital A. So we have to say the solution can be extended. So we need to define the weak solution for because of the appearance of the tip. So fortunately, we can do that. We can define the weak solution and consider when the solution beyond the time capital T A. So after that, fortunately, we can show after a large, large, long time. A long time, the weak solution again becomes a classical solution because when time is large enough, there is no annihilation. So the solution becomes a classical solution, which allows us to study the global dynamics. So our results show that for this initial value problem, 1D, the solution of P exactly have three cases, can be classified to three categories. to three categories. The first case is eventually the solution, the excited region disappear. Yeah. And for example, initial we have two excited regions and something like this disappear. So after this time, after this time, there is no excited region. There is no excited region. So, in that case, V tends to zero uniformly in X. And the second case is we will have the solution converges to a series of traveling paths propagating to both direction. So, yeah, that just see this picture. So, initially, we have four excited regions, and then when T is larger, no, the excited region is. The excited regions look like four traveling paths. And the propagate, the propagation speed is A. It's moving to the right with the speed A. This is moving to the left with a speed A. And the width between two excited regions converges asymptotically to some positive constants. So the width here is LO. So the width here is L P. And between two excited regions, the length tends to infinity. It's basically more than, it's at least the log t. Yeah, we can show that. And the long time behavior of V is exactly a series of traveling paths propagating to the both direction. All right. All right. And the final part is the case two is the middle part is the resting region. And the third case is the middle part is excited region. So it's similar to the second part, but the middle part is different. So you will see the origin part will tend to infinity. This is a little difference. All right. So this is our second. All right, so this is our second part, the results. So the first part, time is limited. I just give a very quickly review. So we would like to ask after we consider initial very problem, it's very natural to ask tender problem support entire solution, entire solution due to the talk of Tanikuji Sen said. Everybody should understand what we want to do. Understand what we want to do. So we consider the whole classical solution defining the whole space and the time. Yeah. So it turns out that we can show there is a periodic wave trend when speed is less than a. So we can construct this is x and this is periodic in x. So we have something like this. And the period is L. Yeah. Yeah, and so if you consider the both eye view, you can see this solution is tell us we have this pattern. There are infinitely many excitable region, which define the whole space. Yeah. So after we have this kind of wave chain, then we can using the refraction, we cut it this part and using the refraction argument. The refraction argument, then we can construct another pattern. It becomes a time-periodic solution. Yeah, and also, moreover, we can show that the C and the period L is one-to-one correspondence. C is a function of L and it's a strictly increasing function. Here, we this picture we assume A is one. Yeah, so after that, we may So, after that, we may ask: can we have some other entire solution? So, it turns out that it becomes a complicated issue. And we need, again, we need a weak solution, the notion of weak solution, because for example, in this spatial solution, we have a tip here. We will need some annihilation occurs, so we need the weak solution. Solution. All right, so we do can give some results, but the time is limited. I think I should stop here. So thank you for your attention. Are there any questions, comments? How about the people online? Are there any questions? Can I make a chang? So you say C equals A reform pulse becomes planar. Pulse becomes planar and C goes to the sun A it is traveling spot. So Crana is yes, it's uh horizontal and traveling spot is finite. So it suddenly becomes from the unbounded strike to the Strike fills up, yeah, suddenly bounded over. Yes, is that right? Yes, yes, yes, yes, but I think the chopping spot is uh unstable, yeah. So it's uh and so how about the train-attarine pulse? Yeah, join pulse should be stable, so suddenly becomes unstable to yeah, it's kind of a bifurcation, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, very interesting. Thank you, Jamo. Thank you. Any other questions? So, if no, then let's thank Sahol again. Thank you.
