I know a lot of us have very different names in this room, including myself. So if you want to know how to pronounce my name, it's not that important to me. But if you want to know, you would pronounce it with a UH at the beginning. So it's Uh, mean. All right, so when I was thinking about what to make for a talk, I went back to the email that Nell had sent around, and I wanted to highlight some of the key phrases out of that email. And so some of them are here so we could talk about connections between different areas of Between different areas of population biology, discuss unsolved problems. And so, in that theme, I created this talk. It's not something I've ever talked about before, and it's not a normal kind of talk. So, please interrupt me for any discussion as I go through. So, in this vein, I wanted to start by thinking about how we think about local adaptation. And so, when I think about it as an evolutionary population biologist, Population biologists, I think about it something like this. So, local adaptation is a balance between migration and selection, and then we add some spice on top of it. So, that spice could be the genetic architecture, it could be having a linked neutral locus, it could be including a BDMI so that you can have continued complete speciation. And then we take this model, do equilibrium or stability analysis, and then you get local adaptation, and from that. And then you get local adaptation, and from that, we can make inferences about a wide range of applications. And what I want to do today is I want to turn this story around. So I want to say, okay, if I go out and I observe local adaptation, what does that tell me about migration and selection and that spice that I added up on top? And from that, what do I know about these subsequent processes? So this begs this one question. begs this one question can we infer migration selection parameters the basics of that local adaptation story from local adaptation data so I started with the simplest model because I said let's just start with the case where you don't have any spice and see if I can deal with a very bland local adaptation story so I have a mainland and there's some migration rate onto an island and there's a big AO deal that is And there's a big A allele that has no fitness on the mainland, so the little A allele is completely fixed here, and it has some selective benefit on the island. And we know implicitly that you're going to get, under some conditions, you're going to get a polymorphism for that big A allele on the island. In particular, you're going to get a polymorphism when selection is stronger and migration is weaker. And then we can measure local adaptation as the fitness difference between individuals from the mainland. Between individuals from the mainland planted on the island and individuals from the island planted on the island. And you'll get most local adaptation when you're down here in the school. Okay, so taking this model, I paraphrase something that I have written before, which is all else being equal, local adaptation will increase as selection increases and increase as migration decreases. So, but we can learn something else from this fake. We can learn that fitness data alone, the difference in those fitnesses, Data alone, the difference in those fitnesses between the island and mainland, is insufficient to pull apart migration and selection. And we can see that because there's a bunch of lines in this plot. So there's a bunch of combinations of migration and selection that will give us the same amount of clinical adaptation. But luckily, we don't just have fitness. We can think about genotypes. So I've complemented this plot by adding FST to the plot. So now I've plotted FST and marginal fitness. And you can see that some of these. And you can see that some of these have lines that go like this, and some of them have lines that go like this. And this is ideal for increments. So we have lots of crossing lines, and so given some genetic information and given some fitness information, we should be able to pull apart migration and selection. But we don't live in a theory world. We live in a world with data. And so how would we collect data on this? Well, we would do a common garden experiment. This is a simple case of a more general experience. This is a simple case of a more general principle of reciprocal transplant, but a common garden is the only thing that makes sense in this geography. So here I have a bunch of individual blue individuals from the mainland, red individuals from the island. I'm planting them all on the island. They have different alleles, and then I measure their fitness. But of course, I don't measure their actual fitness. I measure a fitness proxy. And those fitness proxies have probability distributions. And not only do they have probability distributions, Only do they have probability distributions, we are only sampling a finite number of individuals from those distributions. And ultimately, we want to know: is there a difference in the means of these two distributions? So, can I actually pull that apart with finite data? So, this is the answer. On the bottom side, we have the true parameter value for either the selection coefficient or the migration rate. And then on the y-axis, I have the inferred parameter value. I have the inferred parameter value. In an ideal world, everything would land on the one-to-one line. I'd want to perfectly get back that true parameter value, and I'd have small confidence intervals. As you can see, that's kind of true, but not really true. And unfortunately, it's not true enough here. There's lots of confidence intervals over here that clearly overlap the confidence intervals on the other side of the plot. So this means that given this data. means that given this data alone I have no confidence that I got the right migration selection. Now I've colored these points by the amount of noise in the fitness proxy. So the more noisy your fitness proxy, the less good you do. But that is not sufficient to explain why I didn't do a good job of inferring migration and selection. Alright, so I want to go back to how we think about local adaptation. One way of thinking about Adaptation. One way of thinking about this is: I had the process of local adaptation as described by a theoretical model. I connected it to the pattern of local adaptation, which I got from these reciprocal transplant experiments. And this was insufficient to understand the evolutionary processes that created local adaptation. So I need some more information. What should I put down there? Well, luckily, we already have a well-developed subfield of local adaptation that goes there, which is That goes there, which is what I've called the context of local adaptation, which is this field of ecological genomics, which is that local adaptation doesn't just happen with consequences at a single locus or at the low site under selection. There's link selection and other patterns in the genome. And there has been a lot of work connecting combinations, pairs, of these processes. So, for example, you have meta-analyses that have been really aimed at connecting. That have been really aimed at connecting hypotheses that were drawn from theory to observed reciprocal transplant data. So, here is a list of meta-analyses in this field. And I just wanted to bring your attention to one of them because it's a really nice illustration of this by Greg Coskella, where they wanted to test a theoretical prediction that as you have more migration, you should have more robotic parasites, and they studied. Parasites and they study patterns of local adaptation across post-parasite systems to test this phenomenon. But if we want to resolve this issue of not being able to infer or understand fully the evolutionary processes underlying global adaptation, we need to fully integrate those three different pieces of the film. And so, how do we pull them together? And so, this is my proposal to you, and I'm totally okay if you don't think it's okay. Totally okay if you don't think it's okay. I want to hear that. That's why I'm presenting that this here today, which is that I propose that we use Bayes theorem to do this. So this just came from thinking about what these honames were, that this is a model, this is data, and this tells us something else about the parameters because of link selection or other patterns in the genome. So you can imagine combining them via Bayes' theorem into a likelihood and a prior, and then maybe this. And a prior, and then maybe this would give us enough sufficient information to pull apart those evolutionary parameters. And there's some appealing aspects of this, that by explicitly thinking about mobile adaptation in an inference framework, we're going to move away from these correlative analysis that we maybe see in meta-analysis to something where we can do explicit hypothesis testing and select between alternative evolutionary models. All right. Alright, so that is my proposal. And now, for the rest of the talk, I'm just going to give you little flavors of how thinking in an influenced way has led to something nice for me. So, the first question I asked is, what is the best fitness proxy for detecting low-player region? So, going back to the same model, imagine that we do this common and garden experiment, but we do it with three different types of fitness proxies. So, in one experiment, Proxies. So, in one experiment, we measure survival. So, this is a Bernoulli fitness proxy. In another experiment, I measured the number of flowers, or I just read a paper the other day that measured the number of leaves as a measure of fitness. And then the third one is some measure of, some continuous measure, so diameter, breast height, or body mass. And I want these distributions to be as similar as they can possibly be. So I'm going to keep their means the same and their variances the same when I'm. And their variance is the same when I can't. And I'm going to ask, what one gives me the best to signal a load modotation. And this is what you see. Over here on the left, so I can only compare them in pairs because I want to keep their means and their variances constant. And you can't ever set the binomial and the Bernoulli to have both of those the same unless they're the same distribution. So I'm going to do them comparisons in pairs. So I'm going to compare a Bernoulli to a north. So I'm going to compare a Bernoulli to a normal proxy and a binomial to a normal proxy. Hot values mean that I had a high probability of detecting local adaptation. Cold values means that I often failed to detect local adaptation. And not surprisingly, the stronger local adaptation is, the more likely you are to find it. But we can see that all else being equal, you do a better job finding local adaptation if you use a normally distributed fitness proxy rather than a bird new leak or Rather than a bird new leak or a binomial fitness proxy. And this was quite interesting to me because, in some ways, it's counter to how we often think about good fitness proxies. So we often think about good fitness proxies as those that are really close to a fitness component. So something that is directly related to how many offspring you ultimately produce. So something like survival or the number of ovaries and not something like body mass. But this is simply from a statistical perspective. But this is simply from a statistical properties perspective. A normal distribution does a better job. All right. So that was story number one. And so what do I want to do next? One of the things I want to do is think, okay, if we have this set of evolutionary models, what is that set of evolutionary models? Can I create a database of existing models of local applications? So ultimately, these are models of migration, selection, and balance. Of migration, selection, balance, and there's a lot of them. And so, working with a whole team of undergraduate researchers, we're starting to create this database of local adaptation models that have features like this. And so, I'm putting this up here. It's quite boring, but I would love your feedback on it. So, if you think, like, when you think about migration selection biology, you absolutely have to think about life history or something. I want to hear that. So, I know that I should. To hear that, so I know that I should include it in my database. But at the moment, it includes things like this: so, like, what was the ultimate focus of the paper? What was the genetics or phenotype of the trait under selection, up to characteristics about geography and like history, and some other evolutionary processes? So, whether or not there was drift and migration included, what kind of measures that they use to measure local adaptation. So, not all of them measure them as. So not all of them measure them as fitness differences. The ultimate aim might be measuring FST and then key methods that we're used. So this is where I am currently with this project and I would really love to hear your guys's. And so with that, I would like to thank Annabaza Kalufo and Simon Levy, who have worked with me on two different pieces of this project, and this amazing team who has been helping me put together this database. Me put together this database. And I just want to end because there's going to be a piece of this conference. This is about math education, math bioeducation. So everybody with a star after their name is an undergraduate researcher who took a math bio class from me. And so I offered to them, if this was intriguing to you, I don't have funds, but you're welcome to come and I'll help you read papers. And so this group of students were so excited about MathBiome that they came and have been trying to read. That they came and have been trying to read these maps out. So that's how I left it. Okay, to throw another complication in, I'm thinking of Grimes Triangle from ecology, where you have coloniser types that you may be, you know, locally, and you have competitor types and you have tolerant. Metadot types and you have tolerator types, and that's going to show up with different fitness proxies. And it could obviously, you know, when you sample from disturbed environments, you're more likely to get colour lines of types that will have a whole bunch of like history traits. When you sample from resource-rich, undisturbed environments, you're more likely to get competitor types that will have a different set of fitness traits. Are you able to look at that data through that lens at all? Because which fitness proxy is used is Fitness proxy is used, it's going to have a big impact. So, I'm going to work this into like my world, which is like hosts and parasites. So, you can totally imagine using a different fitness proxy for the host and the parasite. And so, if you're using which one is locally adapted, it's like who's winning the red and queen race or something, like you could get the wrong answer or infer the wrong thing just because of the statistical properties of the distance distribution. So, I, yeah, it's cool to think about. Yeah. To think about. Yeah, yeah. But yeah, the sampling. I think the thing about this is the drought clean stuff is so unpredictable. I mean, I guess the mainland is going to have more parasites than the island typically, but some of these other, these like history characteristics are going to vary in a predictable way across different local environments. Yeah, like where the statistical properties of the distribution themselves kind of evolve. Yeah. This is very, this is very This is very early, so I love that thought, and I'll keep it in my brain. So, yeah. I was wondering about, you said the normal fitness proxies are best for inferring parameters. I guess there's an all-L C quote somewhere, but because you can imagine measuring many different types of traits, some which are nicely, normally distributed but have nothing to do with fitness. So I was wondering I was in a model like In the model, you make some assumption that your body mass was pretty tightly linked with fitness rights. 100%. So, like, kind of merging these two different ways of thinking about what makes a good fitness proxy. So, one of the next steps that Simon is going to work on in this project is we have currently assumed a linear relationship between the two, but what if you have a non-linear relationship? And then ultimately, it would be fun to incorporate these in a life cycle and think about. These are life cycle and think about: like, is there different parts of the life cycle where you have the most statistical power to just have local education versus the others? But these are, yeah, those are cool questions down the road. Yeah. So, I mean, I wasn't able to sort of figure out exactly how you're doing the entire model, but it seems to me that you're finding that the more entropy you have in the fitness measure, the better you're able to reconstruct what was going on, right? Is that essentially what's happening? And if you don't think much of it. Essentially, what's happening, and then you don't think much of form distribution, would you then get it? You have even more power and so forth? No, I don't think so. Like, okay, so I don't know about the entropy part because I don't quite know what that means, but like, say, the uniform, the way I was thinking about it is it's kind of like doing a t-test, right? Like, for the normal distributions, it is a t-test. And it's just that the t-test for a Bernoulli distribution is really hard. And so, I'm guessing that what I was thinking was a uniform. So, what I was thinking was a uniform that it's quite hard to tell the difference between themes. I think I don't have a good intuition of the thing. I see, I see. Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. So, if we think about a lot of the fitness components like lifetime reproduction or something like that, they normally not normally distribute. They have very long trails. So, going to some measures like sizes, four body size, whatever number of War body size, whatever number of leaves, things like that, then we approach much more a normal distribution. And is that part of what you're picking up, or how do you deal with that? Yeah, yeah. So I haven't thought about that yet. This has been completely theoretical at this point of just like you pick these proxies and you do, you're totally right as the sample size, for example, in the binomial, the maximum number of successes increases, you get the same answer. Increases, you get the same answer depending on if you have a binomial or normal distribution. So, yeah, your intuition there is completely right. But one of the next steps is going actually to these meta-analyses and going through what kind of fitness measures people used and trying to think about how they would be distributed, what kind of tails they would have, if that would matter. Yeah. So, if you have, like, you have to do a negative binomial distribution. Negative binomial distribution, I would love to hear that. No, I was just gonna see, I have to go to this computer to find the chat, right? I was nothing in the chat. Okay, thank you. Pretty fun. Maybe a naive question, but in the models, is your differences because of a discrete versus a continuous distribution? Or is there, like, if you sort of use pinormal and started not ranking up the n and reducing the p and p, at some point it starts. At some point, it starts looking somewhat normal. And so I was wondering how much if it is like discrete versus continuous distributions. So we thought about this. I don't think I have enough distributions tested to answer that question, right? Because I can't independently change things like the skew from whether or not it's discrete or continuous. So I'm a little bit in this. It might be yeah, it would be cool to like extend this to other things like. To like extend this to other things, like I don't know, gamma distribution versus you know, a geometric distribution that maybe kind of looks similar, but like are one's continuous and one's discrete. Because I don't, to me, it doesn't seem like it's a discreetness thing as much as like a property of the skew or higher moments. But I'm not 100% sure. So, yeah, good question. Yes? Oh, uh, okay. Well, thank you very much. I found your talk extremely edifying, and I really liked the angle that you were talking about things that are meaningful. But I would like to ask your opinion on going to kind of the other extreme. Suppose we did this by machine learning or something. Measure everything. It doesn't matter what. And then you do an experiment. Then you do an experiment and you want to know whether the frequency of the red one is supposed to up and down. Okay, so how would you... So I love this because I think in a practical sense, actually going to the machine learning side is really useful. Or like, let's not even make a machine learning. Let's just do approximate Bayesian computation. From a practical side, I think that's probably what you'd have to do. But there is this power of thinking about it on the side. This power of thinking about it on this side to think: do we actually have enough information there? So, I think the two sides have to coexist, and yeah, so I want to kind of see how we can develop both the practical side of this, which may be more like black boxy, and the side of really asking, do I have enough information in my data? Are there an identifiability elements to this problem? Oh, sorry. Sorry. Go ahead, Dan. Maybe I missed it, but can you go back to the FSP slide and help me understand the right panel how to read it and how that led to the next part of your talk? Yeah, so when I was making this, I thought, okay, one of the things that you measure from a reciprocal trans-Quentin experiment is the differences in, the relative differences in fitnesses. So that's these blue lines. And then the other. Blue lines. And then the other key information: if I had data, genetic data, at the focal locus that's diverging, then I would have some measure like FST. And so I plotted those two and held those two chain over parameter space just to see if there was like perpendicular elements of information in the differences in allele frequencies. If I think about FST as differences in allele frequency, and then this marginal fitness as differences in fitness, do they give me perpendicular? Do they give me perpendicular consistency? So, this motivates the transforms. Yes. Yes. Thank you. One comment I want to come back to Joanna's question a little bit because in some ways she was asking about the type of work that you've done on density and how fitness measures at low and high density affect local transplantation and RNK selection. So I just wanted you to maybe share that information. That it does matter about how you measure fitness ecologically. How do you measure fitness ecologically in these models? So, this is like a little reference to a work that we did about range expansion and the accumulation of expansion load. And how much expansion load we measure depends on where you measure it if those fitness components are density dependent. And so, yeah, that's another thank you. I kind of made that connection that, like, yeah, we have to really think about like, and we see this already in local adaptation studies where people are really careful about thinking about. People are really careful about thinking about whether or not they remove competitors or how they clean the environment really quickly. But not necessarily for theoretical reasons. It might be for practical or just thinking what the plants need or what. Yeah. Very important. I think that might be a good time to go to coffee and then return at 10.40 when we'll be back on track. Thank you, Aline. Just a quick reminder, Zoom is still on in the room during the coffee presentation.
