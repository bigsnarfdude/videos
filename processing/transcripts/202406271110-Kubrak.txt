Yes. Thank you for the invitation. It's very nice to be in such a great group of people. And I have been learning a lot. I hope to add something with my talk. Yeah, so the talk will be quite computational. I will try to explain sort of a uniform way of computational. Of a uniform way of computation of a mode of higher classifying stack, where G can be more or less any flat mutative group scheme. So today we'll do some restrictions because theory needs to be changed quite significantly for the other cases. Yeah, and I hope to connect it to brow groups by considering the case of KGM2. All right, so yeah, but All right, so yeah, but I would like to start with classical topological situation, where somehow G is the discrete abelian group. So let A be an abelian group. Then, yeah, for each n, one can consider the corresponding Adenberg matline space, k A. Adenberg McLean space, A A M And its defining property is that if you look at its homotopy groups, you get A when I is equal to N and zero otherwise. And the way this is not how they actually construct it, but it's, I think, a good way to think about it, is that you start with A and you consider it just as a discrete space. And then it's a group, and you can consider its classifying space, B A. But then, this classifying space, it's again a group object in the category of spaces. And you can consider And you can consider it classifying the classifying space. And you can go on. And what you will get on end step will have exactly these homotopy groups. Right, but I would also like to Right, but I would also like to present another construction of that, where A can be replaced by any complex. This will be convenient. Yeah. So this BA really, like, or B whatever, it really has the same sort of universal property that it does in algorithmic geometry? Yeah, I mean, they describe torsors. So maybe I will also explain it just in a second, but I mean, the sort of you can think of this as functors on spaces, and if you just look at On spaces, and if you just look at homotopy clusters of maps from X to K A N, then you will get exactly nth singular cohomology X with coefficients and A. And in fact, you can describe the whole space, and it will be the same description as space of maps. It's just its space zero is given by this. By zero is given by this. So yeah, it describes sort of n germs, n a turbs on x. Okay, so yeah, let's now look more generally at the category of connected complexes considered as an infinity category, so the derived category. And yeah, so. Yeah, so in modern language you could also think of this as animation of the category of abelian groups. And this is also an infinity category which underlies the simplicial aberrant groups up to weak homotopy equivalences, up to quasi-homotopic equivalences. So this all are So, these all are the same thing if you consider this appropriately. Module structure and occupy. Yes, and from simplicial abiding group, you have a forgetful functor to simplicial sets, which are essentially spaces. Here you have a forgetful functor to animation of sets, which I will be denoting as spaces. And then the statement is that this This k, this construction of k n is just a particular case of the forgetful of this forgetful functor. Yeah, so this is forgetful functor right and k a n is exactly k applied to Exactly, K applied to A shifted by M. And this gives a recipe how to explicitly compute this Eidenberg-MacLean space as a simplicial set. So you can represent A of n by a simplified. A of n by a simplicial abelian group using Doltcan correspondence, and then just forget the structure of a group. You will get certain simplicial set. Yes, maybe it will be helpful to see that. So, yeah, I mean, you should really think of this thing as simplicial abelian groups and this as simplish sets up to some equivalences. And this is a forgetful functor, and it also has a left-adjoint. It also has a left adjoint, which is given by three Iberian groups on the simplicial set. And so this functor can use. So, this functor commutes with collimates, and on discrete sets, it just sends it to a linear combination, corresponding free abelian group. It's not hard to see that this functor to z of x, where x is a space, is in fact just equal to singular homology x with coefficients z. So, this is the free abelian group on a space x. Right, and using this adjunction, you can describe the maps to KAM, and in particular obtain this formula, namely maps spaces. So by this, I will mean space of maps from X to K M yeah, so I can see the Yeah, so I know this is right a joint applied to A shift M. So this will be the same at maps in D of Z greater than zero from singular homology of in Z to A shifted by N. Yes, and so again, how do I compute this mapping space? I should compute our homes in this category. Consider this as a complex, truncated below zero. This will give me some connective complex, and then I should forget to spaces. So, yeah, probably if you never seen this before, it's hard to follow, but it's given by the, yeah. It's given by the location. Yeah, sorry. So if I take linear arcoms, then what I will get will be exactly a singular cohomology of X with coefficients in A. Right. I will use another notation for singular cohomology because for in non-topological situation, this will be more convenient. But this means just cohomology. Yeah, so maybe better to write that this is K applied to tau greater or equal than zero of singular cohomology of X coefficients in A shifted by M. So I take my complex, I shift it on the left, I truncate at zero, that we get, I present it as a simply Schalaberian group. I present it as a simplicial abelian group. And I forget to the structure of simplicial set. Yes. And yeah, so if you look, what are homotopy groups of this space? So pi zero of this thing will be exactly H M singular at least coefficients in A and then pi one will be H Pi one will be Hm minus one and so on. So the pi n will be hd yeah so you will get an entruncated space with multiple group right yeah so now the question which So now the question which we'll be studying, in particular in this case, is so maybe I should add that these things really classify sort of cohomology. In particular, yeah, we get that homotopy classes of maps from X to K A N and pose the singular cohomology. And yeah, so we will be trying, question will be We will be trying question will be how to describe corresponding characteristic classes. So, having a cohomology class in XA, what classes in integral similar cohomology we can construct functorially on X. And the corresponding, the object which controls this is just the singular cohomology of the corresponding space. Yes. I mean, it also exists on the level of simplicial abelian groups instead. There it's even easier. You just reiterate it term-wise, take either a free abelian group or forget the structure of a group. But sort of the statement is that it descends nicely to the corresponding localization of the corresponding model categories. Or yeah, I mean, there are different sites where you can approach this. Sites where you can approach this. Right, but it's very useful to have these formal properties as you see. So some computations are just formalities. Yeah. So we'll be answering these questions. This question? Yes. And for this, the following notation will be convenient. Be convenient. So let A be a lattice. So by lattice, I mean just three finitely generated abiding group. And then so maybe one comment before. So if I can. Maybe one comment before. So, if I have a space X and it comes from a simplicial set X dot, so this is a presentation as a simplicial set of X, then if I want to compute singular cohomology of X, what I should do is consider the catalization of the Polympich show diagram, which is just given by They're just given by z to the power x dot. So these are functions, z valued functions on x dot. So this is a certain cost simpler diagram, and I can take the corresponding limit, homotopy limit. And this is the formula of a singular homology. But what I will be doing. But what I will be doing now is when, in the case when x is actually an abelian group, you can define a certain subset of devariated functions, which in fact will, as we will see, does not lose any information when you try to compute singular cohomology. So yeah, let's consider z to the power a. So this is some giant ring. Yes, but then But then inside this, there is an invalid natural subspace which is given by a dual. So this is a Z linear function. So this is home D from A to Z. And inside this, you can consider something which is prebinomial algebra on A bool. Binomial algebra on A bull. This is given by Z-variant functions represented by polynomials with rational coefficients. And maybe just to explain the notation, in the case, for example, when it's coming from binomial. So in the case where A dual is equal to Z, yeah, maybe A equal to Z, then there is a map X, which is. There is a map X, which is an identity map. And then bin of a dual is described as, yeah, this is a very old theorem. As Ben and your claims coming from Newton, but I'm not exactly sure. That's true. But so it's So it's a generated, it's a subring generated by binomial coefficients of x, where binomial coefficient is a polynomial with rational coefficients, which are given by x mod n. x choose n is this formal expression. Any z-valued polynomial function on integers is actually a linear combination of this, sorry, products of this. Yeah, it's generated by this binomial coefficients. Oh, yeah, they are based. Sorry. Right. Okay. So now, yeah, let me check. Benjamin is uh-huh. Yep. Right. So now let's assume I take a complex M inside D of Z greater or equal than zero, which is actually perfect. So it's commodified. So it's called modify generated and it's bounded below. Yeah. Then this M is represented by a simplist labelian group. This is a simple Schalabelian group. With M I I being the latest as yeah, for example, both cut can correspondence, if you apply it, just gives such a simplicity group. Right, and then if we take the limit, yeah, so applying this formula for singular pool module, if we take a limit of the corresponding diagram, for simplicial diagram, z of zero at one. The computes singular cohomology of yeah, so this computes singular cohomology of K of M Z because this is represented K M is in fact so it was a forgetful functor applied Applied, yeah, maybe I should have spelled out. So, this for Gessel functor you can apply term bytes. So, this is given by m dot, geometric realization of m dot. So this computes singular cohomology, and inside this quasimplicial algebra, we can consider quasimplicational sub-algebra given by these binomial things. Thanks. Let's call this embedding alpha m and proposition which Which, in some form, I think, is due to Dolt, then also Ecadal, and revisited by many people recently, is that if M is one connective perfect complex whose zeroth homology or zero score homology is zero. Uh, zero it only has homology starting from first homology group, then the map. Yeah, so maybe I should say there is a way to apply, to extend some functors by right to left kind extension. And what this thing computes, this limit, is the application of the derived version of this functor of binomial. Uh um yeah, binomial out of three binomial algebra to the two m check. So I don't want to yeah rigorously define for you this LDM, but uh yeah for these perfect things it is just uh uh write karn extended from uh three abelian three finitely generated abelian groups. Quite three finitely generated abiding groups. Yeah, and so this inclusion gives us a map from Lbin of M dual to single-commode of K M. And this is the proposition says that this is an equivalence. Is likewise isomorphism. And it's really not a difficult theorem to prove. Essentially, you formally reduce to a single case where M is Z shifted in to one, in one degree. Did some computation of yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. I don't want to spa spend time on it, but yeah, if you're interested, I can probably all right. But yeah, so this is nice. I mean, it gives some maybe more algebraic formula for cosmology of Heidenberg-Montmean spaces. But I will want to take a slightly different perspective. So I now want to deform this L-B to something even more sensible, maybe. Even more sensible, maybe. Like these binomial coefficients. Actually, if you try to do computations, it's quite hard. But yeah, I will now try to give another formula because this Adenberg-McLean spaces, which we will be able to generalize to any almost any finite flat commutative group scheme and nice hospital theory. All right, so Am I forgetting something? Yeah, so now observation is that bin of A dual as a functor in A has a natural filtration. Namely, by definition, this is given by things represented by polynomials, and we take the minimal degree of the polynomial which represents the polynomial. And if you take the associated gradient, this potentially, then this is canonically isomorphic to three divided. isomorphic to three divided power algebra on a dual. So again when A equal equals to Z then this gamma Z of Z is given by Of Z is given by. So, yeah, there we had binomial coefficients, but here we get the divided power algebra. And like the reason is that if you just look at the formula for binomial coefficients and you look at the leading term, you exactly get the divided power. So now, having this proposition, yeah, so now we get a deformation from beam to. Deformation from BIM to gamma, like having a filtration means that we have a deformation, and you can ask how non-trivial this deformation is. Like, can we replace in this proposition by non-L algebra by three-divided power algebra? And in fact, you almost yeah, it's almost painless to do this. Yes. Yeah, sorry, I'm losing place in my nose. Yeah, so maybe theorem which you can prove. And this is in a part of a joint project with Yegor Shuklin and Sasha Zaharov. Is that if let a Let A be a finitely generated abelian group. Then for any n greater or equal than one, there is an equivalence. Between singular cohomology of K A N with Z coefficients and three derived divided power algebra on a certain abelian group, on a certain complex. I will tell in a second what it is. Yes, and this is a more. Yes, and this isomorphism is as En minus one algebras. So maybe I should make a comment that this really gives, so both sides here have infinity algebra structures, and this is really an infinity algebra homework. Yes. Yes, so once, I think, yes. So, once you leave, so somehow cohomology is just cohomology on things like Allenberg-McLean spaces, literally just taking the valued functions on the Corispani-Berian group, appropriately understood. And then I just say that, yeah, if the group is connective, then you can, it's enough to consider polynomial functions. In this sense, it's algebraic. I don't know how to put it in bigger paradigm. How to put it in a bigger paradigm or something, like, but why would you expect this? But it's in a way, it's a version of maybe like, I mean, in the end, you can also prove some version of integral version of rational homotopy theory, like that maps between spaces can be represented by maps between cohomology with some extra structure. And this structure actually is a model of the corresponding monad. So this L-bin, it defines a monad. It defines a monad on the spaces, and yeah, so the statement that you can restrict to paranormal functions is closely tied to this. So, at least on Eidenberg-MacLean spaces, you can sort of represent all your objects purely algebraically in terms of some integer-valued polynomials. And this idea goes back to Equedal. Like, he essentially developed all this theory, but he did not have a nice formalism to do this. Formalism to do this. So the final result he gets looks a bit maybe ugly, but essentially it's all there. I don't think there is substantial. Yes. Yes, as a filtration, it has a functor, which you don't see on the right. No, there is no thing, nothing. But there are some works where people try to degenerate. Some works where people try to degenerate category of spaces or spectra to something, and I don't think there is like I'm not sure if there is a satisfactory result, which would be like maybe unstable or like when you don't do cohomology, but just on the nose from the spaces. And I think the idea is that at least p-locally a spaces should degenerate to some p-restricted Lie algebras. Even derived Lie algebras with something. Even derive the Lie algebras with something, but then something called dual should be some algebras. I don't know. But I think this, at least without any details, this looks similar to the generation from beam to gamma, because there are some divided power things appearing there. But I don't think there is any rigorous connection. Nevertheless, there is some pieces of theory which are more deep than this one. Deeper than this one. And yeah, some people are working on it. Yes. Oh, sorry. I can what? Like I got on this side? Yeah, good question. I don't know. Probably yes. I just have not thought about it. But yeah, I would think yes. But there are some maps. Yeah. I mean, it's functorial. So yeah, this boundary map induces some boundary maps. So maybe it does that, I guess. But on the other hand, the shifts of degrees will be different. So yeah, I don't know. I need to think. Yeah, so maybe this binomial language is not necessarily the best thing to think about some structures. But I don't know how to see this deformation, for example, without restricting to this sub-algebra module. Yeah, sorry. So returning to this, so this deformation, once you increase So this deformation, once you increase n, so the connectivity of the Hispanic-Allen-Berkman space, you can even reconstruct the more and more multiplication structure of the cohomology by going from bin to gamma. Yes. And yeah, so maybe this will look very motivated, but in fact, this is also an E n minus one can be replaced by E n if A is torsion-free. There is some funny business here. Yeah, and what is this DSYNCA? This is just a dual, but I want to introduce this. So I want to think of this as some sort of DDNM module in this singular setup. Maybe up to a shift. So D sync is just home, R home. Home, sorry, this single of A, just our home in D of Z from A to Z. So in particular, yeah, and even in this theorem, I just want to maybe draw attention. So if you take S m, something like Fp in degree m, then this is free binomial algebra on an element f p. Fp in degree minus n minus one because there is this you take arc home and so torsion like arc home from fp to z will be fp shifted to degree minus one yeah uh and maybe just a comment so if you do it for b a so when n equals to one this theorem just tells you that this is an isomorphism of easy row algebra so just on the level of abelian groups but in fact abelian groups but in fact you can show that if if you invert two here in the coefficients then this is an i at least on the level of cohomology this is an isomorphism still and it's not true that this is an isomorphism for p equal to two and n equal to one like these two sides are genuinely different in a way this is very sharp this boundary this bound Yeah, so this value of n for en algebra structure is in a way sharp. You can't do better. Okay. Yeah, so maybe this result is less motivated, but right. What is happening is that if you want to extend it to if you want to understand some cohomology theory, If you want to understand some cohomology theory for some classifying steps of group schemes, then in principle there is no theorem like that one, this proposition. So there is nothing which can there is no natural structure like this structure of binomial algebra which can replace the answer. But there is still this L gamma thing. And it will have a very analogous result to this one. Okay, so now let's pass to group schemes. So let G be a flat. So maybe for simplicity, let's assume that this is finitely presented commutative group scheme over. Yeah, so for simplicity, I also will assume that this is some affine scheme S. Yeah, so then starting with G, I can do a very similar procedure. So I can take BG and then this will be a group stack. And I can take B of it. Continue. We will get B and G, which is the same as A and G. And what sort of object is this? This is a higher stack. And what this means? This means that this is a functor on. It's a functor from affine schemes over R up to the category of spaces, which satisfies flat descent appropriately understood in the infinity categorical language. Okay, and Okay, and even more explicitly, so this is if you consider the value of kgn on some algebra A, collect spec A. Then yeah, so maybe better to say that AGN is a shapefication. Of is the functor which sends pack A to the Einenberg-McLean space of G of A and so this is some pre-shift, it doesn't need to be a shift, then you shouldify it. And the result of what you are getting is the following. The following. So frequently, if you take values of Kgn on spec A. So this is a space. And again, it's a very similar looking space to what we saw in topology. So this will be, yeah, we want to use the astation case. So this will be underlying simplicial set of the simplicial group given by flat homology of Homology of spectrum of A with equation. So it is very analogous to singular cohomology, except now we take flat cohomology with equations. Okay, yes. So one input of the problem we'll be solving will be this group G, but then also we. G, but then also we need to fix some cohomology theory, and we can't take any at least to obtain this result. I'm gonna tell you about, but yeah, so we will fix homology theory. Yes, I will use a similar annotation to Lances. So this question mark will be some parameter. Mark will be some parameter which will be the cohomology theory. So, this will be a functor from a fine. Actually, it will be enough for this to just know the restriction to smooth schemes from R. Yeah, and it will take values in some category C question. See? Question mark? So, yeah, it is very important that this category should be Z linear. So, something like key theory would not work. So, Z linear, stable, metric monoidal. But this is not enough. Actually, there needs to be more structure. So, it's maybe better to give a complete list. But maybe in general, I just want you to give a feeling what is needed. Need what is needed. Yeah, so one thing you need to have is an action of polynomial functions, for example. This will be essential because the answer we suppose the answer we want to give will involve three divided power algebras. So yeah. But things which work as a direct category of some commutative ring or like DA plus some structure or maybe Or maybe this is better formalized as quite a coherent shifts on some stack, maybe pre-stack. By this, I mean the derived category of physical coherence. It's also possible to consider etal shifts on some pack or scheme with values in R, A, and yeah, I mean, you can extend the list if. I mean, you can extend the list if you want to ask a question. I can tell you whether it belongs to this. Unfortunately, I wasn't able. Yeah, I mean, it would be good to formalize it better. Yeah, and particular examples which you can consider are so the most basic example is just to take the hook knowledge of practical. Cohnology of factor sheet of the corresponding group of the corresponding stack or you can take the Durham cohomology oh sorry of the corresponding scheme so it does R to R or if you are in characteristic P you can consider crystalline maybe you can take et al with some coefficients constant coefficients or maybe in some shift Or maybe in some shift over the base, but singular cohomology if you are over complex numbers. And I mean, most complicated so far is probably the splitmatic cohomology. Yes, and we will need to assume three things. So, first of all, our gamma First of all, our gamma question mark should satisfy a QNES formula. Then it should satisfy Appal descent. There should be an appall shift. And actually, the most important is the following. So for Important is the following. So for A, an abedian scheme. Or else, if you take the for homology oh sorry, all this uh I forgot. So one essential structure we will be using for these categories is the uh T structure. Is a T structure. So plus a T structure, which also needs to be sufficiently nice. So if you have a T structure, you can define what are cohomology groups. So this will be some object in the cart of the T structure. And this thing should be Yeah, so depending on what the category is, you should have the corresponding exterior power operation in the corresponding category of the heart. And cohomology of a Biden variety should be the same as the exterior power algebra on the first cohomology of the Biden variety. I did not tell you the details of this proof, but I said it reduces to the case of Z shifted by one. Z shifted by one, in which case the corresponding aluminum of MacLean space, oh, yeah, maybe actually to give an example. So, yeah, kz one is as one. And abelian variety actually plays similar role. So we would think of abiding variety as some sort of a circle, but bigger dimensions, so like a torus. And in fact, yeah, you can use it in a very similar fashion to prove that analog of that result. Analog of that result. Okay. Yeah, so we will assume this. And for all these examples, this is satisfied. Like if you take an abedian scheme, you do get this. Yes, Ethereum. Oh, yeah, sorry. This should be too bad. This should also be a nice object. So this should be flat and dualizable. In all these examples, I really want it to be actually, like in all these examples, it will be a projective module. But what I'm going to tell it is. Flat with respect to the structure. The theorem is that let G be either a finite flat commutative group scheme. Or an abedian variety. So far, Jm, for example, doesn't belong to this class, but there is a little modification. Then, first of all, there is a natural dualizing. Visualizable object I will call D question mark G and this is some so it's doubleitable and it will be of tor amplitude 0, 1. In fact, it will be represented by some explicit two-term complex locally on S. And then there is a natural filtration it is more sort of total amplitude. Yes, yes. Yes, total amplitude with respect to this destructor. Amplitude with respect to this destructor. Yeah, there is a nature of filtration on greater than one, there is a nature of filtration on cohomology of Kgn and with a quasi-isomorphism. Of infinity algebras. Second time, I will talk about also the co-algebra structures. There is a morphism. Yeah, so essentially, the associated graded under this filtration will be the three-divided power algebra on. Algebra on. Yeah. On the corresponding DNA model, put in degree minus n. Yeah, and this is for C. Right. Yeah, so at least in this generality, you will have a filtration with a corresponding. With a corresponding with a very similar look and associated gradient, except now you replaced this very easy formula for the DNA model with something, which I will tell you how to compute. But also, what maybe is more surprising is that most often, like in most situations, this filtration actually splits, for example, on the level of contact. So, namely, If g if there exists a short exact sequence, even by g mapping to an abedian variety, a prime and zero. So, for example, if g is an abedium variety, this always holds. But yeah, by theorem of Reynolds, this always holds. So, if G is finite, this always holds. So, if G is finite, this always holds the risk locally on S. So, for local ring, for example, if you consider group schemes over local rings, this is the case. Yeah, and but also, unfortunately, you need to assume more. So, you need to assume that our home in this category C from H1A. X and similarly for A prime X they live in degree zero so these are some complexes and I want them really to be basical so these things should really be projective in a sense like they should be projective models In a sense, like they should be projective models, but again, in all these examples, this is satisfied. Like, if you want to consider something with a filtration or like anomorphism, all these objects, they don't have X to other things. And yeah, so I mean, for a bidding variety, if you take something like crystalline cohomology or the RAM, or maybe, yeah, like occupy relative to a base, it's always first cohomology is always given by projective module, where this is satisfied. This right. But yeah, if, for example, you're just interested in computing something for a field, something very simple out of this list, then yeah, this falls automatically. Yeah, then there exists then this lifts to an equivalence. Between, yeah, hospitology of A G N and this divided power algebra again as E n minus one algebras. And yeah, if A is an abelian variety, then as E n plus one. So the reason that E n changed to E n plus one is because A sort of already plays the role of B each yeah, B of some latest one. Yeah, D of some latest one. Yeah, and similarly to the singular case, actually, if so, again, this is for n equal to one, if you're just interested in bg, which maybe is the most sensible things to consider anyways. Not in Brouwer group conference, but yeah, you get an isomorphism of E0 algebras where it just means, so E0 algebra is just an augmented complex. So this would give an Complex. So, this would give an isomorphism on the level of augmented complexes, but you can show that if p is invertible, and if you're interested in cohomology groups as an algebra, it still gives an isomorphism. So, yeah, I will not try this, but if you just want to compute cohomology as an algebra without higher structures, this essentially gives the answer. Like, you can replace cohomology of KGN by three-divided power algebra on a certain two-term complex. Except for, yeah, except if you are in characteristic true. Then actually, it's again not true. Okay, maybe how much time do I have? This time it becomes yeah, so this is replaced. So this condition to be free is replaced by being an abedian variety. Actually, JM will also work. But I mean, this abedian variety is like B of some lattice. So if you, for singular cohomology, what you're plugging in here is like not a lattice, but lattice already shifted. But lattice already shifted by one. So if you apply the older theorem in the singular case, you will get exactly e n plus one. Yeah, so maybe just in words, I will say, so to apply to gm, you need to replace this condition by the condition that if you take cohomology of B G M, this will be symmetric algebra in the heart of H two. Yeah, and uh so maybe just uh for yeah maybe I will tell some application to Brawl groups in the reason five minutes. I wanted to tell uh how to compute this three-divided power algebras. Maybe I uh yeah, I will not do this. Uh yeah, I will not do this, uh, but just tell that for yeah, maybe let's apply it to something uh related to Brau groups. So we can consider the cosmological Brau group X and yeah, so this is given by pi zero of mapping space from X to B to G M. Right. And so, yeah, any ah, okay. Yes. Yeah, but having a class even without torsion, we will still produce something. So, yeah, essentially, I want to describe characteristic classes in different components. To describe characteristic classes in different cohomology theories for Brow group classes. So, if we have a class here, it gives a map from X to D to G M. So, now if I fix some cohomology theory, I get a pullback map from maybe from here to H star X. And so if you have an assumption that this H2BGM is projective, meaning that forms to any objects are classical, then actually you can describe this thing completely. So as a consequence, So, as a consequence, yeah, so let's assume that our, let's just consider our cohomology theory as cohomology from affine schemes over R to D of A, to some ring A. Then this is abstractly isomorphic to singular cohomology of KZ3. With coefficients in A. Yeah, so our integer, like if A is an abstract ring, this is actually a quite complicated ring. Like it's very hard to describe with generators and relations. But if you assume, so for example, if p times a is equal to zero, and let's assume is greater than two, because otherwise. Is greater than two because otherwise the answer is a bit different. Yeah, so maybe this is equal to a polynomial ring on A in infinite many generators. There is a generator in degree three and then x plus one okay or i greater to equal than I greater equal than one. That's yeah, these are degrees of the corresponding generators. So it's such a thing. Yeah. And so in singular cohomology, for example, if you're just interested in characteristic classes, it's actually not interesting to consider not so interesting to consider other generators because all of them are obtained by applying stimulated operations to the sort ones. Operations to the sword ones. So, for example, if you're interested in knowing if something is zero and you know that it's zero for x three, then everything else is zero. But uh, I want to warn that, for example, if you take the Duram cohomology and characteristic P, then standard operations which are in singular cohomology are usually non-zero, they become zero. So, this really give very independent generators, even from the point of view of like infinite algebra structure. And yeah, so maybe just as a fun application. Yeah, so maybe just as a fun application you can show just blindly following Bargovbat's strategy for his theorem about vanishing of germ classes for things for like crystals. You can show that if our gamma question mark is our gamma deram same characteristic P or crystalline then Then if a class if a class alpha inside Bruer group of X descends to X Duram like, oh sorry, or crystalline has a plan Let me say, has a flat connection, has a structure of a crystal, descends to a crystal. No, maybe better to say to X Duran or XCRIS. Then the corresponding characteristic classes all vanish. Yes, sorry for writing, so we'll make it visible. Yes, and yeah, so that's basically it. Yeah, I don't know. Yes, so actually this thing on the nose is isomorphic to L gamma as a co-algebra. It's just that, oh sorry, maybe you need this sort of projectivity assumptions. Yes, so under these projectivity assumptions, this thing on the nose. This thing on the nose is a for as a co-algebra it is L gamma. And the way to see it is actually the following. So this, yeah, so Kgn is itself a hop algebra object in the category of like groups. And under the assumption that you have a cune formula, this object, its cohomology is also a hopalgebra. Commutative co-commutative. So it's like infinity co-algebra in infinity algebras. Infinity algebras. But in fact, in all these cohomology theories, like the algebra structure is not just infinity, it enhances to direct commutative ring. So it's an infinity qualge in direct commutative rings. But what is true, in fact, is that the quadgeable structure is also derived. So for example, if you take a linear dual, so these whole things they actually reflex it. So if you take linear dual, you will get something. If you take linear dual, you will get something, you will again get a hoop algebra. And then you can show that its algebra structure, which corresponds to co-algebra structure on the original object, is also animated. So it lifts to even it is not obvious. You can induce such structure by some construction. Yeah, and in the project with Akil Matthew, Arpon Raksit, and Bogdan Zavialov, we developed this theory of finite group scheme. Sorry, group schemes with Sorry, group schemes with transperson, like this polynomial laws, multiplicative polynomial laws, and the dual to this object is actually an object of this category. So it's a derived Hoff algebra. Ah, and I can also tell you how to construct this filtration. Namely, if you take the linear dual, it is just the even filtration on the corresponding algebra. Yes, which have appeared in your spoken particular. Appeared in your token particular. So, yeah. That's not how we construct it, but it turns out in the end that it's the same. So, even things everywhere. I have a question. Yes. Oh, yes. Sorry. So, why is this assumption important also? Like, if you have such a presentation with G having to A and A prime. G having to a and a prime, then this, yeah, I meant to say this, but when the time, uh, yeah, when I just do the time good. So this D of G under the, if D is a kernel of the map of abiding varieties, it's just defined as fiber of corresponding map from H1 A prime to H1. And then we can show that it glues, like it doesn't depend on the presentation as a kernel and it glues over the scheme. Yes, in particular, but also formulas of this sort appear all over the place, like in the crystalline theory. And yeah, so usually you use, people have used often abiding varieties in algebra geometric setup as. Varieties in algebra geometric setup as some sort of injective objects or projective objects. Depends on whether you so, yeah, it's inspired by that and also by computation. Like actually, this was all very computational. Like if you try to do a bunch of computations of this classifying stacks in different commodity series, you start to see the common pattern. And that's just, I tried my best to formalize it into something, but it's very computation-based. No, BGM, yes. Sorry, it's to do computations for BGM, you need to replace it, like you should forget about the Belium varieties, and just you can exclusively demand this, and then you can compute the homology of K G M. K G M Yes, but it's important that this object is like you need to split off certain objects from certain complex, and for this you need projectivity. And on the under these assumptions, you get this nice formula speak. Otherwise, there is only a spectral sequence, and it will be more complicated. Yeah, so for example, if you took the coefficients, I don't know, et al. shifts over some scheme, you could have like it could be a local system, but then there could be non-trivial extensions. Local system, but then there could be non-trivial extensions with something and with some other local system, and the final answer could be complicated. Yeah, also p equal to 2 is a very bad prime for all these computations. Many things don't work. I also wanted to present how this looks for all finite commutative group schemes order P and characteristic P. This did in a model. You have like a nice. This did in a model. You have like a nice table to see how this varies with co-moji theory, but not enough time.
