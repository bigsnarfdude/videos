Now, today I will introduce some interesting results about the weak interaction and the weak industry vibration. Okay, so today I will basically talk about three parts. The first part is about the weak interaction between the two tandem static cylinders, and the second part is about the within due. And the second part is about the weakened use evaporation of the two tandem cylinders. And finally, I will introduce some application case about the weakened use evaporation, especially for the energy hybrid system. Okay, so the Wikiduction and Mom. Introduction among multiple plus bodies is a very classic problem in the water dynamics and has many applications in the some civil engineering, ocean engineering, and the thermal engineering, especially for something like the bioelectrical application, something like the fish schooling. So, but very limited research about the history in the weak interaction. So, here is just one simple case is about the weak, about the Is about the weaker about the two tandem cylinders, and the spacing is about the six times diameter. So, if we increase the speed, something like we increase the readness number from the 90 to 150. So, for the first row here, so we can see one type of weak pattern. But if we decrease the speed and decrease the unit number, so we got a totally different weak patterns. So, in this case, it's just one. So, this case is just one case about the h-crease in the interaction of the two tandem cylinders. And this is about the increasing speed. But so we think about how about if we adjust the spacing between the two tendon cylinders, so can we see the similar increased behavior for this case? So, then we did some study. So, we start from the experiment side. So, and here is a Side. So, and here is the experimental setup. So, we use one inclined soap film setup. So, the soap film is driven by the gravity. So, and we place the two circular disks and the disk was suspended in the soap film plane. So, and then we can adjust the spacing between the two disks. And so we adjust the change the spacing in the course steady way. So, it's basically steady for this flow. For this flow, so and the winner's number is around 100. So, so for the follow, I really think on the subfield, because the momentum equation of the following subfilm is similar to the momentum equation of the fluid dynamics, the only difference is about this term gamma. So, the gamma here is the surface concentration and its place of the pressure for the momentum equation. And we also know. Equation. And we also know that the concentration actually is proportional to the thickness of the soap film. And for the thickness, so we can use some optical method to measure the variation of the thickness of the soap film. So in this way, we can just get the photation for the quasi-2D system. So then we just do some fluorizations on the soap film to get the quasi-2D flow. 2D flow. So here is the result. So the lunar sample is about 100, and so we increase the spacing from 1.3 to 6.4. And then we decrease the spacing and get to the original value. So as we can see, two types of patterns. One is about the real attachment region. So another one is about the co-shedding region. In this case, both are. Shading region. In that case, both of the two cylinders shared vertex. So, and then we can see a critical spacing between the two weak patterns. It's about, if we increase the spacing, so it's between the 3.9 and 4. But if we decrease the spacing, we got different critical values. So, it's about between the 3.1 and 2.7. So, here we got the upper limit and the lower limit of the critical spacing. Of the critical species. And we also did some simulation about this problem. So we use the lattice method. So we also increase the spacing and then decrease the spacing. So we also get the two values for the critical spacing. And for the simulation, it's between around 4.1 and for a lower limit is around 3.2. So in general, so we got something here. So for our simulation, it agrees with our soap film experiment. But for the published results, actually, the simulation always does not agree with the simulation, especially if we look at witness number one hundred. So usually the critical spacing ranges from three to five. So I guess the major reason is that. That's the major reason is that so for this experiment, it's very hard to get the pure 2D flow in the real world. So, if you use a water turn or something, you have to make some 3D effect for your experiment. So, the experiment is just not a pure 2D flow. But for our soap field, we can get the quasi-2D flow. Therefore, our results agree with the simulation. And so, our and our realization result had to be such. Visualization result has to be cited by many people as a benchmark case for the 2D flow simulation. So here is a result. So for the literature, the critical space of the two tendon cylinders usually ranges from 3.5 times diameter to the 4 times diameter. And for our studies, we found the two values here. So, and some reviewer and some people just told us, so some study discussed. So, some study discussed the possible relationship between the critical space of the two tandem cylinders and the vortex formation length of a single cylinder. So, it looked like there is some connection or relationship between the critical spacing of the two tandem cylinder and the vortex formation of a single cylinder. So, then we did some work on this topic. So, here is some definition of the current definition, public definition of the water formation line. Definition of the water formation line. So, one important definition is about the stagnation streamlines for the steady flow. For example, this case, so this is the renewal and this is the critical space. This is the water formation defining this way. So, we got the line here. So, and there is another definition. It's really about the point where the fluctuation energy is maximum in the week. So, this is the blue line here. So, as you can see, the So, as you can see, it decreases as an increase in realness number. But so, if we compare with the critical space, I'd say this is the red line here. So, you can see there is a large difference between the critical space and the water formation line. So, here is a conclusion. So, existed water formation definitions cannot explain why the critical spacing of the two tandem ceiling is. And all the published definition can only just provide. Definition can only just provide one value for the critical for the water formation lines. But for our experiment, we get the two values: the lower and the upper limits. So, all the published definition cannot give some explanation about this problem. So, then we just come up with a new definition. So, under this definition, just based on the POD method, the proper orthogonal decomposition. So, the reason we use this. The reason we use this is because it can decouple the time sequence from the spatial distribution. As you can see, the PUD system, so the A is the time-dependent coefficient. It's just related to the time sequence, and the phi here is just related to the spatial distribution. So, and we did the PUD analysis for the pressure field for the flow of the single cylinder. So, as we can see, the force two mode can take maybe 90%. Can take maybe 90% of total energy. So then we just look at the first two modes here. And here you result. So for the mode one, we can see something like here. So and we can see the two different regions here. So for the region immediately after the cylinder, so there is a very large variation of the pressure. So it's something about the vortex formation. And after this region, we can see the pure. This region, we can see the periodic structure of the flow. So it's just about the vertex street. So then we can define lens here. So we call it the fourth principal lens. So it's about 3.4 for the model 1. And similarly, we can define another lens here. It's about the 2.5 for the mode 2. We call it the second principal line. So if we add the radius of the cylinder to the value, so finally. Cylinder to the values, so finally got the values about 3.9 and around 3. And those two values are quite close to the upper and the lower limits of critical spacing. And finally, we can give this some simple equations. The critical spacing of the two tandem cylinders is basically equal to the water formation length of a single cylinder plus the radius. So, and we also did a similar thing for the Also, we did a similar thing for the experimental results, just the realization images here. So, we also do the POD analysis for the intensity of the images. So, and this, the model one and the model two, we can also see the particular formation lines defined by this way. And this results also give some explanation and agree with the experimental results. So, the major fungi in SQL, so we can. The major findings correct, so we can just use the pure D modes and we can define the first and second principal water formation line. And we found that the critical space of two tandoid cylinders is quite close to the difference between the water formation lines and the critical space is quite close to the radius of the single cylinder. So, and we have those results, and the second part is about the weight-induced vibration. In this case, the upstream cylinder is fixed and the The cylinder is fixed, and the downstream cylinder is free to rotate around the upstream cylinder, and the motion is induced by the wick from the upstream cylinder. And we also did some stuff from the experimental side. So this is our setup. So now we use a vertical flowing soap field and the downstream was suspended as a pendulum system as shown here. As shown here, so as you can see, the downstream cylinder can rotate freely, and the motion is induced by the weak from the upstream cylinder. So, in this way, we can study the weak-induced vibration. And the reverse number is about 150 here. Here is the result. So, this is the spacing between the two cylinders in the stream-wide direction, and this is the transfer. And this is the transverse displacement of the downstream disk. As we can see, that is several types of weak patterns. If the spacing is quite small, it's about 1.4 diameter. So the downstream cylinder is almost static. And if we increase the spacing, so about two times diameter, we can see strong displacement for the downstream cylinder. And we can see that we pattern something like the gap flow switching here. That's the gap flow switching here. If we continue to increase spacing to some value around four times diameter, we can see the classic co-shedding region here. And you can see, so we also increase the spacing and decrease spacing, and we can see a small heat-treated behavior for the medium spacing here. And we also measure the drag of the Measure the drag of the downstream cylinder. This is the result. For here, we can see the strong heat pieces for the behavior. As you can see, if we increase spacing for the spacing about 3.5, so there is a sharp increase for the drag. And we can still see the flow structure here is also a transition from the gap flow region to Cushetti region. And if we decrease the spacing. And if we decrease the spacing, we can see also another sharp difference above the time average drag here. And we can see the similar thing for the weak patterns here. So as we can see, the drag coefficient is highly related to the flow validization results. And so, and we, the application of this study is about the anti-degree half-time. About the energy half-so we just curious about the connecting energy of the downstream cylinder because the frequency of the gap flow switching region is much higher than the co-shading region. So, the energy for the small space is quite large compared to the large space case. So, for example, for the point B here, so this case is maybe much better for the energy harvesting system. So, we will. Having system. So, this is a very important region if we want to have energy from the vortex-induced vibrations. And so, another interesting question is the frequency of the vibration of the downstream disk. From experiment, if we look at the spectrum distribution for the motion of the downstream disk, so for the small space case, we got the 10.5 Hertz here, and for the large spacing, we got the And for the large spacing, we got the 5 hertz here. So, here is the question: what determines the frequency of the transverse motion? So, because this is a pondrum system, so the fourth idea, maybe it's related to the gravity. So, if we look at the definition of the natural fix driven by the gravity, we got the value from 1.7. But these values are quite different from the two values here. Another sort of idea is maybe it's from the what I can. idea is maybe it's from the water shading but for our case the water shedding frequency is about the 65 hertz is highly it's much higher than the the both of the two values so what's the real reason and so so the in 2013 the a say just introduced the concept of the weak stiffness so it's about the fluid dynamic if that can be associated with the linear screwing with the stiffness with the stiffness proportional to With the stiffness proportional to the steady lift force. As you can see, so we have the two cylinder systems. So if we move the downstream from the balanced position, so and we can see the time average to the lift is proportional to the displacements of the downstream cylinder. So we got some linear regions here. So and we can define the weak stiffness in this way. And we also did some experiment here. So we just put a beam for get through the downstream disk, and we measure the reflected laser path. We know what's the drag coefficient for the downstream cylinder. And we also develop the equations about the weak stiffness effects. And for the for the from the experiment, we can see it. We can see it does have a linear region for the time average lift within some small displacement. So we can see just do some simple linear fitting to get the slope of the linear fitting. If we plug in the numbers into the equation, the Philips determined by the gravity and weak stiffness model, we can see that for our experiment, the value we measure is 10.5. The value we measure is 10.5. And from this model, we can get the frequency around the turn. For the large basin, it also works. So the frequency we measured is about 5 Hz. And for the model, we got 5.2 Hz. So that means the frequency can be predicted by the weak stiffness. So here is the major findings. So the mean drug coefficient showed the remarkable history effect. Show the remarkable history effect with the change in the ceiling spacing. And for the gap flows reaching regions downstream, this can get a very large motion and is suitable for the energy harvesting system. And we found that the stiff model works well for both the gap flow switching and the cushioning week. And finally, we just talk about some applications. So, and the concept of the angle. And the concept of the angle healthing based on the water evaluation was introduced by the professor Bernister from the University of Michigan. And they just looked at the transfer displacement of the circular disk. And at Virginia Tech, we just chose a different technique solution. So the pendulum system of tandem cylinders. And some studies had just compared the energy output and the efficient between the transfer oscillation and the Between the transverse oscillation and the pendulum system. And they find for our pendulum system, we can get the much higher energy output and higher efficiency for the energy conversion. And this is the experiment setup for the energy half-type system. So we have the two tandem sitting system, and we have a shaft that transfer energy from. To just transfer energy from the cylinder to the gearbox. The gearbox just speeds up the rotation. And finally, just we have the electric motor converts the kinetic energy to the electric energy. So the diameter of the cylinder is about eight centimeters and the length of the cylinder is quite long, one meter. So we conduct the experiment at the Hango Dian University. It's just 25 kilometers from here. And we just did the experiment. And we just did the experiment in the what cause what tunnel. So, this is a setup. Here is just a preliminary result. So, here, as you can see, the downstream thing had a very large amplitude here. So, and this is the LED light to show the energy happening. And for this system, we can use the system to chart myself now. So, it can indeed. Indeed, it can provide some anti-output. So, here is the result. So, this is if we this is the flow speed and this is the amplitude of the downstream cylinder. So, and if we adjust the spacing from the two to four, so as we can see for the small spacing, we have the much larger and We have the much larger amplitude here. And another interesting for the small space here, we cannot see strong history for the evaporation if we increase or decrease the flow speed. But for the large spacing or the medium spacing, for example, for the three times damage or four times damage, we can see some strong increases about the vibration. About the vibration before we increase speeds or decrease speeds. If we overlap all the results from the different spacing on the same plot, we can see for the low speed, so because we have very large torque here, so it can easily start to vibrate at very low speed. So it can give some vibration here. But for the high speed, so the small spacing can just The small space in cancer provides much larger vibrations here. So it is better for the energy half-time. And the next result is about the real energy onput from the system. And we can see the small space can provide much larger energy output compared to the large space in case. And similarly, for the large space in case, so we can see the strong hit creases if we increase or decrease the. We increase or decrease the speed, but for the small spacing case, the hydration is triverse. So, and as you can see, so there is a strong difference about the hydris effect if we adjust the spacing between the two tandem cylinders. So, and for some future works, I want to do some follow-ups of the 3D hybrid number flow for the system. And finally, we can maybe optimize the output and the The output and the conversion efficiency of this working user bridge and the hybrid system. So I just stop here.
