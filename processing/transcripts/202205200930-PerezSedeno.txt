General, but more challenging from the conferencia. And it is a honor for me to present this invitation of Dujo Eulalia Perezño who is Professor of Investigación in Sciencio Tecnologic General in the Department of Ciencia Tecnologic Sociedad, the Instituto y Filosofía del Césic in Spain. Albiena Cido Professor. Albiena Sio Professor Investigora in the Barcelona, in the Madrid in Cambridge, in Reunion, in California in Berkeley, and the University of Paiva. As for example, violent science and technology and the scientific method or the women between others. Mucha gracias por estar aquí compartit with 5 with others. And well, I think this is very philosophical, but I will more clearly possible. Because the final thing that I did a character on feminist epistemology, and what specifically the feminist epistemologist and more like a form of epistemic justice, in particular epistemic. In their epistemic, the podium of the epistemic receiver, when a candidate of epistemic candidates that receive a judge of those epistemic distributions, as you can see, for example, Epistemic, as you can see, for example, the education, the accession of information. That type of questions. It is a typical justice, but in just distributive, and importantly, it is discriminatory. I will because, but when we are in justice, in that section, And a characteristic of the testimonial is that no manipulation deliberate manipulation and constant. It is not there a manipulation or a terrific. Or a tergiversación deliberated from accredited people controlling people who epistemic. But because no intentionality does not exist, if not the contrary and in the case of testimonials, we have many prejudices. For example, the idea of the prejudice of women is not for ten years or for the mathematics that considers.  Discriminations that include some dimensions of social states. What do you say with this agents that are situated in a context in just and to understand how to log people experiences that have local perfection, also a form of discrimination? A typical example: the patient medical path, and the medicine. The medicine has a concept that the patient patient can understand and invest the medical suspects. But in the justice notification that do not understand a cognizant because of sufficient connection, it is understandable, but not consider for a objective. Not multiple. Not interverse in the case. But non-magnetic ninety interreverse forms deliberately the case that is also for the distribution of security of the opportunities of knowledge and canada for conducting filters that need activate porous culture. The injustice is affected by the social fault, because it needs a social situation. Necessary social situations to secure that parallel of discrimination, with distributions of equal distributions in power. This type of epistemic just the feminist epistemology. I want to record that, but the traditional epistemologists, and that the philosophy of the conception of data. Because their context, but these disciplines that are strictly cognitive. For example, the Busque de la Red, the method of simplification, is still precisely because the business of disinterested discussions, but the formula of. But we are also with the critical porpoise scientific community. The subjects are very different and the product. When the valores are a series of values that have some contextual, they say factors, cultural factors, valores, or factors, cultural. Cultural values or cultural factors, social and ideological actors that allow social internal dollars produced or where. And the values constituted interns are the regulations that determine the method of practice. And when we are distinguishing that values, what we are saying is that the contextual values and constitutive values are. And that contestual biology does not internalize the investigation, the observation, in the formula, of hypotheses, in the experimentation, in the rationale that allows justify a hypothesis or a theory. This devalues contextual implicators characteristics: neutrality, autonomy, and impartiality. And partiality. The neutrality of the significance is a tradition that the non-implicate theories about values are not cognitive. And that scientific notes are cognitive values concrete, but other things. The author of the science, what is that progress when we are influenced by values or social or political movements? Political. And the impartiality supports that unit to accept a theory on their relations with evidence and no values. These impartiality is the idea of the scientific theory of the case, between the values when the case. The defenses of the impartiality is in contravention of values, and all these values. Valores and allies are feminists like in La Sciencia. It is considered that the political and social policy of autonomy because their primary flood consists in oppression in the scientific perspective to ignore and validate their conceptions of the world. The impartiality exiges that the acceptance of a theory is completely valuable cognitive in considerations epistemic about the evidence that. Obre la evidence that the theory and the fault of evidence in contrast. The tier and the test that the impartiality is component more basic of the idea of values. So the neutrality as the autonomy presupposes partiality. In a single cabinet considerations, ethics, politics, social, etc. Especially considerations of the Considerations about the separation of knowledge and pod or concern of the podcast, because it does not possibly be epistemic in the terminals that are. If we see many things that feminists, well, that's all of these feminists, not these authors who are precisely feminists, have analyzed ourself that values of all here interview in the science, because in the priority of scientific purposes that. In the scientific purposes that in the investigation, politics of investigation, but in theories, in the question of investigation that the investigators investigated in the plant of hypotheses, in the variable definition, in the decisions in our employads, and experimental, in the recognition and data analysis, in the interpretation of results, in their publication, etc. Well, in the mention of the In the book that I mentioned, the person who has represented scientific materials or presentamos based on these types. A good example of this is the podemos in contrast in the introduction of the topics of the women collector in theories in the evolution of mana, which is all of the evolution in the hombre. Ignore complete pape of the women in this process. In this process, when a case of injustice epistemic evidence fundamentally the utilization for the case and what fundamentally utilized as evidence to form precisely the case of the evolution and support here that the capacity  As feminists consider and just pause the signal of women in the evolution of man, and the idea of assistants applying to the data that dispones a new interpretation. This is because one of the authors and authors do not exist a limited treasury and observation. The front of the categories depending on the context. Depending on the contest. So, the description observation does not limit to a pura of this, but we are interpreting what we are learning theory. We are taking change if the theory of describes esoteric. For the other, we will see the power of the transponders, between the appropriate areas, and also. Of the appropriate areas, and also their civil delays communities to the agents of the community. Recognize that these women to the evolutionist community, apart from feminist party, sustain the intervening and focus the explication or the interpretation of the evidence of disposable and other para change. To change the potential cases for the recollector, as people apart from the cases of major privileges, very important recollection of raises, fruits, possibly animals, technology, and non-necessarily. But the cafe may not end because their variants are not that activities, the technology of the problem with the elliptics and series important, important of the evolution of human evolution. There is distinctions can be evidenced to distinctions and social. Distinctions and societies in other disciplines. There are different epistemologies and feminists, but I will central in two queens with the idea that the experience is a part important of the evidence. It is a important part of the justification of our scientific credit, also part of justification in the context, but do support. But their pertinence and that is epistemological social epistemologies, and contextual values, and the diversity, a important paper in these communities. In this case, I will occupy the contextual of Helen Loangino and the point of feminist de Sandra Harno. But this combination. Gelen Longino affirms that the experience is the basis of the scientific connection, for others insisting the relevance that has the social and cultural context in the construction of this econociment. Because a justification has the evidence for their data, but also the contextual values interview in the decided data are relevant. If we see the science we do not meet with systematic subjectivities, if we generate with validity, describe the scientific investigation as a group, a group in the models and territories adopt and critical processes, chemical processes, dynamic interactions of observational data, experimental data, the focus. The conception social concept of proposed access for Helen London mantras that the scientific communities are critical. Some systematic criticisms request what dominated by opinions subjective opinions particularly. Devide no values that characterized a community that linguists subcratic, así para la contextual delange objectividados incompatible with the presence of valuable recent presence, postividad is understand how intersectividad. However, Hanson does not possibly observe if we work in the area. But in the estimate that the unique form of achievement with the proposals of our scientific community, what implications have a observer or interpreter and order the data between theory, but the scientific. But the scientific study, as in the case of the evolutionists, to determine scientific community, can be other communities, religious, political, etc. From that consideration that the origin of the concepts of justice testimonial menu is triple. Just a little for a postmodernity and the idea of idea of the possibility of separating possibility to know or connect. The conception of philosophy and critical philosophy of validation of the concern only could make factors of universal theories, and the feminist philosophy subject to the idea of Marxism in especialism, the local concept. Special concept location in the point epistemically privileged that the case of the case epistemically privileged from the proletariat. And that is also point where feminist epistemologists have a first moment their public queen and this is the same. And in this book, I consider that the feminist cultivist was cued to create a space that intersections know because they were made with the abstraction, with universalism or mass, but this epistemology of the point of feminist evolutionary evolution. Abolutionado, about all that could be in the book that publicly populated, but in the Bush, where much to the contextual of the genome, and the social Solomon. And I think that this evolution can be epistemology, a epistemology of. An epistemology of cuada to repar injusticias epistemic. The theory of the puzzled vista or part of me referring to the reference to denominated theory of the puja vista for institution, feminists for interreliendo. How do you delay a suspect of representants, but based all these situated and the techniques of the privilege of Christendom? And the latest of the privilege, as we derive from the LUCAC. The testes of situated 1980s in response to critical response to theirselves. It precisely well as commented. How commentado there diverse ministries, but participate all the sellers coincident in the text with the situation, which is that with the situation, this situation in a context that can be socio-economic, anthropological, intellectual, historical, cultural, etc. In a first moment, having concept to critical, positivism, and essentialists from that historical history, postulate that we are important to the world because we have the society and generosity, your other characteristics of limited form to the experiences that we have in my life. Variables for various and form in a conditions for effect combined that will influence in our experience. Add more, the effect of one of these variables can change with the time, for example, depending on sexist society, because the sex of the individual have not sexists. In this sense, Exist. In this sense, the position that adopted posterior hardiness is interesting because the justification has to do the experience. In the words, they are limited and defined as our social position, of course, that the first group has the potential to interpret the phenomenon of points of unique views that the dominant groups are grouping. Dominant North. And that has consideration social position of the first group considerate, we have a format to reparate in just epistemic heuristics. If we significantly have implemented a perspective, it is not the individuals of the  At the conception of a critical point for the epistemic community. This important because the constant is not safe for the individuals and for the communities and that interchange and co-part experiences to the group to interpret the reality of a complete manner that experiences proper experience. A jempro destroy could organizado porpoise victims of violence in general, where the victims do not constantly connect to the vivid companions are concepts that allow what they are and identify and mechanism that are impossible to machinate. What if the community is one of this area of the puzzle? It is a normative promise on the objective of the investigation. And the values are reached the classical concept of objectivity and neutrality for. Valorativalacia que desimos. This investigates the values of igual values, or these others, the critical consciousness of the social proprietary position, allows like the relationship with relations with the production of production. This model in a procession that the diversity of social positions, the identified plastics as exists or classists. Classistas, etc., can be critical, modificated, or eliminated. The epistemic prime age of groups have members of primitive groups have epistemic groups to detect the sensors that are in the concern. These individuals, their social positions, is probable that they identify problems of problems. Maybe the members of groups in dominant positions are. In dominant position, only ambivido experiences more dominant position. The members of groups of alternos in change are no longer the Germanic perspective, but to supunto devista in the community. What have a position of insider/outsider, and that is this position that more facilities to do the epistemic faculties of determining practical determination? Technical practices, and that can also be related to their outside performance, which is practical that with our inside. Arabien, how decided that Europe has epistemic, the multitude of factors and factors that are the manager in which experiences. If we embark as a complex queue, output experiences are difficult. Experiences are difficult to attribute a variety of concrete final output. A scientific question, for the consexo, is a theory of cultivated theory, but in a scientific question, the consexion, it is a theory of the vista, a group could have a systemic privilege for the analysis of the sexual security with individuals in the group or primary group, for example, women in this case, intersecting. In this case, intersexual, non-sexual, etc. And their experiences can be a relevant panel. If we see their experiences, you can influence not only that women, not unidentified, or Spanish, because their experiences as women are distinguished to a woman neglect. To women is unidentified, or negro español, other countries. It is a group first of all as women planned, or incorporating women, the city transnational cities. The response is relatively so that a community can do not women blank. And when you can consider what this situation concrete is suponer, that in the Suponer, that in the critical conclusion, not only depending on this particular context, but it cannot be profound. You can make a great question. Man, it is a good example of what you can say: this epistemological as mentioned between the same distinctions, Distinctions to criticize the conceptual markets in the abundance, society, cases, and the inventors for the cabo, and a series of women, as advantages can bear an interpretation. The majority of critics of women with perfecte with the epistemic privilege. This is the social first historical por el patriarch. This is for the patriarchado sur condition of inside and outside the observation as facilities, the present contributor evidence the partiality of the model or model and the objectivity in the study of the evolution. Not only can it satisfy the condition of possibilities, relation with adopted a Relational relationship with adopted critical points, with feminists, with all the sociopolitical implications of derivative implications, which probably in fact the community and the epoch in Ethiopia. For jarring, in supreme public public, it is necessary to approach a concept of objectivity. The traditional tradition, we allow that students. The need surface when the communities of existential investigations are more legislated from the social tendencies pro-democratic. Socialeses pro-democratic development. This investigation that part of the community communities can certify by social promotions and progress. And individual limitations of certain existentities can maximize the object of more effective management that the existential communities support. Constructing that with known as Professor of Saro Yo de Conocimento.  When coming investigations in our children, and segregate women, that all. When the media comes in the number of infected women, investigations that have variables not strictly scientific, economic variables, political variables, social variables that intervene in the contact and in the event of the informed evidence, for example, manages. For example, the fact of manos, the poverty, the disconnect of economic resources, the racism, the culture, etc. Jordan considered that for an investigation that researched more extravagances and that the interests for the first time in just the traditional idea of objectivity, which investivity. Objective, you are the evidence, and there are more critics that matter. But this idea of investigation don't be contextual. The traditional posts that repeat an experiment by different groups, created with considerable queue processes could identify and eliminate. This standard of objectivity does not have a critical community because a objectivity, an objectivity. Debi, don't forget as we can harvest. So, the investigation has to be the objective in the field that is completely developed on the certain interests of the control. Portal, the objectivity also cultural cannot be in the In the direction of CEADA for particular communities, for the concrete communities. So, we construct a scientific more exhaustible and confidential form. Punta, that the conception of relativism, with this position considering that what realities are valid, not all validity. For example, hardening separately, if positive for the solid not only creates scientific different groups in models, supportions that can realize. Apportaciónes que puedarizar el publico. Se question, because we don't have women about their work, about the needs of aqueous aqueous or interactions, experimental interactions in their labor to harden a practicine, which is marching a public discussion in contestos, teach locales, like global disasters, referring to finally in a tax demonstration, associated. And I would say a lot of this considerations finales. As the adoption of the context in Indiana, how the purpose is under harming the succeeding point in the authorities to understand transpractic, scientific, technological scientific science, and to have the processes that objects. Lasido objects in epistemic. All the way to propose our concepts of objectivity. Intended to comment subjectivity in the case of the case, of the objectivity in the having no idea how commented in the years. I want to see that there are two different differences. Those important differences. In first, describing respectual types of diversity of diversity, if a variety of individuals with interest, important opinions, as London, or their social positions, however. But simple, a different experience, if not accompanied by a different moment, constituted by a valuable interests and characteristics that have indefinitely.  Different experience, we can identify as a interest for this or that experience is from the investigation, but of one sentiment. But to interpret how there is that observe the perspective different perspectives, constituents for values and determined interests. Second, the contextual ideal of scientific community. The idea of scientific community in the all values of interest is represented. Epistemic value in the administration that transponded presents in the community. But they significant that the contributors within the project, if you support a media in which their family, are capacities of decimals, what these values are. In this sense, a plant community for the contextual imperfection is sensible to criticize and receive critics and attempts to mechanism to eliminate the problematic values. The values interests that pass in the court, we are represented in the community, and in the community. In the community, in the connection that this general community, a queen known as one in the media in which we are the forma in the world and the cosmos. For support, the tribal tutoring that is admissible between diversity, the minorities that have been historically infra-represented. If embargoes that a group or minority group automatically buenos. Automatic goods or disables. And this year, we can explore these values in our values. So, these two epistemologies coincide in contextual values of an important paper in the science because distinct role local implications, different forms of understanding the science. For contextual limits, For contextual limits, the diversity of values and interests complete a important examining or support transponding between scientific communities. In consequence, the role that this diversity of values respectividad is principally causal, the values proprietors, paths, like the values of the values, is influenced in the investigation. Is influencing in the investigation. The race porn that the sexists are centralized, influenced negatively with scientific communities, is formed by a group, most of people who share their values. While I think that those values passed, and allowed the presentation of determined presentation to these formos that limited the razor. If we could remedy these situations, incrementamos the diversity of values of interest represented that examine these transponders, as proponents of the contextual. The empire contextual possible unaccountable values contextuales can be more constituted or if you can maintain rationale. The response is that if we. So, these values can be functional, not only as a causal affair, but not also as for the objective, methods, or more difficult. For other roles that have the values contextuals for the value is different, with some values and political values that consider mergers.  It seems the possibility of what one authorities are feminist, what many subconscious ideas of feminist and idea of feminist ideas of feminist philosophy, but I think it is a characterization of minimum characters of feminist actions, as a feminist perspective. Or we say the epistemology or the philosophy, which is feminism as critical to their problems, and that this characterization. In this sense, therefore, here the characterization that the unique possibility of a  Actually, opposition because a dominant, a established friend that situates, and with the creature a dialectic. The form in which it is possible, that this opposite opposition can occupy the contrast is a change of relationship, a contextual relationship of social relations. So that is approaching a scientific inclusive. Scientific more inclusive, in more variable sites, in that more with the cognitive needs property of a more democratic community, post a variety of values, opinions interested. In consequence, a new feminist science will need to create a social and political reality. And this is the circumstance. And this is the circumstance between the contextual and the puzzle. For the greatest, I propose a contextual feminist interdisciplinary interface, as I propose to adopt a contextual feminist context interdisciplinary. Adopted in contextual vitality, an inevitable booklet of relativity between the two. It is fundamentally that the standard investigation for the neutrality for the state, if for the contrary, the transponding community are reflected in social, political, and cultural political fundamental protection. Adopted a feminist focus is very important for specifically for a doctor because there is evidence that generates them. There would be general and other types present in the investigation, and that manner permanently provoked invisible women, identities of non-normal, oppressions, etc. And also allowed to refer to civil rights that exist in the proposed scientific project. The accessible intellectual, visibilizing the plurality. Visibilizando, the plurality that exists in the social scene. For example, put a picture. In the cognitive reference, we have one of the sexes with characteristics being different. But recent studies with images, technical tomatoes for tomographies of domains, for images of magnetic resonance, etc. We are here to disparate. There are disparities, the differences between the members of the same sex, especially superiors to the two sexes. A student more recent, it supported the investigator of Israel and the feminist. As a very, I think, and more. So, images are images of magnetic resonance, but images of this type of image of 15 people that record, and these have different things. In reality, we are going to investigate different sex or general structural structures, the terrorists do not. Los terebros do not in two classes, or we can classify in two classes, one typical masculine and other typical feminine types. What we have is that it is a cycle unico de characteristic algae de las cua espuencer more comparison with homes, or more common in the homes in comparison with women, and other In our cases, And finally, the interdisciplinary focus for the view, with the need to adopt a focus of the point of view, a study and multiple students. Studio has multiple students who are not able to abort a point of view. Or what we are making. So that is also existing a perspective, privilege of here, observing all the scales of objects, is necessary in the dialogue between the different objects that they vanish. And only two criteria that is critical, transformative, informal dialogue can be a But I want to start to pass on epistemic queues as we go in. Della in sabers, or with them who do not deserve a scientific method as operational in mathematical operations in which the repertory of experiences that have apparently not influencia, apparently, in what we know we are abstract, etc. Well, there is simply that all these critical applicants in bio-socialism are precisely the way to maintain subordinate situations to groups of populations, especially in the mathematical case, how we can imagine a But not a injustice because there is no mathematics, but it is very difficult, something physical, because I am very difficult. So I am very clear, environmental, that applies very quickly with these. Constas and I say, for example, in medicine, we are studying much like, working on the concept of info epistemic concept with what master, for example, with the patients that have the central mediobariophysic, where the medical sculpture. And not the escuchas because they don't want to culture because precisely the products that culture experiences. But in India in mathematics, we don't have a good thing, but no separate applicants. But well, I have a question that I have to do about the model control, applicable to the mathematics, but the perfect piston. Well, very gracias. Adriana, tiene la mano liventada. Your chakras are two questions. Obviously, practically philosophy, so I want to make a simple, for example, when there is a interaction between two colleagues, and a moment of city or the approach that has been told. And for there, there are some attendance of our approach to linear approach, for this approach for the women, because it considered that possibly no function of planning and ideas and choices that are going as problematic. If it is, and I have a testimonial in mathematics, that the support of a creator is very inviting. In the presentation of the entrepreneurs, the first laureate for women in science had physical, very numbrado, that publicament that capabilities.  Well, this charlotte with other perspectives in a library that we have, but in English, in a library that we have, and we said as editor, but We are feminist epistemology, but the editorial style, and there are the introduction, there is other colleagues there with me about this about it. And if there are more introductory and more general introductions, in Libro que mentioned. In the book that I mentioned, Adriana, the cartography of the cards, there is an introduction, where they are a little bit the evolution of the city of traditional sobriety that impacts all in some communities, so that in the positivists.  Ah, the specifics that are not feminists, because the cogito laptop and support other theories are also that studies of technology. But I don't know if it's for the internet. Mucha gracias, we are pregunta eloudiencer. Hello, Encerambiá. Hola. Mucha gracious la la pop la presentación. Super interestante. Yo, vo que sira ser un commentar enamay, perdon que mégeni en mimo tema dantes over the mathematica, no, but what do you think is like that here? Sono que esto concepto de epistemology feministo escapano pogo no mathematica zonoido y a proposí. And a proposito of the concept that you are presentation me queuing that you have from the observation and of the evidence. And how do you say Andrea Sunrato because to this idea of situation or theory is very important what occurred in the process of observation? So in the mathematics, like logic, that are. Mathematica, like a logic, that are formal query institutions in a idea of significant observar who is the observation in the formal absence. Well, I think we are trained that medical, but because medical documents are questions, but a observable man, Of observables, or the observation is the companion of a despot of a deduction, but I did much in agreement, okay? But that more, I simply unido observation with experimentation. With experimentation. And I think this aims to experiment when we have diverse projects of a theory, but we don't have considerable experimenting when these approximations different approaches to the resolution of a mathematical problem, for example, is that consideration. But I progress when experimentation is not formalized. All experiences no formal experience. Claro, yes, well, y well, also like this para que lo compecimo, tonosodas tamieno, qual cedía como le dad experiencia en el trabajo mathémác. Gracia, eulal. En el zun, algi en más, quiera cer alguna pregunta. Pola gulia, manyas gracias, por la charla. Se meo cure que entre esta mathematica tempura y los bio social que sado veces lo que serio un poco applicada or pointo es qual es sonos subuestos o la familias examples of family. Because we are receiving situations that. In the reality. In the reality, we are using to model how affected by the rajos for general sex and mass. What do you think of indicating that we could have to do that? Because I think what is because when you do Where to make a model pose to enter tradition and not and also influence, all of us, but influence the determinated investigation. For example, if we record more, we have a year the logic that propositional prime, etc., etc. And the general verdict of the center, etc. Valentes partiendo de other different, not gracias, muchas gracias, y fue una plática very interestant y concido con Adriana y con Andrea para mi es mucha información para s mi. It's much information for similar in all vegetables to record the todas that me queuco la charla que dar agrabada y podemos escuchar la poniendo pausa. Y tomando notas así que agra des comísimo. Con respecto a lo que están plantendo, tanto Paulina, como Gabriela, yome que de reflecionando del lunes, de lunes Andrea plante estárenta tan concreta como podemos situar el And the concepts with situated, like the podemos for ours that are mathematical, and well, this is the reflection in this semana, so that's opinion with what Paulina. I create the exploration public. This revisar loses exemplars, which I voted on very basic, but in the combinatorial, if we have a phase in the queue revised exemplars, including, I am the part as taxonomic, in which we revisit all the examples to observe that characteristics, etc. And, And the work as social, I observe that there is a good reception of this proposed experiences very personal experiences, to have statistics. I observe that there are many more positive receptions of the women tomorrow.  I think it's a problem. But when I think with these things, I think of the mathematics, and all measured and general or general professor of secondary profession, and all the mathematics can contradict, and it is. And it is also one of the first, in this case, of primary, and in things interesting, as well as the examples of the problems that have a secret general. But one because that is not PEPEC.

So, to salidos, when we're like interesting, and the curiosities can be the first, the different astronomy is the last one that I want to know. The author that I want to be. So, I understand the representation of women, but in all the disciplines, as a parent, for supporting professional approaches, for supporting the women scientific women that mention how many presente married presentations, and in some ways, that the representation of the nine is. A losing millions of representatives, having all types of works that the works are feminine, etc., etc. And more attention is that the women in the context of the study in cases in the part of a partial jadas with myself of mandil, Me the attention. So this is why, because many natural lives and society, but they are in our representations. This type of cost, I think that is very important that we have not the people who are questioning people, but it is urgent. But it also in many exists, but when we explain, examples to ourselves. And what medicine has everything that you say, and that expression, well, it's very typical, we are very educated algorithms.

And result that the dedicated to publica much.
