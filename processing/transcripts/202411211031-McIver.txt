So we are roughly here and 05. This is what's currently in our observing plan. So the C-text is kind of doing a lot of heavy lifting here, so we can talk a little bit about that. But right now, the projected start for O5, which would be the A plus in advance Virgo plus detectors, is towards the end of 2027. Personally, I think because of this C-text, which is, so Virgo's got a big choice ahead of time. So, Virgo's got a big choice ahead of them right now. They're going to upgrade their single recycling cavities. It seems like they've opted to do the take the roof off the building route, which is going to take a few years. So, what could happen is that this timeline will shift back. So the Liberal detectors will start a little bit later and maybe take a little bit more time for coding developments for A. And this way, Virgo could join the REP at the end of 05. So there's 05. So there's wiggle room, but this is roughly the kind of time scale that we're looking at for 05. And then beyond that, so we've got LEGO India, probably 2030 at the earliest is my personal guess. A-sharpened Virgo Next, so this would be 06. So this would be the early 2030s. And then beyond that, we've got Next Generation Cosmic Explorer Einstein Telescope. Very likely, I think the mid-2030s is very optimistic, personally, but roughly about that time scale. That time scale. All right, and assuming that we do all these great things, what are we going to see? So, this is a screenshot from Sathya's Topkit on 7, the workshop about planning for future generation detectors. So, there are three different screenshots. One is how many events will we see? One is how well localized will they be, one is how high SNR will they be? So, what kind of science could we do with them? So, here's a network that is A-sharp-like, that includes Virgo next and detectors of this. And detectors of this sensitivity. This network happens to be LIGO-Hanford, LIGO Livingston, and LIGO India. But you could easily substitute in VerberNext for a similar scale of events. I do want to draw attention to the fact that the series of plots was generated assuming rates as we understood them in O3. So we had a shifting understanding of the rate of neutron star mergers. Let's just say that. So take this with a grain of salt. But here you Grain of salt. But here you can estimate roughly the number of events we get for neutron star mergers, neutron star black holes, binary black holes, for a variety of different O5 and beyond. So here's O5. Here is different variations on the theme of beyond. So this is next generation detectors. And then here, so how well localized would they be? So here we've got in terms of better localized Better localized 10 square degrees, 10 square degrees, 1 square degree. So by the time we get to A sharp, we are starting to see for neutron star mergers on the order of a square degree, assuming that the neutron star rate is roughly within an order of magnitude, as we expect it. And then finally, so the number of SNR greater than 100 events, and also getting up to shifts of greater than 10. So what kind of cosmology can we do? So, what kind of cosmology can we do? What kind of high SMR tested general relativity can we do? And here we've got again H sharp error on the next generation with some H sharp error detectors instead. So this will just kind of give us a rough order of magnitude, a framework for having these discussions so that we can all have a shared common understanding. You are welcome to choose whatever assumptions you like about what detectors will actually be operating, whatever your favorite. Be operating, whatever your favorite multi-messenger follow-up observatories. And then this is your challenge. So, your first part of your mission is going to be to try to open this Google Doc. So, laptops are very welcome during this discussion. We'll all report out together. So, think about designating a reporter and a scribe again. And as you're doing that, so we're going to get into randomly assigned groups, and then like Michael's session, we'll introduce ourselves. We'll introduce ourselves, and then your job is going to be to work with your group to come to a top three demands. So, top three demands of analyses that you think are going to be the biggest hurdles for O5 and beyond. So, I suggest that you give everybody in your team a little bit of time to speak. If they want to speak, if you don't have to speak, if you don't want to speak, identify the common elements that people seem to be resonating with across your group, and then work from there to come up with your top three. There to come up with your top three, and then please add those top three O5 and beyond analysis challenges to this Google Doc. And again, you can assume any scenario within the bounds of reason. So maybe we're not going to get gifted a next generation detector in the next two years, for example, but anything within the realm of possibility, please go for it in terms of the network, what our follow-up capabilities are. Maybe Swift has fallen into the sea, maybe it hasn't. Your science goals, whatever is most important to you, and whatever. Whatever's most important to you, and whatever governance structure we might be operating under. So you have a lot of freedom. Okay, questions before we get into groups? Yes? So I had a question about the different DNS mergers we will obtain. I was looking at the two plots, one which showed how much we can expect. Just detections. And after that, so I think there was a previous one. I'm talking about the shape of This one, the events. Yes, yes, yes. So, here we'll see so many PNS events here. But then we talk about SNR greater than 100 PNS events, those are so much smaller than all the others. So, do you know the reason for that? Well, I suppose the thing about PNSs is that because they're so much lower mass, they need to be quite close. And we have an understanding, well, this is also, again, assuming the rates as we understood them right after O3. Understood them right after 03, so it's likely that that number is going to lower based on what we've seen so far in 04. But it's the horizon for detections that are an SNR of over 100 is going to be much, much, much smaller for BNS. Even though we expect them to occur more frequently, that's what's driving that effect. Okay, great question. Other questions? Hey, are we ready? Are you feeling pumped? You put the link back up. Oh, yes. And so we're only going to take 25. So we're only going to take 25 minutes and then we're going to check back in and then we're going to have part two. All right. You want to start us off with a couch, Sion? One. One. One. You're one, Marco. Oh, one again. Okay. Two. Three, four, five, six, one, two, three, four, five, four, six, one, two, three, four, five, six. Okay, please get together with your groups. I'm gonna check in with everybody and we'll meet right back here in 25 minutes. Okay, group four. Since Siongi is also one and a half.   Before we change it, don't go sleep. Did you get hurt? Yes. Oh yeah. It was a disgruntled disgruntled insect. Okay, here we go. Yeah, we're gonna scroll to first, I think that makes a better sense. Or the scrolls first. So will we stay here or will go some day out? No, no, let's say I'm gonna remote chair. No, you don't want to start. It's fine. There's another room there. I don't know that the There's another room there. I don't know if they have people outside. Can we bring you some chairs? Yeah. Oh, we have just a state sitting on next to the door, right? Behind you. So just as you are. You got this chair. You want this chair? Top three O5 calendars. I think here is probably the best, you know, because there is another room, but it's already there. But it's already there are a lot of groups and let us see if we respond to yesterday you really picked on me in your presentation. This is quite accurate.
