Within it, interested in speaking. So, um, Kang Ju Lee is a postdoc at Seoul University, South Korea, working in cognitorics, network theory, and topological data analysis. He'll be speaking today on simplicial electrical networks and their applications. Okay, the floor is yours. Hi, thank you for introducing me. My name is Kan July. I'm a postdoc at Seoul National University, South Korea. Today, I'll talk about simple share elections. I'll talk about simple electrical network and application with connection to HASIT theory. The main object of the talk is effective resistance from circuit theory. Effective resistance of two nodes A and B denoted by capital I sub AB. Denoted by capital I subab measures how well current flow between A and B are registered. Let us recall the definition of effective resistance. We add on new edge A B edge of battery Then the current flow current flow between A and B then the capital R sub A B is defined to be the resistance of the new edge AB. Then the effective resistance capital R sub A B satisfy the axiom of distance, then this effective resistance also called This effectiveness is also called the distance distance. Let me show you an example, and we will recall the three laws in electrical network. There are three laws in electrical network. The first one is Karkov's current law, and second is Kirkhoff's voltage low. The current is equivalent to the current The current is equivalent to the cycle and voltage is equivalent to cosycle. The current is the current law says the sum of currents in each node is zero and the voltage law says that the sum of voltage along each cycle is zero. And Om's law says the current and voltage are related by resistance on each edge. Here are examples of current and voltage. The left one is current, and the light one is voltage. I assign current and voltages to each edge. You can see that these lead colors with and with red colors and blue colors are satisfying the current law and voltage law respectively. Respectively. And we can also define voltage in terms of potential difference. Potential difference is potential is defined on each node. In light figure, we assign voltage. Voltages we assign potential denoted by phi and phi over one is two and phi over two is zero and phi over three is one, phi over four is five. Then you can see the potential difference is equal to the voltage I showed you before. People. In this example, what is the effectiveness capital 2 sub 4? The current over 2 sub 4 is 8 and voltage of 2 sub 4 2 and 4 is 5. They are hence Capital R sub A V effective response is 5 over A. We see the meaning of 5 over A. What is the meaning of 5 over A? We consider its reciprocal curve denoted by capital R s over 2 4 8 over 5. We rewrite over 5, we will rewrite 8 over 5, 1 plus 3 over 5. Then 1 minimum 1 is direct interaction between 2 and 4 by the edge, the black edge, and the 3 over 5 means the indirect interaction between 2 and 4 by 2 at 2 By two add two tests two one four and two three one four. Therefore, the effective consider both direct and indirect interactions. Stevenson and Jalen define information measure capital I sub AB as the reciprocal. As the reciprocal of effective response capital R sub A B. And for each node A, they define information central T denoted by capital I sub A is define the harmonic mean of capital I sub AB. Why they consider Why they consider the harmonic mean? They consider the information as a sort of velocity. So they consider the harmonic mean. And they apply their centrality measure to analyze AIDS network and barbon colony. And I capital I, so A is also referred to as colant for. Also referred to as current flow closedness central key and this capital SA is employed to identify the best spread node in 2017. The goal of today's talk is to generalize the concept of effective resonance to simplification network. Let's briefly review a high-dimensional generalization. A high-dimensional generalization, which consider several people's previous talks. In user network, interaction between every two people are represented by edge in simple network. So simplicity record interaction more than two nodes. Interaction more than two nodes. Three interactions are represented by triangle, and interactions among four people are represented by tetrahedron. And one of one example is collaboration network and collaboration paper. Paper represents the simplicity and simpler network or high order simpler or hyper network emerging field of network. High order interactions appears in several areas, including brain network and protein-protein interaction network. And protein-protein interaction network and link prediction, contagion model, page length, and chromato model discussed the previous talk and the consensus model over simple complex also discussed previous talk. Today, I will talk about a simple shell. About a simple generalization of effective resonance capital R sub A B. Here is the list of applications of Hadi Laplacian and Hadi decomposition appeared in the survey paper by Leken Lim. And one application of Hadi Laplacian is the last The last to generalize effective results to simple share complex 41 paper. Our paper today, I will introduce our result, simple shell network and effective resistance. In user electrical network, resistance are assigned to each edge to left to The left figure shows. In Shinpusha electrical network, listings are assigned to the face. In this live figure, the listeners are assigned to each triangle. And these are three laws in electrical network. I will show you. Network, I will show you before. We will consider its high-dimension generalization. Instead of graph G, we will consider a simple complex of dimension D and del sub D is the simple boundary operator, which is also denoted by V sub D previous to and the we assign Lear. So we assign real lumbar R sub tau for each for each these phases. We can generalize the three law in electrical network to higher dimension. This is initial initiated by Katanjado, Chonya Kwine in 2015. Then Coco's current. Then Kokov's current law says that capital I, the current capital I is contained in corner of the sub D. The count voltage law says that voltage capital V is contained in pop over corner of dash of D. And the Ohm's law says that the voltage of V. The voltage volume of tau is equal to I sub tau times resistance I sub tau. Then we can define effective resistance capital R sub sigma over d plus ones voltext state sigma. To define effective resistance in synficial electrical network, we We add on current generator sigma in this figure. Sigma is ABC triangle. As a Heideman general battery, we attach this simple X sigma, then we obtain the live figure X union sigma. Then the if And the effective resistance is defined to be the listance of a new simplex sigma in capital X union sigma. Then we need to consider the definition of simple effective resistance capital S of sigma is well defined and how can it extend the properties in the user. The usual circuit theory to temperature circuit theory. And we will just recall the combinatorial Laplacian or Had Laplacian. This is will denote delta sub i. In other talk, this delta sub i is also denoted by L capital L sub i. And the And this delta sub i is also defined in several previous talks. And combinatory HADI theory says that the kernel of delta sub i harmonic space is isomorphic to the leaders to homological as a R vector space. Then we consider a bigger complex Y is a d plus one dimensional complex with two conditions the dimension of the use homological group of y is equal to one and the deskeleton of y is same with the simplest complex x union sigma then the Then the three loads in pressure electrical network is listed as follows. The second law, current voltage law is equivalent to the voltage vector V is contained to pop over corner of del sub D is equal to corner of the transpose of del sub D sub T plus 1. Sub t sub t plus one, then since the dimension of the d reduced homology group of y is equal to one, then the latest of width lature over current and voltage are always current. So, current computational HAD theory shows the well-defined is over. Shows the well-definedness of our definition of capital R sigma. And energy minimizing property of harmonic element, just that high dimensional analog of Thomson's principle in circuit theory. And we obtained the expression of Expression of effective resistance capital S of sigma in terms of combinatorial Laplacian. In this theorem, we assume that the d minus one reduced group x is equal to one. In this example, in this theorem, the condition is the the condition is essential from the from this con from this condition we see that the combinatorial Laplacian delta sub d minus one has always inverse therefore we can consider the inverse over delta sub d minus one each the each element of this inverse matrix This inverse matrix denote by G sub nu and nu prime. Then our formula says that the simple effective resistance capital I sub sigma is equal to sum over minus one to the i plus j times g sub sigma sub i comma sigma sub j. In this formula, sigma sub i is the is the sigma minus i element, then g sub i is the set of nodes. Then the simple share effective results can be in terms of the plus one scale terms. I will show you an example. In this example, is does this scale letter of standard M Thus this calendar of standard m minus one simplex. The delta sub t minus one is has always nice formula for this standard simplex case is n times identity matrix. Then its inverse is n minus one over n times identity matrix. Therefore, by our formula, capital R sub sigma is Capital R sub sigma is D plus 1 over N. And I would like to point out the paper citing our result. One is on first paper is Hadi Laplacian on GREAP collecting the applications of Hadi Laplacian. And the second one is Poistance Laplacian, which Laplacian, which is already discussed in this conference several times. The second paper defines Laplacian and they present an algorithm to compute post-tent homology connecting our electrical circuit theory. And the last one is simple least tones. List on least curvature on graphs. Today's first talk was curvature. And the last paper may find a problem, generalize their list of covert to simpler complex, mentioning our effective resonance capture. Our effective resistance capital as sigma. And we define temperature Kirkup index using our capital R sub sigma, generalizing the lowestness measure of Kirkup index as a structural descriptor in mathematical chemistry. Basomedical chemistry and we generalize the formula in for Kirkov index in terms of Laplacian eigenvalues. We generalize this formula to higher dimension and compare several simplicial complexes using this index. And lastly, I will talk about the relation between electrical networks. Between electrical network and combinatorics. The object I like introduced is spanning tree. Spanning tree is the subgraph T of G satisfying following three conditions. And the second condition is T is connected. And third condition is T has no cycle. And we denote K of G, the number of penetrates T in G. Then there is a nice relation. There is a nice relation between combinatorial appliances and the number of spending CK of G. And it is a variation of metric Turie theorem by temporary. And then the determinant of the Jonda Plazian is equal to n scale times k of g and this formula generalizes to higher dimension. The second condition is given to the zerosomologist The zero homology is zero, and third condition is equal to the fourth homology equal to zero. And this is generalized, the concept of spanning to generalize to a simple complex by Geel Carli. And the second condition is generalized to higher dimension, the least homology, reduced d minus one homology is equal to zero. And the third condition is released homology of this dimension. This hold of this dimension is zero, then the this tree number is the sum of sum of spanning trees with on portion weight. Then there are general beautiful generalization of temporalist formula. The determinant of delta sub i combined to Laplacian is equal to k sub i minus one times k sub i square and k. sub i square and k sub i plus one and this is a generalization of the previous formula and this is a for the information for left term the complex operation the starting of eigenvalues of combined has been interest has been of interest in combinatorial In combinatorics. Here are the list of temperature complexes whose Laplace and Eigenvales are integer. The first one is transport complexes studied by Joy Friedman and Phil Harlan. And the second one is matrix complex by my advisor Cook and Leiner Canton. And third one is TPC complex. One is typically complex, my collaborator Dubar and Liner, and last one is matching complexes, you know, and what which works. And using this formula and the high-dimensional analyzation of temporary formula, one can compute the formula for simperature spanning tree. And we add on list for the formula for simple. The formula for simple share spanning tree. The last one is color-shifted complexity. This complexity has no integral Laplacian spectra. We using the effective resistance and electrical network, we compute the formula for color-shifted complexes. And we also give another method to computing the formula for shifting. The formula for shifted complex in the list in third part. And this is an idea of our method, which is an inductive method. This is a combinatorial interpretation of I sub AB effective distance. And I will show you just the example to compute the if compute the if k of g we will use this computatorial formula i sub a b is equal to 5 over 8 which i i show you the beginning of the talk and this 5 over 8 is obtained by the assigning the concert concrete value for each current and voltaging where the harmonic element then we We know the K of G minus AB is equal to 3. And using inductive hypothesis, we show that K of G is 8. Then using this method, and we generalize this ideal to a higher dimension, we give a new method of computing. Of computing the number of simpler spanning tree. This is my last slide. Thank you for your listening. Okay, any questions? Okay, well, thank you for your talk, Carl. So let's thank him one last time and then.
