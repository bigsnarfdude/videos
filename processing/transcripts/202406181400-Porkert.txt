Okay, so thank you first to the organizers for this nice conference and for inviting me to speak. So as was said, I will be talking about our ideas for a correction for iterated Eisenstein integral. And this is work together with Ollie and Akset Klashmid, which is very much in progress. Management, which is very much in progress. So, we've been working on it for approximately one and a half months, most of it while I was a visiting PhD student at Nordita. So, I'm also very grateful for their support. And so, as a motivation, we have seen talks from different areas of physics so far and will have some more. So, for example, about Farm integrals for collider physics, amplitude methods for gravitational waves, and also upper strength theory amplitudes. And in all these applications, Amplitudes and in all these applications, special functions and numbers appear. And so, as physicists, if we want to compute something either because you want to get a number out or want to understand the analytic structure better, we need to understand these special functions better. And yeah, there will also be a talk by Matthia tomorrow. And this is also a bit the motivation for this work that we want to understand better these iterated Eisenstein integrals. And so I will start by reviewing multiple polylogarithms, which you all probably know very well, and also their coaction. First, giving the basic definition and the applications in physics that the co-action and the symbol had for these functions, and then talking a bit about work by Ollie on generating series and finding this co-action and also single-valued versions from these generating series. And then I will introduce the topic of this talk, which are iterated Eisenstein. This talk, which are iterated Eisenstein integrals and their relation to EMZVs, and also talk about their generating series and the work also by Ollie and collaborators on this. And in the final part, I will talk about our candidate correction for these iterated Eisenstein integrals and tell you what we have found about this so far. Okay, so first I start with the review on multiple polylogarithms, which you all know very well, probably. So as physicists, we usually Probably. So, as physicists, we usually use this definition for multiple polylogarithms as iterated integrals. And their special values are the multi-seta values, which you can also write as a series or by evaluating g's at special points. And what physicists know is this coaction formal deal polylogarithms, which takes you from the q vector space of MPLs, which we call Of MPS, which we call A to A tensor H, where H is A modulo I pi A. And oops, how do I go? There are explicit ways to compute these that are well known. So for example, you can express your computation in this compact formula, where on one side you have this G of some vector of indices A, and on the other side you have other G's with a vector B and also. With vector B and also this GB, which is just evaluated around a different contour. And yeah, this is very well known how to compute. And examples include these simple formulas where you have g times one or one times or g. And also an important thing is the IÏ€, which never appears on the right-hand side. And this coaction has some properties that physicists also use. So, for example, the Also used. So, for example, the discontinuities only appear on the left-hand side and the derivative is on the right-hand side. And so, maybe I should give more comments on how exactly this is used. So, one way how physicists use this is by simplifying multivariate expressions through relations between MPLs by using the specific computation for some MPL and then comparing both sides. So, here I have a simple one-variable. So here I have a simple one variable example. So if you take the one one part of the k action of Li2 of one over x, you can then find how to write this without the one over x. And the only thing that's not fixed by this comparison with the correction is the set at root. So values of pi, and these can be obtained by evaluating at a specific point. And with these kinds of relations, you can make your numerics better, and this is implemented, for example, in polylog tools. Implemented, for example, in polylog tools. And on the other hand, you can also use these specific ways that derivatives and discontinuities interplay with the coaction to help you compute your derivatives or discontinuities of Feynman integrals. So this is the other applications for physicists. And this has been used for different calculations, also in connection with the symbol, which is just the maximal iteration of the coproduct. For example, to bootstrap. For example, to bootstrap planar NS4 amplitudes or also for phenomenological applications. Okay, so tomorrow you will hear a talk by Matthia, where he will give you the correct mathematical framework for this. So I will not say much about this because I'm not the expert. But the important thing is that the correct mathematical framework for this would be the motific collection where on the left-hand side of your tensor product you have a motific object, on the right-hand side, Motific object on the right-hand side, a DRAM object, and so this is just a symmetric description. And for physicists, the important point here is that this DRAM part is only defined up to powers of i pi, so you can discard all even setter values and work modulo i pi's. And as I said, tomorrow you will hear the correct version of this. Okay, so another approach to these multi-poly logs. These multipoly logs is via generating series. So there's this generating series GA, which has as coefficients these multipoly logarithms. And the generators are these EA, which we call the generators of the small algebra. And you can extend them with additional generators sigma to a large algebra if you want to also have your MZ V series. But so the relevant thing about this is you get this generating series, for example, from the set equation, and then you can read off your polylogs as the coefficients of the series in the EA's. And then there's this other generating series that I had already mentioned of the MZ Vs, which has these sigmas as its generators. And instead of directly putting the MZ Vs in, we use the F alphabet. So this So this by sends the setters to the F alphabet, and these independent words in the F alphabet give you Q independent motivic multiseta values. So you only get independent ones, and all the relations are already included. And examples are so in the simplest case, if you just have an uneven. Simplest case, if you just have an uneven setter value, it corresponds to an F, but for multi-setter values, you get these kinds of products of F's. Okay, so another thing that is nice about this F alphabet is that the correction for this F alphabet is very simple. So if you have a word of an even F and some odd Fs, then your correction will just be this sum over the F's. Over the Fs. And in this paper, Ollie and others have also found a correction for G from this generating series approach. And in the one variable case, the formula looks like this. So you have this generating series MDRAM, then the G series, the M series, and again the G series. And if you want to get out your correction for a specific MPL from this, you multiply it out. You multiplied out all of these generators here and then basically read off the coefficients of some word in the EA's. And from these m's, you will also get some of these other generators sigma, but they basically cancel out through their commutators that you know. Commutators that you know. And in the end, you can just read off your collection from this formula. And a similar formula exists also for multiple variables and for the single-valued version. Right, okay. So the idea is now that we want to find a generating series also for the collection of functions defined on the Toros, so the things that we've heard a lot about, J or even beyond that. And for this, we have some existing. We have some existing results. So, first of all, there's also a generating series for the iterated Eisenstein integrals. So, basically, something similar to this, but for these iterated Eisenstein integrals. And this is what we will use, but there are also already results for the correction or symbology itself by Matthia, which we will talk about tomorrow, but also by some physicists who looked at symbology for elliptic-feynman integrals. And our idea. Integrals. And our idea now is to start here with this generating series and then build a coefficient for iterated Eisenstein integrals. Okay, so I will first introduce these iterated Eisenstein integrals and they are formally defined as these iterated integrals over the kernels new, where the news are their most important ingredient is the Their most important ingredient is the holomorphic Eisenstein series GK, which also has a tau j and then a three factor in pi. And you iteratively integrate over these kernels and you get your iterated Eisenstein integrals, which generally for the indices you have k and j, where j only goes up to k minus. Okay, so these Italian Eisenstein integrals are related to something that probably physicists To something that probably physicists, or especially particle physicists, I guess, are more familiar with, which are the elliptic multi-ceta values. And those are defined as the special values of your elliptic multipoly logarithms. So similar to how the zeta values are special values of your MPLs. And these can be expressed in these iterated Eisenstein integrals in like collinear combinations. Okay, so now as I promised. Now, as I promised, there's also this generating series for the iterated Eisenstein integrals, which takes the form of a path-ordered exponential of an integral over the Eisenstein series. And if you then expand this out, it looks like this. So, you again have an alphabet of generators, which here are the Tsunoga generators. So, this is not a really algebra, but there are relations between them, which are relations between them which give you also only the iterated Eisenstein integrals that you're interested in and then the coefficients are these iterated Eisenstein integrals and some free factor and again you just can read off your iterative Eisenstein integrals from these series right and also we again use the generating series for the multi-seta values where on one hand we have our generator sigma i which generator sigma i which contain the sets and also basically infinite series of more of the suno-gai generators. Yes, and you can on the other hand also just look at m's in the sets itself which will give you different objects in the end but that I will come to later. And if you want to look at single valued multi-seta values you just Multi-seta values, you just put a function SV in here for your F alphabet, which is also well understood. So you can just put in here the single-valued F alphabet. Okay, so these are the ingredients that we need. And for these ingredients, you might also want to compute a modular transformation. So for example, if you take your generating series for the iterated Eisenstein integrals, you can compute the S transformation by modular. The S transformation by multiplying with a generating series S and then transforming your I plus. So, first of all, to transform this I plus, you just act on the generators by changing their index, their upper index and having some prefactor. And we also write these with the matrix US to minus one and US. And also, you need this series S, which is a series of Which is a series of multiple modular values, which are these objects. And for depth one, they are just simple zeta values. But for depth two and higher, you could also get L values and multi-ceta values. And the easiest way to say this is that they are just the E evaluated at tau is zero. And on the other hand, we also have the tau transformation, which is very similar, but even simpler to compute. Similar, but even simpler to compute. And I'm saying this in that much detail because we actually, in the end, with our, I guess, for the correction, also find relations for these multimodular values that appear in the S. Okay, so the thing that Olli did in his previous work was to look at equivariant and single-valued combinations of these iterated Eisenstein integrals, and both constructions are very similar. So, what the physicists So, what the physicists, or specifically string theorists, are interested in is the equivariant iterated Eisenstein integrals because you want to have nice properties under modular transformations. And you get these by combining your generating series M with I tilde, another M and I. And in the first M, you have the set, and in the second, you have the sigma. So, as a reminder, the sigma was the set, and some more of these tsunogai Of these Tsunogai generators. So, in this case, here you only have the set, so a lot of terms basically drop out in such a way that this transforms nicely under modular transformations. And on the other hand, you can also take the sigmas in both of your M's and you get the single-valued iterated Eisenstein integrals, which are more canonical. Okay, so the idea is now to also make a Also, make a similar construction for our correction. So, what is known on this side is like the correction for the MPS, which in the generating series formalism takes this form. And it is known how to construct the single-valued MPS from this. So, this is a well understood part of this diagram. Then, what is also understood now is how to construct your generating series for the iterative. Generating series for the iterated Eisenstein integrals. So we can go here. And now, what our idea was basically was to find a similar pattern as here for our iterated Eisenstein integrals, which you can actually already read off if you compare these sides. So here you have single-valued m, g, single-valued mg, and here you have your Here you have your single-valued m i, single-valued mi. So you can do something similar to go here and then understand how this object behaves. So this is then our candidate for this correction from the generating series. And it looks as you would expect from the diagram before like this. So you take your m sigma, which contains Diram's setter values, then your I plus M, then again an M sigma and an I plus. Then again, an m sigma and an i plus m. So this is your only motific part. It contains your motific iterated Eisenstein integrals. And then all the other integral, the other ingredients give you the DRAM part. And you get your EDRAMs from the I plus and the other DMs give you CETA values. And some simple examples. So for depth one, this is very simple. So you just have always EM plus EDRA. Always em plus EDRAM. And for depth 2, you get something similar, but you also get products of depth 1, iterated Eisenstein integrals, and theta values. And maybe this is also important to mention. I always skip the tensor product to make the notation a bit shorter. So this EM would mean EM tensor one, for example. Okay, so we made this conjecture and then we looked at the properties of this. Of this operation. And the first thing we did was to look at how this behaves on specific limits. So the first limit we looked at was tau to I infinity. For tau to I infinity, i plus m is just one because your integral boundary is just the same. And that means that if you then compute the correction, you put in one here and here. So you just have sigma derivative. So you just have sigma d ram to minus one and sigma d ram, which is one. And this is exactly the same as per action of one. So in this limit, it works very trivially. The second limit we looked at was tau to zero. For tau to zero, your i plus m just becomes s. So this is the series that we also use for s transformation and which has as its coefficients the multiple modular values. And for this evaluation to be well defined, you Be well defined, you need to have your correction of S plus to be this combination. So you either insert S plus for this limit, and on the other hand, you can also insert the limit in your correction itself. And you find that for this to agree, you need to have this coaction for S plus. And this is still a conjecture that this is true. We check this for many cases, so for K4, 6 and also for depth 2 different combinations of 4 and 6. And yeah, but we still need to consider a bit more this conjecture for the S. But this could also actually be useful to compute this multiple modular values in a faster way than by using PSLQ. By using PSL2. And what is now left to do also is to check whether this also works at other points, but it's a bit harder to check because these two limits give us very simple objects for I in the limit, but for other limits, it's a bit harder. And also to check the other properties and to compare to the literature. So a simple property that one can check is how the derivatives act on it. And you want to have something similar to what you get for MPLs. What you get for MPLs. And we actually find something similar. So we find also, maybe here the reversion is not that important, but we find that your co-action of d tau is the same as acting on only the RAM side with B tau after the coaction. So this is the same that you get in MPL case. And now we also wanted to look at modular transformations. So in the MPL case, there's a well-understood behavior under discontinuities where there are Behavior under discontinuities where they are only on the left-hand entry. So, our very naive expectation in the beginning was maybe modular transformations also only act on the left-hand side. And we checked this by just looking at an example and found that it's not true. So, if we look at, for example, at this collection of EM04, we get this example. Four, we get this expression, and on the other hand, if we first act with the coaction and then with the S-transformation, we get this expression. And they look kind of similar, but there are some differences. So, for example, here in the EDRAM, we have a zero for the collection first, and in the other case, we have a two, and we also get an additional zeta value. For the T transformation, it worked very well, but for the S transformation, it did not. So, what we So what we conjecture is that the actual behavior of coaction and S transformation looks like this. So if we first act with the S transformation and then with the coaction, it's the same as first acting with the coaction. And then with this tensor of S transformation times something that we call pre-S transformation, which is just the part of the S transformation that changes the generator. So before I had Before I had explained how the S transformation acts on I, and we had this series S and the part that acts on the E's, and this is only the part that acts on the E's. And then also you need to put in a mod setter DRAM. So this pre-S fixes this basically, and the mod setter DRAM makes this comparison correct. And it's not only some unknown modding out, but we actually have a generating series. Actually, we have a generating series also for the rest that we have here. And we check this explicitly for all of these values, so for k up to 10 and depth 1, and then for these combinations. And similar behavior happens for the t-transformation. And for that reason, we conjecture that for any modular transformation, you can write down the behavior of this collection candidate. Candidate in the same way. And what we finally looked at was whether you can write down some different map that gets rid of the mod set that they run for you. So, in a similar way, that for the single-valued version, you have the single-valued version and the equivariant version. And so, we wanted to have something like the equivariant version of our map, which doesn't need this mod set that you run, but has nice modular transformation properties by itself. And that was actually possible. Actually, possible, so we write down a second operation which here has the set instead of the sigma. So we lose some of the tsunogai generators in our n. And here we have just gamma tensor pre-gamma, but no mod set.diram. And we also check this for different values. But the interesting thing that we actually found for the first time by observing this object. First time by observing this object, was that here we get the same correction for the multiple modular values that we also found by looking at the evaluation of our other candidate correction. And we checked this for many values. So yeah, this is also something we still want to look at a bit more, what one can do with this formula and also to prove it. But the big downside to But the big downside to this map is that it's not actually well defined with evaluation, and you can see this very easily. So, if you can take the example of tau to i infinity, you have one if you first act with the limit, but if you first compute the correction or a not coectionless map and then uh put the limit in, you don't get one. So yeah, this is uh somehow an interesting object to play with, but uh not our our good candidate. Not our good candidate. Okay, yeah, this actually concludes the talk. So, what have we done? We have found a candidate coaction and understood how it interplays with evaluation, derivatives, and modular transformations. And in that process, we have also found a contexture for the co-action on these generating series of multiple modular values. And the next thing you want to do is compare this to other notions of coactions for EMZVs, look at more examples, and then. Look at more examples and then also look more at this, try to prove it, understand its implications. And of course, as a next step, it would be more interesting to look at cases for EMPLs with one or several variables, and in the very far future, also at higher genus cases. Okay, thank you. Yeah, that's a good question that we are also thinking about what we could check as because the good thing about these limits is that uh they just have a really nice um form that's very well understood, but we are we are we are thinking about it. We are thinking about it. Not expecting like we were sure, it was just we expected some interesting behavior like this. Um So I forgot. Maybe Ollie can say something on this. The image of the tau plane with a modular parameter is it. And take this modular t factor, which is just a loop around the origin to do this. And or we get genus zero, we loop to the last one. And at genus zero, we sometimes take half from zero to one. And the cutest analog of that associated with the modulus. associated with the modular S whether S maps tau from infinity with the original tau which included something that the original function. But this is more like an analogy to that but here I can give a more precise mathematical characterization with analogy. Yes. So, I mean, what dropped out, what we really didn't land with, is also this conjecture for the S plus M, and there you can actually find, hopefully, the multiple modular values from this new relation. This new relation, yeah next week I'm on vacation. Yes for Delta. Therefore, there are maybe the projector for a cluster which should be tested for various cases, reading efficient corrections.
