Welcome, everybody. We now have Tony Feng here to tell us about the Galois action on symplectic K-theory. Okay, thanks a lot for the invitation to speak. So most of the talk will be explaining what the title means. So if that's not something already familiar, don't worry about that. And everything will be joint work with Sarin Galatius and Akshay Mekatesh. And so the plan is that I'm going to begin with some kind of cool teaser factor. Begin with some kind of cool teaser facts to try and pique your interest. Then I'm going to talk about a connection between arithmetic groups, the theme of this conference, and Galois presentations, a connection which goes under the umbrella of the Langlands correspondence. Actually, it's very convenient for me that Matt just explained a lot of this. And finally, I'm going to dive into some more specifics about some fluctuate decay theory. So to begin, I just want to list some kind of cool facts. Some kind of cool facts, which illustrate, I think, a deep connection between number theory in my field and topology and Homotopy theory. So the distribution of primes is governed by this thing, the Riemann zeta function, defined as so, the sum of reciprocals of integers to the s power. So I'm just going to write out some kind of selected values of the Riemann zeta function. Zeta of two is pi squared over six, zeta of three is this thing, uh, zeta. This thing, zeta 4 is pi to the fourth over 90. And what we're seeing, as you would expect, I think, from this kind of infinite expression, is that you can plug in an integer and you're going to get something which is kind of a random decimal expansion. So that makes it kind of interesting that when you start evaluating this function at negative integers, for example, zeta minus one, the sum of one plus two plus three plus four plus, et cetera, it turns out to be something relatively tame, minus 112. Minus 112. And if you evaluate it at minus 2, you're just going to get 0. And of course, I'm being slightly facetious here. So, what I really mean is that this state of s, which is operator defined by a formula that makes sense when s is large, actually admits some kind of analytic continuation to the complex plane. And these are the values at these analytically continued points. And if one continues on in this game, one will keep computing values. For example, the next one is. Values. For example, the next one is zeta minus 11 is 691 over 32,760, which I bring up because it exhibits something which, from the perspective of this talk, is interesting. So for our purposes, when a prime, the 691 is prime, appears in the numerator of some kind of negative odd zeta value, then that's interesting for us. But as we're seeing here, something which we didn't see kind of up here is that these numbers are. Kind of up here is that these numbers are all rational. And so that maybe suggests that there's some sort of higher reason for why this is happening. Maybe these numbers are rational because they are trying to count something. And that's, in fact, true. And what they are trying to count are what are called the algebraic k-groups of the integers. So it's a theorem that zeta 1 minus 2i, for i bigger than 1, up to a sign and a factor of 2, the ratio between factor of two the ratio between k4i minus two and k4i minus one and this theorem well why is it true so it's actually a combination of two very different and both very uh deep facts one is the quillen-lichtenbaum conjecture as proved by rost and voibotsky which relates the relevant Which relates the relevant, for example, the K4A minus 2 to some atol cohomology group. So that's an interesting thing, but it's not going to play a further role in this talk. So I'm not going to say more about that. But I will say a little bit more about this right-hand side connection, which says that kind of the value or the p-adic valuation of the zeta function at negative integers is the same as the size of the Zeta-Kohl multi group. That's called the Iwasawa main conjecture, and it was proved by Mazer-Weils. And it was proved by Maser Wiles. Okay, so just to before I really say more about that, I want to say how I'm thinking about this group here. In case it's not that familiar, so let me just say that this is my shorthand for notation you might have seen, which is cohomology of the space, the scheme, specs that you want to repeat with these coefficients. These coefficients are some kind of. Coefficients. These coefficients are some kind of local system. And more precisely, it's built out of roots of unity. So you take the inverse limit of the p power roots of unity. That's Zp of one, then tensor to the 2 ith power. This is a free Zp module of rank 1, but its Galois action is non-trivial. That's why we make sure to notate it in this way. Galois acts in some non-trivial way on roots of unity. So this is some formalism, this atoll homology, some formalism. This atal homology is some formalism of singular cohomology, but for schemes. And so if you're a topologist, you want to think of this as being like the singular cohomology of some kind of atol homotopy type of this scheme, spec 1 over z over 1, 1 over p. And to get a sense of what that thing should look like, I'm going to tell you or show you a little rough picture of this ADOT homotopy type. So the first thing to understand is that the homotopy type of spec Z1. The homotopy type of spec Z1 over P is meant to look like an open three manifold. And this is something which is true in general for rings of integers. And the more primes that you invert, primes are not. So the more primes you invert, it's like you're taking a knot complement in this open three manifold. The second thing to understand is that this space is meant to be a kÏ€1, where pi is therefore the eta fundamental group, and that the eta fundamental group is Atoll fundamental group is, in some natural way, a quotient of the Galois group, absolute Galois group of Q, which could be thought of as the fundamental eto fundamental group of Q. So these facts will let us kind of interpret this H2 right here. First of all, because it's an open three manifold, H2 is dual to some kind of H1. Maybe I should put C for compactly supported. There's some condition at the boundary, but So, there's some condition at the boundary, but the size of h2 will be the same as the size of certain h1, and then secondly, because of this second bullet point, this h1 is some kind of h1 for a group, so it could be interpreted as an extension group. So, it's the space of extensions of this fundamental group, pi1c1 over p, with some condition at p that's corresponding to this compact support. That's corresponding to this compact support between, well, as it shakes out, like these two Galois modules. Another cyclotomic twist, like we saw up here, and some sort of just torsion, p-torsion group with trivial action. So, the upshot of all this was to say that kind of the way we think about this group, at least from the perspective of this right-hand relationship, is that it's some kind of space. Is that it's some kind of space of Galois representations of a specific form, and they're reducible. So they're not, um, they're kind of different from maybe the focus of what Smet was discussing, Taylor Wilde's story, and so on. We're looking for reducible Gau representations, but we're looking for ones that are not split, so interesting extensions. So that's kind of what this arrow is about. It's about like every time p divides a zeta value, you have to go out and find yourself some kind of non-trivial Galois extension. Some kind of non-trivial Galois extension. And one can ask, like, where are we going to get these interesting Galois representations? And the answer, and this is where we tie into the theme of the conference, is you look at the cohomology of arithmetic subgroups. In this case, arithmetic subgroups is SL2Z. So if you look at the H1 there, it's going to have actually a natural Galois action. And at the same time, And at the same time as we discussed, it has HEC operators. So there will be commuting HEC operators, commuting with each other and with the Galois action. And if this is not something familiar, I'm going to review the mechanism for this thing shortly. But the point is now, this is, of course, this H1 is some big space if gamma is pretty small. But using HEC operators, you can cut it down to sort of smallish pieces. And then you can look at how Gawa acts on those pieces. And in particular, you look at You look to see if you can find the types of reducible representations that you want to prove this theorem. So, this is where we segue into kind of more general context of the Language philosophy. And part of that, I think, is that the cohomology of the arithmetic groups should account for all Galois representations of a certain shape. So, I declined to say exactly what I mean, but if one puts appropriate adjectives. But if one puts appropriate adjectives, one can expect some kind of true statement. And so we can think of this as a kind of duality where on one side you're looking at cohomology arithmetic groups with the action of Hec operators, and that's a kind of automorphic data. So we'll call this the automorphic side. And the other side is some kind of space of Galois data. And the key case, I think the core case where Case where in all situations where we can prove interesting such relationships, interesting such reciprocity relationships, the core case is the case of the symplectic group, or at least like that exhibits the core phenomenon from which this principle is built. So to explain that, the key point is that the classifying space of this integral symplectic group actually has a lot more structure than what would immediately. lot more structure than what would immediately one would initially imagine so um we can present it as the quotient of the ziegl upper half space hg by by the this sp2g action so this thing this ziegle upper half space is uh what i guess matt was calling gmod k in the previous talk and uh in this case uh what it what it is is it's the space of g by g complex matrices which G complex matrices which are symmetric and their imaginary parts are positive definite. And so here's a picture, at least for g equals one. It's something probably pretty familiar. It's the usual like a half plane. And it has an action of sp2gz by linear fractional transformations. This thing itself, Z-Wauper half space, is contractible. And so And so, if one takes this quotient in a free way, like an orbifold quotient, then it will be a model for this classifying space. And so, this topological space will compute the group homology of gamma. Okay, and the thing which makes this presentation really special is that it has some kind of moduli theoretic interpretation. Namely, this quotient can be interpreted as the moduli space of abelian variety. Interpreted as the moduli space of abelian varieties of dimension G over the complex numbers. So if this phrase abelian varieties isn't familiar, that's okay. It won't, like the technical properties of it won't play much of a role in this talk. But I think at least one example is probably pretty familiar, which is that if you give a point in this complex upper half space, then you can form an elliptic curve, you can form this complex numbers quotient by z plus. Quotient by z plus z tau, this lattice spanned by one and tau, and that will that will look like this as a as a topological space. It's a torus and it has a complex structure, and it can be promoted to an elliptic curve, which is a ambulane variety of dimension one. But for our purposes, what's important about this is that this is a purely algebraic notion. It didn't It didn't require, it doesn't require anything about the complex numbers, even though over the complex numbers, maybe there's some kind of connection to topology. We want to make sense of it purely within algebraic geometry and kind of in any kind of algebraic geometric family. And the upshot of that is that there's some thing, some stack, AG, which is the moduli space of abelian Faraday as the dimension G over any base in the language of algebraic geometry. Of algebraic geometry. And this is some more fundamental, more primordial object, such that if I take its complex points, then I recover this discussion we had above. And in particular, I recover this nice model for the classifying space of SP2GZ. And a consequence of all this is that this appearance of this space as coming from something. Of this space as coming from something kind of more primordial reveals extra symmetries on it. For example, it's a consequence of some general compatibility and comparison theorems that because of this, the cohomology of this classifying space with p-adic coefficients is canonically identified with the atal cohomology of AG times over spec C with spec C. So, whatever this right-hand side means, one thing is evident about it, which is that What is evident about it, which is that it has symmetries by automorphisms of C, just because they act on this space right here. And therefore, the left-hand side also acquires such symmetries. Although one can show that they're going to factor through the action of the Galois group, and actually they'll factor furthermore through the Fendeman group of C1 over P. But in this way, through this algebra geometric interpretation, we Interpretation, we see some kind of expert symmetry on this thing. Okay, and so that's the one mechanism by which this language philosophy is realized, that you can start with arithmetic groups and extract Galois representations out of it. However, so far, so in principle, all the co-multi-arithmetic groups should be related to Galois representations, but the irreducible The irreducible Gauer implementations, in some sense, like the ones of the most fundamental ones, are, as Matt was saying, mostly tied up with the middle of COMOLG, depending on how middle you, if it's really sp2gz, it's exactly in the middle. And sort of if it's GLNZ, it could be a little bit thicker, but very, very close to the middle. And so the work of Wiles and Taylor and other people in this tradition. Other people in this tradition aim is to establish a theorem which has the following kind of shape. So, here's a sort of prototype for what this theorem looks like. And it says if I take the middle cohomology of appropriate arithmetic group and I sort of concentrate it on some particular Hegend system, then I'd like to show that it's the universal Galois representation of a certain type, like with some adjectives like irreducible, and I could put some condition on his restriction. Could put some condition on is restriction to the fundamental group of the p-adic numbers and so on. And this is the kind of thing which one can hope to prove about like things contributing to this little sliver here. But as I say, in principle, we're interested in other kinds of other parts of chromology as well. One thing which makes them difficult to analyze is kind of forgetting the Gal action. We don't even really know what they look like as groups. But there's one part which is kind of But there's one part which is kind of accessible, which is the stable range. In this stable range, some kind of new structure crystallizes, which allows us to say pretty non-trivial things about it. So by definition, by stable range, I mean like the homology of this arithmetic group has already stabilized to kind of what its value is at infinity. And a new structure appears at infinity, which is kind of underlying why it's possible to say interesting things about it, which is that you have some kind of concatenation structure. Given an infinite symplectic matrix, another infinite symplectic matrix, they're mostly identity, but you can just stick these two things next to each other and get a new infinite symplectic matrix. And that's a kind of structure which one doesn't have when considering matrices of like a When considering matrices of like a fixed size. And let me just emphasize here that we're actually walking a bit of a dangerous line. Like it's close to make, considering the stable range is close to making the Gala action not interesting. If we were to consider rational coefficients, it would not be so interesting. So it's crucial that going forward, we're really going to be thinking about integral theory, ZP coefficients. That's what allows it to. That's what allows it to still be interesting. Okay, so this sort of term, like formalizing, you know, what this property means and like why it's useful and so on is the domain of algebra K-theory. So let me just quickly review kind of the classical perspective on this. And it's that if I take like the union, disjoint union of all these classifying spaces, then so that's the classifying space for all finite projective Z models. Space for all finite projective z modules, then that thing that's a space which has a monoid structure under the direct sum. You can take a direct sum of two projective modules or kind of concretely, it's like some sort of concatenation procedure. And then I can take this monoid and feed it into machines. Like, so I can sort of feed into a group completion. It'll output some kind of group-like space. I could feed it into infinite loop space machines. Feed into infinite loop space machines and end up with a thing called an algebraic k-theory spectrum. And I would define the higher algebraic k-groups to be pi i of this spectrum. And somehow I haven't really explained it, but it's related to stable homology by this work of Quillen. That being said, going forward. That being said, going forward, I'm going to drop this point of view of stable homology and think of the K-theory as being the correct thing to consider. Okay, so this was a story for the general linear group, but we're interested in the symplectic group, and we can feed it into a similar process and get these symplectic K-theory groups defined in a very similar way. And we can then define the higher symplectic K-theory and K-theory. And then, specifically, because we're working with the integers, they'll carry some additional structure, which we didn't see in the previous case of algebraic K-theory. They'll carry the action, a natural action of a Galois group by the same mechanism which I explained the Galois action on the homology of symplectic groups. And so, our work is about describing what is this Galois action. About describing what is this Galois action. So it turns out to be interesting in degrees which are 2 mod 4 specifically. And so what does that look like? Well, it turns out that as a group, this symplectic K theory in those degrees is an extension of Zp by the usual algebraic K-theory. And if one analyzes the situation more closely, one can see that, like, in this example, We can see that, like, in this extension structure, which is preserved by the Galois action, this thing has a trivial action, and this thing has the action indicated by this 2i minus 1 here. But I just want to emphasize that this, even the underlying statement about groups here, which looks like maybe could be the output of some computation, is actually the output of some deeper properties of K-theory. It's actually the output of a periodicity theorem saying that the difference between these two spectra. Saying that the difference between these two spectra is something periodic. So it's already to describe this at the level of groups is using some kind of phenomenology of k-theory, which one doesn't see for cohomology. But okay, let me continue on to just describe what the answer is. So it turns out this is the universal representation for this kind of Galois group, which is of the form this twist by some group with has a trivial action. Some group which has a trivial action. The same kind of extensions that were actually discussed at the beginning of the talk, and which is furthermore split after restriction to the fundamental group of the pedic numbers. So this kind of condition was also mentioned before, like typically in this Taylor-Wiles type stuff, you also have to impose a condition on the restricted get members. So, okay, I think I'm out of time, so thanks for your attention. Let's thank our speaker. Are there questions? Yes. So the zeta values were fractions. So it's tounted like a dimension or something. Okay, I didn't hear that. You said the zeta values are fractions, and how is the what? The what's definite dimension of the space, or how what's the formula supposed to tell me about the denominator? Let me just scroll up first. Okay, are you talking about this thing here? Like it's a fraction, and that fraction is like an integer mod integer, and the integer is the size of the group. I think it takes a little just below that sense that. So just below that it says that like just the part that's back from the bottom of the screen get that. So okay, yeah, sorry. So I'm going to start answering what I think the question was and someone corrected. I didn't exactly hear. So we're, yeah, we're going to prove what I'm saying here is we're proving this statement like prime by prime. So like for a prime which divides this, we kind of want to show Which divides this, we kind of want to show that it divides this and vice versa. So, like tensoring this with Zp extracts the part of this finite group, which is, you know, which is like the P part of it. And the size of that group is the same as the size of this group. The size of this group is the same as the p-adic norm of this number. Was that the question? I think that. Are there other questions? Does the same argument work for totally real fields? We haven't tried to write it down, but I think it does. Yeah. So, I mean, I guess there's a question of what the statement should be. I think we thought about it just enough to think that it's a similar statement, but where one Statement, but where one has like the Hodge. This thing comes kind of from the Hodge bundle in some sense. And in total wheel case, the Hodge bundle will decompose into maybe a direct sum of several things. And then there should be like a universal extension of that several things. And that's what it should be. Right. I mean, because the representation you sort of see is not the right one, but it's tensor product. The right one, but it's tensor product. Right. And this is sort of only an indirectly related question, but I wanted to tie it together to the question I asked at the end of Matt's talk. So when you take the cohomology in these low degrees, you get these very simple stable comology. You get these very simple stable cohomology groups. Can you say anything precise about how the HEC operators act? Like one question, I mean, if the group you get is Z, there's not much way the Hack operator can act. Things act by their degree. But when there's this torsion, there's a possibility that they might act non-semi-simply. And so, this non-steady simple action is sort of exactly maybe related to this extension here. And so, one question is, I mean, I'm still under the at some point for some reason we're writing down like a fake argument that on the stable part, the heck action actually does have to be true. Heck action actually does have to be trivial, but I forget if we really tried to pin down whether it's true on the nose. But what does your theorem with Matt Sagan? I mean, don't you? Oh, no, but it's sort of, it just says that it's sort of that this operator is nil, that the thing you think might be zero is nil potent. Okay. And of course, it might be zero. I mean, if you have a nil potent operator acting on Z, it kind of has to be zero. It kind of has to be zero, but a nilpotent operator on Z plus a finite group does not have to be zero. And you might expect it to actually be nilpotent of order two, and that nilpotence to be related to exactly this extension you're writing down. I mean, we say you might expect if you come back and tell me, actually, we can prove it's literally zero, I wouldn't fall out of my chair. But yes, I'm not sure that we hadn't, or certainly I haven't thought about this. Or certainly, I haven't thought about this. There's no reason why you would know the answer, but it's more a suggestion that I'd be interested in the answer. I would say that when P is large enough with respect to I, but I is still in the stable range, so we can still talk about homology. These things arise some kind of quotient of stable homology by like Like sort of massive products and things like that from lower degrees. And so, um, so perhaps perhaps we don't like, I feel like on this thing, it's not something on the on this quotient, it's going to be similarly simple, but perhaps for quotienting, it's not. Sorry, yeah, that wasn't, that wasn't very answered to anything, uh, just the fun. Not just the podcast, yeah. It's an interesting question, actually. Maybe someone in the audience knows. I mean, is there any argument that even integrally unstable, like the stable part of homology, that the hip operators have to be trivial? Well, that was sort of the question. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah. So to say even sounds like the simpler question, but I think that sounds still a hard question. So it's still a hard question. I think this is interesting because I was always asking, I've been asking Tony and Abner in which sense the eigenvalues are trivial on the stable part. And they always said, yeah, that's something that Caligari and Emerton have done. And so, like, so it's not really known. And like, another question would be like, Another question would be: like on the counterpart in the top dimension, like it's also like, I mean, the free part apparently, there, it's there, it's trivial. That's what Tony said. But could you elaborate, somebody elaborate on what's known, what's actually known? Maybe we should talk about it in tea. Yeah, like thank Tony. Thank Tony again.
