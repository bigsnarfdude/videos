Well, what's going to happen when I look at the, you know, when I switch to eladic atal cohomology? And we wanted to know what the Galois action is going to be like. And it turned out to do that, we needed to do something really quite geometric and explicitly find symplectic involutions on these other hypercalors. And so that is. And so that is what we did. And in fact, we found symplectic involutions on hypercalors of larger dimension as well. And I should hedge slightly from my abstract and say it's not absolutely all hypercalors of Kumar type, because I think the definition of this is just that they're deformation equivalent to the generalized Kumar, but it's all of them that I can make out of a moduli space. That I can make out of a moduli space on stable sheets. Okay, so to state these results properly, so that I can actually write down something more definite for you, I'm going to need to define everything. And so I'll start out by giving us some background. So today what I'm going to do is I'll start out by Is uh I'll start out by giving backgrounds and reminding us of uh construct like a construction of these things, and um then I'm going to talk about the statement of the results and the uh and the symplectic involutions that we found. And these things have some really cool geometry. So, as there's time, I'm going to talk about the fixed loci of these things in an example. An example. So we'll see how far I get. Okay, so just a reminder. I want to give a, so there are a lot of different definitions of hypercalars that people give. You know, they might like to say, you know, like compact Kalar, holomorphic, symplectic. I'm going to. I'm going to give one that follows Fu and Foo and Li, where they were working with these things over a positive characteristic. So they were thinking it's kind of auto-setting. So they said smooth projective varieties with trivial ATAL fundamental group. group and um so that there exists uh like symplectic so non- like everywhere non-degenerate and closed um algebraic two form but um really the way i like to think about these things is in terms of examples because not a whole lot are known and so Whole lot are known, and so when I think of hypercaleries, I'm, you know, it's easier to just like I tend to think of the classes of examples that are known. Um, so for one thing, uh, I you can think of these as generalizations of K3 surfaces, so right, their dimensions are always even, and in dimension two, this is K3 surfaces. Um, but there are a couple of big families of examples. are a couple of big families of examples that include K3 surfaces, like one of them includes K3 surfaces. So there are ones that are called K3N type. So these are made, these are moduli of stable sheaves on K3 surfaces. And there are ones of Kumer N type. And these are the ones I'm talking about today. And they're constructed by starting out with my Can constructed by starting out with moduli stable sheets on abelian surfaces and doing something that I'll show. And there are a couple of sporadic examples, one that's six-dimensional and one that's 10-dimensional due to O-grade. Okay, so let's talk about, I'm gonna talk about these guys today, so let's see their construction. Let's see their construction. So, and I guess I'm going to, you know, I'm going to specifically talk about ones that come from modulized stable sheets. So I want to fix A, an abelian surface. And I want to work with moduli of stable sheaves on A with a fixed Mucai. A with a fixed Machai vector. So in order to get my moduli space to be irreducible, I'm going to want to fix some numerical invariants. So just as a reminder, if I've got a coherent sheaf, then its Mukai vector is going to be the true character times the square root of the todd class. But since I'm working with abelian. But since I'm working with abelian surfaces, this is just going to be one. So here, you know, today, this is the same thing as the train character. And what these, so, right, this lives in even collogy. And then what this is telling me is it's giving me the rank. And the middle class is going to be the neuron-severi class of the determinantal line bundle. Determinantal line bundle of my coherent sheaf. And the last thing is going to be the Euler characteristic in the abelian surfaces case. So there's a couple of results here that I want to use in order to do this construction. And I should say these are going to be like I'm using Giesecker stability. I'm using Giesecker stability. So due to McKlein, if H is so right, G-Sigur stability is defined in terms of Hilbert polynomials. So I have to pick a polarization. It's got to be general, so not sitting on a wall, so that this thing works. And then I want to fix a Muci vector that's going to be primitive in terms of like, In terms of like primitive, kind of in the lattice that it sits in. And then given those criteria, then this moduli space, which I'll call, say, M uh V, I'm kind of suppressing the H because as long as it's kind of picked generally, I'm not too. generally i'm not too i'm not too worried about it um then this is a projective scheme of uh dimension v squared plus two right so i have a pairing that's defined on um the mukai vectors that i'm using to decide what this is so if i take the So, if I take this pairing, right, it's the intercept pairing. And some people choose different conventions than others. But this is the convention I'm choosing for what the intersection, what the pairing of these factors should look like. So, but this thing is not yet my hyper Kaler. To get my hypercaler, I have to do something additional. So I need to use a result of Yoshioka. It tells me what the Albanese morphism of these things are. So the Albanese morphism of for MV. Well, I'm going to say what it does, and then I'm going to say what the domain is. So if I've got some coherent sheaf living in here, then what is Then, what it's going to do is it's going to send F to the determinant, the determinant align bundle of F. And then it's going to make a pair here where the second factor is the determinantal line bundle of line bundle of what I'm calling phi p of f where phi p so we're derived geometers so we like this part so this is this is the the for you muckai trans form that has kernel the point current bundle and i don't have a nice simple don't have a nice simple like a like a nice simple characterization of exactly what this thing is but it's at least helpful to know over here that what this would what this would do is send say a degree zero line bundle to the skyscraper of the point on a for some consistency with later stuff um With later stuff. So, right, a dual parametrizes degree zero line bundles on A, and so this degree zero line bundle actually gets sent to the skyscraper sheaf at the point corresponding to it. And then similarly, the skyscraper sheaf corresponding to a point here would go to the degree zero line bundle on the other side that corresponds to it. So, I'm going to use this notation for this specific V for you. Specific like the Fourier Mukai transform. Okay, and then where does this thing live? Well, the determinant, so since I fixed the Mukai vector, so this is going to live in the Picard group of A with neuron Savari class L. And then this part, actually, by fixing this neuron several class, I'm fixing the neuron several class over here. Over here. So there's just something that it has to be, and I'll just call it L hat. And this is where it lives. And if I'm living over like something algebraically closed, then of course this is just isomorphic to A hat cross A. Okay, so that's what the Albanese morphism looks like. Looks like here. And so to define the hypercalic forfold, so I'll call this, or well, it's going to depend on what V is, whether it's a fourfold or not. But to define these generalized commers that I'm interested in, I want to fix. Fix a point in the codomain over here. And for my purposes, I want to fix these line bundles to be symmetric. So meaning that If I write so the minus one map that acts on A, I can make this act on these coherent sheets that are on A. So I want to ask that these are symmetric. And so I can, if I'm working over an algebraically closed field, I can always do this. And actually, in my construction, it's okay if. My construction, it's okay if I mean, since I'm working over cohomology and I'm a lot of eight tal cohomology, it's okay for me to, in my construction, actually to base change. So I just get to assume that I can do this. Okay, and then Ka of V is the fiber of Alb over this Albanese morphism. Of an anti-morphism over L, M. So that's these are the moduli spaces that I'm interested in today. And let's see a few examples. So there's a So there's kind of a kind of classic example that we call the generalized Kumar. And I'll go ahead and pick out the fourfold. So here, this would be K of one, zero minus three. And so the stable sheaves with this Muk I. Stable sheaves with this Muki vector. So they're going to look like ideal sheaves at length three points, possibly tensored with like a degree zero line ventil. And I can identify this with, let's see. Oh, so maybe I want to say the MA and then we'll talk about what the fiber is. So it looks like the product. So it looks like the product of Hil three cross A hat. And then when I go ahead and take the Albanesiomorphism, it'll be going to just A hat cross A because my neuron severity classes are going to be trivial here. And what's going on here is that the map to A hat simply acts. A hat simply acts like acts by projection. So there's an identity map on these two A duals. And then on the Hilbu part, what's happening is that we're taking the length three points and we're summing them in the group law of the abelian surface. And so to go ahead. And so to go ahead and take a fiber over this thing, I would here I would just pick like zero zero. And so what this is going to be is going to be like length three points that sum to zero. So that's what the generalized coomer looks like here. The generalized Hummer looks like here. So that's a pretty classic one. There's another one that I would like to look at because I think the geometry is pretty interesting. So let's take a look at if I fix them with pi vector. So I want the rate to be zero. So, I want the rate to be zero. I want my neuron severity class to be of a primitive line bundle that's got self-intersection six. So I can get this on like a like a 1,3 polarized abelian surface is exactly what's going to be going on. And S, I'm actually just allowing it to be anything. These things are going to be pretty closely related to one another. So, what points on this moduli space look like? Look like, well, rank one torsion free. So, usually line bundles. So, rank rank one torsion free sheaves on curves C so that The line bundle corresponding to the curve is that its neuron severine class is equal to is equal to you need to move the camera down to see what you're writing. So I'm stopping here. Can you see what I have so far? No. Oh, I mean, I went online. I can online, but I can with the camera, it's just a little bit hard to sort of reset it. So the last, can you hear me? I don't know if you can hear me. The last line that you just wrote is only half visible. Okay. So it's only the last line that's a problem, but you need to write to rewrite that above. Okay, yeah, let's just do that. Okay. Just do that. Okay. So there's a video box in that lower corner that's causing the problem. Oh, thank you. Because I was like, I can see it. Anyway, so I set this up quite carefully this morning. Anyway, thank you. So, and then I want to frame this is on curve C so that if I take the neuron to the very class of the associated line bundle, it's equal to. line bundle it's it's equal to how so there they're they look like um yeah most mostly they look like line bundles on these curves and then uh what i want to know what happens when i'm when i fix this point and i'm taking the fiber over it um so uh so taking the fiber over l well it just it amounts Well, it just amounts to fixing what, like what these, restricting what these kind of curves can be. So this is going to mean that the curves must be in the linear system defined by L. And really this fiber over L, I mean, if you like, it'll be If you like, it'll be the relative Picard of like the canonical over the linear system L. So like if you like relative Picard groups, that's what it is, or Picard schemes. And then this degree D is going to, you can compute, it's going to be S plus 3. It's going to be s plus 3. But then the question is: okay, what does fixing m do? So make some room for that. Right, so I'm doing like this part of the map. Maybe I'll kind of leave that. I really long to return to the days where I just have like six blackboards. Where I just have like six blackboards that I can slide up and down. So fixing M. So, well, if this degree D is equal to zero, so I need to sort of. To sort of, like, I can think of this really as just it contains like all the things in it are, and, and I possibly need to take, you know, the kind of correct compactifications, but all of these things are like everything in here is a member of, you know, maybe. Of maybe a closure of one of these things. So, in order to figure out what M is going to be like, I need to figure out what the maps, and I'll just kind of cheat and drop the compactification, but it's there if we need it. So there's some map basically to be to A dual in this case. And in this situation, what we In this situation, what we actually have is the map from the universal property of the Jacobian. So, yeah. So, anyway, I've got this like inclusion from C to A, and then I can match. A and then I can make the map from like the nano C to A dual correspondingly. And more generally, what's kind of happening is I need to, let's see. So if I'm given right, so one of these line bundles, it'll correspond to some like divisor. Of like divisor on T, then in general, what's going on is it'll go to like kind of M, but tensored with what the degree zero line bundle corresponding to, well, taking this divisor of This divisor of it's going to be points on C, and then including it into A and summing it. So when I write this sum, I mean in the group law of A. So you can kind of get this from using the short exact sequence that's got, you know, like that you get from a skyscraper sheath. So everything will kind of look like M. will kind of look like m you know tensored tensored with something like this and so to figure out what these fibers look like i need to i need to figure out what uh what the kernel um uh of these of these maps are and this is very much like an uh above jacobi map kind of a problem so there's uh so there's some really kind of uh kind of neat geometry going on in in figuring out what these fibers are uh and uh another And another thing that's good to mention here is that there's actually a Lagrangian vibration, which are popular on this hyperkaler. So this was also observed by Martin Gold Branson in his dissertation. In this dissertation. So, if I go ahead and take the map to P2, where this is the projectivization of the linear system here. And if I send a coherent sheaf to the curve, it's supported on. Let me say support. Say support. So, this being Lagrangian just means that this is going to be a surjection and then it's got connected fibers. And Gilbrenzen worked this out, but in this particular case, this has also been worked out, or the fact that these fibers are connected is also in work of Barack and Sinkeric Bow. Of Barack and Singer about these kinds of polarizations. Okay. So that's my kind of more evolved example of these things. And for me, there's a lot of geometry happening. You might have also noticed, so these constructions really are generalizations of Kumer K3 surface. Of Kumer K3 surfaces. So I guess I hopefully just erased the construction with Helm 3, but if I do that same construction with Helm2, then I get the Kumer K3. And it's kind of nice because, so usually, you know, I guess usually when I think of constructing a Kumer K3. Constructing a Kumar K3 of an abelian surface, right? You're taking a quotient by the minus one map, and then you have to blow up at the 16.2 at the 16.2 torsion points. But with the construction with the Hilb2, you don't have to do the blow up because there are already P1s at all the two torsion points because the Hilbert scheme is keeping track of the fact that there are kind of P1 ways for two points to collide because it's not tangent information that's keeping track of it. Tangent information that's keeping track of as well. Okay. So now we know what those things are. So let's go ahead and see a statement of a result. So first I'll say Tasset and Shinkle will talk about what they did. So what? So let's say. So let's say we've got X and it's complex. And for the moment, I'll just say that generalized. And four fold. And what they told me is that if, well, what they wrote in their paper is that if I take the middle singular collomology of one of these things, that's One of these things that it breaks up into a nice sum. And so part of it comes from just taking symmetric products of H2 of this thing. And I'm going to do something that changes this just very slightly. I want to take the intersection. To take the intersection with C2 prop. So this just shaves off one dimension thing on this thing. In general, there's no Hodge classes in this part. And then it breaks into a sum that's orthogonal with respect to the intersection pairing with some other piece. With some other piece that is 81-dimensional, and V is spanned by the fixed loci of symplectic involutions on X and And what they look like is, well, first pulling back by minus one is how they're going to act on sheaves. And then pulling back by a translation where X is a three torsion point in A. So this three is a little bit small. Is a little bit small. So these are the involutions on X, and then by deformation equivalence, this decomposition tells us about all fourfolds of Coomer type. So this decomposition is true for all hyperfillers of cooler type. Okay, and so obviously these fixed loci are going to have to be two-dimensional for this to make any sense. So the fixed loci The fixed flow sign, so as a sort of a by the way, are they are actually well, they're all kind of translations of one another. So you really only have to check what's going on where you take your x to be zero. So these are going to be, well, Kumar K3s, and specifically the, you know, You know, so I'm starting with some abelian surface, so they're going to be the Kumar K3 on A. And there's kind of a nice way of seeing this, right? So you're taking like triple, like triples here on your abelian surface that sump to zero and that are fixed under this action of minus one. And you can see that you're going to get a set that looks like kind of moving. Where, like, kind of most of the points in here are going to look something like, you know, one of your points equals zero, and then you've got like a minus a, and those are going to be the things that show up. And also, an interesting thing about these fixed loci is that there are, in addition to the Comer K3, there are 36 kind of sporadic points. They're not really doing anything in the collomology, but they're kind of geometrically interesting. Geometrically interesting. And 36 points. So this part was actually not shown by Hassett and Jinkle, but was shown by Kevin Terry in his dissertation. And what's kind of going on with these points. So one of them is like the vertex. If I take kind of everything in my Hilbert scheme that's supported over zero. That's supported over zero. And then the others are coming from all the ways you can take a triple of two torsion points. So you have to kind of dig into the structure of the abelian surfaces here. So there are like 35 triples of two torsion points that sum to zero, right? So I'm living in Bill 3. I'm living in build three and I want things that sum to zero and then two torque points are going to be are going to be fixed under this involution. So these kind of scattered points are hanging out in here. Okay. So Sarah and I were looking at this result and we got curious, okay, yeah, what happens if I change the field I'm working over? What is the Galois action? Working over what is the Galois action going to be like because using deformation equivalents is going to mess things up. So, in this case, when I'm just thinking about the generalized curve, then, well, this really tells me what the Galois action is going to look like if I'm working over some non-closed field. So, if I've got, like, really, it's just going to behave like. But really, it's just going to behave like this group, like the Galois action on this group of three torsion points. So that gives you kind of a nice description of what this action is going to be. So the sort of question, what happens over something that's, I don't know, not algebraically closed. And we want to, yeah, we want to know what the Galois action is going to be like. And a major sort of challenge here is that, so, well, Hassett and Schinkle showed a very nice result that these symplectic involutions also deform quite nicely in families. So we knew that the symplectic involutions on these other Comer portfoles. Comer fourfolds should be responsible for any kind of interesting behavior here. But we didn't know what they should look like. And in particular, if you just kind of try these, they're often not defined. So I've got like the dangerous bad road sign. So this involution is This involution is going to be, in general, not defined on these kinds of comers that we're interested in. So in particular, what happens is that they don't respect the, like, it's not going to respect to the fiber structure of the albanasiomorphism. of the of the albanasiomorphism so um when i i i take uh like when i when i act on um the structure sheath generalized commer case then this is this is going to to fix the the structure sheath but that's not going to be true for um uh for other choices so i i said that i can get away with say choosing uh choosing my l and m to be L and M to be symmetric. So this minus one is going to respect them. But in general, if I do something like, right, so I can kind of pull a pullback out of the determinant. So if I'm taking like the pullback of a line bundle here, that's just, it's not. It's not necessarily got, you know, sort of, it's not necessarily degree zero. It will look like L tensored with something of degree zero, but it's not necessarily going to be L. So we can't just get away with using these. So we had to go searching for symplectic involutions and Symplectic involutions. And these seem to be a pretty popular topic. And we looked in the literature to see if anybody had already found an explicit description for these, and we were not able to find them. So we found them. And I would say that, you know, we're at a direct conference, so we get to feel good about direct geometry here. I would say that really, like, just being familiar with the Rouki isomorphism, I think, is what really helped us come up with the idea. So we sort of thought about So we sort of thought we thought about, we tried to start thinking about other cases. And the first case we thought about, so if the generalized Kumar is like one, zero, minus three, then, well, if I take three, zero, minus one, these these aren't These aren't going to just be kind of related by the Fourier-Mackay transform, but I kind of like think of when I apply the Fourier-Mackay transform to the abelian surface, what it's going to do is, well, it'll take my neuron severity class to whatever neuron severity class on the other side has to be. It has to be. And then it switches the rank and the Euler characteristic. So what we decided to do was try stuff that, and so we were kind of like, okay, this like feels like the dual. It's like smells like the dual. And so what we did is take, try instead tensor. Try instead tensoring with three torsion blind bundles. So, you know, I could just kind of state this and like what the result is going to be really quickly, but it's like maybe fun to share the joy of discovery here for a moment. So this was kind of our idea was to try this in this other case, and indeed it works. And so what we did is we said, And so, what we did is we said, okay, that works in this case, like this works in this other case. And we said, okay, let's try to put them together and then see if we can show that there are always enough of them that are actually well defined. So, these things are symplectic, and we know that there should be 81 of them. And in fact, the total number of symplectic automorphisms. So, the total number of symplectic automorphisms here is going to be like 81 times 2, because I could always kind of leave off the minus 1. That's something that's just known. So, once we check that these are symplectic, we know we have every one. Okay. And so, what we did is we kind of tried that onset and it worked. And we had to. And it worked. And we had to kind of do a bunch of sort of computing with abelian surfaces. And it turns out that you can actually get at all the evolutions sort of putting together these two forms. So the result here is Is so for KAV and maybe I'm going to hedge slightly and just say, I mean, I expect this to also work in characteristic other than three, like this retortion makes the construction not work well, but I'm just going to say characteristic zero for the moment. There are exactly Are exactly 81 symplectic involutions. And I should say here I'm restricting to dimension four of the form. So what they're going to look like is pull back one minus one. minus one composed with translation and then tensoring sort of for x y in the three torsion of a crossed with the three torsion of a hat so it's kind of a kind of a funny thing here that um right so there there are like 81 times two possibilities here and uh and then when you go up through and And then, when you go through and do the computing, there are actually exactly 81 of them that are defined. And so this is actually, this extends to enfolds, actually. So I don't have a cohomology statement about them, but the methodology extends. And really what we did. Really, what we did to do this is we just said, okay, I want two equations. So I want that, like, if I've got any coherent sheaf here, I need the determinants of this to be right. To be right. So it's really just kind of the most straightforward thing we want to ask for. We just want to say that, okay, we have this compatibility. So, if we ask about these equations, there are going to be, you know, the exact kind of right number of them will work. And the three torsion on A and the three torsion on A hat. The three torsion on A hat sometimes kind of mix. So you can turn these. If I change over to additive notation, so it's a little bit less messy, then I can write this as an equation. I guess this is going to be the first one is going to be on A hat. So this is this Phi L is your standard. Phi L is sort of standard notation or the map that sends L to its trans its translation by X tensored with its with its inverse. So we end up with an equation on A hat and an equation on A And then we have to do some work to solve them so that I get a little bit of time to talk about the fixed loci. Maybe I'm not going to go into a huge amount of detail. I mean, the proof is not just kind of technical, but there's a lot of. Is just kind of technical, but there's a lemma due to Yoshioka that's very helpful here. So that tells me that the composition of these two maps, VL and Vm, amounts to multiplying by minus L squared over two, which which in this case so I guess in my in my the case of like my complicated example was going to be minus minus three so I had to I had to break things into cases and and tackle them and you know so for instance like Riemann Rock for obelian varieties Riemann Rock for a billion varieties tells me how big the kernels of these things should be, but I have to know something about what the kernels actually consist of because I'm only interested in three torsion points. So the part that's most kind of technically challenging there is to sort of make sure that all of your solutions to these equations all consist of three torsion points. And there is some work to that, and it's more involved. And it's more involved in these higher cases when the torsion that you're working with has composite order. That's technically more challenging. And so there are a number of kind of things that have to come into proving this, including like primitivity of the chi vector in our proof. So we get exactly these sort of 81. Of 81 things in this case, or it's like you know, and n to the fourth when we've got n children. And these form a subgroup. And indeed, we know what the Galois action is going to look like because it'll just look like the Galois action on this torsion here. And, you know, and there's maybe kind of a few questions that we might have as derived geometers about the behaviors of these solutions. Because, right, thinking about A cross A dual, it has that hunky A isomorphism smell to it, right? It's right. So we might want to know: okay, is this compatible with that isomorphism? Because there's exactly like 81 of them are getting picked every time. And, you know, depending on what the Mukai vector is, sometimes it kind of looks like Like choosing nine of them over here, and then for each of them, there are nine choices, or it might look like choosing all the points over here, and then for each point, there's like exactly one choice over here. So it looks different different ways for different chi vectors. So, right, the root k I. The Rouquier isomorphism tells me that if I have got a derived equivalence between two abelian surfaces, then I get an isomorphism between these two products. And this is actually compatible with these equations. So it's compatible. With this, so it commutes in the right way. So I think that's kind of cool. And another question that we might have about this result is, well, what can we say about derived equivalence of these hyper Of these hypercalers of comer type. So, for instance, there's a question of whether, say, the generalized Kumar on A is like, is it derived equivalent to the generalized Kumar on A? On a dual. And well, if they are, we expect from Orlov's conjecture on these things, like on derived equivalents giving isomorphic motives, like we expect the cohomologies to look the same. And what's kind of interesting. What's kind of interesting, so at least over C, we know that the collomology of these generalized coomers kind of looks like the collomology of A and symmetric products of it. And the same is going to be true of A dual and like the cohomology of A and the cohomology of A dual. There's a lot of stuff. Like, there's a lot of stuff that says we can compare them very nicely. But we know for this middle cohomology portion, then the action of the Galois group, right, it looks like something else. It looks like kind of specifically this three torsion. And so, certainly, when my abelian variety is, or when my abelian surface is principally polarized, these are going to be isomorphic. These are going to be isomorphic to one another. Or if I'm working over a finite field, I've got like Teeth's isogeny theorem, and these are going to be the same. But I would, so sort of some future work is we're finding an example of A where So, we're working to find an example where these three forging groups have a different Galois action. And we've got some strategies in mind. So that's kind of an interesting question that's arising out of this. I can see I'm running low on time, but the sort of last thing. The sort of last thing that I listed that I would talk about today was these fixed loci a little bit. And maybe I'll just say really quickly, so if you look at the fixed loci or fixed locus of, and we can just kind of look at, so this involution is always in there. Is always in there. If I look at it on my example here, I don't know if this would be native, then something kind of cute happens, right? So I mentioned that there's this Lagrangian vibration on these things. So maybe I'll just try it here where I'm taking. Where I'm taking, say, like these line bundles on curves in this linear system, they're going to be genus for curves, and I'm mapping the line bundles to the support. So there's this Lagrangian vibration I was mentioning earlier. So if I take the fixed locus by minus one, yeah. Well, it's going to. Well, it's going to, so you can use some work of Gold Branson actually to kind of use Hasse and Shinko's result and say, actually, here it is also going to look like a Kumar surface along with like 36 scattered points, but the geometry of how it's situated is very different. And when I go ahead and take this fixed focus, what I end up getting is an elliptic fibrillation. An elliptic vibration. So I get like also another Lagrangian. So I get like the Comer K3. And I get this nice elliptic vibration here. And then the geometry of how the 36 points are situated is very different than the other cases. Than the other case. And I actually had to get out, you know, like Hudson's book on, you know, like Coomer configurations from like 1912 or something to figure it all out. Like it turns into kind of an interesting classical geometry problem. Anyway, that's, I think, what I wanted to talk about for today. Thanks. Today, thanks for having me. Questions so you mentioned looking for the three torsion points of A and A hat where we had different Galois actions. But where would you look for such things? But where would you look for such things? Right. Yeah. So I guess I so they can't be elliptic curves because those are products of two elliptic curves. So our first guess is to look for something that's not principally polarized, that has a one, three. Polarized that has like a 1,3 polarization. So we'll kind of see. It's not known. That's something where it seems that there aren't any examples written up anywhere. So we're having a look. Okay. Other questions? If not, let's thank you for tuning in for excellent talk. Thank you, Prati, again, for an excellent talk. I think we're back in about a half an hour, a little under half an hour, for the next talk by Patrick McFadden.
