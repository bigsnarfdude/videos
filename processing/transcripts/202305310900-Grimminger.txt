So, um, this will be a colloquial style talk. I'll be very colloquial. Uh, also, I'm a physicist and I'm supposed to talk to a math crowd. So, I will try just to not use any physics words, whether that makes it math-y, I don't know. We'll see. Please feel free to comment or ask questions throughout the talk. Actually, that's highly encouraged. And also, there was, of course, some discussion already yesterday about Higgs branches, Coulomb branches, symplectic duality, 3D mirrorsymmetry. duality 3D mirrorsymmetry. That's roughly the these are roughly the things I'll talk about today. So my topic is singular hypercalar varieties and their smooth strata. So well Higgs bundles does not appear here but I hear that modulized baseline of Hicks bundles are hypercalar so there is some connection and maybe we can make this more clear. Maybe you can tell me what the connection is. So we'll look at two different kinds of hypercalar varieties. Of hyperkiller varieties, and whether they should be called hyperkiller varieties or a different name kind of depends on the style of mathematician you are, I guess. Sometimes they're called symplectic singularities or symplectic holomorphic varieties, and there are some small differences, but I won't insist on particularity. Okay, so we'll start with a basic ingredient, a quiver. Let's call it Q, and then we associate to it two different spaces. Two different spaces. One of them is the you could call it the Nakajima quiver variety. You could also call it a hypercaler quotient. And you could also call it a Higgs branch. And we'll denote this by an h of q. By an H of Q. Now, the second variety we'll look at is the Coulomb branch. And that's the only name I know for it. It was really an object in physics much before it was an object in math, but it does have a definition now that you can ask Steve about. Okay, and we'll denote this by C of Q. And when we construct these two spaces from the same When we construct these two spaces from the same quiver, then under mild assumptions, they will be dual in a certain sense. This duality is called symplectic duality. And one sign of symplectic duality is that the global symmetry of one space tells you about the deformations of the other space. So this is some. So, this is some generalities. We won't be talking about these global symmetries and deformations today, but that's a cornerstone of symbolic duality. Now, it's possible that if we have some quiver Q, so that the Higgs branch is some certain variety, the Coulomb branch is from certain other variety, there could be some other quiver, which we can call Q tilde. And this Q tilde can have a Coulomb branch. Which is the same as the Higgs branch of the first quarter. And if the Higgs branch of Q tilde is also the same as the Coulomb branch of Q, then we call these Q and Q tilde 3D mirror. Okay, so this is. Okay, so this is some words that we can talk about later. But actually, what I mainly focus on is one of these branches in particular and study its singularity structure. So the varieties we'll look at, it will very schematically look something like this, for example. So what I mean by this drawing is that we have some variety. Have some variety. This is supposed to be open, of course, or endless at least. And we could move around. And when we hit some singularity of some co-dimension, and on this singular stratum, we could move, and then we can hit a further singularity. And we can decompose these varieties into a disjoint union and of smooth. And of smooth spaces. And these smooth strata are called symplectic leaves. And there is a theorem by Kalerin that tells us that for such a variety, this is always possible. And when our singular space is a moduli space of some A moduli space of some physical theory of some kind of field theory, for example, a gauge theory, then moving from one of these strata to the next could be called the Higgs mechanism. This is for the physicists. Okay, are there any questions so far? Okay, that's good. Then let me. So, when I say quiver, we should make a little bit more precise what I mean by that. So, probably for most of you, a quiver looks something like this. We have dots and arrows. And when I mean quiver today, when I say quiver today, I mean a tripled version of this. So, what you do when you triple a quiver is that for every node, you introduce an arrow to itself. Then for every arrow, you also introduce the reverse arrow. And let's give it a name. Let's call this one A. Let's call the nodes one and two. Then we would have our arrow A. Then we would have our arrow A. We also have A tilde, which is just the backwards arrow. And then we could call this phi one and phi two. And the result of this tripling is not just a quiver, but actually a quiver with superpotential. Which I'll call W. And this is a potential is constructed with all of the closed loops you can make of three R. Of three arrows involving one of these phi's. And so here we would have a tilde phi one A plus A phi two A tilde. This would be the superpotential. So this we can obtain straightforwardly from this. Okay, now another component, and in principle, maybe I should put a trace here to make this a function. To make this a function. Now, we can also add another part in the quiver, framing. This will be represented in a box. I can add an arrow like this. And now the frame node will not get an adjoint when we do the tripling. And it also does not contribute to the supotential. And in physics terms, the difference between a regular node and a The difference between a regular node and a framed node is the difference between symmetry that is gauged, whether global, gauge, or flavor. Okay. Oh, yes, of course. Let's call this B. We would have B phi one B tilde. All right. Okay. And of course, this is quite a messy notation. This is quite a messy notation, so instead, we're gonna use this notation. But since the direction of the error doesn't matter, really, what we'll write is just this. And for us, it'll always be important to put dimension vectors for the nodes. So we'll always put numbers. And now this is not a labeling, but we'll always put some numbers like n1, n2, n3, and we refer to these as ranks. Okay. Okay. Now, um, yes? Do you have the possibility of a background multiple for the experiment? No. It's not relevant for what I want to discuss. So also my talk will not, I will not try to be super precise about absolutely everything because if we want to be too general, then we will get nowhere. So this is going to be rough. And any particularities, I'm super happy to discuss later. I'm super happy to discuss later, and like I'm happy to show you how to compute stuff, but I don't think that it'll help us now. Okay, good. But let's actually compute something. So the simplest thing, the most straightforward thing to associate to this quiver is the part I just wiped, this Higgs branch or quiver writing. So let's take the very simplest example. So let's take the very simplest example. We're going to take a quiver which consists of one gauge node, one flavor node, one round and one square node, and the ranks are one and n. And now I can draw this in our tripled way. So we have phi A and A tilde. And now the super potential looks like this. And as I mentioned, this magnitude variety, we can construct this as a hypercalor quotient. And for a hypercalor quotient, we need a moment map. So here I'll work in a Over, I will work with complex equivalences. So we have a hypercalor quotient h n mod u1. The u1 comes from the fact that this is your rank one node. And there is a complex moment map, which is a derivative of the super potential by this self-arrow that we added in the tripling. So dw by d phi. So dw by d phi, and this is equal to A A tilde. So just to clarify what A and L tilde are, A is a map, a linear map from C to C to the N. So this is a one by n matrix, and A tilde is an N by one matrix. And phi is a one by one matrix. And A and A tilde, they transform under this U1. I could put a U here to clarification. So A will have a A weight plus one, and a tilde we have a weight minus one, and that is e one transformation. So, when we do the Habital equation, we want to take invariance. So, an invariant combination would be A tilde A, and it's called as M and this A tilde A is now an N by N matrix. Okay, so M is N by N. Okay, so m is n by n and it's of rank one by construction. What should I say? Order of composition. I think maybe the question is just how I put the almost here. So maybe you could explain that the linear half didn't go the other way. Then go the other way. Usually, you say keeping tailor for the layers on there. Okay, yeah, yeah, but it's conventional. I mean, it's not so here. It's the n by n matrix. It's supposed to be the n by n matrix that I can make of a one by n and n by one matrix. Yeah, maybe for math people. Yeah. If you switch them around, it's here. I see, I see, I see. Okay. I did them all backwards. Okay, okay. Very good, very good. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Very good, okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, let's just do this then. Okay, are people happy with what I wrote down? Like otherwise, so we have a one-by-n by one matrix, we make them an n-by-n matrix of rank one, at most one. Okay, good, good, good. So, this here is rank one. And now, the rank of this is smaller than equal to one. And now, to write the well, the final result of this hypercale quotient, let's be. This will now be our m, which is m by m. And now we'll have some conditions which come from the complex moment maps. So the first condition we can get is if we take the trace of m, this is equal to the trace of a a tilde, which is equal, well, it's a a tilde, which is the trace of a tilde a. And this is supposed to be zero if we set the f. Supposed to be zero if we set the f term equal to zero or the convex moment map equal to zero, and then the next condition will be m squared. This will involve a tilde a tilde a. Again, here we can see our moment map F, and this will be zero. So now the conditions we get are that we have a traceless matrix. So the entries are all in C. With a traceless matrix, it squares to zero, and the rank of the matrix is small or equal to one. Now, of course, Now, of course, complex matrix, which is traceless, that's an element of SLN. And actually, this is the closure of the minimal Milkton orbit of SL and C. And we will denote this with a little a n minus one. Okay, any questions? Okay, any questions? Good. If not, then let's look at the singular structure of this space. So we could draw this Higgs branch very schematically as a cone, like this. And at the tip of the cone, this is where the rank of M is zero. And everywhere else is where the rank of m is equal to one. And the point where the rank of m drops to zero, this is the singularity of this singular variety. So now we can write this as the, well, everything but the point, but the origin, sorry, union with the origin. And these are our two symplectic leaves. And if we take the everything but the origin and we take a closure. And we take a closure of this inside the full space, what we get is our original space back. So taking the closure includes the origin. So there is a partial order now. This is a general statement. When we have these singular spaces and there's a stratification, for any stratum, I could take the closure and I can ask which leaves are included in the closure. This gives me a partial order. The closure. This gives me a partial order. Of inclusion of closures and a partial order can be depicted in a Hase diagram. And so here I will write the Hase diagram with. With two dots, and one dot being above the other means that this leaf, the closure of this leaf, will contain this leaf. So let's draw them like this. And yeah, this will be my Hazard diagram. So I would say that we should just go to the next more interesting example to see how these Hazard diagrams really work. So I just want to put the name, these we call symplectic leaves. These we call symplectic leaves. Maybe I said it before, but just to make sure. Okay. Now, the next more interesting example would be if replaces U1 with a UK. Now, everything works just the same. The only difference is that here we'll have a rank k. And I will require that n is bigger or equal to 2k. Okay. Okay. And also, here we will have the condition K. And of course, now this is no longer true. This is now the closure of the orbit two to the k one to the n minus two k orbit in SLN. Bit in SLN. C. And here we have again an associated Hasse diagram, which I think is quite straightforward to see how it works. The leaves will be just given by the ranks. So at the bottom, there will be the origin or the rank zero, and then the leaf which will contain the origin, but nothing else, if we take the closure. Else, if we take the closure, will be the rank one, and then we go up up here, we have rank K. Okay, so this is an example of a Haze diagram. Now, there is an additional bit of information that I want to add to this Haze diagram to describe the geometry better, and this will be strancer slices. And for this, I want to go To go to the example of k equals to 2. So for k equals to 2, very schematically, this looks exactly like what I drew in the beginning. Our variety. So we will have here the rank 2. Here we'll have the rank 1. And at the origin, there's rank 0. And now I could ask a question if I'm somewhere on this rank one leaf. So let me maybe give them names. Let's call this one L2, let's call this one L1, and this one L0. So if I'm somewhere on L1, then I could ask the question: if I fix those directions, what are the transverse directions inside the rest of the variety? This goes under the name of transverse slice. Of transverse slice. So I can fix a point here and then ask for the transverse directions, and this I will call t1 because it's a transverse slice to L1. Now you could ask the question of whether it matters which point on L1 I take, and actually it does not. This is something that mathematicians have shown. So now I could ask the question. So, okay, just say. To any LI, we have a transfer slice EI. And then I'll also define a transfer slice if L well let's see for any I which is not the same. I, which is not the same as J and L J closure contains L I, we can define a transfer slice from L I to L J. Can you still read here? Okay, okay. Okay, okay, good. And I'll call this, I'll write it up here so you can all read. So this will be Tij, and this will be Ti intersecting Lj closure. Okay, so if we take, sorry, this is really loud. I apologize. We'll try to move less. If we go, for example, to the rank is three case, to the case three case, then our hazard diagram will look like this. Here we have L3, so this is now matrices of point three, then L2, L1. L2, L1, and L0. And now a transverse slice I will denote with a bracket. So, for example, the transfer slice which goes all the way from the bottom to the top, that is just our whole variety. The transfer is basically the origin. And so this is the Higgs bunch of, well, yeah, the Higgs bunch of U3 with N flavors for this quiver. Now, for example, the transfer slice from L0 to L1, this is now. To L1, this is now something that we will have to compute. And there are methods to compute this, but I won't show them now. I will show you some different methods when we talk about the Coulomb branch. So, here this slice will be the Higgs branch of U1 with N flavors. Now, this slice here will be the Higgs branch of U2 with N flavors. The full space is U3 with N flavors. Now, this space here, for example, this transfer slice. This space here, for example, this transfer slice from L1 to L2 is the Higgs branch of U1, but now with N minus two flavors. And this here is the Higgs branch of U1 with N minus four flavors. And there's one last bracket. I'll just put it for completion, for completeness. This would be U2 with N minus two flavors. Yes. Can you say again what you mean by transverse slide? By transverse slice? So, um, the transverse slice is I have my variety which has various strata, and now if I study the origin, I move on this stratum of some co-dimension, and I have some moduli that I can prescribe. And now I will fix those moduli, and I ask inside the bigger space what are the remaining moduli that I can tune. But is it so for example in your picture? is it so for example in your in your picture there yeah you put that point on your stratum uh on your stratum one yeah and then you you drew kind of an arc passing through it yeah there's tons of other arcs that you could have also drawn right yes yes so the the the notion is really transverse so we could put a little little angle here if you want killer metric and you look at the orthogonal well so i don't i don't have a precise answer to your question there is a precise answer to your question There is a precise answer to your question, but I cannot reproduce it. But we can look at it later. Maybe you have a better answer. But it's not something infinitesimal. It's actually a complete thing. No, no, it's really a complete thing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's really, it's really this picture. Like we move transfers, and we don't go on some slope because this would basically be tuning this moduli while also tuning this moduli, and we don't want to do that. And there's a way to make this precise. Yeah. And so I will just say. And so, I will just say a few physics words here to maybe clarify more what's going on here. Is if I'm at the origin, then I would not have given a VEF to any scalars. So I don't have any massive particles, and the gauge group is unbroken. Now, if I move on this L1, for example, I would give VEFs to some scalars, and actually the gauge group would break from U2 to U1. And now what remains is U1 with some amount of flavors. One with some amount of flavors, and this transfer slice will be the Higgs branch of this part. So that's the logic. Okay, good. Now, from now on, I will not put all of the transfer slices to such a Hasse diagram. It's just too much and inconvenient to compute as well. What's really important to get this structure of these symplectic leaves in a partial order, what's enough for this is actually if we compute what I will call elementary slices. What I will call elementary slices, which is a slice between two neighboring leaves. And I will use the shorthand that we introduced before. So the Higgs bunch of U1 with n flavors, which is the closure of the minimal nilput and orbit of SLN, we call small a n minus 1. And then this is small a n minus 3 and small a n minus 5. And this will be the way that I will draw HACE diagrams from now on. Okay, more questions? Yeah, so the structure. Yeah, so the structure here doesn't depend on n requirements, n is bigger than four. N should be bigger than six. It's not u three. Yes, but I want to have something with a Higgs mantra that is singular. And so only you one with two flavors or more will be singular. The structure is the same, but it would be elementary leaves. Elementary leaves will depend on that. So exactly, yeah. So the partial order is the same. But now what these leaves are, what dimension they are, for example, will be different. So I could put the dimensions. So the dimension here will be zero. The dimension of this will be n minus one. And then this will be two n minus four, and so on. And so this, of course, depends on n. Okay. More questions? More questions? Ah, yes. I'll do an example for you in a bit. They are very simple examples. I'll just wait a little bit when we get to the computational part. Okay. So I want to show one more example because it will be another. So we see here the basic building blocks of this variety consists only of these small A transitions. Now, you could, of course, ask, is this all? Now, you could, of course, ask, is this always the case? That's not always the case. So, let's show one more of these basic building blocks. So, let's take another example. Let's take this quiver here, which has n minus one u1 nodes and these two flavor nodes. Now, the Higgs branch of this, I think it's okay if we skip how to compute this, it's not very hard. This is C2 mod Zn, where the Zn acts opposite on the two C factors. Opposite on the two C factors. Now, this I will call A n minus one. It's a Klein singularity. And yeah, the Higgs bunch here, the Hasse diagram of this space now would just look like this. And we could do now the generalization of this example here. The disk quiver and the Higgs quantum disk quiver. Now, I don't have a very nice description for you, there is no nice name that I'm aware of, and I don't have a nice algebraic description for you. So, instead, I'll only give you the Hasse diagram and it will look like a like a n minus one. Wait, I'm making a mistake. Yeah, a minus one, a, n minus three, and at the bottom there will be a, n minus the two k. Okay, so here this looks very similar to the sky over here, just that we have instead transitions which are Are very good. Transitions which are big A, not small A. And also the labels are actually in a different order, like the ranks go up instead of down. Okay, good. So I think I showed you some examples. So far, we've only seen linear HACE diagrams. We'll get to some non-linear ones in a bit. But now I want to switch gears for a moment and I want to talk about the Coulomb branch. To talk about the Coulomb branch. Now, as I said already before, the Coulomb branch is rather a complicated construction, and I cannot present to you the mathematical construction. I don't understand it. I hear that Steve does, so he should really talk. Okay, na-na. But there is a physical way of thinking about the Coulomb branch, which actually was there before it was defined mathematically. So write some things on the board. So that's the 3D counter. There is a construction by Prabhaman Finkelberg in Nakajima and this. And this was influenced by the physics, which describes the Poulom branch not as a variety, but rather what these physicists, Helani, Kimonesi, and Zafaroni, what they did was to write down the Hilbert series of the Coulomb branch. And this is what influenced this mathematical construction. Now, I don't want to start explaining how to compute this Hilbert series and the underlying formula, the monopole formula. Because it will take too much time and it just serves a talk in its own right. It just serves a talk in its own right, but I'm very happy to show it to anyone who's interested later. And it's not hard to use. As long as the ranks of the quiver are low, it's fairly straightforward. You can do the Hilbert series of the quiver. But instead, what I want to show you is how we will compute the Hasse diagram of a Coulomb branch, because there's a very neat graphical algorithm. So let me first state some facts. So the Coulomb branch of this guy here that we saw in the very beginning is actually equal to a n minus one, which is symplectic dual to the small a n minus one, which is the Higgs branch. Which is the Higgs branch of the same guy. And the Coulomb branch of this quiver is equal to the small a n minus one, which is symplectic dual to the big a n minus one. I'm just writing the same thing as above, which is the Higgs branch of the same guy. Guy. And now these two quivers here are what is called 3D mirror. And this is the simplest example that we have of 3D mirror symmetry example that I know. Now, a more advanced example. We mess with this rank here. This guy, and or for example, if we look at this guy. Okay, and what we can do now is compute this in a graphical algorithm. So, let's say how to get the Hazard diagram. We will use quiver subtraction. Okay, and before we can start this quiz subtraction algorithm, we need to say a few more things about quivers. So, first of all, it will First of all, it will be convenient to work with the unframed version of Quibbers. So, if I take some random quiver Let's say this guy here, which has some framing. What I will do is I will take all of the framing and collect it into a single U1 node that I will introduce. And now I will put enough links so that there are still the same amount of edges that go into our nodes. So here there would be two, and here there would be one. And this is also called a Crawley-Bowie trick. Okay, and we can move back and forth between these two because I can just, whenever there is a U1, I can just make it into a flavor box. And all of the things that we can compute will be invariant under choosing one of the U1s. It's kind of like picking a basis. Go on. I was going to ask the question: I think you could ask why is that invariant under choosing which one you pick as specific one? Yes. Well, if you do yesterday, this is the optimal effect. Yeah, so let's say, for example, we frame again. We unframe, and then we can frame. We could, for example, pick this guy here. Okay, and I invite you to compute whatever you can about these two quivers. All of the answers will be the same. And I can give one reason, for example, for the Coulomb branch. Give one reason, for example, for the Coulomb branch that we haven't introduced, but what's important is to look at the for both the Coulomb branch and the Higgs branch, if we think of this as gauge theories, what we have is a gauge group G, and then we have some representation, R. And the gauge group G here in this case would be equal to U1 times U1 times U2 times U2. But really, there is a U1 factor which acts trivially on the A u1 factor which acts trivially on the representation. So there's a u1 center. And this thing will not contribute to any of the computations. So this is just decoupled. So what we could do is just write this. And then there is a u1 which is kind of there. So we can ignore it. That's the logic. So this is the group. And now when we really the true group, and we see that it fits for both this and this, right? This is the answer. It's just a question of which one we chose to modify. Which year one we chose to modify, and um, when yeah, when we do the computation, it's really kind of a basis choice. Is the claim that the computers on the left-hand side are the old cover gauge series? So if you compute anything to do with the moduli space, they're indistinguishable. It's the same. I guess from the mathematics point of view, as you say. Mathematics point of view, as you say, it's the same group that's generated by the two pictures on the left, and also the same representation, yeah, coming from the circle nodes. Yeah, and so then if you put that into the PFN construction, it'll be exactly the same. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. It's just a matter of, so if we if we compute this curve subtraction, we'd like to work with this unframed quiver. If you, for example, compute the Hilbert series, you need to frame the quiver. And when you do this framing, this is a well. Well, I don't want to get into details why we need to frame, but basically, how you do the framing is really just again, it's the same thing as before, but it's just a basis. It's not a big deal. So, these are really the same thing. You could just always think of this guy, and then when you do computation, you pick a frame. No, it's the same. It's the same. Okay, well yeah. Let's do this later. Let's compute a Haze diagram. That's more relevant now. Okay, so we want to work with this unframed quiver. And we're going to accept for now that this is something we can just do. Is something we can just do, and also another thing: a very important, a very deep quantity of a for or not sure what the right word is, it's really useful to look at the balance of a node. So let's call the notes I. So let's call the nodes i and they have ranks ni, then the buttons, and I want to have the number of edges between i and j. I will call this eij. So if, for example, these notes are called 1, 2, 3, and 4, then E24 will be 1 and E34 will be 2. And E34 will be two because this is symmetric. And now the balance E I will be equal to the sum over all J, which is not I E J I N J minus 2 N I. Okay, this balance tells us a lot about the Coulomb branch, actually, the generators of the Coulomb branch and the global symmetry of the Coulomb branch. Of the Coulomb branch. So, for example, here, well, let's go to this example. Let's compute some balances. Here, there is the only edge that we see comes from this node, and it has rank two. So it will be two minus. And this will have rank one, twice its own rank. So it's minus two. This is zero. Now, this node here will have. Here will have a balance which is one plus one plus two minus four, it's also zero. Also, this node here has a balance which is two plus two minus four, which is zero. So all of these gauge nodes have a balance zero. So if we connect all of the gauge nodes, the circle nodes, which have balance zero, then we will always get a dinking diagram. In this case, it's of shape, of A type, A shape. Of A type, yeah, A shape. And what this tells us is that the Coulomb branch of this will have an SL4 global symmetry. And actually, it also tells us what the generators of the Coulomb branch. Here we can see immediately that they must all be in the adjoint and they will be of greed two under the symmetry, the S2 symmetry, which rotates diabetic structures. If we pick U1 inside. So this balance is really extremely nice in analyzing Coulomb branches. But for now, But for now, well, I don't want to get into the business of computing code browsers. I just want to stress that this balance is something super neat to look at, and we will need it for a query subtraction algorithm. So, yep. No, you can have self-arrows. But then there will be so the thing I said about the generators, this will still be true, and the global symmetry will also be true. But actually, there could be an even bigger global symmetry and there could be more. Even bigger global symmetry, and they could be more generous when you have these self-arrows. And in general, when you have loops in your quiver, then you can run into some problems. But yeah, it's also changed, right? Sorry? Ah, okay, of course. You want to modify this? Yeah, this has to be modified. This is a very good point. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Okay, this is an excellent point. Excellent part, so yeah, no self-loops, okay. Yeah, excellent, okay. We can, but we can modify the balance formula, like that's all possible. Okay, good. Now, let's let's say what query subduction is. Okay, so it's going to be a three-step process. It's going to be a three-step process. It's going to involve a quiver Q, and we're going to subtract another quiver D. Okay, the first step will be to identify a subquiver P of Q. So, what I mean here is a quiver which has mean here is a quiver which has exactly the same nodes and edges, but all of the ranks are strictly lower. And so I identify a subquiver D of Q such that the Coulomb branch of D is an isolated singularity. So two examples that we just saw would be this quiver here. Be this quiver here, which in its unframed version looks like this with n edges, or this quiver here. I give straight away the unframed version. These are two examples of such a D that we have to look out for. Any affine dinking diagram, for example, would work here with correctly chosen ranks. Okay, now step number two would be to subject. Step number two would be to subtract the ranks of D from the ranks of Q. And then the third step is to add an extra one and edges. To rebalance the other notes, the remaining notes, let's say. Okay, so let's just do an example. If we take For example, this quiver here is an example of the quivers we already looked at. And we'll go to the unframed version of this. So I connect these two to a U1. And now I see here there's a sub-quiver consisting of these three nodes, which is one of the allowed quivers to subtract that I gave you. Now, if we subtract these. Now, if we subtract these ranks here, we get this. And now let's have a look at the balance. Up here, this node is balanced, this node is balanced, this node is balanced, this node is balanced, this node is balanced, and this note is balanced. By balanced, I mean that the balance is zero. Now, if I look down here, these guys, so this guy will be balanced, these two are balanced, and this guy is balanced, but these two. This guy is balanced, but these two now have a balance of minus one. Now I can cure this if I add this extra u1, as I said, and I put an edge here and an edge here. Okay. Now, yeah. You say you take a software instead of strictly more ranks. Ah, if it has all the ranks the same, this would be the five, this would be the step that terminates query subtraction. So fair enough. Subtraction. So fair enough. But here you already know the Hasse diagram because then it's isolated. Yeah. And yeah. Okay. So in principle, actually, if I want to read the subcur with all the same edges and all the same notes, what I should have drawn would be this here with zero ranks here. If you wanted to be really precise in that. Oh, wait, I'm sorry. The ranks should be lower or ah, yeah, yeah, sorry, that was that was prime. No, no, it should be lower or equal. Exactly. That's the that's that's the thing on it. I wanted to say this, and it was the wrong sentence. Okay, let's continue. So now I see, let me remove this because it just glutters the whole thing. Here we saw this fine A2 diagram. Now, here we see that we can Diagram. Now, here we see that we can have an affine A4 diagram. So if we subtract this, then what we'll end up with is this here. I'll already do the rebalancing. And now we find a quiver, which is already isolated. And so now we can just subtract itself. So I'm not going to draw it, but we'll end up with just the rebalancing node, which is just the one. Balancing node, which is just the one. And now this tells us what the Hasse diagram is. So the Coulomb of this guy here is A2, the Coulomb of this is A4, and here it's A5. So the Hasse diagram of the Hasse diagram of this quiver here will look like this. And I made a mistake. A mistake? No, it's good. Okay, so this will be the final answer. So, this is a very straightforward algorithm which is kind of based on thinking diagrams and the slight generalizations of them. And so it's most of all a very simple algorithm to compute something, which, if you want to do this with the tools of standard algebraic geometry, would be an absolute nightmare. So, this is the upshot of this curl subtraction algorithm. Now, let's Algorithm. Now, let's, since we're nearly out of time, well, first of all, are there questions about this? Yeah. Can I ask a great since could you imagine taking the other, the other one, like one, then put it in capital N one and subtracting that from the edge of the quiver direct, i.e. take one one in this quiver here. It's not a. I'm I don't think he wants to take any sense in. Oh, always. Sense. Oh, oh, it's not isolated to anything. Ah, this is what you mean. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, I see. You want us to subtract this thing here? Yeah. Okay, but the Coulomb branch of this is just C2. So it's not a singularity here. Okay, good. So since we're running out of time, let's do something where we actually see some bifurcations. And let me pick totally at random. Totally at random, some star-shaped quiver that some of you may know. And let's compute the Hazard eigenvalue of this. So now, of course, I didn't give you the full list of all of these Ds. And in fact, this list is not known, but we have a working list. And it would be nice to classify all possible Ds, but it's questionable that we will reach this goal. But one of them. But one of them is the fine-tinking diagram of d4. The Coulomb branch of this is the minimal nilput and orbit of d4, which will I will denote, which I will denote like this. Now, I can subtract this inside this quiver in five different ways, right? So I have to pick the u2 here, but I can pick any four of these five u1. So there will be five subtractions, which here will all be the same. They will all They will all be of this type here. And when I do the subtraction, I will be left with this last U1 node. In order to rebalance it, I have to put two edges. And so here this will all be the same. And now I can just subtract itself. And then I will reach the end of pure subtraction. So the Kudenbranch-Hasse diagram of this guy. Of this guy looks like this. All of these are D4s and all of these are A1s. And the fact that here at the bottom, we have these five slices, which are all C2 mod Z2, which has an SU2 global symmetry, which commutes with a hypercalor SU2, tells us that the coupon mod of this quiver has an SU2 to the power of five global symmetry, which is something we could also see from the balance that I mentioned. We could also see from the balance that I mentioned before. All these five u1s here have a balance of zero, but this u2 has a balance of one, and then it doesn't contribute to the global symmetry. And yeah, so here, of course, I showed an example where these five subtractions were all the same. There are also examples where they're different. We're running out of time. So I want to finish with one last comment. What is the Higgs branch-Hazard diagram of this? Well, in this case, there is a very neat In this case, there is a very neat relationship between the Hazard diagrams of Higgs and Kulom branches under certain conditions that are not completely understood. But in this case, I can take this Hasse diagram here and I can invert it. So, of course, here it's a little bit. So, of course, here it's a little bit hard to see, but what I'm going to do is turn it around like this. And now we will have a D4 here and an A1 here. And then what I'll do is I will exchange capital and small letters. So this A1 becomes a small A1 and this small D4 becomes a big D4, which is the Kleining singularity associated to D4. The Klein singularity associated to D4. And so this process gives me now also the Hazer diagram of the Higgs punch of this quiver. When this kind of inversion for the Hasse diagram works for a Coulomb and Higgs pair, as I said, it's not entirely clear, but it works in certain conditions. And this is an avatar of symplectic duality: that there is an order-reversing map between the symplectic leaves and their inclusions. Okay. Okay, and well, it's 10, so I think I should just stop here and ask for questions. Thank you. Thank you for this beautiful talk. And is there any question in the audience? So I have a question. So, I have a question. There are many different ways to produce HACI diagrams. What are the precise assumptions you're making? Why do you assume the theories you get are physically, actually accurate physical theories and healthy? And what are the balancings and all these procedures you make physically corresponds to? I don't quite understand the question about the physicality. Not all covers are physical. Why not? This is a quantum field theory. Why not? This is a quantum filter. Treating is for quantum filter. I can write a HACT diagram, and some of the HACT diagram will actually not correspond to those what you get as a quiver, because there are many other ways to produce the explicit HACC diagram flows. So I think I don't understand the question, but let me answer the question I think I heard. So I don't take a HACC diagram and produce something from it. What I did was I started with a quiver, and then now I showed you how to compute. And then now I showed you how to compute the Coulomb branch-Hasidim of the quiver. Now, this quiver here is a physical theory. It has a modular space, but most of all, it's a quantum field theory in 3D equals to 4. And now we can ask, what is the stratification of the Coulomb bunch? And that's the answer I give you. And there is, if we have underclass question, when you're doing the HACI diagram, you're giving a web to a field or in a potential orbit. What is that corresponding to by doing this balancing the Corresponds to by doing this balancing the quiver. It's not the balancing of the quiver. You just flew from the top to bottom. Yes, it's an that you're giving. It's not giving a bev. This is not giving a bev. The Hasi diagram. Giving a BEF? Hasy diagram is by definition a renormalization group flow, and you have to give a BEF to something. What is that? It's not a normalization group flow, it's a Higgs mechanism. And also, if you no, that is not correct either. I mean, you're talking about the Either. I mean, you're talking about the symplectic duality and the 3D duality. Any flow has to be an RG flow. I mean, that is bite. What flows are we did? I just showed you something in geometry. First of all, it is a Higgs branch RG flow. Okay, but where is that in geometry? I'm just talking about geometry at the moment. If you want to have a physics discussion, we should have it somewhere else because this is a shared math physics audience. But let me address your point. If you do a Hicksing, this is our origin. And if you turn on a VEF, which is non-serial, Turn on a V, which is non-zero, this means that you move from here upwards, which has nothing to do with doing the subtraction here. First of all, the first subtraction here has nothing to do with the first fixing here. It's an opposite, an opposite thing. Here, what we do is we compute this certification by taking a layer and removing the layer. Okay, and then I move to another layer and then I remove it. Why is it physically starting the origin and you move to a less singular, to a less singular partner modulus space? A less singular partner modular space. Why is that physically okay? What? What is that assumption? What is a precise assumption? You have to be more precise in your question. It doesn't make sense to me. I had a very simple question, maybe. In this inversion that you showed at the end, if you Showed at the end. If you take the example, I mean, you know this example, so I'll just say where you replace the D4 by a B3. Yeah. So what happens on the other side? So there we can. Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, this will inversion will not work here. Yeah. So this is why I said that there are certain conditions and it's in general. It's a tricky thing. So this is an example where this works. And to specify when precisely this works is, for example, that the Hase diagram cannot contain a slice which is not ADE. Okay. Okay. Good. Thank you. Okay, okay, good. Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Julius, for the reading I talk. I found this all very fascinating. Actually, I'm trying to sort of pair it up with my understanding of things. And so, yeah, at the risk of introducing a non-physical quiver, you know that I'm very interested in the star case, and so are others like Laura. If one, without, again, without thinking. If one, without again, without thinking at all about any physicality here, if I add loops to the quiver, in particular, this trick of adding loops to the central node to geometrically increase a genus that's occurring off the side in the background. Can you compute a HASA diagram in that case in any reasonable way? Do you mean when we went from this to this thing here? Well, actually, just more directly. Well, actually, just more directly, exactly. Okay, so then so this is um quite tricky to compute Hazard diagrams because now the standard curves of fraction doesn't work. So I wasn't precise with when this exactly works because of a colloquial nature, but this is very random question. And I'm highly interested in exactly those kind of cases. So let me give it a try. So are we. Because so are we. This is good. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. So let me give the simplest case with an Advanced. Case with an add-on. So I'll remove this guy. So if we take, for example, this here, this quiver, now the Coulomb branch of this is equal to, there is a free part, and then time C2 mod Z2. So how do I see the Hausen diagram of this part? Well, the way that we do this is we think of it in a brain system, and then we can do a certain And then we can do certain operations. So, what I will write this as is I will write a quiver like this and say that these two nodes should actually be packed together into a U2. This I denote by a green arrow, a green circle. And now I say that because this is a node which has an adjoint, this means even the node itself already is single. means even the node itself already is singular. So if I have a if I have a node n like this, the Coulomb branch of this is smooth. But if I have an an n with an adjoint, then this is singular. So here there is a notion of if I have two brains which make this U2, there's a notion of putting them together and keeping them fixed together. And this is going down on the Hasse diagram. And so now I can do a minus A1, but it's not really a small. This A1, but it's not really a subtraction. And I put them together. So now they're a single guy. But now I want to keep the balance of this the same. And also I want to keep the balance of this the same. And the only way to do this is to involve an edge, which is not a regular edge, but a non-simply laced edge. So I have to put this. And this would be the process. Now, if I have three guys, this will be the third symmetric product of C2. Symmetric product of C2 and we put it here. So now here we would start with three things and now we could take two of them, put them together, and I would still have the And I would still have these loops around. This would be an A1 transition. And now I can make another transition where I put them all together. And this would be actually now a non-normal transition. This would be M. And so in this way, we can still doing this kind of putting stuff which should be identified together. We can compute a Hazard diagram. But now actually, this circle here, this is the one, this circle here between these two things, which Here between these two things which have a different link connected to them, we don't know how to compute the Coulomb of this. So we gave this a name. So Antoine and I have thought long and hard about this problem for maybe two years now. So we call this a decorated swiver. And how to precisely define what we even mean by decoration is unclear to us, and we are really quite a bit away from computing the Coulomb branch. Quite a bit away from computing the crude branch. So, if you have ideas, that would be highly appreciated. But the basic idea is that here we would have some S3, and now we kind of mod out an S2, but there is some remaining, it's not really a symmetry, but there is something which acts. And how to make this precise? This is really, this would be something that would be nice to know. I don't have an answer. No, that's great. That's amazing. Thanks. I'll hand this back to Marie. Hand this back to Elmarina. Thank you. Is there any other question? No? Last one. So you need the theories. You need the theories to be good in the technical sense of the word. Yeah, yeah. So I didn't mention this. Well, in principle, I don't. If you want to compute the Coulomb branch with the monopole formula, the quiver should be good. And this roughly translates to all of the balances are positive, or they're bigger than the minus one. Minus one, and um there are some well with a grain of salt. If you have loops, it can be more problematic. But if you have a bad quiver, so some of the balances are lower, it doesn't really make a difference for this algorithm. You can just run it, and at the end, you will not get a single U1, but you will get something which is smooth, and that's also fine. So you can still compute the Hase diagram also if the quiver is bad. And for example, for a linear quiver like this, the Nakajima. Equipped like this. The Nakajima and others describe the Coulomb branch as generalized slices in the affine Grasmanian, and they give the stratification. And this matches exactly to what you would get with the query subtraction.
