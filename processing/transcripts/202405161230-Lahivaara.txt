Thank you very much. Thank you very much. And as I said, so my name is Timola Hibara, and I'm from the University of Eastern Finland and then also working in a company called Guava. And so let me first introduce my co-authors. So in this work, we have William Hall, Dale Otta, and Vijay Sankar from the HyperComp, and then Mati Malinen, also from this company, Cuava. From this company, Cuava, that I mentioned earlier, and then Peter Monk from the University of Delaware. And as already said as well, so the topic is a title is electromagnetic wave simulation with the ultra-weak variation or formulation. And maybe one more thing on this kind of first slide. The reason why I have those two affiliations in this talk is that actually here, the Yeah, let's say setup goes in such a way that we are developing the code at the company. So, all the code development has been done in this company called Guava. And then luckily they gave us the permission to also publish the work. And that's the, so quite recently we had a publication about the recent kind of developments on this work. Okay, but let's then. but let's then let's then jump to the let's then jump to the background so yeah maybe i will start from the from the right hand side of this slide so you will see a set of uh pictures over there and this this is of course something but is coming from the coming from the uh this customer point of view so these are the this the customer is uh kind of a solving solving uh this electromagnetic wave propagation on on this kind of propagation on this kind of these kind of cases. And as you will see kind of from these different figures shown on the right hand side, that these problems, they can contain a lot of very detailed level kind of features on the surface. For example, on this kind of at this, hopefully you can see this amounts as well. But anyway, so you can see that kind of these are very narrow dips and so on on the Narrow dips and so on on the surface. Then, on the other hand, when thinking more generally about the problem size, so of course these are huge. When scaling to the kind of what is a frequence band, we are interested about. So, we are talking about frequencies at least in the X band, that means in centimeters in vacuum. What is the wavelength in vacuum? It's just a few centimeters. And if we then come back to the And if we then come back to this kind of problem scales or problem size we are talking about, this easily leads to a huge computational problems. And if we think about this, some kind of a rule of thumb for the low order finite element scheme that let's say the 10 elements per wavelength is needed to reach the kind of good enough numerical accuracy. Good enough numerical accuracy. It's quite clear that for the problem scale for these frequencies or these wavelengths, it's absolutely impossible to kind of get even the computational trick. And therefore, we need to do something else. And I guess that this is very briefly also the background why we kind of started this collaboration with this customer. And so Customer. And so maybe this ultra-weak variational formulation is one approach, one approach that enables us to use this higher order approximation on each element and therefore kind of enabling us to use larger elements and so on. And then, so, what comes to this, let's say, theoretical background of my talk and this is a method-related theory. third-related theory. All of those were already given by Peter Monk in his talk earlier this week. So hopefully everyone saw that talk. So let's then, yeah, this yeah, we will go very briefly. So I don't show any equations about this method. But so as you all are very familiar with this first bullet point that this Of this first bullet point, that this ultrawick variation of formulation is a special DG kind of a type of method. And it provides a kind of a very efficient and attractive approach to simulate electromagnetic wave problems, as we're going to see also in this talk. And then I would say that, yeah, I will use this version 1.0. So when I say So, when I say version 1.0, I mean this kind of work done by Tomi Huttun and Peter Monk and Matimalinen a few years ago. And so it was the kind of a parallel version. So at least in my opinion, the kind of the main point in the paper when comparing to this one was that it was the parallel. So that it already, that code enables to enables to use this kind of a large scale problem so that we can we can we can we can kind of use the we can use these supercomputer facilities high performance computing facilities and we can take all the all the power all the power from from those but then on the other hand so then when these are kind of a new add-ons or kind of new features what are needed for the for the code for example in in this uh already example in in this original original version it was kind of based on the flat face elements and so maybe if you think about those are kind of setups or the problems we are now studying or the customer once kind of to study uh maybe these curved elements might be quite uh quite useful as it turns out that it is really good really good add-on uh to include and maybe maybe that is a way to actually to relax that Way to actually relax that so this flat face element, so it requires roughly five elements per wavelength to capture these geometric details so that the kind of we don't have these geometrical kind of errors coming. And so maybe we can relax that grid density kind of a criteria by using these curved elements. And then just to kind of very briefly, before we jump to those. Very briefly, before we jump to those numerical miracle examples, so let's let's briefly check and it's a comparison comparison table between the version, this original version and then this most recent kind of add-ons, a most recent version. So as I already explained, this MPI, MPI parallelization. So yeah, of course, included in both versions. So we made minor modifications. Minor modifications in this most recent one. But then the first one, first kind of a real add-on will be these are curved surfaces. It was, let's say that it was kind of supported, yeah, it was a kind of a the way of adding those curved surfaces in the previous version was quite limited. And so it was completely revised in this newest version. The newest version. And then also, when we started kind of thinking about it, what might be the way, for example, once again, coming to this huge kind of problem scale we are solving. So one idea was that because we want to also fill these huge volumes. So let's say that we have a kind of, let's say that the customer wants to solve a problem that contains two of those aircrafts in the same model. And so then what might and so then what might be the way of filling the what might be the way of filling the volume between those and so maybe these other element types than tetrahedral elements might be kind of a useful and therefore we decided to give more flexibility flexibility for that by implementing these a hexahedral elements a wedge type of elements and also this pyramid pyramid type of elements and i will i will show examples later on from from Show examples later on from these first three element types. And then also, it is a low memory, low memory or kind of on-the-fly matrix building. That is also a way to, what also the customer wanted, that they sort of, by sacrificing the computational time, they wanted that, would it be possible to kind of so that because it was sort of a bottleneck for them that they had some. For them, that they had some computer power available, but then on the other hand, it was a bit limited memory kind of available on those computers. And therefore, we made the kind of add-on for the solver in such a way that it will build one of the matrices on the fly. But of course, unfortunately, this will have a huge kind of negative impact on the combudation of time. Makes, of course, perfectly sense. And then also, And also, when we were thinking that we would like to fill especially those kind of volumes using, for example, these hexa elements, and the idea was that maybe we can use element size something like 10 lambda. So we are talking about that scale. So then in the original code, we had a maximum number of plane waves per element was limited to 130, but that is not enough. So we are not able to reach that. not enough so we are not able to reach the enough numerical accuracy when we are talking about let's say 10 lambda element element size so and therefore that had to be that had to be increased so now in the in the current solver it is limited to 1.2 thousand lane waves per element uh then also from the once again from the application point of view so this is a resistive sheet okay that Seed, that type of a condition or that kind of a boundary condition is something what they need in their studies as well. And so that is now implemented. And I will show one numerical example of that in a minute. And then also this mixed total or scattered field formulation once again, and if a transmission transmission And for transmission condition, so that we can feed the incoming wave for any internal surface in the vacuum. So that, for example, when we have this perfectly matched layer surrounded by the target, so it might be quite attractive to have this kind of mixed total scattered field kind of boundaries, especially for this in-house. These inhogeneous cases, as we're going to see in the future, kind of in the numerical examples. And then these polynomial elements, it's something that Peter also talked on Monday. So it is now implemented. But the reason why that is in brackets that we have still some, let's say, challenges, and those need to be solved. So currently, there are kind of these number of iterations. Number of iterations needed to reach the solution is way too much, and we need to be able to reduce that quite a lot. Okay, but let's then jump to these numerical examples. So, we will have four different cases, all of course, 3D in here. So, first one will be this penetrable sphere. We will compare some computational times as well. Then, second one will be Then second one will be plasma, plasma type of sphere, quite similar to the first one, but the physical parameters will be, of course, different. Then there's a resistive sheet, as I promised that I will show something. And then the ultimate case will be this full-scale aircraft scattering from that in the X-band frequencies. And then also I want to highlight so that all of these numerical results are generated using the kind of Are generated using the supercomputing facilities we have available at the CSC, it's an IT Center for Science. Okay, so let's start with the penetrable sphere case. So then the kind of a schematic of the problem of the cross-section of the problem shown on the right. So we have the perfectly matched layer, perfectly matched layer, and then I Matched layer, and then kind of going inside from there, we have this region of interest that contains two subdomains: this vacuum, and then also this penetrable sphere. So, for the penetrable sphere, we set a radius of one meter, and then inside the sphere, we have epsilon 1.5 and mu 0.5. While in this everywhere else, it's a vacuum. Everywhere else, it's a vacuum. So it's they are one. And then you will see, okay, yeah, and now we have this total scattered boundary. Boundary, it's kind of located inside the vacuum. Then here you will see that, okay, so it's a quite long distance, loosely speaking, a long distance from this penetraposphere to the PML. That's true, of course. So the only motivation So, the only motivation of having that large distance in this case is that we wanted to kind of really test the algorithm that is capable of providing good results so that we have a kind of using the whole spectrum of this available, this number of plane waves per element. Yeah, you will see that from those accommodation accreted plots in a. Plots in a second. And what else? Yeah, and then the frequency is set to two gigahertz in this case, meaning roughly 50 centimeters in wavelength. Okay, so here are the computational crits. So exactly as I was explaining, that because we wanted to kind of really test this algorithm. So now you will see from the color bar, which shows the number of plane waves per L. Shows the number of plane waves per element that we will kind of use almost the whole range of available kind of values. And then on the left hand side, on the left hand side, you will see, yeah, it's a kind of labeled mesh1, which means the original type of crit. And by original type of grid, I mean that we have the surface of the sphere is modelled using the five elements per wavelength criteria. Elements per wavelength criteria. While on the right-hand side, we have a more sparse computational grid that uses one-third of a wavelength. Yeah, one-third elements per wavelength. That is the criteria. So, three times wavelength is the element size criteria for the surface. But then, on the other hand, on the right-hand side, we need to use the curved elements or curved surfaces as. Elements or curved surfaces, as you will see. Then, of course, here, also, what motivates is that we can see that there's a huge difference, of course, for the number of elements, because the customer also wants to run these cases in such a way that everything can be built on this, let's say, office laptop. So, of course, makes perfectly sense that when we're kind of extending, especially for real kind of aircraft cases or something. Aircraft cases or something, it might be that we are not even able to build the surface grid for the frequencies they are aiming to kind of a goal. And so then the solutions, how they look like. So this is a total field, so the real part of the Y component of the electric field. And so And so now there's a black line, a black solid line here. So that shows the interface that was used to, so the total scattered interface, while this white one is the interface between this material parameters. And of course, that's something we can see easily from the figure that it has a huge impact. Anyway, so and then I would say, yeah, visually, of course, if I zoom, if I zoom. Course, if I zoom this picture, I start to see some differences, but maybe it's not that easy to see what are the differences here, but we will see those from the far field. But before we jump to the far field, let's check these computational times that are we kind of gaining anything. So on the left-hand side, we have this mesh one flat. That means the original five kind of a dense surface triangulation. So means. So means 346 seconds for the whole combination. Then if we use the sparse surface elements, then still using the flat elements, of course, the computational time will kind of go down quite nicely. So 162. But then on the other hand, from the accuracy point of view, this won't be enough, as we're going to see from the far field. Then on the right-hand side, the measure. Then on the right hand side, the mesh 2 with curved elements 234 seconds. So, of course, this is something between these two guys, and this is exactly what we were expecting it to be due to the numerical integration. And then this is a far field. So, this is what the customer always wants to see. So, now we can see that this mesh one, me series, and mesh two with curved LMS day match quite nicely. curved elements they match quite nicely as as kind of we were hoping hoping to see so that the accuracy is is really good between those uh three curves but then on the other hand the mess do with flat base elements that doesn't kind of give us good good accuracy as as we were kind of expecting expecting to happen okay let's then jump to the plasma plasma sphere roughly the same same idea Same idea, so that we introduce the incoming wave using the total scattered boundary inside the vacuum. Then, in the same way, we have perfectly matched layer, we have the same frequence. But now for the DISA plasma sphere, we assume that the this epsilon, epsilon r is a minus 5, 1.5. So, in the previous one, it was 1.5, but here it's minus 1.5, otherwise, the same. And this is And this is first of all the snapshot of the field. So how it looks like. So on the left hand side, the kind of a 2D, 2D plane, and then on the right-hand side, 1D plot, 1D plot for the Y equals to, Z equals to 0. So on that line. And if I compare, once again, this afar field, how that looks. Field, how that looks like. So we see that we are kind of reaching quite good numerical accuracy. So that here, by the way, of course, we are using only the curved surface elements. And so it matches quite nicely with the Mi-series, as you will see from this kind of difference between these two curves. Okay, looking good. Then the third. Looking good. Then the third example will be this resistive sheet. So once again, we have this total scattered boundary for the incoming wave. Then we have a PEC sphere inside. So now this PEC sphere is this predius is one meter for that, otherwise the same. But in addition, of course, now we need to have additional. Need to have an additional surface. In this case, it means that we have a lambda, one quarter lambda distance from the PEC surface, and that kind of a spherical surface is used as a resistive sheet. So, we can maybe more easily see that from this figure. I can try to zoom if it works. So, now we use the volume between the The volume between the back sphere and then there's a resistive sheet surface. So, in this case, the kind of use of these hybrid elements is quite good in my opinion. So, now we can fill the kind of this domain between those quite easily using these vets elements. This might be a bit more kind of a well complicated is a bit strong word here, but of course, we can always use tetra elements. But from the number of elements point of view, From the number of elements point of view, this will be much more kind of attractive. And then otherwise, idea, idea exactly the same as we have done on those previous cases. I'm checking the time as well. Okay, so then this first of all, this near field plot spot, different values for this resistive secret. So the resistive seed be control. Resistive seed we control that it's a boundary condition, and we control the resistivity resistivity with the layer conductivity, conductivity, and the thickness. So that those are kind of freely selected parameters. So if I set that to zero, so in this case, eta will be equal to zero, then it means that it's a kind of, there is no impact from this resistive seed. But if I kind of A resistive sheet, but if I kind of select something else, then of course it starts to have an impact on the wave field. If you look closely here, you will see that this eta equals to one, this combination, it quite nicely we see only at sort of a plane wave propagation, almost only a plane wave propagation on this kind of negative X side. When compared to here, we see kind of a, yeah, it doesn't look Yeah, it doesn't look purely plane wave. And maybe more easily that can be seen from this afar field. So, that meaning in practice that for this eta equals to one, so if I go to this, so that this angle 180 means that it's the same as the incoming angle, the incoming wave, so this direction. So, it means that, loosely speaking, that we don't see the target from that direction. from that direction. So, and of course this is one of the this is the one of the applications on these resistive seeds that they are kind of a what is a stealth type of technology. Okay, then the then the ultimate one. Hopefully I still have one minute. So then the ultimate case. So this is the full scale aircraft. So so here the kind of uh yeah. Kind of yeah, the incoming wave is given on the PEC surface, so it's directly on the on the surface of this aircraft. Then the frequence is eight gigahertz, so that corresponds to this roughly four centimeters in wavelength, and so otherwise this is vacuum. So now we don't have any inhomogeneities or any resistive seeds or anything like that. And then these are the results. These are the results. So, first of all, this kind of electric field. So, this is the Y component on the left hand side, and those are three planes quite nicely. It shows the kind of, of course, from this field, we can see the structure of this aircraft. At least when I was seeing these pictures first time, I was quite excited how it actually looks like, because I haven't seen this type of. I haven't seen this type of a plot before. And then on the right-hand side, it is just an animation, animation about this ISO surface, ISO surface from one single ISO surface from different angles. Just kind of a, yeah, if we take a closer look, we can see this very detailed kind of structures in the way field. Then I think that I'm almost running out of time, so then once Running out of time, so then once again, of course, from the customer point of view, they are mostly interested about this kind of far field. So, this is how it looks for this case. And then we can jump to the conclusions. So, yeah, it has been extremely interesting project to work really on the customer kind of customer is saying that what is needed. Saying that what is needed. So, and all the things what we do, all the developments, it's always kind of application-driven that this is something that we need to be able to do faster and so on. And therefore, at least I have kind of enjoyed a lot about this. And of course, this is an interdisciplinarity to work with people with totally different expertise. And I have enjoyed. And I have enjoyed. And then, of course, as we have seen, just to kind of highlight something from these added features, is these curved elements that it seems to have a huge impact on the computational time. And then, yeah, a future steps very, very briefly. So, yeah, of course, these are polynomial elements, as I mentioned, and Peter also mentioned on Monday that. Mentioned on Monday that that's definitely something that we are kind of we need to improve. Then maybe going even higher kind of orders for these curved surfaces. And then I'm personally very interested about these neural networks and these are physics informed neural networks. And maybe we might have something in the future to that direction. Would it be possible to boost this combination somehow using neural networks? neural networks. All right, but that's all. So thank you very much. Thank you. We have time for one or two questions. I have a question. So it concerns the calculation for the plane. Okay, because I noticed very, very briefly that the size of the plane tends to be ten meters. Seems to be ten meters. Is it correct? You mean you mean here? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, because it is my oh no, it's perhaps a little. So is it a big plane for what you're interested in? Of course, this is just a kind of it is just a model that that is available in console multi-physics. So it's geometry is taken from there and it's tilted. So kind of because it's, yeah, as you will see from this animation on the right hand side. Will see from this animation on the right-hand side that it's kind of a tilted. So, what might be the length here? Oh, yeah, okay. Yeah, but yeah, the Peter-Gaw theorem. Okay, we can calculate. Okay, but okay, so then, okay, but is it interesting for the application you have in mind to look at bigger planes or objects, or okay, just to know? Well, I think that from the application. I think that from the application point of view, of course, this is something what the customer is doing. So I'm guessing that they are more interested to kind of have these more detailed kind of structures included in the models. And that could mean, for example, these antenna models and so on. Somehow I feel that that might be the, loosely speaking, a bit more interesting kind of approach here that would it be possible to include this very detailed level things. Very detailed level things on the, for example, on the surface of this aircraft and to that direction. I have a last question. What is your linear solver to invert the matrix? When you have this huge system at the end, what software do you use to invert the matrix? So you mean. So, you mean the iterative method? So, this picnic it's an iterative method that you use to solve. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Thank you. It was very interesting. Okay, thank you very much.
