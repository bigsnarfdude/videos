Here today, once again, in this sort of wonderful place. So, what I want to tell you about is a recent result with Colin and Tibold that is about a nozzle surfaces. So, let me tell you a little bit. And I will begin with perhaps what is the central result somehow in this sort of area of geometric inverse problems in 2D. It's a little bit remind you. Let me remind you about something that I'm sure you have seen at some point. This is the famous, celebrated. Famous celebrated boundary rigidity result from Tester Ruhlmann. So, let me quickly remind you: suppose you have two simple metrics on a surface M, and you know that the boundary distance function of the two simple metrics, G1 and G2, are the same, then you can show that there is a diffimorphism, R, from M to M, with the property that it's an isometry, so maps G two to G one and is the identity map of the line. Okay? Definition of simple surface, just in case you don't have it fresh enough on your mind, three things. So, boundary is strictly convex. There's no trapping, so every geodesic runs between boundary points. And then, this key last property is free of conjugate points. So, this essentially forces M to be a disk. It's kind of easy to see. A disk, it's kind of easy to see. So I could have defined simple in like 10-12 different ways, depending on how you sort of approach things. So I could have just said also that it's just a disk with the property that between two points there is a unique geodesic actually connecting them, and this geodesic there is in a symphony plane with a pair of points, and there's two different planes, and so on. You can get the picture. Right. So, uh Right, so quick result in the class of simple metrics. So I come back to these three properties, like away. But then here's the question. So what is the analogue of this result for closed surfaces? So let's say you don't have a boundary. Is there an analogue of this? I don't have a boundary. So what is the analogue of this? Well, the analogue of this is to work with what's called an With what is called an anosov surface. And the way to motivate what an anosov surface is is not to give the dynamical definition of dynamical systems, which I will not need at all, so I can tell you about it if you want, but there's no need. It's just simply to say that a surface is an OSOF if the metric G is in the C2 interior of the pseudo-metrics without continuum points. And this is exactly the correct thing because let's say if we go back to this. Because if we go back to this, if we don't have a boundary, essentially these two things are meaningless. It is impossible to make it non-trapping if they're working on a closed surface. But it is well known that this is C2 open. It's one of the first things you do when you talk about simple surfaces, is that the simple condition is actually C2 open. So it's a good, decent chunk of the set of Banyan matrix. So you do away with this, you keep the three of conjugate points and you make that into the C2 open condition. So from this point of view, if you go to the closed case and the zero. If you go to the closed case and the two mausoleum properties, exactly the correct replacement for this. We've known this for quite a while, and we know that one can kind of freely move between the two. When I say freely, you know, not so freely, otherwise there wouldn't be a point for this talk. But there is like a sort of, you know, like a dictionary between one and the other where you find the right objects on one side that would allow you to move and prove interesting things. Okay, so, but we don't have a boundary distance function, so we need to replace the boundary distance function. So, we need to replace the boundary distance function, which is the length of the geodesics, for something else. Well, it turns out that once you give this definition, you can go away and prove that there are a lot of closed geodesics. And in fact, in every free cometoped class, there's a unique one. So, you could, in principle, look at the length of that. So, this gives rise to the following notion. But before I get into that, just to give you a little bit of context, so here is a sort of, you know, all. So, here is a sort of obvious example that you want to have in mind. If you have a surface with negative calculus curvature, I mean, that is obviously free of conjugate points. That's one of the first things you check in a basic course on the minor geometry of surfaces, that if your curvature is less than or equal to zero, there are no conjugate points. Clearly, an open condition. So that implies the Nossov property. But the Silver-Nossov matrix is much larger. It's a much larger open set. For example, we can exist isometrically embedded in R. Isometrically embedded in R3, which is the other second thing that you prove in a basic charge, because any surface in R3, isometrically embedded, will have a point where the chemical is greater than positive factor. But and also surfaces can exist as objects inside R3 with a metric that is inherent from R3, and there are many more examples. So it's a larger and more interesting class. Still, a little bit mysterious, for example, it's not known if this class is path-connected, a set of Path connected, set of surfaces with negative curvature is path connected. The NASA metrics still sell. So, very interesting questions. Okay, so then you do the next thing that geometers tend to do is that you pack an interesting object into a moduli. So, you take the set of all and of matrix and you mod out by the set of different morphisms isotopic to the identity. So, the little zero here important isotopic to the identity. This is a different morphism for R2. So, that's the name that I'm going to. So that's the name that I'm going to use. And on that space, you define the length functional, in which what it does is essentially, if you give me a metric which is a NOSOF, I have now a new functional on the set of free homotopy classes, which I denote by sort of currently C, and essentially they looked at the length in the metric G of the unique closed geodesic in that homotopy class. Geodesic in that homotopic class. And then you can check that this really goes to the quotient. If you want to move this by a diffeomorphism isotopic to the identity, you don't change the homotopic classes. This is where the isotopic to the identity is important, otherwise you would be kind of shuffling the free homotopic classes in a way that you might not want. So this gives you this sort of functional here, and then the question is whether this functional is injective. That's the analog boundary rigidity. So you have replaced boundary distance function by. So you have replaced boundary distance function by length of the close geodesics in free homotropic classes and you want to prove injectivity. Injectivity here will tell you for free that there is a map, a diffomorphism math, mapping one metric into the other, which is a synotopic proof. So, and that's the theorem. So, this is the theorem we end up proving. So, this is the analog. We've been after this thing for quite a while. I guess there were some sort of ingredients missing. there were some sort of ingredients missing that now kind of became uh possible. So this is the thermal kit and you know this was known in negative curvature. Well this was perhaps one of the most classical rigidity results proved by Koch and Nottal when the metric has negative curvature. But you know, um unfortunately their proof did not extend to the Anosa case. Maybe just sort of passing by quickly, there are some results that do sort of extend in a fairly easy way. Of extend in a fairly easy way from negative curvature to serve and not soft, and there are some others that don't, that really require something new and non-trivial. And this is one example, the other is tensor tomography. It's a little bit like for simple manifolds, the upgrade of tensor tomography from negative curvature to simple to non-conjugate points is very expensive. This one is expensive too. How does orientedness come in here? Good question. It doesn't. I mean, once you prove it for the oriented case, if you have something that is not orientable, you can go double cover and make it oriented. I'm going to use things that you only have in the oriental case. It's going to be some vertical Fourier analysis. Very little of it, but you know, to be honest, you need that to be orientable. So there is this is a conjecture of Burns and Katok from 85 that the theorem should actually be true in any dimensions. I don't want to go into the detail of the literature about that. My two co-authors did some amazing work in high dimensions, but the conjecture is still open in the generality that's been good in dimension too. Okay, right. But then, you know, what is really the key result of Establishment? So, boundary child is kind of, you know, the sellable thing, the marketable. But the real result is not that. The real result that they really prove is this. So modulus, unknown things. And I'm going to make this what I'm going to do. But the really proof that it's kind of amazing is this result that says that if you have, I'll move it up in a minute. That's a problem with dividing, that the whole theorem doesn't fit in one. Okay, so sorry about that. So let's the real theorem that they probably say if you have two single metrics on a surface, and then you make a sort of little adjustment to make them the same at the boundary, something that you can always do if you're the same boundary distance one. Let's assume g1 and g2 are the same on the boundary. Then if they have the same scattering relation, and I'll remind you what that is, then they have the same vision line of. This is the thing that they put. So that's scattering relation, DC, and scattering relation is just, you know, I guess almost everybody knows. Point and vector pointing inside, you look at the point, exit point and exit vector. That's alpha d segment mark. Okay, so once you have that, once you have that, this Once you have that, once you have the same DC to Neumann map, then it turns out that from the DC Trinum map, you can see that there is a diffeomorphism, that is the identity on the boundary, and that is a conformal map, namely maps the metric G2 to the metric G1. Which is written here in this way, but if you want, you can say perhaps the more correct way you're saying is that G1 and G2 give your surface a structure of a human surface. structure of a human surface, and then this map phi gamma by co-morphism with respect to the structure of human surfaces, which is the identity of the map. So they recover the conformer class where all the content of the conformer class, because of the Bappin theorem, is really contained here. The fact that you have asked the ephemorphism to the identity of the button. And this is great, and this you can see now in a number of different ways. So when I first came into the subject, this was, you know, quoted Laz Asula. You know, quoted Lassa Suhlmann as having proved this, sure, they did prove that. But then Benny Scherf proved something similar. But, you know, my feeling is that this was already proved by Roy in the 56. It's a Riemann surface, he's all. If you know the boundary values of a Riemann surface, you know the structure of a Riemann chain. And if you know that this is the normal map, you know the boundary values of holomorphic functions. It's the same sort of equivalent information. The thing is, I pressed the woman, I always looked at this problem always, and maybe I'm Martin Winter from with real classes. From with real classes. And my point of view is that this is a complex geometric picture, really. Anyway, so this was all known, was known by that time. So they essentially get from the scattering relation the conformant class. And once you've got the conformant class, once you have capture M as a Riemann surface, then Mukhometov comes into the game, classical result from 77, then you've got everything. So once you know the Kofuma class, the same bundle. Know the conformal class of the same boundary distance function will give you that the matrix isometric. So there's really no conformal factor there. So structure is clear from boundary distance function. You do some argument, you will do scattering relation. From the scattering relation, you recover boundary values of homomorphic functions. From boundary values of homomorphic functions, you recover real surface structure from that hometown to give you x-ray destinies. So, what we really prove with Colan and T-Volt is that if you have two anoss surfaces with the same marked length spectrum, so the key thing is that we show, this is annoying, that there is a crucial line, because we divide there exists a diffeomorphism, and that zero is very important. I should talk into the identity such that it maps conformally one metric to the other. Normally, one metric to the other. So that little zero is very important because once you know that the little zero is isotopic to the identity, CAT talk actually replaces Buchometol and tells you that the metrics are isotropic. Because you know, one of the first things that they did when they started to think about this problem was to prove everything in the conformal capacity. It's easier. So you see this sort of analog, right? So Kato, Mukomito, is all kind of clear dictionary, even though each one of the proofs is not quite. Even though each one of the proofs is not quite the same. And this approach is really very different from what Krok and Ottal did: that they try to actually prove that some map that you construct with the unit tangent bundle by doing some argument becomes one A, the map itself is an isolated. They didn't really go after the conformal class. You always got the impression that going after the conformal class was the key thing. Okay, so this is really the key result of Eston Woolman, and this is what we proved. But what is really the key idea of Esto Woman? ID in Pesto Wuhlmann. This is the way I see it. The key idea in Pesto Wuhlmann really is the following. It's to consider the following object, which if you go to the paper, you're not going to see what goes. But if you go to our book with Nicole Hunter, you will see it kind of written like this. So the theorem had a bit of an evolution, the proof of Panama object. And I think the correct object is this: they look at the set of C infinity first integrals of the geodesic flow. So x. Of the geodesic flow. So x is the geodesic vector field that's given by a metric, and they look at sort of invariant objects. So functions f, which are C infinity, which are being killed by X. And in addition, are fiberwise photomorphic. Fiberwise hydromorphic means the following. If you're working now on the unit tangent bundle, so you have fibers on the unit tangent bundle, and the fiber, since it is the surface is oriented, it's really a circle action, an action, only circle action. If you have a circle action, you have fully analysis. Collection, you have Fourier analysis. So you can do a Fourier analysis in the vertical variable, and it makes sense to talk about Fiberwise holomorphic functions, which just simply means if you do a Fourier expansion, you just simply say that all the negative Fourier roles are zero. That's fiber-wise holomorphic. And now in this case, we have a wonderful interpretation of this as being a holomorphic function in a transport twist of space. Obvious geometric pictures and reliable disease, but that we know we know need for this. Need for this. Okay, so this was the object, and then the key result, again, being cut by the slides, is that if you take one of these invariant objects, firewise homomorphic, and you project it into the sort of zero Fourier mode, you do a push forward of this, this is in the unit tangent model, you do a push-forward, two things. If you begin with a first integral with this, which is father-wise holomorphic, you land into a holomorphic function on n. That's easy to check. That's easy to check, and the key point is that this map is actually subjective. Zero Fourier mode, this map, what they prove, this is the famous subjectivity Y0 star, which they don't phrase in this way because, well, and this is actually subjective, and this in turn comes from the injectivity by zero and some micro-local analysis with a normal of the same spirit as we saw. And then they go on, and this is the key thing that they use. Right. Now, the problem that we have is that in the Anosov case, you can actually show that this is not going to work. You have to do something different. This is not going to work because you don't have, you can prove, and this is the fact that the geodesic flowing on another subsurface is ergodic, you don't have any trouble, it's kind of the opposite. So you don't even have an N2 invariant function. So that's not what I want. So that's not going to work. So you need to replace it by what? Well, this was easy, we knew for quite a while, with Nikka Wunter even. You have to replace it by distributions. So now you drop this infinity thing and you say, look at just all the distributions which are involved by the geodesic flow and they do have actually their favorite. Which again, you can do a fully analysis expansion distributions in the same way as we find them. Turns out this is a really nice object. Turns out this is a really nice object. It turns out to be light in the simple case. It turns out to be an algebra. You can multiply these objects if you do a correct wave and set analysis, which is not obvious, but you can. That's kind of very nice. Again, there is a sort of interpretation of this in terms of a transfer twist or space in which you end up taking just product of ordinary colomorphic functions. But now, the other thing that happens is that you're on a closed surface, so you don't have collomorphic functions on a closed surface. Any collomorphic function is constant. So what else do you have? Function is constant. So, what else do you have? Well, you have high-order differentials. In particular, you look at the simplest one, holomorphic one-forms. You do have holomorphic one-forms. Okay, so what you need to do is first you need to replace infinity functions in Betsy-Woodman by the distributions, and you have to let the holomorphic functions go, and now work with holomorphic functions. And now it turns out that the map, so So, you can sort of ignore the zero-fourier mode because it's all constant, so you can kick it away. And then, here I'm going to just have first invariant distributions that begin from the first Fourier mode up. So I sort of kick away the single Fourier mode. And then if I map this into the first Fourier mode, that turns out to be also holomorphic, one form. Yes? And this part turns out to be subjective. So this we knew quite a while ago, and this is something. Quite a while ago, and this is something that we proved with Miko and Multi-Pack in 2014. Quite nice, okay? You have that. Now, how do you use this? Now comes the thing. So these were all things that we knew at the time. This is great because I'm in slide eight, and I have one more slide to tell you what's actually really new. But there is a new point of view, of course, that should probably underestimate. Yeah, actually, real great. Great. So if you have the same wire length spectrum for the two metrics, then in the same way that there was this sort of argument in the simple case going from the banner distance function to the scattering relation and so on, there's now a dynamical argument that replaces this, which is again has been known since the 90s programming time, which says that if the length spectrum of the two metrics are the same, then you have a nice simple Then you have a nice infinity diffeomorphism between the unit tangent values of one metric and the other that conjugates the G D C flows. This is the analog of saying that the scattering relations are the same. Now, you cannot say that the G L S in flows are the same, that doesn't even make sense because you're not even working on the same manifold, but you know, you're throwing a diffinity diffio between the two that conjugates the two difficulties. That's exactly an idea. So, an even better this diffio is Different is isotopic to the identity map. And again, this comes from dynamic assistant theory, you know about this. The question is really, you know, what do we do with this? So then what we do is the existence of this diagram. You've been very fond of this sort of woolman push-byte diagram, in which you sort of arrange a sort of information like this. So bottom are things on M, and the objects in the bottom are kind of always holomorphic. Are kind of always holomorphic in the sense of the Riemann surface. Objects in the top, they live essentially unit tangent bundle or in transport twist or they are holomorphic in this other notion, that way. And then you have this map going down, which are just push forwards. And the great property you know is that this push forwards actually is objective. This is the key thing, right? So this is Ulman or uh B silo or Ulman B, whatever. Shallow or pink. So then you sort of do it like this, and you can define the map, this map going down in the following way. Since this map is one to, you can now pick an arbitrary right inverse. It doesn't really matter which one it is. Let's go to E1. And E1 is the only, well we need this one too, because at some point I want to show that this is an isomorphism. You take a right inverse, and then obviously, well, not so obvious, you end up showing that this map. You end up showing that this map that conjugates the geodesic flow obviously will map an invariant distribution to an invariant distribution. What is less obvious is that it will map a holomorphic, fiber-wise, holomorphic invariant distribution into a fiber-wise, holomorphic invariant distribution. But it does. First new thing. Two away from sit analysis and propagation similarities, and you end up showing that this map behaves the way you think it has to behave. Now you have constructed this very nice map. Nice map. You check down, and now you have a map F between the holomorphic one volumes. And this map F is easy to check. There is an isomorphism, but the killer property is not the isomorphism, it's the fact that it presents the periods of the one-forms. The periods of the one-forms are just essentially the integrals of the one-forms along the closed geodesic in the common docket class. And it's a unique one. And now you have Torelli's theorem. Torelli's theorem on Riemann surfaces will tell you that the period Riemann surfaces will tell you that the period mapping of a Riemann surface determines the conformal structure. So, this is what would be replacing, you know, the BC to Neumann map or whatever thing, Royden that told you that the boundary value of holomorphic functions will determine the structure of the Riemann surface. Now, the period mappings of the holomorphic one forms are replacing. Actually, Torilli's theorem is missing this. Once you've got the diagram, and this requires proof. Okay, so great. Okay, so great. Towards the last slide now. Forms. And now, how do we prove that that map F preserves the periods? Well, this comes with a nice little bit of integral geometry, soft micro-local analysis, which is this kind of little miraculous formula. Let me try to explain what this says. So you take a close due distance. So you take a closed geodesic and you look at S1 of gamma. So that is simply the unit tangent bundle around gamma. So gamma is a geodesic. You look at the circle around every polymer. So that gives you a torus inside the unit tangent bundle. That is one of gamma. Now F was one of these invariant distributions. I multiply by d lambda. Well lambda is a canonical contact one form. So this is a two-fold. So surface two-fold. I compare it. Oh. Two form. I can pair it. Oh, careful. You can pair it if you have authorization. Authorization is what? Away from set condition. So away from set condition, this, and this is, we go on with proof, because we have very good understanding of the wavefront second condition of the F. The same sort of thing that will tell you that the map of phi was mapping holomorphic objects into holomorphic objects. So these have the correct wavefront second condition. So the formula will tell you that this pairing that can be legally defined. That can be legally defined is so nice that it equals exactly the integral of the push forward of the f of the class gamma. And it only depends on the class, right? Distinct here. And it's very easy to prove. You just prove it for a C infinity F. And for a C infinity F is an elementary exercise in free analysis. We do it. It's geometric unit tangent, but there's nothing going on. And then it holds by sort of continuity Hermal wave and second issue and on any distribution. So this is the pairing thing. So, this is the pairing thing. This, something like this, like half of this appear in the argument by Surviv Ottal. So, somehow, I guess, one new insight or somehow how to make that argument that Ottal made in conjunction with the Gauss-Ponet theorem work in our case. So, if you have this pairing formula, you can go back to the map, to the diagram, and essentially change the diagram. Initially, change the diagram. Change that diagram and then check with the varying formula that the function f meets are preserved. So that's the kind of new thing. And then, well, you apply Torelli theorem. The problem is that the Torrelli theorem gives you an abstract, an abstract by holomorphism. So you don't know if the bicolomorphism that comes from Touredi theorem is an absolute. comes from Joel's theorem. This is a topic to the identity. So you have a problem. So this causes can't delay for a couple of months. Because you know, this is a little different than going and trying to prove that this map, that the map, that this map phi actually comes from the lift of a map from the base. We don't do that. That's very hard. That's what Krok and Latal do in negative curvature. We don't do that. We do that at posteriority. The way we deal with this problem, the isotopic to the identity, Problem the asymptotic to the identity is by using a little bit of a touch-of-type mirror theory. And again, this is a trick that we use with Nico, which is that, you know, you're not just working on the surface. You know, you are allowed to take, you know, finite covers. You have the same mark length spectrum on the surface. Any finite cover that lifts everything will have the same property. And you start going to finite covers, and it's an amazing amount of information you have when you go to finite covers if your fundamental group is large. And essentially, what happens is that if you apply the argument that we've just done at every sort of finite cover, you kind of end up proving with a little bit of technique theory that at some point the points are different in different points of the orbit of the mapping plus group. So you end up showing that they had to be different to begin with. So you end up proving that the points, they are not just related. They are not just related, they are not the same in moduli, but you end up putting it, they are the same in technier. And if they are the same in technique, then you're done. You can put your map as an entity and then talk and this mode of cursor without denying. And I think, um yeah, so that's that's proof of screen. Thank you. Thank you, Paulo. Other questions? Can you go back to your diagram? So um what is the key point of the diagram? Key point of the diagram? The key point of the diagram? Well, first the diagram itself. Then the fact that this map phi is mapping this to this. So the map phi is by sort of pullback. So if you pull back an invariant distribution, you get an invariant distribution. But this is both. This is fiberwise holomorphic. So you pull it back, you don't know if it's fiberwise holomorphic. You have to prove it's fiberwise holomorphic. In Pesto-Mulban, that does happen too. You take one of these holomorphic functions and then they have the same. Holomorphic functions and then they have the same scattering relation. We launch them from the boundary, and then it becomes otherwise holomorphic because of injectivity of the x-ray on zero functions and one for so here you have to do that, but you have to do a previous waveform set analysis to be able to go through it. So I guess the fact that I can write a map from here to there has to be proved. It takes some effort. So that's one point of the diagram. Then you've got your map, and then you have to prove that your map is superior percent. And then you have to prove that your map is period preserved. And this is the pairing for it. So these are the two main sort of ingredients. And from a micro-local point of view, maybe this is what you have in mind. It's really soft micro-local. It's just wavefront analysis at propagation of similarities. There's no need. So at some point we thought that for this we needed to use for lens map pi. We don't. Which makes me very happy somehow because the result of the Migrant Winter was good enough. In the same way for tensor tomography, The same way for tensor tomography, once you know that this thing is an algebra, you can solve tensor tomography in one go just with what we did with people. So conceptually, I mean, I don't want to. I don't want to diminish Collens map in any way, but at least conceptually, I think that's the kind of correct thing. You don't need to use big cover when you don't have to. Let me ask you a quick question. So are you using the fact that you mentioned that this set of finitely invariant distributions are algebra? No, in this particular proof we don't actually need the algebraic property. No, I just mentioned passing by because it's a good thing to know. If you ever need to approve distributions, really title. Title. But this particular proof is not neat. For tensor tomography, you do need it. If you want to higher-order tensors, the way you prove that is once you know that this map is on top, if you start taking products here of holomorphic one forms, you get higher order holomorphic forms. And then essentially by using that display soto, you want to take the product of the distribution. The product of the distributions to argue that once you have taken that and you do the sort of push forward in degree two, let's say, you hit your degree two four. So that those maps of higher order are actually old. There you need it. And this is what actually Colleen is. So the map pie actually, if I may, just one second. I mean, actually, Colleen's map, what it will give you, the way I think about this, is The way I think about this is an optimal right input. It's a write input with wonderful properties because it gives you a special distinguished distribution that you have picked up in a canonical way by choosing the normal operator. Exactly as it happens in the simple case. If you use the normal operator to pick up a particular infinity integral. But for the proof, you just need a right inverse, not a really efficient right inverse. We have preserved quite a lot of time for discussion, so I suggest that we
