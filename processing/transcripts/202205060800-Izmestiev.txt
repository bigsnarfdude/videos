Conference, the first talk will be given by Ivanazmestev. Please. Thank you for the invitation and possibility to speak at this conference. So I will speak about discrete radical applautions. And some of you might have listened to that talk already, so I apologize for that, but I think most of you did not. I think most of you did not. So, the plan is as follows. First, I will recall some facts about the classical Laplacian for small functions and introduce the combinatorial Laplacian Laplacian on graphs. In the second part, I will speak again about known things on the discrete Euclidean Laplacians, and it will allow to see. See somehow what are the problems, what are the guidelines, how one should introduce a discrete spherical Laplacian. And of course, at some point, I also will explain why do I care, so why it would be good to have good discrete spherical Laplacians. All right, so let us start with classical things. So the usual Laplacian, so for me, this is so it has a minus sign here, so that it is a So that it is a positive definite quadratic form at the end. I mean. And functions for which the Laplacian is equal to zero are called harmonic. They describe stationary heat distributions. And this harmonicity, so Laplacian is equal to zero, is in fact equivalent to the mean value property. That the value of f at every point P is the average of the values on any circle. On any circle centered at P. From the mean value property, one immediately derives the maximum principle. There is no local maximum in the interior of the domain, because if there would be, then the value in the maximum could not be the average of the values on a circle. And furthermore, this Laplacian operator is self-adjoint and positive semi-definite. If you integrate Laplacian f times h. integrate a partial f times h, then this is the same as integrating the integrating the inner product of the gradients of f and h and if you substitute h equal f then you get the norm of the gradient which is non-negative and of course it vanishes only if the function is constant so the constant functions are the only functions in the null space of this operator. All right, so let us now discretize the La Pausan. And the first thing to look at is the square grid. Assume that a function is defined on the nodes of a square grid by f sub ij. We denote the value at the point with coordinates ij. Then somehow the finite difference, the second mode of finite difference, which replaces the second or the partial derivative is this expression. Derivative is this expression. So exactly this. So these are three points which lie on the vertical line, and these are the points which lie on the horizontal line. And then the Laplacian should be this expression. So that is the Laplacian of f is a new function on the square grid whose value at fij is equal to four times fij minus all the neighbors. And if we take this And if we take this definition, then we get, we recover all the properties of the smooth Laplacian, namely, there is again the mean value property. The function is harmonic if and only if fij is equal to the average of its neighbors. Then the mean value property always implies the maximum principle, and this operator is self-adjoint and positive semi-definite. If you multiply Laplacian F ig with Fij and sum up, then you can rewrite. Up, then you can write this as the sum of squares of these differences, and it looks very much like the squared norm of the gradient, right? Okay, so after this success, let us go further and let us look, let us take any graph. So, VE is an abstract graph. It does not need to be embedded into the plane or embedded anywhere. An abstract vertex set and edge set E. Again, a function f is defined. Again, a function f is defined on the vertex set, and with fi, we denote the value at the vertex i. Then, again, the Laplacian is a linear operator on the space of functions defined on the vertices. So that is a linear operator on a finite dimensional Euclidean space. And we define the value of the Laplacian of f at the vertex i as this, the sum of differences f i minus its neighbors. Its neighbors. In the special case of a square grid, this gives the definition from the previous page. And let us see what we have then. Again, immediately from this definition, we see that the function is harmonic if and only if fi is the average of its neighbors. Then the maximum principle also holds. And if we again take the inner product of Laplacian f with f, that is simply the sum of Laplacian f. That is simply the sum of Laplacian f at the vertex i times fi, then we can rewrite this as the sum of squares of differences. Good, very nice. And although this the next slide doesn't have to do with most of the talk, I just cannot help to mention this nice property of the Graft Laplacian. The spectrum of the Graftaplacian reflects some combinatorial Reflect some combinatorial properties of the graph. For example, the number of spanning trees of the graph is 1 over n, n is the number of vertices times the product of all positive eigenvalues. A spanning tree is a subgraph which contains all vertices, so therefore spanning is connected and contains no cycles. For example, this graph has eight spanning trees, all of them are drawn. Trees, all of them are drawn here. And if we look at the corresponding discrete Laplacian, then Laplacian matrix has this form. And to compute, well, one can simply compute the spectrum and then multiply the three non-zero eigenvalues, but effect is also. Values, but the effect is also that the product of non-zero eigenvalues is any of the principal minors. So, for example, if you take the first principal minor, then you compute and get eight. And this eight is the same eight as there. Then another fact is that lambda one, so the lambda zero is equal to zero, right? And lambda one, the smallest positive eigenvalue, is related to the expansion properties of the Is related to the expansion properties of the graph. So, which means that lambda one is large if and only if it is. So, the larger lambda one is, the more difficult is it to cut the graph into two almost equal parts. We need to cut a lot of edges. Good. So, now let us move from the combinatorial to discrete. And what is the difference between combinatorial and discrete worlds? And discrete worlds. It's because in discrete, so I mean discrete in the sense discrete geometry. So some polygons in the plane. So if you have not only kinetotics, not only a graph, but also some geometry, for example, you have really geometric triangulation, then the geometry of the situation should be reflected in the weights. So we should introduce some Wijs. Wij and define the value of the Laplacian f at the vertex i in this way. Then the function f is harmonic if and only if. So let us, we should write this sum equal to zero, and then we can solve it for fi, and then we get fi is equal to the weighted average of its neighbors. Now, if all weights are positive, Weights are positive, then one has the maximum tension because then, well, it's a real weighted average with positive weights. This operator is always self-adjoint, and it is positive semi-definite if the rates are positive, because then again, you have sum of positive numbers times the squares of differences. But later in this talk, I will present a situation where not all weights are positive, but the operator is still positive semi- But the operator is still positive semi-definite. Because it is a sufficient condition for the positivity of this sum, the positivity of the weights is sufficient, but not really necessary. All right, but the question is actually how to choose those weights? How to extract these weights from the geometry of the city? Weights from the geometry of the situation. So if you have simply a spine relation, yeah. Excuse me. So have you seen the question? Yeah. No, I haven't seen the question. So there's a question by Daniel Hook. So other ways. Yeah, so that's exactly the question I want to discuss now. So in a sense, you can take. Um, so in a sense, you can take um well, any weights, but um, so the geometry should be reflected in these weights, right? So, you should uh choose the weights in accordance with the geometry, but in what in what exactly way. So, this is something that I will discuss now, right? So, one choice of the weights is for every edge ij. So, we want to. So we want to choose the weight. I mean, the weights are associated with the edges, right? Wij for every edge ij. And the weight associated with the edge ij, the classical choice is the sum of cotangents of the angles opposite to that edge. And the sum of the cotangents is nothing else but sine of alpha plus beta divided by sine alpha sine beta. And if the beta and if the sum of these angles is smaller or equal pi then the weight is non-negative and the sum of the opposite angles s or equal pi this is the Delaware condition for triangulation so this is it seems to be a good choice because for any point set now assume you are not given a triangulation you are simply given a point set in the plane then for any point set there is a unique Point set there is a unique Delaunay tessellation, Delonette triangulation of its convex hull. I mean, sometimes it's not a triangulation, but decomposition into polygons therefore tessellation. Delimet tessellation means that every face is inscribed in a circle and the circumcircle doesn't contain any other vertices. So that means with any finite point set, there is a canonical There is a canonical tessellation associated and the canonical discrete laplosh with positive weights. Also, you don't need to stay in the Euclidean plane. You can also consider abstract polyhedral surfaces. And this is a bit like abstract Riemannian surfaces. I mean, Riemannian manifolds. These are not polyhedral surfaces embedded anywhere, but abstract metric spaces which are locally isometric to a polyhedral surface. Symmetric to a polyhedral surface, but you don't know actually the combinatorics, you don't know where the edges are. And with such an abstract polyhedral surface, you can also associate a unique devonate oscillation, which leads to a canonical discrete laplacian. May I ask a question? Yes. Why is it unique? Do you assume some general position of the points? General position of the points or no so I don't assume general position in fact in general position this decomposition will be a triangulation and why is it unique it's a it's not obvious but so one way to explain why is it unique is to take a paraboloid i mean the points are in the plane but let us take the graph of the function z equal x squared plus y squared then leave squared plus y squared. Then lift all these points to the paraboloid. You get some points in the Euclidean space. Take the convex hull and well basically take the lower hull. So look at the convex hull from below. Then what you will see is the Delonet angulation. And so since the convex hull is a unique construction, I mean well-defined construction, you get a unique Delonet angulation. If you have four points at the vertices of a square, then yes, that is, then there are two triangulations which are both good. And therefore, I say that the tessellation, so up, sorry, that is unique on a tessellation, decomposition into polygons. If you have a square, you don't need to cut it. Okay, now I understand. Thanks. So, yes, I mean, now I want to ask the question: why exactly these weights? Well, on one hand, they work well. On the other hand, maybe one can introduce different weights, which also are positive exactly for Donetlin relations. But there is another explanation, namely, if you take any function on the vertices of a triangle, then there is a unique piecewise linear extension of this to the triangle. Extension of this to the triangle. So we have a piecewise linear function, and the Laplacian of a piecewise linear function does not make much sense. The Laplacian is zero in the interior of a triangle because they have a linear function and not defined on the adjacent vertices. But the gradient is defined also in the interior of triangles, and you can use the formula that we had in the small case. Now, instead of being a theorem, we make it to a definition. And we say the Laplacian of such a piecewise linear function, or of such a discrete function, is defined by this formula. So if f and h are two piecewise linear functions, then we define the left-hand side through the right-hand side. And it turns out that, I mean, for the function. I mean, for the functions f and h, all you need to know are the values at the vertices. It turns out that the right-hand side has exactly this form, and w ij ij are exactly the cotangent weights. So this was known in the finite element methods for some time, and then it was rediscovered at the TU Berlin by Olive Pinkel and Collard Bautier, who studied discrete mineral surfaces. Its mineral surfaces. And let me also remark at the end that I have defined the left-hand side, but I actually don't want to make up my mind what the inner product here means. A canonical choice of an inner product would be the sum of somehow Laplacian fi times hi. So the canonical Euclidean product. Right? But maybe it's not the best choice to take that. Not the best choice to take that product. All right, then let us. The next question is: how to extend this to higher dimensions? So up to now, we discussed only two-dimensional situation. So that is a field called discrete stereo calculus, popular in the computer graphics, because they are you need to work with bodyhedral surfaces. And so they And so they explain this Laplacian in the following way. If you have a set of points, there is not only a Delanette triangulation associated with it, but also the Veronois diagram. Veronoi diagram consists of, so a domain in the Veronois diagram contains all points closest to a point I. I mean, all points which are, so whose closest point is I. And this Ramoy diagram is dual to the Is dual to the Delaunay escalation. So the edges of the Evanoi diagram are orthogonal to the edges of Delaware. So here I denote it, so there is some inconsistency in the notation. On one hand, I denote them by Lij star, on the other hand, by Aij star. And it turns out that the ratio of Aij star to Lij is exactly the sum of the cotangents. Well, one half sum of the cotangents. And then one can Contingents. And then one can extend it to the high dimensions in a similar way. There, the Valonoi cells are three-dimensional, so they're polytops, and you can take the area of a face of the Valonoid isolation and divide it by the length of the Deloma edge. And that would give positive weights because the area is positive and the length is positive. But that is the difference. But there is a different generalization, namely the one that I already basically described, because the trick with the L2 product of the gradients can be also done in high dimensions. And then you get a formula which is different. So there, the weight associated with the HIJ has this form. Here you take all the faces which are opposite to the HIJ. ij in dimension two you had two vertices opposite to the edge ij in dimension three you have a cycle of edges opposite to the edge ij for this uh cycle of edges you take the length of each edge and multiply it with the cotangent of the dihedral angle that edge and this is what you get if you apply this formula it cannot be simplified um this is different from what you get in the disk This is different from what you get in the discrete stereo calculus. One can look at a particular example. If you take an inscribed bipyramid of a regular n-gon, then you will the weights of the DEC Laplacian will be zero because everything is inscribed in the sphere. But the weight of this so-called Dodzukwitney Laplacian will be negative because the dahedal angles in this case will be obtuse. So this looks like a problem because, well, on one hand, there is no problem because whatever triangulation you take, the Dodge-Quitting Laplacian is positive semi-definite because simply by definition, because you have the squared norm of the gradient. So even if the weights are negative, you will get positive semi-definite quadratic form. Quadratic form. But you have a problem with the maximum principle. The maximum principle will not hold if the weights are not positive. So either we should not care about that or we should learn to choose the triangulation in a special way. The delanator simulations are not maybe not very suitable choice. Well, for example, exactly because of that. Exactly because of that, even if you take the Dalmatian relation, then the weights still may be negative. Okay, so now before I go to the spherical things, I want to speak about another generalization or another context. If you now take a simply combinatorial triangulation, simplificational complex, T, then you can look at the co-chain complex. Look at the co-chain complex. So, CK is simply the set of linear combinations of synthesis of dimension K, and there are co-boundary operators in this complex. And if you choose some inner products on all those co-chain spaces, then you can define the adjoints by the usual procedure. Procedure. The adjoints go then in the opposite direction. And then you can define the Hodge Laplacian. So which goes from CK to CK and is equal to this sum of two compositions. If you take k equal to zero, then so you look at the functions on the vertices, and this is exactly what we had before. So, but this is a generalization of the This is a generalization of these two from Laplacian to functions to Laplacian and forms. This Laplacian is, it is easy to see that it is self-adjoint and positive semi-definite. So this comes from an article by Bernard Ekman, written actually just a couple of years after the works of Hodge on the smooth Hodge theory. But there is a freedom of choice of these inner products here and our choice. And our choice came from the L2 product of the gradients. Right, so the question is what inner product to choose? And if you take the canonical Euclidean product, then you get what is called combinatorial curvature theory. It was investigated in the work of Globin Foldman in 2003. Before that, Joseph Dodzuk Joseph Dodzuk considered the following definition. If you take any, so sigma is a function on the simplicis of dimension k, then you can associate with it, well, no, sigma is just any simplex. With a simplex, you can associate a Whitney form, which is again something linear and And you can define the inner products again by the L2 product of the Whitney forms. A special case of that is what we already discussed, the L2 product of the gradients. Lodzuk has also shown that if you approximate a Riemannian manifold by simplicial complexes, By simplicial complexes, so actually, in a way, similar to the way how Chigen Milo-Shtado do that, but for.Zuk, there is no distinction on the fatness of the triangulation. So then the spectrum of the discrete Laplacian converges to the spectrum of the smooth Laplacian, which is, of course, a very nice result. So the convergence is always good to see. Okay, now I think I'm ready to. Okay, now I think I'm ready to discuss spherical applause, and sorry, I don't see my clock. Can you Sasha maybe tell me how much time do I have? Or I just quickly look at my clock. Sorry, so we have 25 minutes left. Sorry, I did not hear you. So 25 minutes left. So it's exactly the half of the time. Yes, very nice. Yes, very nice. Very nice. So let us now see how we should define the spherical distance Laplacian. So first, what is the playground? So up to now, we looked at piecewise Euclidean things. So now we should look at piecewise spherical things. You can take a set of points on a sphere. You can take a spherical polygon and look at its triangulations. Or you can look at manifold glued from spherical simplicity. manifold glued from spherical simplicity. And we want to define a self-adjoint operator on the vector space. I mean space of functions on the set of vertices, v is the set of vertices. And this self-age interpolator should have somehow properties similar to the spherical Laplacian. So here is one property that one would like to have. The spectrum of the Laplacian on the sphere On the sphere looks as follows. Again, there is a zero eigenvalue corresponding to constants functions, and then eigenvalue of eigenvalue n of multiplicity n plus one, which corresponds to restrictions of linear functions from on our n plus one to the unit sphere. So if you want a discrete Laplacian on the sphere, so for some triangulation of the sphere, then it would be good to have this property. Be good to have this product. So, now the Steining formula that was mentioned several times during this conference. Here is the picture all of you know. We compute the volume of the T neighborhood of a convex body in the dimension three. I mean, the picture is two-dimensional, but you should imagine a three-dimensional situation. Then you have this expansion. So, with the area. Have this expansion so with the areas at the t. So, here you get somehow the Gauss ponyl, you get just the Euler characteristic of the sphere. And at this place, you have either the integral of the mean curvature or the sum of the edge lengths times the external angles. So, this is the total mean curvature, and one usually calls it the total mean curvature also in the discrete situation. Okay, so this picture was somehow in two cases in the smooth case and in the polyhedral case, but one can extend by continuity this to any convex body. So as Simon Alesgard explained it in his talk, so everything here is Hausdorff continuous and you can get a continuous extension to the space of all convex bodies. So for any convex bodies. So for any convex body we have again this expansion where w0 is the volume, w1 is the one-third of the area of the boundary. You can define the area of the boundary in this way actually. W3 is a constant and w2 is something which extends the integral of the mean curvature. These quantities wi's are called quermos integrals. They are also called intrinsic volumes if you take a different normalization. So they should Normalization. So there you should divide by the volumes of spheres, and so they are not intrinsic in the sense that they depend on the dimension in which you embed your body. But they are quad mass integrals, which means they are related to integral geometry. Wi is proportional to the average projection to three minus i dimensional subspaces. For example, the surface area is the average projection to the planes. Trojection to the planes and total mean curvature is the average width, the average length of projections to the lines. Okay, so why do I speak about that? It will become clear on the next page. Because it is possible to compute all these quantities, these wi's, from the support function of the convex body. The support function is function is the distance from the, so it is a function defined on the sphere. It associates to a unit vector the distance from the origin to the tension plane, support plane, which has u as the exterior unit normal. And if the boundary is smooth, then the function h is also smooth. And you can compute the query mass integrals just from the function. For example, Just from the function. For example, the total mean curvature is the average width, and the average width is basically the integral of the support function. Because you can see h of u plus h of minus u is exactly the distance between two parallel tangent lines. And here is a complicated formula for the surface area. So, again, the picture is two-dimensional, but if you imagine a surface in the Surface in this space, then you can compute its area by this integral. And the Laplacian here is the spherical Laplacian. Yes, and that's why I was speaking about equadlus integrals. The spherical Laplacian appears in the formula for the area. And we will use this formula later for the definition of the discrete Laplacian. But yes, and that's already some motivation. Yes, and that's already some motivation for our definition, but let us look at the again at the spectrum of the spherical Laplacian. Here are two theorems. One is a special case of the Minkowski inequality for mixed volumes. W2 squared is bigger or equal than W1 times W3. So W1 is the surface area, W3 is a constant for pi over 3, and W2 is the average width. Average reads, and here's another theorem. Uh, for the circle approach, excuse me, there's a question. So, there's a question. I'm sorry, I just don't see the chat. So, yeah, so that's my that's my task to tell it to you. Um, so it's again a question by Daniel. So, so, so maybe you asked? Um, yeah, I'm referring to the smoothness you require in the first formula you don't need it because you just have the support function in this. Because you just have the support function in the second. If you do a partial integration as far as I remember, then you can write it in terms of h and the gradient, and then you don't need it either, right? Yes, actually, I did not care about that, about that. For me, smooth always means C infinity, so there is no problem with that. But that's a good remark that you even don't need C2 because you can, by partial integration, just make it to the gradient. In fact, this is also. In fact, this is also a way to define the Laplacian for non-C2 functions. You can define the Laplacian in a weak sense for functions with square integrable gradient. And I think that's a known construction. That's nothing new. But the Laplacian that I will define will be not this Laplacian, because you can take any piecewise linear or piecewise something function. Piecewise something function. It is always, I mean, has integral gradient. You can apply this construction, but then you will not get the Laplacian that I will define. But it's not obvious, but really, thank you for that question. Yes, and as I said, well, I can say I'm using only C infinity because it's anyway dense in the house of sense in the set of convex bodies. And I don't need I don't need somehow more distinctions in this case. So, and now I want to explain that these two theorems are equivalent in some direct way. So this fact about the first non-zero eigenvalue of the spherical Laplacian and this Milkaust inequality, they equivalent because of the following. So because um recall that w3 is the is some constant simply the simply four pi over three one third of the area of s2 w2 is the integral of h which means this is the average value average value of h on the sphere up to a factor well here this is the factor so h with h bar i denote the average value of h So let us take any function h and denote by f minus its average. Then f is a function with zero average. And that means that f is L to orthogonal to the constants. The Laplacian has, I mean, I mean, the constants have eigenvalue zero for the Laplacian, and the functions which are orthogonal to the constants lie in this in the subspace where the eigenvalues are big or equal to. So if f is orthogonal to the constants, it implies because of lambda one, I assume now that lambda one is equal to. So this implies that Laplacian f times f is times f is bigger or equal than twice the squared norm of f. So this is sort of point-cutting inequality, but it follows from the fact about the spectral gap. Okay, now if you take this inequality and substitute for f our h minus h bar and then compute a little bit, then we get that w1. Again, so this is the formula for w1 for the area. Formula for W1 for the area. So, if you compute, then you get exactly our inequality here. So, that means I have proved now the implication from right to the left, and one can, I guess, also reverse the argument and get that also the left implies the right. Okay, so now I want to define the spherical applaution. The spherical Laplacian, and it is done as follows. It will be a Laplacian on a triangulation of a sphere. In fact, the triangulation will be defined by a set of points. I take n points, u1 so on u n, such that in every open hemisphere there is at least one of them. And then I consider Euclidean polyhedra with UIs as our As outward normals to the faces. Such a polyhedron is determined by the distances from the origin to the faces. So these distances are support numbers. So P is the intersection of these half spaces. And besides, I want to put some distinction on these HIs. I want that, I mean, if some HI is too big, then this phase will not be. And this phase will not be there, actually. So I want this H to have such values that there are exactly n phases, one phase for each normal. Then for genetic choice of H, this polyhedron is simple. That means that every vertex, you have three edges. But the combinatorics usually depends on the choice of H. I mean, what faces are adjacent? Faces are adjacent depends on the choice of h. But that is also a canonical choice if you put all h i's equal to one. It means that you are taking a circumscribed polyhedron about the sphere. You take the planes tangent to the sphere exactly at the points your eyes, at the points your eye. And the adjacency graph of these faces is exactly the delonate insulation. is exactly the delonate isolation now delonate selation in the spherical sense but which is the same i mean every face is inscribed and the circumcircle of every face doesn't contain the other vertices okay um so what did we do now we have chosen we have taken any set of points and associated with them um A subdivision of the sphere. Yeah, so this is a side remark. One can ask about what combinatorics are possible for a given set of points. So these are so-called weighted Delaney or coherent triangulations. They also appear in a well-known book by Glefan Kaplano-Zelvinsky on multi-dimensional determinants. We studied together with Francois Felast. So this So, this situation. So, but now back to our question. So, we have chosen any set of points and defined the triangulation of the sphere with that vertex set. And now we define the discrete Laplacian in the following way. If f is any function on this set of points on the sphere, then we define the Laplacian in a weak sense and also with a somehow And also, with somehow this additional term. So, we define the product of 2f minus Laplacian f with f as twice the area of f, where the area of f is not necessarily the area, but it is the following. If you compute the area of the polyhedron, constructed on the previous page. So, with this. So, with this variable distances hi, then you will get some quadratic form in the H's. But the problem there was that the polyhedron can have different combinatorics for different values of F. We take exactly that combinatoric that corresponds to the Delaunay distillation. So, on the right-hand side, you have some quadratic form in F. quadratic form in F and this defines our Plush on F in some weak sense. So in weak sense, I mean how it L2 acts on the other functions. The explicit formula for the light inside looks like that. So this is a quadratic form in F i's. It is now not positive definite because Definite because this second is bigger than one. So it is not positive definite. So the letters are explained here. Lambda ij is the spherical distance between the points ui uj, and l ij star is something like the dual length. All right, so this definition implies This definition implies some good properties about the spherical Laplacian. So, first, this Laplacian converges in the weak sense to the spherical Laplacian. This is exactly the continuity of the area with respect to the Hausdorff distance, because we used the formula for the area in our definition. And another property is the spectrum of this discrete Aplausion lambda one is equal to two and has And has multiplicity three, and this follows again exactly from this inequality and the condition for equality. So I have shown the proof how this is related to the signature. Now we are using this proof in the opposite direction. Yes, because this inequality actually holds for all convex bodies, not only for small ones. All right. All right. Yes, by the way, so when you look at this signature of the quadratic form, then it is the Laudensian signature, and one wants to look at some hyperbolic geometry. And again, so together with François Felix, we looked at this hyperbolic geometry on the space of shapes of polyhedra. This is related to a work by Thurston on the shapes of polyhedral and power energies. All right, there are more good properties of this Laplacian. So, first, so here are two theorems: an old one and a new one. The old theorem says that if you take any, well, the sphere is infinitesimally rigid. But if you take any spherical domain, any open subset of the sphere, then there are many infinitesimal isometric deformations, and all of them have the following property. Have the following property. The radial component of this deformation is an eigenfunction of the spherical Laplacian to the eigenvalue 2. The next theorem is a discrete analog of that. If you take any convex inscribed polyhedron, inscribed into the sphere, again, not a closed polyhedron because it will be rigid as any convex polyhedron. But if you take some part of it, then again, it's the later component of its infinitesimal isometric deformation. Infinitesimal isometric deformation is an eigenfunction of this discrete spherical Laplacian to the eigenvalue two. And another theorem, also from a joint work with Roman Plosanov and Tian Chi Wu. One can extend the definition of the spherical Laplacian to polyhedral surfaces with cone singularities. Singularities. And if the common singularity has singularities have positive curvature, then the spherical Laplacian has lambda one bigger or equal two. This is an analog of the Lifni-Lowitz inequality. And so we have used this to solve the prescribed curvature problem in a discrete control class. In the smooth case, this is the Toyano-Flau-Tian theorem, so about Tian theorem, so about the existence in any conformal class, smooth conformal class of a metric of constant curvature with given singular curvatures at described points. And yeah, so I will also come back to this inequality because here it is proved only in dimension two. And of course, one can extend the definition of spherical Laplacian to higher dimensions. So here are some of So here are some open questions and some motivation why I am studying the discrete Laplacian. The total scalar curvature as a functional on the space of Riemannian matrix on a fixed manifold. This is an interesting functional also appearing in the general relativity. And this is a non-convex functional. It is usually convex on conformal deformations of the matrix and concave on anti-conformal ones. And concave on anti-conformal ones. Well, this is not a very rigorous statement. It depends on the geometry, so on some things, but it sort of tends to be a convex. It is convex up to some finite dimension and concave on anti-conformal. And this is based on the properties of the Laplacian of the conformal factor and Laplacian of some tensor field. So it would be good to. So it would be good to prove a discrete analog of this, so of the signature for the discrete total scalar curvature, probably using discrete Captions for functions and for weakening forms. Then also, maybe some similar arguments could prove their, I mean, give a new proof to the theorem of Chigo. So this is a very nice theorem. If you have your Very nice theorem. If you have a Euclidean circuitial complex, so something glued from Euclidean theta Hilda, such that all curvatures are bigger than zero, then this is a real homologous sphere. Yes, it holds in all dimensions, not only theta hilda, but any simplicity of any dimensions can be glued together. Chigu's proof is very complicated. It uses basically the Hodge, the smooth Hodge theory, then general. Theory, then generalizes it to Riemannian manifolds with singularities, and then applies some Bochner-Weizenberg formula. Of course, in this situation, it would be more direct not to use Riemannian manifolds with singularities, but use the finite-dimensional Hodge theory. But this was not so far done. So despite several efforts. So, despite several efforts. And finally, so this Lichni-Lowitz theorem. So, if you have a remaining manifold with TG curvature bounded below, I mean, by exactly this constant, then the first positive eigenvalue is bigger than equal to n. The theorem from the last page, so this one, is a special case of this conjecture. So, the case n equals n. So, the case n equals 2. And I wonder if this holds also for high dimensions. So, that's all. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Are there questions, comments? So I would like to ask one question. So can you recover this theorem of Troyanov by limiting argument? I don't know for sure, but because one should then have some approximation result for this disclaimer. Result for this discrete between discrete conformal deformations and smooth deformations. And I know that there are some recent papers about convergence of about convergence in this sense. But I'm not sure that they yes, so this is actually a very interesting question because their uniformization. I mean, for positive single curvatures, it is known, but for general, not necessarily positive singular curvatures, this is an open question. So, where there were some also decent works. So, my answer is that one needs some approximation results, and I'm not sure that they are already there. So, maybe somebody from the audience knows that better. Bit off thanks. So there is a question by Jan, please. Hello. I have a question. So is there some discrete version of Keller manifolds and of Keller identities that would involve this discrete Laplacian? Keller manifolds. There was a work by Timit Ipanov. Timiti Panov. Dimitri Panov, I can write in the chat about discrete solim. I'm trying to get to the chat. So here is the name. So he has written something about disclaimer manifolds. I cannot say exactly if some Laplacian appears there. Appears there. Okay, thank you. Yeah, so discrete can manifest. I'm not a specialist on that, so you should look in the article by panel for asking. Thank you very much. Are there other questions? Comments, yeah, by yeah, yeah, please. Uh Dima? Maybe you said it's not. Maybe sales and diagnosis, but uh can you do something similar for higher genus for higher genus yes so it's I mean there it would be more natural to to look at the hyperbolic is hyperbolic metrics not spherical ones and yes uh so there one should look at the not at the So there one should look at the not at the volume of poly Hitler, but at the volume of certain then Fuchsian manifolds and and and so something in that direction was done by Franco Afilast so I cannot cite any results there but but yeah so for example in the in this in the hyperbolic case you get a positive signature Positive signature. It's yes, it's a very nice picture. In the spherical case, you get one negative eigenvalue and the rest is non-negative. In the Euclidean case, you get some kernel, and so it's quite parabolic. So it's hyperbolic in the spherical case, and it's elliptic in the hyperbolic case. So that's the situation. Okay, thank you. There does not seem to be other questions in the audience. So then let us thank the speaker again. Thank you. And we have a break for eight minutes.
