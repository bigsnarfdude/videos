Inviting me to join you with this talk. Well, the whole topic of this program sounds very interesting to me as well. And so, what I'm going to talk about is Is a little bit of a history and mostly motivation of why we started doing what that produces the results that you are going to see. And maybe more importantly, that for a number of years as it is. it is usual thing in mathematics we were doing I was doing this because it looked interesting just some sort of inner mathematical interest you feel that something there is something in it There is something in it. But after a while, it comes time when you start asking: so, where does it go and whether it has any place in a bigger picture? And what is this bigger picture? This bigger picture and this sort of questions. I think that at some point everyone has to ask this sort of questions. It is not just our personal interest that we are doing, but we are part of some bigger system. Okay, so for me, this story starts with interest in In Morley categoricity theorem and what sorry okay so in and the developments that that followed so in the beginning it looked like a great theorem but Ethereum was and in its Ethereum with end in itself. And its connection to a bigger picture for a while didn't look too inspiring. And I remember some of my colleagues then back in Novosibirsk where we joined this. The community of people who developed interest to this technology and this great result. So some of the people were saying that, well, now it is all over. It is the end of this story. The theorem is proved, and in this generality, what else can you find interesting? Can you find interesting? I think it is some interesting fact that that's the way some of us often think. But then it started to occur that actually the fact that this theory had The theory had very few meaningful examples. And in fact, the only meaningful example that was known in the beginning was the theory of algebraically closed field of a fixed characteristic. And then, of course, thinking about it a bit later, one realizes that it doesn't That it doesn't have to be the field itself. Everything that you can build from this object, from algebraically closed field, everything which is interdefinable with it has basically the same properties. And when you try to apply all the notions developed in the theory to the subject, then you realize that. You realize that you enter it very rich domain of absolute algebraic geometry. Absolute, of course, meaning that algebraic geometry over algebraically closed fields. Later, some people found a way also to see how arithmetic algebraic geometry also can be. Is can be extracted out of this context, at least some of it. And this was with the development of Richer theory around Morley categories theorem, and this was, of course, stability theory. And actually, it was quite a big surprise. Quite a big surprise to people there that the route that Shalach took to do generalizations. That's something that looked like, you know, just what is the point of generalizing something meaningful? But generalization is something that kind of Incremental, maybe some people would think. But it turned out that what Shellach was doing was not incremental at all, that he introduced so many great ideas and so much better understanding of the theory that it really became a very rich subject, of course, as you know. As you know. And it had this effect on understanding certainly some aspects of true algebraic geometry. Okay, then there came a thought of, right, so if the first order categoricity theory is Theory is something which is in some way adequate to algebraic geometry, then we can think about... So what is algebraic geometry from this point of view? It is something that has all these features that we find in much more That we find in much more general context of model theory of first-order categorical theories. And if we think about as model theorists on extending these sort of ideas, these geometric ideas, then what is a notion? What is the notion of that that what is the direction of how you extend model theory in a way that leads to extension of algebraic geometry to analytic geometry? And it's also a very good question in understanding what really analytic means because. Because we know that there is complex analytic geometry, there is non-Archimedean analytic geometry, there is some formal analytic theory that people play with. So, from a logical point of view, what is analytic? And you see the question mark here. Question mark here. So, what is the appropriate model theory that goes with it? And of course, nowadays we have a sort of answer to this, maybe not full answer, but very good suggestion for an answer. And And well, I think it is safe to believe that what has been developed as Shellach's categoricity and stability theory for abstract elementary classes is actually the answer to these questions. And more specifically, More specifically, well, I think that in this audience I don't have to explain what L omega 1 omega is, but here is the slide that I prepared for somewhat other talk. Yeah, but more specifically, in fact, there is some Some meaning in trying to be more precise inside Shellac's stability theory and try to see your theories in the context of L Omega 1 omega languages. And the reason for this The reason for this is that this language is very appropriate if you try to formulate at least basic topological notions. And so, for example, if you want to describe the fundamental group of Of variety, then, well, we know it is finely generated, finely presented group, and there is always very nice omega 1, omega formula to describe such a structure. And many more topological Topological objects that could look more complicated than this can be described in this way. Now, of course, we have been working also in other languages and still the context of abstract elementary classes remains very important. And also, you hopefully could. Hopefully, could see this through this talk. Yeah, and then there is this basic example from which it is a very good point to start to think about possible examples and questions that you can ask about this. And so, this canonical kind of and very simple object, well, very simple as long as you know what exponenti on the complex numbers is and what its properties are. So, it is really very instructive kind of example, but it turned out. But it turned out that to understand this structure, there are several intermediate steps that you have to take. And in each of the steps, you have to analyze a certain kind of structure and see for this structure to For this structure to have the properties that you expect. Okay, and let me remind you what properties we do expect. And it is really interesting to ask ourselves why we would expect these properties to hold. And of course, And of course, what we want, we want some obviously non-elementary theory, some maybe L omega 1 omega or stronger language theory that can describe this structure in its cardinality uniquely up to isomorphism. Well, which of course we call it categorical. Of course, we call it categorical in its power. And this is logically, of course, very important property, but not only for logicians, but also as a property that mathematicians should care about. It is It is uniqueness of a model of a theory. And a few years ago, I found out that in the beginning of the 20th century, physicists, including Einstein, Einstein were deeply interested in understanding this sort of categoricity for physical theories. They discussed this, of course, in mainly philosophical terms. They called this theories univocal, that can talk about The objects of the theory or the huge structures that the universes that they study as being described as unique structures that satisfy this description. Okay, so and now you see that one intermediate is especially Intermediate is especially important, intermediate structure turns out to be so-called cover structure. So, roughly speaking, what is a cover structure? So, we have our algebraic variety, complex algebraic variety, and well, assuming it is a smooth variety, and there is a classical notion, a topological notion of universal. Universal covering space for such a structure. And now we look at this very simple structure that consists of two sorts. And here is the sort that we usually endure with predicates that talk about Zariski closed side. The risky closed subset of Cartesian powers. And in fact, except for this map, we don't have to put anything on you, at least for the beginning, because it is quite interesting by itself how much of the structure can be lifted from here to here. From here to here, and how much information we can get out of this structure. But in fact, it is more appropriate, and by the way, it was Michael Gavrilovich's suggestion to think about this cover structures. With all its so you initially you think you are interested in your algebraic variety X, but it is very appropriate to consider all its unramified covers. And you have intermediate cover structures. Cover structures. So everything here should be commuting. And in this way, you get more information. And this is a very classical picture that is being considered by geometers. And this is essentially the picture that we would be interested in. Well, except that speaking more in more details, you will see that it is not very simple picture. You see, the problem is that what is the field of definition of all the algebraic structures that you see here. That you see here. So you have a field of definition of this X, and then the field of definition of this covers could be somewhat bigger, could be finite extensions of this field. So how you incorporate these finite extensions into your language? Would you introduce constant symbols for Constant symbols for these extensions as well, or you want only the constant symbols that are in the basic field of definition. This is actually quite important question, and this question is fully resolved if you accept Grotendik. Grotendic construction of this part of structure. I wrote something about this and it takes a lot of time to work out details. In fact, just to translate what is known by people People for many years for algebraic geometers. Anyway, in our context, namely, the context can simply be this: that if you have rational points on X, then the whole of those Grotendy constructions. Grotendi constructions can be simplified, and instead of the slattest of structures, you can have a simple tower. And in this tower, everything would be defined over the same base field, the field of definition of x. Of X. So you don't have to be very concerned with this sort of questions. However, it is also useful to understand that this reasonably simple picture has a lot of structure and information in it. And in particular, there are this. There are these finite groups, the deck groups acting on the covers. And you can lift all these deck groups upstairs. And this would give you, in case that this is a proper topological cover, when you lift all these groups, you get These groups. You get actually a topological fundamental group. If you use a profinite construction in the spirit of Grotendieck, then you have a profinite completion of a topological fundamental group. And for profound completion of this picture, the results are absolutely different. So it is very, very essential that we work with. essential that we work with that we assume here that we work with with proper topological cover of complex variety right now the the main claim of of today is that this this structure This structure actually holds a lot of information about the metric topology, or maybe better to say, Hausdorff topology that complex algebraic variety has on it. But at the same time, it is stable in Shalas sense. So it is stable. Well, that would be specific theorems for each case. Once we prove categoricity result, then according to Shellac's theory, this implies stability. And in this context that we are discussing, We are discussing today. Stability also means stability is important because it gives you a feel of extension of algebraic geometry to this analytic context. And this is in a way opposite. In a way, opposite to the way that a minimality would deal with this sort of structures. Of course, I'm not meaning to say that ob-minimality is less important in this context, but But it is just a different direction in which we want to extend our algebra geometric vision. Okay, and so now I'll try to be more precise with this claim. With this claim. Okay, so the important point that we should have in mind is that in the Grotenik setting, we would consider this picture. In fact, cutting out the Cutting out the top level, just this level of algebraic structures in the context of ethyl topology and in this context when we see two algebraic varieties which Algebraic varieties which are equivalent in this et al. topology context, then it is in fact the same as to say that these two structures are first-order equivalent. And because these are structures over algebraically closed field, Algebraically closed field, then being first-order equivalent means that there is an field automorphism that takes one of the structure to another. They are conjugated by an automorphism. So when they are over number fields, for example, then they are Galois conjugated. And so So it is useful to remember it through. Okay, so now some history and I think that many of you have seen this sort of results that That claim that this cover structures, many of the cover structures, so the cover structures where the covering is realized by exponentiation is the one that was first discussed around two thousand. Then also people looked at the cover of elliptic curves. Looked at the cover of elliptic curves, also the covers of abelian varieties, more recently the cases of the covers which are hyperbolic spaces. And so J-invariant would be the covering map. And more general cases. And so a general statement. So, a general statement is that one can really write down some sort of when I say natural, it means more or less explicit omega 1, omega sentence, which describes this cover. And the sentence gives you a categorical Categorical abstract elementary class. So, what is important here is that this natural sentence also means that you find out and you write down a lot of important information that went into your proofs. Went into your proofs. And proofs require, of course, the general Scheller's theory of abstract elementary classes, and some of it is quite non-trivial. I am going to mention some later. Plus, some strong arithmetic theorems of the kind that like That, like Mamfortate conjectures, for example, for exponentially, this sort of Mamfortate conjecture is a very simple one. It is a Dedekind theorem that tells you that the Galois action on torsion. On torsion points of algebraically closed field is the same as just automorphism group of as automorphisms of the group structure of torsion points. And for the case of abelian varieties, this already is more a much more recent Much more recent, quite not trivial theorem of SER. And for J Invariant. So in the initial version, Adam Harris, and as far as I know, in more general Sebastian Etirovich did. did go around the this the need of understanding the special points of corresponding varieties but eventually if you want to consider this natural l omega one omega theory in One omega theory in the language that I just described, in the language of the base field, then you have to understand the action of Gallo group on torsion points. And this is a very interesting question that goes into the Artinary. The Arcten reciprocity law and more recent results. So, with CRISTO, we worked hard to understand these cases just for Shimura, well, actually, for modular curves, even. Okay, and so and of course also Extensions of Galois and Kumer series, and also these are quite strong results. So, for example, the necessary commerce theory for abelian variety was constructed just 15 years ago. 15 years ago by Larson, if I'm not mistaken. So it's quite strong statements. And here you see some of the names who worked on this. And maybe I missed some then. Sorry. And Yes, but what is also quite striking for which was quite striking for people who worked on these issues is that the arithmetic facts that you have to learn while you work on it, they're not just They're not just there to prove your theorems, but in fact, they give you content of your theorems. In other words, these arithmetic facts are sufficient and also necessary. And you can formulate it in the form that if you manage to prove by some Prove by some mysterious reasons that the natural theory is categorical without knowing this fact, then such facts would follow from this categoricity statement. But of course, we don't know such proofs. Still, it gives you some Gives you some some ideas right now most recently the question turned itself into something more philosophical. As I said, As I said, so the just the inner interest in studying the structure at some point comes to some, you come to some saturation point, or rather the point when the following steps becomes too hard. And so you just have to ask. And so you just have to ask whether your investment in the next step of along this program, whatever this program should be, is worth it. And you have to ask, you know, what is it that you are doing? And what sense in big picture, as I mentioned, can it make? Can it make? Well, first of all, again, where is the end of this road? And now you have some natural question to answer. Is it, should we expect that this sort That this sort of theorems will continue on, of course, if we put enough efforts in their proofs. So should we expect that for any smooth complex algebraic variety with some assumption on its cover? Because if the cover, for example, Because if the cover, for example, is trivial, if the variety itself is equal to its universal cover, which happens with many important varieties. So, as far as I understand, for example, calabilla. Then, for example, Calabio do have this property. Well, so you really have to consider something more general than just a cover structure, something similar, but maybe more general. And of course, you And of course, you would then ask for some non-triviality. So should we always expect a statement about categoricity? Now, it turns out that there is some evidence that something like this should be the case. And this is the theorem that is now published. Is now published at some two years old. Well, it turns out that, for example, if you have projective complex curves of genus at least one, then Then there is, well, we cannot be sure that there is L omega 1 omega sentence, but there certainly is L omega 1 omega Q with this quantifier saying that there is at least uncountably many realizations of a given formula. And this question And this question, Mark, means that we have no information whatsoever, the way that the theorem is proved about how this formula looks like. But there is such a sentence which gives you a categorical description of a cover of such X. Of such X. Okay, it gives you some sort of hope that along this route there could be more and more similar results. Although these results could be much more harder. And interestingly, how much harder. Well, still, still. Well, still, still, it is a very good question why really it is the case that there should be L Omega 1, Omega Axiomatization of arbitrary enough algebraic varieties. Why should we expect it? What are the geometrical algebraic reasons for this? I don't have an answer to this. Don't have an answer to this as of now. Right, so the proof actually uses some technology from ominimality. So in the proof, I embed this cover structure into o minimal context and And studied using o minimal definability and some results from the theory. And then at the final stage, I use this very deep theorem of the part. Yeah, the part of this theory of abstract elementary classes, of course, based also on a lot of things that Schallach has done in this theorem of five authors about quasi-minimal structures. And that's limits of this theory which Theory, which put the limits to the generality of this theorem. So, because the theorem hasn't been extended to cases which are high-dimensional than one-dimensional quasi-minimality. One-dimensional quasi-minimality structure. So the results, there are some statements, but the results are much weaker than this statement. Okay, now the next question is that what is the general mathematical meaning of the categoricity? The categoricity statement. I'm checking my time. I think I still have some 10-15 minutes. So, what is the mathematical meaning of categories statements if we produce ones? Right. And here is a more recent theorem. I just submitted it the other day. day uh it is uh it is it is actually published uh uh on archive uh but uh the the most latest version I haven't put on archive yet anyway so what what is this uh theorem um uh is about uh so uh suppose we have an uh uh uh abelian variety or a Shimura variety. Or a Shimura variety over finitely generated field, so parameters A, so finitely many parameters A. Doesn't have to be finitely many, but in fact we always have finitely many. And sigma is just an automorphism of the field of complex numbers. The field of complex numbers. Now we look first at this variety and its cover. And suppose that, like it is the case for abelian varieties, I claim it is always the case that we can write down some, not very numerous, but some. Not very, but some categorical statement. For Shimura varieties, we know it only in limited cases. But suppose that we can have a categorical L omega 1 omega sentence and now look at the conjugate of this variety by. Of this variety by this automorphism. Well, of course, the conjugate of this variety is just, it is enough just to apply sigma to parameters and you will have new equations to define your variety. Find your variety, and so it is a very simple construction. But what happens with a cover is not clear at all because cover is constructed by topological reasons, not by algebraic ones. But suppose we also have a lucky and have a categorical statement for this one. For this one. And now we compare these two statements. And it can happen that this statement can be obtained from this just by changing the interpretation of parameters. Of parameters according to what this automorphism tells us. Just, in fact, it is the same statement if you use abstract constant symbols. It is the same statement, but the interpretation in the field of complex numbers would be different of these symbols. So, suppose this situation happens. Once this situation happens, then the claim is that these two complex algebraic varieties are in fact topologically isomorphic. And being topologically isomorphic, you see the only topological isomorphism of a field of complex numbers is complex conjugation. So you have to expect that this is the case. This is the case. So either you have a biholomorphic isomorphism between this and this, or you have a biholomorphic isomorphism between this conjugated by automorphism and conjugated by complex conjugation. So this is the only thing that can happen. So in other words, this This omega one omega sentence contains a complete topological invariant of this complex variety. And so it is, of course, it demonstrates that it is much more powerful than characterization of this structure in This structure in algebraic terms or in terms of etile topology, which can only give you the characterization up to this sort of conjugation by automorphism. Okay, so now, well, I think that this is for me, it is. For me, it is a really interesting fact, the fact that really kind of suggests that in complicated situations, your topological invariant could be Could be, has to be actually described not in terms of this algebraic topology, which is complicated enough by itself, but maybe the form of L omega 1 omega sentences, maybe the L omega 1 omega sentences of some nice structure, but Nice structure. But so you can take this form of description of topological invariance as a kind of your working system of topological invariance. But now it is interesting also to look at it as a At it from the point of view of a kind of a complementary problem. So we can look at the situation somewhat differently and ask ourselves this, that, okay, so we have, say, algebraic variety. So I omitted parameters here, it doesn't matter. Here, it doesn't matter. And suppose that we do have a categorical sentence for this one. Now we apply sigma to X and so knowing that X could be categorically described, the Described, the cover of X could be categorically described. Can we somehow deduce that its conjugate has the same property? And if it has, then how this one is different from this one, how one gets from here to here. So this. So this seems to be a simple and natural question, but let's see what we know in practice. It turns out that in practice it is quite known problem. So first there comes some in history well I don't know Uh, well, I don't know, it is probably sometimes in the 1970s that CER produced an example of when you have exactly this situation with sigma being even a Galois, not general automorphism. Automorphism. And this sentence, this sentence is essentially different from this sentence. Different in what? That even the description of fundamental group, this pi1 is a fundamental group, so can become different in the conjugated variety. In the conjugated variety. So, something is going on there. Now, sometime in 1970, Kashdan produced the following theorem, that if you start with a so-called arithmetic variety, well, in fact, arithmetic variety is a Shmur variety, but just taken abstractly. So, you have the have some sort of covering space where GLR acts and then there is an arithmetic subgroup and that's why it is called arithmetic variety. You get it by the quotienting this covering space by this arithmetic subgroup. And so the statement is And so the statement is that if you start with this variety and you apply, so it is always over a number field, and you apply a Galois conjugation, then you get similar variety, but the gamma could still be a bit different. And now there is also Langland. Also, Langland actually found a generalization of Karstan theorem. And this is called Langland's conjecture on conjugated Shimora varieties. So the statement of it is the following: that you start with a Shumuro variety, X, and And Lagland listed, gave a list of invariants. So in fact, it is topological invariants, although some of them look like arithmetic invariants. And we know from our experience that in this omega one omega formulas, you have a lot of mixture of topological and some other. Some other invariants that look like arithmetic, but in fact, that's the disguise of topological invariance. So it is quite complicated list of invariants. And then he suggested what happens, how this becomes Becomes gets into for the conjugated variety. So, this was proved, but it is also interesting what Langlands took it. First of all, he made quite a point about this. You see, so even formulation, it is quite a long paper. It is quite a long paper where he formulated this statement, and he had a subtitle that it is a fairy tale kind of formulation for him. And you see from this quotation that it was very difficult to formulate what we What we would call this L omega 1 omega formula. So he worked a lot on formulation of this with several failed attempts. But eventually he did it. And you see, we don't, well, I don't know of any more general statements. Any more general statements of this kind. But in model theoretically, of course, this sort of problem that I just formulated in the previous slide, this complementary problem, is very easy to formulate by itself because once you don't go into details. And I think it is quite interesting point. Interesting point, and that's where I think I finish. Thank you. Thank you very much. Are there any questions for us? Hi, Boris. That was nice. So, in this last part, where you're talking about Last part, where you're talking about Langland's invariance. Do you have a specific concrete way of converting the invariance that he's suggesting into logical formulas, null, omega, one, omega, two? Just that he has invariants and you have ideas. Curious, is there a way to convert what he's doing into audio? Well, the quality of sound is. Well, the quality of sound is very bad. Sorry. Could you repeat, please? Sure. I'm waiting. Just a moment. We will just unfold. I think the mics are here. So I'll stand up. Sorry about this. All right. So, what I was asking is whether these invariants that Langlands was talking about, whether you know how to Whether you know how to convert them into formulas, into something that you can express in your language, or whether you're telling us about this as a challenge to look at geometry and see whether we can make it into logic. Well, maybe the way that I really understand the well, because of this quality of sound. Well, because of this quality of sound, sorry. Well, let me say something. So you see, we have some experience of what this sort of formulas should look like. You know, I use this formula. This formulation, it is important that I say that there is a natural sentence, L omega 1 omega sentence. And well, there is no clear definition of what natural means, but intuitively and practically, it means that It means that you want to find some natural, maybe even topologically natural axioms that describe your structure categorically. And here, it is what is important here also is that many times. Many times we found that if you miss something in your natural description, so say you think you are lucky, you know some properties, you found from some literature some properties, and you start with these properties and formulate some L omega one omega sentence. And when you start proving this theorem, you see that something is lacking, and the theorem doesn't go through. And then you find out that you need something more. And this leads you to some statements that look like natural statements. But it is very difficult to be more precise here. Difficult to be more precise here. Still, I hope that a model theoretic, just a very general model theoretic classification theory principles. So we do have a lot of experience in this classification principles and these classification principles, they actually show that there are not very much Not very much the structures around that is being used in our classification theory. And this gives you a hope that at the end of the day, something like what should be a natural L omega 1 omega sentence, maybe, maybe, well, something is working. Well, something is working somewhere in the end of this program. But no, it is very difficult to say. But just to use this occasion, I should also mention that there are actually very complicated topological invariants like Invariants like I don't really know anything about it, but one can try and understand what Gromov-Witten invariants, for example, are. And there is a lot of ways of looking at these invariants. There is an arithmetic description of some of these, and then there is a purely geometric. Geometric, or well, in terms of real geometry description of this. And so, working in this direction could be just step-by-step approaching this answer to this question, if I understood the question correctly. Thank you for a very detailed answer. Are there any other questions? If not, then thanks again to the speaker and we shall resume.
