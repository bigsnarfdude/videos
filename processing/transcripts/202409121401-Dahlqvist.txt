Thank you, Paul. So thank you very much to the organizers for the invitation and for this very nice workshop and make this happen in person. I will talk about an object that we saw in the In the presentation of how the Young-Mills measure. But I want to study, I don't want to discuss here the construction of the subject really. I will give a definition. What I want to study is some properties of it. When you change the group, there in this talk he had a compactly group. A compactly group, and what I want to do is to consider groups of large dimensions. Okay. If you didn't attend to this talk or you don't remember, so yeah, the topic of the talk will be related to broaden motion on a complex group. But possibly pinned in some way. So it could be a broadened bridge, brown and loop, or it could be yeah. Or it could be a kind of Brunen bridges condition in a way that depends on the topology. And I want to study these Bruno bridges when n go to plus infinity, when n can think about the dimension of the group, go to plus infinity. Okay. So the recent results I want to discuss are Want to discuss our joint works with Thibault Lemoine, who is now at postdoc in Strasbourg. Okay, and the aim a bit of this presentation here is to make contact a bit with another set of results obtained by people to By people doing hyperbolic geometry, and I would like to set everything up in a kind of finite-dimensional setting where I allow myself to talk about different groups. So I want to do a probability on what's called a character variety. What's called a character variety, and I want to think about it when the dimension of this space is high. Okay, so in this talk there will be a fixed group gamma and this fixed group will be always kind of a group of loops in some space. And then there will be another group, DN, which will be Which will be something that you can that comes on top, and you hope to get some information about gamma by taking your obstation in Gn okay so we if you remember the talk of Thomas so you have this developing map of paths and yeah so you can develop it in the in a unitary group You can develop it in a set of rough paths and signature. So, this is kind of this object. Okay. And I want to low myself here to consider classical compacted groups or finite groups. And I want to send this. I want to send the size of the group to infinity in some way. So the space I want to look at is the space of representation of my group gamma. So into GN, so the set of morphism from gamma, group morphism from gamma to GN. And so the the proper space to Proper space to where people worked a lot, so in differential geometry or algebraic geometry or in algebra, is to think about the quotient of this set by the adjunct action of Gn. So you say that two morphisms are equivalent if there exists a fixed G in the group Gn such that Such can obtain the first from the second by conjugating. No, right. Okay, so that's the character part. Okay, and the question I want to look at is what happened if, so I assume that Gn is a concrete set of matrices, and you're given some probability measure in this space. I let's denote by xn the random variable on my probability space, chi n. And I want to study somehow at the character. So I want to take the trace of my matrix and I want to study that in a regime where I divide by n and hope for the best. My n goes to pleasantly. Best, my hand goes to pleasant me. That's the question. And I will give some answers for different gammas and different G's and discuss what's not known and the consequences of this kind of result. Okay, so the way I want to think about it is rather Is rather, I want to work with a random variable xn, which is an actual homomorphism, not working on the quotient. Take a random variable in this space, and I want them to be involved in the biconjuggiation. Question? So that's Question. So that's the question you can ask. So, what is the main sort of example that you have in mind for the Yeah, the aim of the next slides is to give a yeah. By the add map, you just mean like conjugation, not the add map on the Lie algebra. No, okay, conjugation. Okay. Um so in the context of uh 2D animals, so this was uh the thing. The thing physicists were looking at were this object was called the Wilson loop. And yeah, the set of questions, conjectures somehow were gathered by Isador Singer in 27. Okay. So including Yeah, so that's I don't know when I'll so hopefully in 15 minutes we will be talking about it. So first let's start with two kind of groups so we'll talk about first the free group gamma F R. Uh F uh R, it's a it's a set of uh of words in R letters and their inverse, where you say that two words are equivalent if you can obtain them by adding or deleting the two letters, two consecutive letters of the form A A minus one. You can also think about it as the About it as a group of loops, the fundamental group of a decay with R petals. And the other group will be, so by one, the fundamental group of closed orientable surface of genus G fixed here. I will also I will also somehow, and the aim is to go in the middle, starting with also a free group. So, what's realized in a special way when you have a graph which is embedded in sigma-g, by that I mean that you can realize sigma-g as a C double E complex, and the graph is a skeleton of the of this complex. Of this complex. And this will be the setting of 2D Young MILS, where you load yourself really not. So these are finitely generated groups. And now let me go to the continuum. So if you fix now a metric on sigma g you can You can consider the say the big group which is a set of loops which have a finite length and which are considered up to parameterization and you can question that to make that group okay so So, if you know the signature, somehow you can relate that to the fact that you can say that two loops are equivalent if they have the same signature. Otherwise, and more topologically, you can say that two loops are equivalent if they are homotopic within their own range. That's the set of gamma I will consider. Of gamma, I will consider. Yes. Say what the group action, what the group operation would be in the yeah, and on loops. So if you have, so here, to make it a bit lighter, I didn't specify a base point. So these are really base loops, and I have to pick a base point. And then, so there And then, so the operation is the concatenation of use. Alright, so I said it already. I want to consider classical matrix Lee group. So concretely, I will consider the intrigue group, the orthogonal group, the compact symptom group, the special imiterary group, and the permutation group. Computation group. That will be my final. So, what is the question? Well, the question that I saw you, if you have your random vivo, your random morphism from gamma to g n you have a matrix which is always in this case E theory, you can diagonalize it. There's n eigenvalues on a circle. Eigenvalues on a circle, and you look at the mean of the eigenvalues of this matrix. So somehow you say something about the empirical measure of the eigenvalues of the spectrum of the matrix. So if you manage to do that, then you will actually show that you. Actually, show that you have a weak convergence of this measure. So, when you talk about pernotation, it's more concrete. So, here, well, the trace is permutation accounts for the number of pit spots. So, now let's answer the question. Now, let's answer the question of examples of random variables. So, the easiest case will be the free case where you have a relation work with the free group of rank R. But for that, let me say that, well, you also have a natural, very natural case whenever gamma is finitely general. Is finitely generated and your group is finite, this set is finite. You just need to specify the value of the morphism on the generator of the group. And there are just finitely many choices. So this set is finite. And you can check that the uniform random variable on this set is indeed invariant in the Is indeed invariant in the by conjugation. So that's a good candidate to work. That's the first example that works for any gamma, which is finitely generated, and g n which is finite. So for instance, yeah, the set of results I want to discuss is with Gamma I is by one. Is with gamma i is by one so magic. And in this case, so you can build, you can do a random geometry somehow. So whenever you have a morphism from the fundamental group, you can build a random surface by considering the cover, the n-sheated cover associated. So if you give yourself a morphism from gamma to Sn, you give yourself an action of gamma to the set 1n and yeah, you can portion this product by the diagonal action of gamma. Okay, this is the random object you can say things about then because. Then looking at the traces. Okay. So let me now give you an example when gamma is the free group. Okay. So in that case, it's quite so it's also similar. So it's also similar. So you, well, in the finite case, when Gn is finite, you can apply what I just said before. But when Gn say is a compactly group, well you can remark that, well, this set is just your group Gn two raised to the power R. Raised to the 4R. Okay. Spawns this. So it's a compactly group. You can take the harmony on it. And the harm measure on the product is nothing but the rule of R-independent harm measures on GN. Okay. So you sample R-independent random matrices? are independent random matrices and you want to form words in them and look at the trace of these words. So this kind of, so here we have a word in three letters and so here you have a random matrix and so the law of it is called the word measure. You can do that for any compact figure and you have a lot of them. And you have a lot of interesting questions related to that. So namely, so you want to know given this random variable, what can you say about the word? Can you make the difference between two words? So this has been the topic of a lot of words which have been initiated and partially with So, with some success, by Doran Coudat, who is so the question is this question: so, if you give yourself, you say you fix a group sequence of Gn and you give yourself Lu of all this, of all the Xn, evaluated at this word. And so, can you, and now you give yourself another word. Now you give yourself another word. So if you assume that the two random variables are the same low, can you say that the two words are kind of the same, that is, can be obtained by an automorphism of the group? That's the question. So it's not true in general for any group. For UN, it's a sequence of UN. For UN, the sequence of UN is not true. But and it's not known whether you actually it's not the conjecture that if you give yourself all these laws for any complexity group or any finite group, then the two words should be equivalent. But that's yeah, I can't. But that's a conjecture. What is known is to know whether a word is primitive or not. What is a primitive word? It's an element of the free group, which can be completed on the basis of the free group. Okay, so there is, yeah, set up work about this. And that's a motivation for studying this random variables. So now, here is a more complicated object that I will not define here. So when gamma is the fundamental group of a surface, homogeneous G larger or equal to 2, and when your group And when your group Gn is semi-simple, remember that the Lie algebra is equal to any element of the Lie algebra is any bracket of two elements of the Lie algebra, so that's a simple Lie algebra. Then we focus not on the set of morphisms, but on so here you can think of gamma of a morphism. You can think of gamma of a morphism as a rotation, a linear reputation. So, this set is not, in general, a manifold. It's not good to work with this. It's an algebraic variety with some singularities, and it's better to work with the set of irreducible repositories of gamma. So, now if you work So now if you work with this set quotient by diagonal eye transaction the eye transaction, then you can show that this is the work of Atiya and Bot and particularly of Goldman, that this set is a simplectic manifold, finite dimension, and And of finite volume when Gn again is comparatively grouped, which is semi-simple, like SUN. Okay, so when you have a simple T4 and you have a volume and you can consider therefore a natural random variable where you normalized the volume. Okay, and that's what we wanted to look at. What we wanted to look at. And this is called the ATIA BOD-GOL budget. So when you have such a random morphism, again you can construct a random object here and now you quotient the coherent space times the space you act on, so Cn by diagonal action. And so this is So, this is like a random vector bundle, and on it, so you can naturally build a random flat connection. But I want to work with this object. But as well, so you have links where you can say things about the geometry of this set. If you know things about the traces of this. Of this and all this. So the sable plan is the unique colour? Yeah, so that is concretely the unit disk or the plane. Boundover over what you might want to do. So and the bubble is over sigma G R. No. No. So, but so if so, if you think about maybe in a continuous language, which is the language of ITR and bot, so you give yourself a connection, so you think about this elements, so you make a bijection somehow. Or well, you can okay between this set and the flat connections. And then so you can build, so if you give yourself two connections, you can consider the wedge product and you can then take the So, take a trace, this, and you want to have a two-form, a real-value two-form. So, you take the real part and you integrate that. And that's the and you check that it behaves well and they're quotient. So, that's the very rough definition. Okay. So that's the uh omega, the simplified form. Um and it's named after Atia, Bot, and Goldman. Maybe if I have a yeah, seconds I will. I will say a word about one fact which is a bit just a natural question is when you have a simplectic manifold you have a Poisson bracket and you can explicitly describe so you have the set of functions is a algebra and you can explicitly describe Can explicitly describe the Lie bracket of the function trace of Xn gamma. If you give two alpha and beta to loops, you know what is the Libracket of the trace of Xn alpha and the trace of Xn beta. Yeah, it's and very closely related to. And very closely related to an equation we will see and let you know in a second. Okay. So I was saying 15 minutes, it's right, so we are about to define the youngest measure. Okay, so now take G to be a graph which is embedded in C magic. Again, think about you have a CW complex. The total space is sigma, is a surface of genus G, closed or interval. And so you can describe, you can give or presentation of this group in different ways. And let me so give one. So we're taking so I I label the the faces and so see I have R faces. So see I have R aces and I take a root vertex in my graph and now here is a claim in the textbook of algebraic simple algebraic topology that you can choose the base of loops which are Which are lassoes, namely, you fix your root in your graph, they call it V, and for each face, each place you can choose the lasso is with that face is a loop, which is following a path up to the boundary of the face, then turning around. Then turning around the face, respecting the orientation, and then going back according to the same path. That's a lasso. Claim is you can find R a lasso for each face and 2G of the loops such that so the fundamental group of this graph is This graph is given by the generated by this loops, quotiented by the title product of all lasso is equal to this product of commutators. The commutator is the existing audience. Okay. So that's um and take that as a given if you don't know it. So okay and just look at it as a as a group again we are just changing and it's not not hard to see with this prostation that this is a free group and that's a basis for that quite since is given by all this All these letters, but one, if you remove one of the L's, and you can check that well, this 3D is a free basis of that. It has a rank 2G plus R minus 1. Okay. So now comes the heat kernel and the drawing motion. So, what you want to do somehow is So, what you want to do somehow is to interpolate when you have the group like this frustation, you can somehow add or remove the relation by adding a heat candle weight. So first, so here we have our free group, so we can we have the merger on it, okay. I told you can take the merger coming from the HAL merger product. Product. So a first random variable, but it's not new, is to take independent this as independent random variables on improve. But I want something which takes into account of the topology, of the fact that this is embedded. And so let me choose my favorite semicrop on GN. Okay, and so for instance, let me choose the heat catalog on my group. But I want, it's not like in the talk, last talk up this morning, I want a semi-group, a heat kernel which is a class function. Which is a class function. So I want a metric which is both left and right in lines. And this plays a key role in a property of the definition which is about to come. So let me fix now a time or a parameter for each space and I want to consider a measure which has a weight related to Related to my heat kernel. So for amorphism H, I choose A, and for a vector A, so which assigns, somehow assigned each face, I define the functionh as a product of the heat kernels, so one heat kernel per face, and I evaluate at the value, the image of The image of the lasso of the base, and I take the well, at the time of the parameter of truth. Okay, so this you can think about it like, yeah, naturally if you look at the the joint now the measure I want to consider is this one. You well, you weight the R measure by this function. The R measure by this function. And you normalize it. Okay. You can define this for any kernel actually at that point. It does make sense. The problem is that this is not really canonical if this depends on the choice of basis you take. So if you want this to be independent of the choice of propestation of Choice of proposition of this group, then you need to impose that PA is a class function. And then you need to impose that you have a left and right moment metric on your pro. Okay. Questions ask? Ask the equation LI is LF type. What is it? What type of L I is oh yeah, oh yeah. This is a change of position. This is a F or you find the power in G so the morphisms between pi 1 G and G. Between pi 1 G and G n is isomorphic between G to the 2G plus R minus 1. So what is the power? Yeah, it's the same, it's a rank that you see here. Yeah, so it's the number of generators of this frequency. Yeah, but like what is it like a I'm trying to understand what that group is like. Well is this the the really the Cartesian product of G. Oh okay. Is a cartogen product of a cheese? Oh, okay. Yes. Great. Yeah. So, yes, this is quite a poll, so it maybe looks dreadful. But yeah, if you take a virus, let me take say a torus. Say Torres makes realize as a gluing of two triangles just to make sure the one is wrong. Here I can take this say as my first loop, this as my second loop, okay, and here I have This is xy. Here you have that L1 L2 is equal to y and the power I have on that. So if I fix The area here to be A1 and the area there to be A2. Motor, I'm working here on a motor on G to the three. So X, I have three elements to generate that group, X Y and L one, say. And I find so my weight is so there is one weight but per each kernel let me call the parameter parameter for L1 gamma and the parameter for X and Y alpha and beta Um so here uh I have um so I have two faces for the first face I have the disk weight, the heat kernel evaluated at image of two, but I denote by gamma. Then I have the second loop, um second loop, but uh I so I chose to I so I chose the priorist thing in terms of L1, X, and Y. So L2 is L1 minus 1, X, Y. They're yours. Sorry, X Y. And that's a measure that I consider, and I need to normalize it. This K4 sample so you see it looks like the time. You see it looks like the the time marginal indeed uh of a bridge, uh but again with a terminal condition even by a given law corresponding to the competitor. Um so and here, so for instance, here, what is that? That is the integral of this respect. That is the integral of this respect to, say, gamma first, alpha and beta. But if you integrate with respect to gamma first, you see a well, a convolution. So Z, if you have a convolution semi-group, Z is actually not depending on A1 and A2. It's depending just on the sum of them. And this is a number that's my partition function. And my claim is that this is true for this simple. This simple fact here we just had two faces. The fact that this actually doesn't depend really on the way I cut it. The fact that I had two faces, I just could have taken one. It's true for general to take any graph. This number doesn't depend on the really embedded graph, just depends on the Graph just events on the surface and on the total volume. Okay. And somehow the same argument tells you that all these measures with different gammas, different graphs are all compatible. So somehow you don't need to do a difficult stochastic analysis to define a murder on a With but still, you need to do some work if you want to work with a continuous subject. And all right, so you take now the set of old loops of finite loop up to reduction. Then you can show, and that's a result in 2000, that there exists a measure on chi n with a symmetry called sigma field, such that whenever you restrict the measure to the loops which are embedded in a graph, the measure you have is the one we just defined, but with the areas given by the volume of the face. The volume of the face with the fixed metric you have. Um so that's uh yeah, that's a theorem to try to go to space of loops, of finite length, and also to check that this is invariant when you you take equalities on this space. Space under homotopy, which homotopy within the same range. So that's a theorem which is not so easy to prove. Okay. Out of time. So yeah. What is the large end limit? And I think I have one minute. One minute. So for gamma equal the free group, you have kind of a zero-one law. The limit is one if and only if gamma is well is the true word. And that's due to Voikulisku for UN and for by due to For by a juice bookout or the function group. So let me claim what's known. Now when you go to surface groups and you take the IT abort webmind measure, the same is true, but with the expectation. Alright, so let me Just say here that it's not known how to prove that in probability here. So in this case, we don't know how to prove concentration. We don't know how to get Poincaré inequalities or that would be really helpful. Okay. And this theorem nonetheless has really strong consequences in proving properties of spectral guide. So the answer is. So the answer is simple, but yeah, the consequences are not. Okay. When you take the graph to be with three boundary conditions, so say imagine your graph is just as is within disk, okay, with three boundary conditions. Then this is known since. Then this is known since Philippian. And if you want to work with loops, then this is a work, uh sequence of works uh by Essen Hunter and Kudovich and and and work group of Levi works with any finite length uh loops. Oops, actually correct. Okay. And yeah, and this is characterized by a set of equations that I don't have enough time to recall, which has Michael Enko-Minval equations, but I was told it's a bit of a misnomer because actually it's a people the Kazakhov and Kostov equations, which are in Which are in a 2D realization of my Genkomic data equations. Okay. And, alright, so let me just take the result, the conjecture and the result. So it works for any plane, in the disk or in the plane, so it works for any finite enclosures. That's a result of TILAD. On the sphere, it's a result that we obtained with James Norris. And the answer is different. But it satisfies this same equation. You can describe it somewhere explicitly. It's basically, so here the answer depends on the Here, the answer depends on the total volume. So, you have kind of an explicit answer which is related to the big null log when t is less than pi square, but after pi square, it's not true. And for any surface, so now moving to negative Euler characteristic, we conjecture that Conjecture that the limit is not new. The limit is actually given by whether zero if the loop is not contractible. And if the loop is contractible, then you can get a lift in the lift, say, in the disk and do it with the with with a hyperbolic metric constant curvature so that say you you make it so that the volume of your surface is T and yeah so here you can define the young miss measure you have the object which was shown in the disk case and And yeah, so this is the answer, which is explicit. If your loop is simple in the disk, just find the hyperbolic area which is enclosed. So even though you start it, say, some if you have some very complicated looks on the surface, it will cover. Alright. So we didn't prove that yet. So we didn't prove that yet, um but we proved it in a lot of cases for of loops um which are okay. We don't have all loops okay we know that this is true if this is true for simple class of loops and we know it in the case of another quotient so the flat flat case on the torus if you quotient the If you coshier the plane by z2 or by this exactly to have a volume t, the same result holds true. The limit is given by what you had on the plane, on the fundamental cover. Okay, and I have time, so thank you for your attention. Questions? If you're happy to say, what's missing to get from where you are to the conjecture? So, yeah, so this is mainly, well, this kind of loops where you need to really use the function. To really use the fact that the property of your loop as a fact that it is a geodesic show that the trace, normalized trace, goes to zero. So this is what is missing now, and which has, and when you look at the expectation, and when you look at the zero volume case, this The zero volume case, this has been proved. So, what is missing now is actually now we could prove that if we had ostrich. So, if we are able here to give new Poincaré inequality, this is true. So, is it true meeting expectations somehow? The thing is that this theorem is not true if you just have expectation. So, and the reason is the form of the Mike and Komindal equations, Kostov, Kazakh, Kostov, Mike and Komindal equations, which are involving a product. So, you have an equation which relates so some kind of derivative of the loop. Your loop. Okay, let me phrase it this way. So you deform your loop in some way and you differentiate with respect to the parameter of the differentiation. And then you get expectation of the product of two other loops. And that's a problem. That's somehow the issue when you don't have concentration. Um here to just just inform, it's product of two phrases. Okay. Um So that's yeah, if it were the product of the expected product. Yeah, if it were the product of the expected racist. So yeah. That's um don't know that it's factorized. Uh but already I didn't go at the end. I didn't have to. So, but because we are just discussing this, so you have results of concentration when you work with, so there is a work of Hao and with Hong Shan and Chan Shan Zhu about a version of the young miss network where you don't put the weight which is like the heat kernel, but you put the weight which is exponential and time trace of the part n like real. Find real parts of the trace. And this is the weight respect to the harm measure. And you know that on the compact group, you know exactly here with a metric you know exactly what is the rich curvature. And so you can prove a have a you can look at the Blackfield and react theorem there. But to make it work, you need to have a parameter To have a parameter in front of the real part, say beta, which is large enough. And this is equivalent here of taking T, which is large. It doesn't work when T is small. The particle of doesn't work in the case of the Atiabod-Bohma measure. And also, it doesn't work directly with the measure we're looking at, with the heat kernel. So, in that case, you will need information. In that case, you would need information that, well, some of you know way more than you could tell me. You need to have information about the Asian of the log of the heat kernel and to have something which is good when n goes to passing heat. Just a quick reminder.
