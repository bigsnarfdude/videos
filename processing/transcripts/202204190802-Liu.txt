First, I wanted to thank the organizers for the invitation and thank everyone coming to my talk. Today, I'm going to talk about the discrete periodic shooting operator. So, what we're going to study, we're going to study the inverse problem, inverse spectrum problem, which we call Fermi isospectrality. So, let's start with the operators. So, as I mentioned, the So, as I mentioned, they discrete periodical shading operator. We have the standard discrete Laplacian on ZD. So, where the Laplace U at the site N equals all the site U at M prime such that M prime minus N the norm is one. So where the norm is just as a sum of the absolute value of each component. Value of each component. So roughly speaking, when d equals two, so the Laplace at the side n equals all the sum of the four labels. So we also have a periodical potential. So we say a function V is gamma periodic if Vm plus little gamma equals Vm for any n in Zd. Here, Here, the gamma equals the Qmz O plus Q2Z into Qdz. So, roughly speaking, we say a potential V is a periodic is a periodic if in chess direction the function has the period qj. So, to simplify the talk, so I assume all the periods are distinctly prime. So now this is our operator. The discrete periodic shading operator, we have a Laplacian, discrete Laplacian, and we also have the periodic potential. We are interested in the inverse eigenvalue problem. So here is our eigen equation, Laplacian plus V equals lambda. Here, lambda is the eigen. Is the eigenvalue parameter. We also call lambda the energy parameter. And we also have this flow kit block boundary condition, which is given by the following. So um plus qj ej equals e2 pi i k j um here ej is the standard basis in the in R D or Z D. So this formula means that in this direction, But in this direction, after a size, you know, Qj, the eigenfunction changes by a factor U2 pi i kj. So here, kj is called a quasi-momentum. So here, keep it in your mind that we have this eigen equation. We always have this floke-blocked boundary condition, and this condition is very later in the study of periodic shading operator. So we can. So we can introduce the fundamental domain W, so which is here, this is given by the formula here. So each side, each component nj is in, is between 0 and qj minus 1. So easy to say that the cardinality domain is a product of all the periods. So we can try write out the eigen equation. Write out the eigen equation with this boundary condition in the fundamental domain. The fundamental domain is a co-dimensional space. So then one and two can be translated into the eigenvalue problem for a Q by Q matrix. So let me explain it more here because maybe some of you guys are not familiar with the periodic shading operator. So now So now we have let's take it D equals let's take it D equals 2 now we have a fundamental domain here So we have the Q1 side here and the horizontal none we have Q2 side Q2 sides so if I choose a point here then Laplace. You, Laplacian, you know, we have four, we get the sum of four labels, so which is your in this fundamental domain. And the lap and the potential v is just a multiplication operator. So we get a site here, so which is your in this fundamental domain. However, if we choose a site n, which is in the boundary, then the four labels get into this four points. Get into these four points. Unfortunately, this guy gets out of this fundamental domain here. However, by the floor blocked boundary condition, this point can transfer to this point with an extra factor e to pi i k j. So finally, we can write it down by the similar, you know, similarly, we can, you know, for this point and this point, we can also. This point, we can also translate it to this point, right? So, in this way, we can write it down. This operator, eigenvalue, equation one with boundary condition two in the fundamental domain. And the matrix depends on the k. Actually, the matrix depends on E2 pi i k j, right? I just mentioned you by the translation, you can always write it down in the fundamental domain. Write it down in the fundamental domain. So let's see. That's a matrix we call D. So now I'm going to introduce the floor isospectrality problem. So we call two periodic potential, gamma, the V and Y are flow kit isospectral. If for any K these two guys have the same spectrum, since this is a Q by Q. Since this is a q by q matrix, actually which means that it has the, you know, the eigenvalues, right? Which means the eigenvalues are the same. So we call floated isospectron isospectron. So we are also going to introduce the separable functions. We call function v is separable if it can be written down as a direct sum of lower dimension potentials. So let me give you an example. So let me give you an example. We call potential V is 2, 1 separable. If the function can be written down in the following way, equals V1, N1, N2, plus V2, N2, N3, which means here, N2, N3 is in Z. So from this example, I believe we can understand what's the meaning of this separable functions, right? You can just write it down. Functions, right? You can just write it down in different in low-dimensional way. So these are separable functions. So now I'm going to state as a main questions in this talk. So this questions have been mentioned in many articles and also have been studied a lot in the history. So here, this is the first question. We also call this cooperating is legitimate. We also call this cooperation is a rigidity type of problem type of theorem or problem. So now we have two potentials, Y and V. We know that they are floated isospectral. And Y is separable. So is V separable? This is the first question. So the second question is that assuming both V. That assuming both V and Y are separable, which is separable, you know, they are in the same way. So, if V and Y are floated isospectral, so are there lower dimensional decompositions V J, Y J, floke isospectral? Two questions? So, those two questions have been partially answered by many mathematicians. So, SKIM, Russia, Tupolev. Kim Rossetti Tupo with Golden Kepler, the Kepler. So this Kepler is this Kepler Kepler is this KMN KM guy. So that's the main questions. So now I wanted to reformulate our main questions in the language of blocker varieties and the Fermi variety. So this flow categories, here is our problem. But now I want to reformulate it. But now I want to reformulate this problem in a different way. So let me introduce the block of variety. So the block of variety B V of this operator is all the pairs K lambda in C D plus 1 here K is in C D and lambda is in C such that this eigen equation with exactly the same With exactly the same floor boundary condition has a non-trivial solution, has a non-zero solution. So the same eigen equation, the same boundary condition. That's the definition of blocker variability. So we also have the Fermi variety. So the Fermi variability is the level set of the block variety. So let me for given lambda, So, given lambda, the Fermi variability, some people call it a Fermi surface, which the notation is F sub lambda is given by K such that K lambda in the block variability. So, we call F sub lambda V the Fermi variety of this operator at the energy level lambda. So, you say the Fermi variety depends on the energy lambda. So, Fermi variety is a hypersurface. Variety is a hypersurface of this block variety. This is the two varieties. So now I'm going to reformulate our flow cat isospectrality problem. And also I want to introduce a new type of inverse problem. So I introduce this new type of isospectality problem in 2021. So we say two potentials, V and Y. V and Y are firmly isospectral. If their Fermi varieties are the same at one energy level, which means for some number, not the two Fermi varieties are the same at this point. So we call Fermi isospectrality. Proper? So flow categories isospectronic is equivalent to that the Fermi variety. The Fermi variety are the same for any energy level lambda. So, lemoni, the blocker variables are the same. So, I will explain to you later why Fermi isospecturality is equivalent to the fact that the Blocker variability are the same or the Fermi variability is the same as the same for any energy level lambda. So, from here, you can say that the Fermi isospectrality problem. Problem contains much less information than the flow-kate isospectality problem. Because the flow categoris isospectality means that the Fermi varieties are the same for any energy level lambda. However, the Fermi isospectrality problem means that the Fermi variety are the same at one energy level. So sometimes we call this Fermi isospectrality problem or hypersurface. Or hypersurface version of this flow-quite isospectrality problem. So now I can restate my main questions. The main questions are here. So if V and Y are located as spectrum, so lemon, if we use the language of the firmware blockable varieties, which means that Y and V have the same blockable variables. Have the same block of varieties. All the Fermi varieties are the same at any energy level, lambda. And Y is separable. Is V separable? That is the first question. Second question is that assuming both Y and V are separable, and V and Y are floated iso spectrum, namely for local varieties are the same. So are the lower dimensional potentials of Vj, Yj. Potentials of Vj, Yj for local as spectrum. So the same thing, the block of varieties are the same. So this is the main questions. So now I'm going to state the main results in this talk. So the paper is available on ACIF. So basically, we are going to answer these two questions positively under much weaker assumption. So here the So, here the original question is under the assumption of floated isospectrality. So, we will answer those two questions positively, even under this weaker assumption for me isospectrality. So, here we have three rigidity type statements. The first one says that if potentials V and Y are firmly isospectral and Y is separable, then V is the same. Is separable then V is separable? So let's go to the first question. So we have this weaker assumption, but we get the same, we answer this question. So now let's get the second one. Second one, we answer the second question. So if potentials V and Y are firmly isospectron, and both of them are separable, then up to a constant, the node dimension decompositions are floated isospectral. Compositions are floated isospectron. So, not Fermi. I wanted to mention that, you know, even under the Fermi isospectrality, we get the floated isospectrality. Now, we get, we have the third rigidity type of problem. This is Abazumian type of problem in the study of inverse problem, inverse spectrum problem. So, if our potential V and the zero potential are firmly isospectron, then V must be zero. They must be there long. So, I want to say that there is a question. You assuming that they are separable of the same order, they need the same R. Is that important? Yeah, it's important in our proof. They cannot be of separable of different orders. Oh, you asked a good question. So, actually, w we we can prove you know, even though You know, even though if V is separable, and then we can actually prove Y is separable in the same way. So it doesn't matter. Aha. So it's not only that it will be separable, but it will be separable of the same order. Yes, good, yeah, yeah. So this is the first question. Actually, you're right. So if we are showing V and Y are from the isospectral and the V is separable, then we can show that V is separable in the same way. Exactly the same way, yes. Exactly the same way, yes. Thank you. Thank you. So, what I wanted to mention that the part 3 follows from part 1 and the part 3 immediately. So, there are two reasons why I listed the part 3 separately. So, firstly, this is my original motivation to get into this area, to study this area. Secondly, in the Area. Secondly, in the proof part of this talk, I'm only going to focus on the proof of the part three to give you the main ideas behind the proof. So I list this guy separately here. So any questions before I can jump into this previous results about the AGD type results? So good. So now I wanted to mention the previous result. So for continuous periodic shading operators, when you know body, corner row and turbo weights proved two and three when dimension D is three. So here they answer the problem: two and three when dimension is three for continuous case. And their proof, however, their proof is based on However, the approval is based on the directional compatification, which is approach from artifact geometry, very different from our approach. And for the rest of the four results, their assumption is floated isospectral. So the second one is that for the discrete case, Kepler proves that if V and Y are floated isospectral, and the Y is complete completely separable. completely separable, then V is completely separable. Here, completely separable, which means that this potential is 1, 1, 1 separable, which means that this potential can be written as a direct sum of one-dimensional potentials. And also, Kepler also answered the question Q2. And for the continuous case, S team, Blau Stream, and the Trouble Width prove that if Y and V and the Y are for look at isospect. V and Y are for look at SO spectrum, and Y is completely separable, then V is completely separable. So there are also other results here. For limited time, I don't want to repeat it here, but basically all the four results are dealing with the floor isospectority problems. So I wanted to mention that before our results, even under stronger assumption, let me flow at the isospect. Let me look at isospectronity. This three problems are not completely understood. So we prove it under much weaker assumption. So look at for me as a spectrality. I'm sorry, Wensai, there's something that's confusing me. So it seems to me that if lambda is in a gap for both V and Y, Both V and Y, by your definition, there would be Fermi as a spectral, right? Oh, so yeah, you answered a great question. So, ask a quiz question. So, for Lambda, so let's know why when we define the Fermi isospectrity properly, this guy actually we also have the Fermi is not empty because we allow K is a complex number and then. Lambda. And then, even for any lambda in say, we can actually is not empty. Yeah, so this is why all the variables lambda and the k are complex numbers. Yes, very good question. So if this is why we must consider this problem in say capital D plus one or C D right for this Fermi variety is in C D for the broker variety in C D plus one only In C D plus 1, only in this case, for any given lambda, the formula variety is not empty. So, this is important actually. So, now I'm going to tell you more details about the block and the firmware values, and also I will explain to you what I promised. So, why from wave ISO, you know, why floor ISO spectrality is equivalent to. Is equivalent to the local varieties are the same. So now we can just let P is a function sub of B is a determinant of the eigenvalue problem. Admitting this guy is a Q by Q matrix. So you just get a determinant. Then the block varieties and the Fermi varieties can be written as a zero set of this function p here. This function button. Here, this function button now is fixed number. So, you from this definition, we know that the floccade iso spectrum, you know, oh no, the floccade blocked boundary condition is e2 pi i k j. We have a factor. So, which matter this guy is unchanged here. So, lemony, this function is a periodic with respect to k. So, I'm going to state you know two irreducible. Two irreducible conjectures here, which related to what I'm going to talk about later. So, there are two conjectures. The first conjecture says that the blockable variety is irreducible after modulo the periodicity. Since as mentioned, this guy k, this function is periodic with respect to k, you need to module this periodicity. The second question is that. The second question is that the Fermi variety we also model with the period velocity is irreducible, possibly for except for finitely many lambda. So those two conjectures have been mentioned in many articles. So particularly, you can go to Peter Cuciman's survey article for all the history about this, you know, irreducibility conjectures, also the isospectronic problem. Also, the isospectronity problems. It's a very nice survey article. So, these two conjectures have been proved by myself in 2020. So, I want to formulate the exact versions I proved about these two conjectures. So, first, I want to change the variables. Any question? So I wanted to change the variable. I changed the variable Zj equals U2 pi letter Zj equals U2 pi Kj. And also we have this multiple index Z and K variable. So now we net curved dv is this equals this guy and curved p equals the determinant of this matrix and then the p equals Regular p equals a curved p. So, I wanted to mention in the following: if we use a variable k, we usually use the regular notation, like here. If we use a variable z, we use a notation curved notation. But you can think that the same thing, just in different variables. So, why do we introduce the new variable? Because after introduce the new variable, introduce a new variable. This determinant is a lower polynomial. Actually is a low polynomial of lambda, but lower than the polynomial in the variable Z. Then we can use the, you know, it's an archive set. Actually, you know, we can use a lot of tools to study the block variety and affirmative varieties under the new variables. So now I'm really So now I'm ready to state the irreducibility results, which I proved in 2020. So when dimension is bigger than or less equal to 3, we prove that this lower polynomial as a function of Z is irreducible for any lambda. For fixed lambda, this guy is a function of Z, so it's irreducible. Let bracket V. Let bracket V the average of V, then when dimension is 2, we prove that the curved P as a learned polynomial of Z is irreducible for any lambda, except for one point. The one point is average point. And at the average point, this polynomial has at the most two factors. So serving three and four implies. 7, 3, and 4 implies that the block variety, also, you know, the block, you know, as a curved p as a loneliness polynomial of z and lambda is irreducible. So these three theorems answer the irreducible conjectures, right? It implies that block of variety is irreducible. And also, for the conjecture tool, we indeed prove that it's irreducible. prove that is irreducible for in every lambda except for the one case which is d equals 2 and the lambda equals the average we show that only in this special one energy level this guy may be reducible so here is a remark this special point is sharp Is sharp. Namely, when d equals 2 and for constant potential, this guy actually has two irreducible factors at this average energy. So, which matter, you know, we can order. This is very special here. So, here, you know, are some previous results regarding the irreducibility conjectures. So, most of the results. So, most of the results are about dimension 2 and 3, but they use different approaches. They use the compatifications. So, for limited time, I don't want to get this part because they are not really related to the isospect problems in this talk. So, now I'm going to tell you more about this block of variability and the framework variability. Blocker variability and the Fermi varieties. So now, based on the irreducibility results, let me remind you that the blocker variety is a zero set of this function p. Then, since this guy is irreducible after changing the variables, we can show that the function v, pv equals py if and only if the blocker varieties are the same. We can show that similarly, we can show that the blow formula values are the same if these functions are the same. So, this is a place where you see irreducible conjugatures. So, now I'm going to tell you I'm going to to explain to you why flow categories is the equivalent to the blockable varieties are the same. To the blockable varieties are the same. So for each k, as I mentioned, this matrix is an eigen, you know, is a q by q matrix. So we can order them in non-decreasing order, q eigenvalues. Then the function pv is just as a product by linear algebra. So recall that the flow categ isospect quality means that they have the same eigenvalues. That they have the same eigenvalues, they have the same spectrum. So, many all the corresponding ordered eigenvalues are the same. So, the corresponding eigenvalue are the same, which matters the P is the same. So, right? So, which means the flow category spectrality is equivalent to the function Pv equals Py. So, I just proved that by irreducibility. By irreducibility, the broken variety are the same and only if the function are the same. So, lemon flukate isospectronity is equivalent to the blocker varieties are the same. So, we can use this blocker variety language to study it. So, now I wanted to remind you the Fermi isospectrality. So, Fermi isospectrality, which means that the Fermi variety are the same at one energy level. At one energy level. So, which means that they function Pv are the same. And then it means that by the fact here, it means that the product of the eigenvalues are the same. So now I wanted to conclude the Fermi varieties and the Fermi isospectraity and the floccat isospect. Isospectality and the floated isospectality. First, floke isospectuality, which means that the broker variety are the same. Namely, the Fermi variables are the same at any energy level lambda. So Fermi isospect quality means that the Fermi variability are the same. Fermi variables are the same at one energy level. So it means that the Fermi atrophy is a hypersurface version of the Fermi. Surface version of the floccat isospectrality problem. Secondly, the floke isospectrality problem means that all the eigenvalues are the same. However, the Fermi isospectuality problem means that the product of the eigenvalues are the same. So you can understand it in two ways. It's our problem. So now I'm going to get Now, I'm going to get into the proof of this problem. So, first, I wanted to say that you may notice that I mentioned this function P V a lot. So, this P V actually is called a characteristic function in the study of inverse spectrum properties. So, for the discrete case, as I mentioned, is a product of the eigenvalue. Product of the eigenvalues. Actually, even for continuous case, like 1D of the continuous case, by the Hadamard factorization theorem, this PV can also be written as a product of the infinitely many eigenvalues. After some normalizations, here, number m is roughly speaking m squared. So, this product is convergent. Convergent. So I wanted to mention that this one, this curved p, no, no, this function p is very important in the study of the inverse problems. So this is our bridge. Now I'm going to explain the main ideas behind the proof first. So as I mentioned, by the reduced B result, Fermi isospect quality implies that the curved P are the same. So curved P, why I chose curved P, then there are polynomials, a lot of polynomials. Then we are going to focus on the study of this two low-land polynomials. So you may think, no, this is not difficult, right? Because you know, we have two low-land polynomials. I just do the calculations and compare the coefficients. The coefficients should be the same. Then I solve this problem. However, the coefficients. However, the coefficients are very complicated. I did the numeric for d equals 2 and d 2 oh no sorry d equals 2 and q 1 equals 2 and q 2 equals 5. Even in this case, I believe you needed to spend at least 20 minutes to even write down all the coefficients. They're super complicated. So this is why it's not that easy to compare the coefficients directly to solve this problem. To solve this problem. So, what's the main ideas behind our proof? We are going to choose proper archiplicate curves of the variable Z so that the leading entries of this load on the polynomials can be easily calculated on those curves. So, here the leading load of the polynomials means highest order, lowest order, or and Notice the order or and others. And you cannot just choose the algebraic curves randomly. You should choose the algebraic curves so that the coefficients have very simple structures. Then you compare V and Y, they are equal. You can solve this problem easily. So this is the main ideas behind our proof. Choose proper algebraic curves. On those curves, you compare On those curves, you compare, you calculate this coefficient, then compare then, then get what you want to have. Now I'm going to explain to you how to choose the IGF curves. So which is highly motivated by the fluke transform. So now I'm going to change the variable again. We start from E2πi. Started from E2πi Kj, right? We use a variable Zj. But now I wanted to make a Zj to Zj Qj. I wanted to do this change of the variable. Then after changing over the variable, we call this function TOTA curved ID. So we also introduce the solution of the unit. Solution of the unity equation here is U2 pi nj over qj. So by the standard flow coded transform, floccat block transform, we have that this matrix after changing the variables is equivalent to our original eigenvalue problem after changing variables is unitarily equivalent to A plus B where A Where A is a diagonal matrix which only depends on the variable Aj. So it looks complicated, but just diagonal matrix A. And A is independent of the potential V. And then the potential V get into B V, which is given by this Fourier transform, this created Fourier transform of the potential V. So from here, you can say that when the potential V is zero, Potential V is zero, which means P V is zero. There is no such guy, then this matrix is a diagonal matrix. Right? This is our goal of this flow-block transform. Flow-Block transform, we are transfer the fluid Laplacian problem when the potential is there low to a diagonal matrix. So now I can give you some examples of how to choose the archibretic curves. How to choose the archiplicate curves. So sometimes we need to choose this archipelago curves equals lambda. Sometimes we need to choose this guy equals zero. Here, d1 is smaller than d d is a dimension. Now I'm going to tell you two technical preparations and then I will give you the proof. So as I mentioned, I'm only going to prove As I mentioned, I'm only going to prove the simplest case to you. The simplest case is a part 3. Part 3, which matters if the potential V is isospectral to the zero potential, then V is zero. But we are going to only prove the dimension 3 for you. So, here first, we have this Fermi isospecto. If V and V and the Y are Fermi. V and y are for me isospectral. Then you have the average of V equals Y. And also you have this function equals another function. So here is from V, as I mentioned here is a discrete Fourier transform of V hat. Y hat is a discrete Fourier transform of Y Z equal. So let me explain to you where this two Where are these two guys from? So, in the study of the flow kit isospectronity problem, or in the study of this inverse spectrum theorem, it's very natural if you have the lambda as a parameter. Usually, it's easy to just calculate as a coefficient of lambda to q's power, which is always 1, and the coefficient of lambda q minus 1, and the coefficient of lambda q minus 2. However, in our case, However, in our case, we cannot use lambda because lambda is the free, you know, lambda is fixed because we only have one energy level, lambda. So what we do here, we choose the highest order degree of the variable Z, which matter here you get the degree of ZQ and ZQ minus one, ZQ minus two. So here is a coefficient actually. Here is the coefficient actually is ZQ minus 1. Here is the coefficient of ZQ minus 2. We get this two formulas. In this vector theory, actually, this is similar to the trace formula. This is very similar to the second momentum. That's the two. 1k lemma, 1k theory. So I need another preparation. Another preparation, so which we care about as a linearly dependent and independent among the unities. So now we have assume q1, q2, q3 are relatively prime, then we have this guy equals zero and LJ, Lj prime is in this fundamental. Lj prime is in this fundamental domain, which means that it is between 0 and q j minus 1. Then L1 and L and L prime must fall into one of the following six cases. Now let me give you some explanation. Where is this six cases from this six cases are the trivial cases? The first case is that this guy is zero. L1, L2. Which matter there is one one one so linearly dependent. The second case, the second row is one one one. A third row is one one one. Then which one, these two rows are the same. The second case, third case is that the second row and the third row are the same. So now let's check get it into the second row. The second row. To the second row. The second row, the first case is this guy is one. This guy is one. L2 is one. Here is one. Which means the first two columns. The first two rows. Sorry, sorry. The first two columns are the same. And the second case is the Is the first colour and the third colour are the same. So the third case is the second colour and the third colours are the same. Because there are trivial cases. Actually, this proof actually is quite technical of this guy. So sorry. So suppose we have this lemma. So now I'm going to present the proof. The proof of the simplest case, namely part 3 and dimension is 3. So let me remind you that this guy, rho mj equals e to the pi qjm. Qj is a period. So now as I mentioned, potential V is zero. You know, one potential is zero. I wanted to show that this guy is also zero. So V y is zero, which means all Z. Y is zero, which matters all the Fourier transform is zero. So this guy is identically zero. Then we get this equation. So right. Now we only study the dimension three problem. Here is three. And let me remind you that W is a fundamental domain, as a fundamental domain. So now I'm going to give you some hints how to. Hints: How to choose a curve. So now the first case I choose Z3 is equal to 0. Then if I choose Z3, now check the denominator. Denominator becomes rho n11 plus rho n2 z2. Sorry. Because z3 is 0. Multiplies rho m1 prime 1. 1 plus rho 2 prime 2 Z 2 so this is denominator now if you check the denominator now I consider another curve this is very this is just a you know line in Z R 2 or C2 so Z 1 plus Z 2 equals 0 so now you check now if Z1 plus Z2 equals 0 in all if z1 plus z2 equals 0 in order to make a denominator have 0 have 0 I needed to have the worst case is n1 equals n2 equals 0 n1 prime equals n2 prime equals 0 only in this case the denominator has double zeros for the rest of the case they only have one zero at most only in this extreme case both Both guys are zeros. Then, on this curve, the coefficient of the double zeros must be zero. So, what does that mean? You can say n1, n2 is 0, n1 prime, n2 prime is 0. Then this guy, the first two entries must be components must be 0. And n3 can be any number, right? Because this 3 is 0. So, we show that the sun is 0. The sun is zero. So remember, every guy is zero. So this allows us to actually, if we permutate Z1, Z2, Z3, we can show that any this guy, N1, N2, N3, equals zero if two of N1, N2, N3 are low. And three, I don't know, but I only, even though I only prove that this guy, first, even first, the two guys are zero, then it's zero. Actually, you can do it for any case. So now I want to rewrite this guy in the following. Before, the sun is at n is in the fundamental domain, m plus the fundamental domain. So now I wanted to delete some points from this fundamental domain. What's the point I'm going to delete? To delete. So I'm going to delete here this prime, which means that I'm going to only choose a sum such that at least two components, you know, at, you know, I wanted to delete the sun if two of this and one, n2, and three are zero. Then the remaining part is that for any. The remaining part is that for any choosing n and n prime, the difference at least two of them are different. Because if at least two of them are the same, then this guy is zero. I have already proved it. Then I can delete those points such that all the sum in the fundamental metal domain, at least two components are different. Now I'm going to show that all the All the sorry, let me elements in this partial sum are linearly independent. So why is that linearly independent? Which is guaranteed by this lemma. Let's check the second row. I mean, for the second, now we check this vectors. This is first vector, second vector, the third vector. For this, Third vector for the second row, if the determinant is their row, like the first case, this guy must be one, this guy is one, this guy is one, this guy is one, which means that the first row and the second row has two components that are the same. The first row and this, you know, and all these three rows have at least two components are the same. So which is not in our case here because as I mentioned, Case here because, as I mentioned, we have already excluded both cases. Then, the only case is that the first row. The first row, which means that the three vectors, at least two of them, are the same. But now, we choose a different vectors in this partial sum, then they are linearly independent. So, once they are linearly independent, we can choose the coefficient that must be zero. So, why? We can choose. So why we can choose proper artificial curve. This is the curve we are going to choose. We choose one guy equals zero, another guy equals zero. Then in order to we check the double zeros in the denominator, the double zeros in the denominator only happens at this point and this point. Then they correspond for the rest, they have, they don't cannot have They have they don't cannot have double zeros, then I've shown that this coefficient must be zero. So I'm down. So basically, this is the main ideas behind the proof. We always try to choose archive curves and use some other technical preparations to solve your questions. So I think that's all I wanted to say in my talk. So thank you for listening. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Any questions? Do I understand correctly that all, so even though you formulated your results only for dimension three and above, but does it work also in dimension two? Yeah, very good question. Dimension two, the approach doesn't work for dimension two. So we can our proof actually only for dimension D is you know. You know, not just design or equal to three. Doesn't work for D equals two. This is a very, very challenging problem. It doesn't work for you. Yeah, it doesn't work. Because of the algebraic, because of the choice of the algebraic curves? Yes, because the approach I use doesn't work. Actually, in Trubo Witch's book, in several places, he didn't say directly, but he implies that the second dimension case, when dimension d equals 2, is a When dimension d equals 2 is the hardest problem. Actually, even though I didn't mention it, but from the test, I understand d equals 2 is the most difficult case. Any more questions? I have a comment. First of all, it's these are absolutely wonderful results. Absolutely wonderful results. And I want to mention that all those statements go out of the window in non-self-adjoint case, including the simplest one, that if you have Lacare as a tutoriality of two potentials, one is zero, another doesn't have to be zero. So essentially, it boils down to the property of matrices that if you have triangles. That if you have a triangular matrix and its spectrum only tells you about the diagonal part. So there are one can construct easily examples when adding some non-self-adjoint potential doesn't change the block variety. But this is just a peculiarity of non-self-adjoint case. Again, Again, it's it's great work, thanks. Thank you. Any more questions? All right, so let's thank what's I did. Thank you.
