Of S units. So if you haven't seen this before, then just as a small recap. So these are elements of the number field such that the generated ideal will have only primes in S in its prime factorization. Then if you fix two numbers A and B in the number field, you can write In the number field, you can write down the S-unit equation, which reads Ax plus By is equal to 1. And here, X and Y are constrained to be S units. And as you can see, the equation itself is very simple additively. But the constraints on X and Y are multiplicative. So, in some sense, it asks how addition and multiplication fit together, which is a very common topic in number theory in general. So, that's why. Theorem in general. So that's why it's such a fundamental equation. And Siegel and Mahler were the ones who first considered it and who proved that there are only finitely many solutions. But so why do we actually care? And for me, one of the motivating examples is the ABC conjecture, which actually can be phrased in terms of asymptotic height bounds for the solutions of S-unit equations x plus y is equal to 1 over q. One over q, so to some very specific s-unit equations. But then it turns out that also many Diaphragm equations reduce the s-unit equations, and here are some of them. And in particular, I want to mention also Siegel's method for computing as integral points on elliptic curves, but also hyper-elliptic and super elliptic curves. Then, another application is that you can prove asymptotic Fermat-type theorems over number fields by solving as unit equations by the work of Freitas, Krauss, Ossmann. Work of Freitas, Kraus, Osman, Schengen, and Sigzek. And one more application, well, there are several others, but one more application that we can come back to later is that you can actually compute elliptic curves by considering SUNY equations. Okay, there are classical methods which essentially all go back to De Vega, who considered S unit equations over the rational numbers. Then Wildanger took a similar approach for unit equations. So when S is For unit equations, so when S is the empty set, and SMART combine those two to make an S-unit equation solve over the number fields. And basically, they all go as follows. In principle, you start with an initial height bound that already bounds the heights of the solutions. And classically, these come from linear forms and logarithms. Since these bounds are so large that in practice, you can't just brute force go through. Go through all the candidates and check whether they are solutions, you have to reduce the bounds by what people call LLL, which is essentially a diaphragm and approximation problem that you try to solve. With similar ideas, you can sift in the remaining search space, and for the tiny solutions, you just enumerate them. And in my solver, I use several new ideas. Well, some of them have appeared already before in some. Appeared already before in some sense. One is: well, essentially, it sounds very trivial. So, this is a high-level view on actually the new ideas that will improve the running time exponentially. So, I constrain to those. One is that you actually should make sure to use efficient estimates because in the classical approach, due to the technicality of the estimates, there are often quite, for example, norm conversions made, which can be avoided and which should be avoided. Which can be avoided and which should be avoided to make a fast resolver. Then, with Von Kanel, we have our algorithm overQ, which uses a refined SIF. So, the idea there is that you should actually, in some parts of the search space, SIF with respect to several places, because it will be considerably more efficient. And the good thing is that this idea can be extended over a number of fields. Then, furthermore, there's a so-called fast enumeration method. Fast enumeration method. So for the tiny candidates, it turns out that there's a method to do this considerably faster by actually an exponent of two-thirds than just the trivial enumeration method. And also this idea, which I found not completely trivial, can be extended over number fields as well. Then usually people consider a search space for X and for Y and it turns out that it makes sense to consider not only X and Y. To consider not only x and y, but all the conjugates of x via the anharmonic group. So this will be six different search spaces, and it sounds like it will make our efforts by a factor of six bursts, which is true, but there will be exponential savings when doing so. Then it turns out that we will have usually to compute integral points on polytopes. How do you do this? Well, the standard method is. How do you do this? Well, the standard method is via finger post, where you find a small ellipsoid that contains a given polytope. But the problem over number fields is that the polytopes become quite complicated, and especially they have exponentially many vertices. So how do you find a small ellipsoid that contains a given polytope? And it turns out that one can borrow ideas from Katian's ellipsoid method that he used for solving linear programs and make this work by extending. This work by extending actually the ways how he finds ellipsoids to find approximations of the minimal volume ellipsoid containing a polytope with possibly exponentially many vertices. And in practice, it also happens that very often you have constrained S-unit equations. For example, by Galois symmetries. What are constraints? This can either mean that the exponent vectors of your S-units have to lie in certain subspaces, or you may have Or you may have linear relations between them. And these turn out to be very useful, and I try to implement them as general as possible. Torsion can be handled more efficiently, and also I try to make my code very generic, such that in future, if there are new ideas or actually maybe new possible applications for SNI integrations, one can hopefully change the code to make this work. Code to make this work. And I should also say: so there are different methods that I presented here. It is actually quite difficult to find the right balance of where to use which method. And so the idea is that we are not aiming for, in some sense, a Ferrari that just shoots in one straight line. It's more like a mass rover where you try to actually make an S-unit equation solver that works for all possible input data. Because the problem is that depending on the input data, there are different bottlenecks appearing. Different bottlenecks appearing, and one has to somehow cover all of them if possible. Okay, so much to this. Let's compare this to previous S-Unit equation solvers, and I will compare it only to the most recent ones, which is the one by von Kennen and myself, OberQ, and the algorithm that is currently available in Sage due to Alvarado, Kuzianas, Miles, Koch, Rasmussen, Vincent, and West, who are considered as unit equations or one number fields, both with. Both with coefficients a and b is equal to one, but this is the most important case anyway. And first, the comparison over q. There you can see that for different sets S, while the one by von Kanen and myself outperforms the other ones, I'm worse by currently by a factor of 50, and I know where a factor of six is coming from. And this is just a symmetry that I'm just completely missing here. And the other factor of 10, I And the other factor of 10, I'm not completely sure where it comes from, but I will possibly just do due to the more complicated data structures for number fields. And the one by Alvarado et al. for three primes, I had to finish it due to memory constraints on my computer. And then I have another example over number fields, which appears. So this number field and this set S appears in a study of genus 2 curves with good reduction outside of 3. Actually, you would have to solve the S-Unit equation over the Galois closure. Solve the S-Net equation over the Galois closure of this field, which would be considerably more complicated and probably completely out of reach right now. So Alvarado and Al, they stop after they have 10 to the 17 candidates left, and my algorithm runs in 30 seconds and computes the whole set. These comparisons look quite drastic, right? But the thing that one should have in mind is that these algorithms That these algorithms are exponential in nature, anyway. So, you should think of these comparisons on a logarithmic scale. And also, I should say that the algorithm that is currently available in SAGE is not really bad. I mean, people invest years of their lives when making new SUNY equation solvers, and it's just a very difficult problem. Okay, well, this being said, let's come. So, this being said, let's come to actually applications, namely, the one that I'm most interested in are elliptic curves over number fields. And the goal in this talk will be to compute all elliptic curves over a given number field K with good reduction outside of a finite set of primes S in this number field. And good reduction, I think it's clear what it means, but just to be sure, if you can, for example, think of the conductor of the For example, think of the conductor of the elliptic curve, this will only be allowed to have prime devices in S. Or if K has class number one, we are considering all elliptic curves with minimal discriminant, also again being only divisible by primes in S. And there are several methods. The one that we focus on here today is the method by Parshin and Chavarevich, which actually did this just theoretically, and Elkis was the one who was thinking. And Elkis was the one who was thinking of making this into an algorithm, but only Kuzianas was recently the first one who has actually made this into an algorithm and quite impressive work. The principal idea from the top level is relatively simple, which is you write your elliptic curve in the genre form. It only depends on a single parameter lambda. And lambda is not only an algebraic number, but it will lie in a two-dimensional. Algebraic number, but it will lie in a two-division field of the elliptic curve. And then it satisfies the trivial relation lambda plus one minus lambda is equal to one. But the important point here is that lambda and one minus lambda will be as tilde units, whereas tilde is just the primes in this two-division field over s and over two. So you just have to solve this s-unit equation, but over which fields? Well, you will have to consider all possible two-division fields. And the possible set of candidates of such two division fields can be computed via a comma theory. And I should note that if you have a good asymmetric equation solver, then the second part can become also a bottleneck depending on, again, the input data, especially for fields of large degree, the second part you can become. But also actually for small fields, so of low degree, but for large sets S, this sometimes can become a bottleneck if it's not done properly. If it's not done properly, so there I had to also invest some work on it. Okay, but let's come to what Kuzianus did. He computed especially two sets of such elliptic curves, namely for Q, where S is the set of primes 2, 3, and 23. And this is already out of the reach of Cremona's database, quite far actually. I think the maximal conductor of an elliptic curve that appears in this table will be around 33 million. 33 million. And he also did this over the number field q, adjoint square root of minus 1, where s is the prime above 2. And note that this is an imaginary quadratic field. So the modular approach may be difficult there. Okay, and before I come now to my results, I have to make a big disclaimer, which I always denote by a star, which refers to one of three things. Refers to one of three things. First, I'm quite often assuming GIH just for computing class groups, which can be actually possibly in some cases be removed by just computing the class groups properly without GIH. The very important part is that I'm using the unit group class in Sage, which currently still contains a bug, which will be fixed in Sage 9.2, which hopefully comes out soon because it's already fixed in Pari. So I found Already fixed in Paris. So I found this bug actually by computing my tables, and I think that I can detect it using a heuristic, but I cannot prove that this heuristic always detects the bug, such that I can do something else. So currently, the tables that I have are not proved to be complete, unfortunately. And I think I will just have to redo all my calculations once the bug is fixed. And also, I'm using for small parts of the computations magma, which some people consider as a black box. Consider as a black box, and so whether you consider proofs based on computations in Magma, a mathematical proof, is at least debatable, I guess. So, these are the three things that Star will refer to. So, let's come now to my computations. The first one considers elliptic curves over Q with good reduction outside the first n primes, which is somewhat a classical topic because the case when n is equal to zero was already considered by Tate. So, what does it mean to have good reduction? By Tate. So, what does it mean to have good reduction outside of the first zero primes? Just means to have everywhere good reduction. And Tate proved that these just don't exist over Q. Then the next case, n is equal to 1. So when you have a conductor being a power of 2, was considered by Og, and he found all candidates, and also actually for Iberian varieties in his case. N is equal to 2 was considered by Koglin and Stevens. N is equal to 3, 4, and 5 by von Kahnen. To three, four, and five by von Kairnel and myself. And it was recomputed by Bennett, Gaga and Rechnitzer with a different method. So von Kahnel and I used model equations. Bennett, Gaga, and Rechnitzer, they used two Mahler equations. The next case, n is equal to six, was recently considered by Best and myself, but we used the method by von Kenne and myself using model equations. And we only computed this heuristically, which means Heuristically, which means especially that we could not compute all the necessary model value bases of the model curves that were appearing, but we have arguments based on BSD and ABC that should say that our data is still complete. So I actually with the S-unit equation solver made sure that this is correct up to my disclaimer. And I computed the cases when n is equal to 7 and 8. And just to give you an idea how large the table is, well, we have Large the table is. Well, we have roughly 200 million curves, which is 70 times as large as Cremona's database. But the number of J invariants is only around 400,000, so which is, I think, 20% of Cremona's table. And the maximal conductor that you see in there will be of the order 100 quadrillion. Okay, well, you can ask the same thing about number fields. So let's do this. I consider just the same. I considered just the same table about number fields, for example, about q adjoint square root of minus one, where s is the primes above the first five rational primes, and five is the one that splits. So these are actually six primes in k. And I computed the table. And then I did the same when q when you adjoin square root of three to q. And there you get, well, we have the table now for as being the primes above, again, the first five rational primes. Again, the first five rational primes, and here 11 is the one that splits. So these are again six primes in k. And I have similar tables for smaller sets of s, notably large families of fields where s is always taken to be the primes above two. And it includes also one case where k has degree 12. So which is, I think, out of reach with other methods currently. And as a corollary, for example, And as a corollary, for example, I obtain the set of all elliptic curves over k that have everywhere good reduction, so when s is the empty set, for all number fields k where the absolute discriminant of k is bounded by 20,000. And this is not only for the quadratic case, which is quite often considered in the literature or for real for totally real number fields, but just for all number fields up to this discriminant. Discriminant. Okay. And as a last table, I want to mention something that I will compare to Cremona's database. Namely, Cremona, the most famous database for elliptic curves over Q is due to Cremona, because he not only has the full set of elliptic curves with conductor N bounded by 500,000, but also he computed a lot of extra data like model while bases and PSD data. In a recent project with von Kellen and myself, we computed the set of all We computed the set of all elliptic curves where the radical of n is bounded by 1000. So, what is the radical of n? It's the product over all primes that divide n. So, in other words, the radical of n is the product over all primes of bad reduction. And so the parameters n and the radical of n, they somehow stratify the space of elliptic curves over Q in two different ways. Elliptic curves over Q in two different ways. And we always assumed that in practice, these two stratifications are quite different. So you would possibly never have one stratum computed so far such that it contains another stratum. And also the parameters are used in different applications. So for example, n appears very much, for example, in the level of the associated rational new form and also in the functional equation of the associated L function. The associated L-function, whereas the radical of n appears quite often in applications for solving Diophantine problems by reducing them to these elliptic curve tables. And in general, when you're interested in actually primes of bad reduction instead of how bad the reduction actually is. And so, what I computed recently, but also with this disclaimer again, is the set of all elliptic curves where the radical of Elliptic curves where the radical of 2n is bounded by 1 million. And as a comparison, so it contains a Cremona's table. And since I have this disclaimer, right, I check that this is indeed the case. And I also checked, well, if you, for example, go up to radical 30, this would already require curves where the conductor is 1.5 million, which is out of reach of the modular symbol method that common occurrence. Symbol method that Komono currently uses. And the maximal conductor is a number very close to 1728 times a million squared. And this is no coincidence. So it's of the order of one quadrillion again. And I want to mention that there's again, as I mentioned already, the alternative approach using Turmal equations, which was recently used by Bennett, Gergen, Rechnitzer, also very interestingly, to compute elliptic curves with prime conditions. elliptic curves with prime conductor and prime squared conductor to a very large to a very large bound. And so with together with Gaga, von Kennelen and Zigzek, we are currently trying to come up with a new two-male equation solver where one of our goals is just to push Cromona's table a little bit further. And to my very last slide, I want to also compare the conductor on the radical of N. So there's So there's the famous ABC conjecture, which bounds the maximum of A, B, and A plus B in terms of the radical of A times B times A plus B, at least asymptotically. It was actually motivated, at least by Eusterle, from Spiro's conjecture, which bounds asymptotically the minimal discriminants of an elliptic curve by the conductor. Conductor. And based on the data that we collected, it may make sense to conjecture that actually the conductor can be replaced by the radical of the conductor in Spiro's conjecture. What I should add maybe is that first of all, ABC implies conjecture one, conjecture one implies Spiro's conjecture, and Spierr's conjecture implies ABC almost, namely, when you replace. Most, namely, when you replace ABC, whether you replace the right-hand side, which is usually the exponent in the ABC conjecture, by 3 over 2. And moreover, maybe this is a bit anticlimactic. It turns out that actually conjecture 1 and Spiro's conjecture are equivalent. So it's maybe not such a big thing. But it tells you again that the radical of n is actually a very important quantity. Well, not. Well, not only for applications to diaphragmic patients, but even for such theoretical ones. Okay, with this, thank you very much. Any questions or comments for Benjamin? Very impressive. Thank you. Thank you, man. Hi, this is Samyev. I just wanted to ask you a question. So you said you computed all elliptic curves of everywhere good reduction over all Over all number fields of discriminant at most 20,000. Yeah, this is it. Discriminant at most 20,000. I mean, could you tell us more about what you found? So what is the biggest degree number field in that list? Degree six. Degree six. And did you find an elliptic curve over a number field of degree six of everywhere? Yes, actually, it's a bit disappointing. It's a bit disappointing because I stopped finding. So I did this for larger degrees, also to a larger bound. I think for degree 9, I went to 100 million. So where the discriminator of case bounded by 100 million. So there are around 100 of such degree 9 fields there. But the problem is I just can only show that there is no such curve with everywhere good reduction. So there, actually, this modular approach, which was used by Cremona and his group, Used by Cremona and his group, is actually more successful in finding at least elliptic curves with everywhere good reduction over totally real number fields, because there you just want to have those with where the conductor is one. And there the modular method is better at constructing those, I think. But well, for non-totally real number fields, the interesting thing is also the more complex places the number field has, the faster. The number field has, the faster the method is, because the number of fundamental units actually decreases with the number of complex places. So it's a bit interesting that actually the modular method works better at places where actually my method works worse. So thank you. To Benjamin, it's uh So, Benjamin, it's Mike. So, how early on if you're doing, let's just say, elliptic curve computations over Q, are you using GRH? For that's a good question. So, at the beginning, I used GIH immediately because I couldn't go very far without GIH. For, for example, this table here where the radical is bounded by 1 million. But I noticed that actually I I noticed that actually I used GIH for way too much. So you need only GIH for certain extensions of degree 2 and 3 of the number field, in this case Q. And not over the... You don't... Well, one may assume just GIH for the two division fields that are of degree 6. So this saves a lot. But I haven't checked it yet. So possibly one can get rid of it completely. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Thank you. So, Benjamin, I have two hopes. One is that you are going to put every single elliptic curve you found into the LMFDB. And the second hope is that you're going to do it without asking me for any help. Well, I would love to. I think one problem is that the conductors are so large that it will be difficult to compute the associated L-functions. Functions to nothing precision that uniquely identifies them. I think this is. No, no, you'll clearly have to cut down the amount of data. Yeah, but that's understood. But the problem is also on how to merge it with existing data, I guess. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, I know. Maybe I missed it, but what is the largest conductor that shows up in the radical n to 1000 data set? Radical up to 1000. This would be almost 1728 times 1000. 428 times 1000 squared. So for the von Kenne and myself, which is completely computed exactly. So there we don't use any conjectures. Yeah, you cut down six zeros, basically. That would be, it would be easy to compute those L functions. So that might be a good target. Benjamin, I have another, this is Samuel. I have another question. I have another question about the use of DRH. As far as I can see, I mean, you just want to compute the S unit group of some number field. That's right. And I mean, if I assume, well, whatever I assume, I know that I'm of this group. Of this group. So, and if I find enough S units, which you clearly are, then all that it could be is that the group that you found is out by some finite index. So, is there a hope that somehow you can have a method for solving S-unit equations that takes account of That takes account of the fact that you might be out by a finite index? I think, so I'm not an expert on this, but I know that Yuri Bilo, he has a paper with, I think, Hanro where he uses, where he studies Tour equations, where he does exactly this. So where he may just have a finite index subgroup of the units. In a subgroup of the units and the S units, and he can actually by this deduce then still all the solutions of the associated Touhou equation. I would have to think about it actually, whether this is possible in this case, because for Toue equations, he can use many more techniques that are just not available for general S-unit equations. But perhaps, because here for this elliptic curve table, one has a lot of Galois symmetries, perhaps one can actually. Um, perhaps one can actually one can make use of them as well. Um, yeah, there might be hope. I guess it the pointer would be to the Bilo Hanco paper. Thanks. Can I just make one small comment? This doesn't necessarily mean I think it makes sense to put all these into the LMF TB, but computing the even for your maximal conductor, that's totally feasible to compute the LMTB. Conductor, that's totally feasible to compute the L-function. I wouldn't want anyone to run away thinking that that was hard. That's it's only proportional to about 30 times the square root, and that's about 10 to the 15. So we can easily compute APs up to 30 times the square root of 10 to the 15. Okay. Then there's the rank and the model-v group and a few other things. Yeah, yeah, no. The other thing is, absolutely, that I'm just saying the L function is totally computable. Yeah, so for the rank, I can say that. The rank, I can say that Edgar Costa was the one that computed actually the analytic ranks of all the curves over Q with good reduction outside the first six primes for our table. So there the analytic ranks are available, but I don't know whether it would be available for these tables. So how big did they get? I forgot the exact number, but it would be the price. I forgot the exact number, but it would be the product over all these, over all the primes, the first six primes, squared times 1728 almost. No, how big is the rank? Oh, the rank? Oh, eight. Four. There are several, I think 120 or so curves of rank four, of analytic rank four. That's good. Which is quite a lot. I think in your database, there's only one of rank four, right? Yeah. Yeah, it behaves a bit different. Yeah, it behaves a bit different to the database that you obtain from bounding the conductor itself. If you want the radical, yeah. Benjamin, did you compute sort of Spiro ratios for all of these of the first bunch of prime? Oh yeah, yeah, right. I'm just sharing my screen. So I can go to this one. Can I go to this one? I don't see what the title is due to the zoom. This is a R. So this is a histogram for all the ratios where you take the radical. Let me go to Spiro ratios. These are the Spiro ratios for the first six primes as a histogram. So you see that the Spiro conjecture would say that asymptotically you should not go over six. Of course, you have a few cases over six. Have a few cases over six, and I also compared this to um where's okay, I don't find huh, for some reason I don't see Cremona's table here. Yes, I say it was there, it was there. Was it oh yeah, there, there it is. So, yeah, uh, here you see that in Cremona's table, actually, there are some spier ratios that are very large, um, almost uh, almost twenty-two, and I think twenty two point four is the current record, I think. I don't think that's true. I don't think that's true. Oh, is there a higher record? No, no, no, it's much smaller than that. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm considering the ratio where you take actually the radical. Oops, I'm sorry. But there exist examples of Spiral ratio, I think, 22.4, if I'm not mistaken. No, it's the biggest known ones about 9. Uh, so there's there's slides by Samuela Ani and uh Sam Giovona, and somebody else that I forgot, but okay. Um, I didn't find a paper that is also associated with this. Sam Welley's put into the chat this is uh this is hype for hyper elliptic stuff. Oh, not genus one. Oh, okay. Okay. Anyway, um, sorry, we can, I think we can carry this on and look something like that, but right now we have to have But right now, we have to have a group photo. So if people
