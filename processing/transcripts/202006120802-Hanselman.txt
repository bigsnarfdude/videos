From Princeton. So let's all mute our mics and let Jonathan take it away. All right, thanks. I want to thank everyone for being here, or I guess being wherever you are and tuning in, especially if there's any West Coasters present who are up extra early. I also do really want to thank the organizers and Burrs for the extra work it took to adapt this workshop. It took to adapt this workshop to this virtual format. Of course, it's you know it's sad to not be together with you all in person, and I hope it won't be too long before that can happen again. But in the meantime, it's been really great to be able to have an awesome week of talks. Okay, so today I want to tell you about, oh, and let me mention, I think there is or will be a link in the chat to these notes, because I'll probably be going kind of fast. So the notes might help you keep up if you like to do that. Like to do that. Okay, so I want to tell you today about knot floor homology. I realize that that's not a new topic for many of you, but I want to describe a relatively new way of thinking about these objects. And this sits in a broader context of some recent work, sort of taking algebraic objects coming out of Hagard floor and related theories and recasting them in a more geometric way. Them in a more geometric way, especially using immersed curves in surfaces. I would maybe be bold and argue that this is the right way to think about these invariants. I hope to at least convince you that this is a useful way of thinking about these invariants. So let me just start by reminding us that not photomology is a not invariant defined by Asbeth and Zabo and independently by Rasmussen. And given a null And given a null homologous NOT K in a three-manifold Y, we associate this object CFK minus of YK, which is a bigraded chain complex over this ring F adjoining UV, which in the talk I'll be referring to as R. By the way, here F is any field. Or, okay, so if I'm being precise, it's not the chain complex, but it's a chain homotopy equivalence type of this complex. Chain homotopy equivalence type of this complex, which is the invariant. There's actually another related piece of information that is in general not contained in this complex, but I do want to keep track of, and I'm going to sort of include this as part of what not floor homology is. And that's an isomorphism from HF minus of y to itself, which we usually call the flip map. In some cases, this is determined by the complex. For instance, if I care about knots in S. By the complex. For instance, if I care about knots in S3, HF minus Y only has one generator, so there's only one thing that this could do. But in general, this is sort of extra information I should keep track of. If you're not familiar with these invariants, then it's not so important for this talk where they come from. The most important thing for you to know is just that there is an invariant of interest, and this is the form that it takes. But I'm assuming that many of you are comfortable with not formology. Are comfortable with not floor homology? Let me just briefly remind us that, well, this complex is computed from a doubly pointed Hager diagram for yk. We do some sort of Lagrangian floor homology and some sort of symmetric product. The differential counts homomorphic disks, and if those disks cover the two base points, we record that with these two variables u and v. By the way, you may be used to notation that doesn't have a v. It turned out it's convenient to add this extra formal variable v to keep track of. Extra formal variable v to keep track of the Alexander filtration. This flip map also comes from, can be computed from the doubly coined Hager diagram. The observation is that if I forget either one of the two base points, I get a Hager diagram for y. And I can find a sort of sequence of Hager moves taking one base point to the other. And this gives rise to this footman on the monologue of Y. Okay, so my goal is to interpret this sort of data on the right. The served data on the right as a geometric object. And well, the result I get is that this can be represented by a decorated collection of immersed curves in the marked torus. So here, gamma is an immersed multi-curve collection of curves with some grading information in the marked torus. And it's decorated by this thing, B. By this thing, B, this thing called a bounding co-chain, which I'm not going to define just yet, but I will describe what that is later in the talk. First, let me try to clarify a few things about this statement. So by the marked torus, I just mean the torus with a single mark point in it. And I'm going to assume that I have a sort of favorite parametrization fixed. I'll always think of this marked torus as, like, if I think of it as a square, lambda is in. Think of it as a square, lambda is in the horizontal direction, and u is in the vertical direction. Okay, so I said that these immersed curves in this torus have some grating information. There's two gratings, Alexander and Maslov. And the Alexander grating is easy to interpret geometrically. It exactly specifies a lift of these immersed curves to this covering space, which I'll call T-bar, where I sort of unroll in the vertical direction to go from this punctured torus. Punctured torus to an infinitely punctured cylinder. So I can think of this as immersed, doubly graded immersed curves in the torus, or equivalently as singly graded immersed curves in this infinite cylinder. And I'm almost always going to do the latter for a variety of reasons. Among other things, the pictures are easier to draw if I work in those covering spaces. And then, you know, the Alexander grading is just encoded in the picture. The Maslov grading, I won't really say much about. The Mazov grading, I won't really say much about, but I'll just say that there is sort of a standard notion of what it means for an immersed Lagrangian to be graded. And the Mazov grading sort of fits with that notion of being graded. That's all I'll say. So now we have this bounding co-chain that's a bit mysterious at this point. And as a partial way of saying what it is, this is a linear combination of A linear combination of the self-intersection points of gamma, of this inverse multi-curve. Almost, except I also have to pick sort of a chosen point on each component of gamma, and I include those in with my self-intersection points. Although these have a little bit different roles, like for instance, these points have to have non-zero coefficients. So, for instance, if I'm working with ZMI2 coefficients, I can ignore that part. And then a linear combination. And then a linear combination of self-intersection points is just a subset of self-intersection points. So you may want to think mod two coefficients and just think B is a subset of self-intersection points. It's not just any subset or linear combination. It has to satisfy some technical condition, which again I will put off stating. But for now, I'll just call it the no-monogons condition, which will hopefully be clear later in the talk. But I will say that this condition is fairly restricted. But I will say that this condition is fairly restrictive, so I can't just sort of pick any self-intersection points at random. I have to choose them fairly carefully. That said, there are still like multiple choices that I could make, even representing the same complex. So going back to this theorem statement, one thing that's a bit unsatisfying with this as written here is that I can represent CFK- in this way, but I haven't given a uniqueness claim here. It turns out that there are. It turns out that there are multiple choices of gamma, multiple choices of B that will represent C of K minus. So, in an ideal world, we would have some sort of normal form that we could pick the simplest such representative, and that would be an invariant. And this is a part of this work that is still in progress because I can't do that in a fully satisfying way. But there are some things we can say. So we can. We can and we will assume, for instance, that these immersed curves, this collection of immersed curves, gamma, is in minimal position, meaning that it has minimal self-intersection point, minimal self-intersection, except as is kind of standard for fluorohomology, we don't allow there to be any immersed annuli. And what that means is if I have sort of two parallel copies of a curve, then I have to do a finger move to introduce some two. Some two intersection points. But other than that, I can assume I have minimal intersection. Okay, there's also, it turns out that these self-intersection points all have an integer index, which I won't really define, but it's determined by the Masov grading. And I can always choose that there are no points of negative index involved in this bounded co-chain. And also the zero. And also, the zero index points have a very special form. So, first of all, these points that I chose on each component that are kind of special, those all have index zero. And those can be included. But otherwise, the only index zero points that I allow come on a non-primitive curve, meaning some curve that wraps around a simpler curve more than one time. If I have such a non-primitive curve, I'll always assume, you know, because up to homotopy, I can do this, that it's parallel almost everywhere, but it's got a lot of. Almost everywhere, but it's got sort of one sort of region where the strands cross each other, and then these intersection points can be included in my bounded code chain. It turns out that these are the only sort of index zero points that are allowed, or I can choose a representative that only has these index zero points. And for people who have seen this immersed curve stuff before in other contexts, let me just point out that this index zero part of the bounding code chain I've described is exactly equivalent to putting a local system on each component of gamma. system on each component of gamma. Okay, so I can always sort of choose representative representative where these conditions hold and if I do that then I can say that the curve I get is well defined up to homotopy. So this gives an invariant and the index zero part of this bounding code chain, which as I said is equivalent to a local system on the curves is also an invariant. However the rest of the However, the rest of the bounding co-chain, there may be sort of different choices of subsets of intersection points that are equivalent. And so I only have invariance up to understanding that equivalence. So the unsatisfying definition is that there are two bounded co-chains are equivalent if they determine the same complex. But it would be nice to have a sort of local moves that we can swap out an intersection point for another and that. And that two are equivalent if I can connect them by a sequence of these moves. And ideally, some sort of normal form, some simplest form that there's always one and only one representative of. We can say sort of, I can say some things along those lines, but I don't, as of yet, have a sort of nice normal form for this quantum code chain. But in practice, what I can say is enough to sort of tell if two of them are equivalent. Okay, so that's That explains kind of the words that appeared in this statement. I do just want to mention quickly that this is stated as a theorem about not-flow homology, but there's not really any topology going on in proving this. This is really just a consequence of an algebraic statement, like really a structure theorem, because we already know that not-flow homology is this sort of bigrated complex. So, this is really the underlying. The underlying result is about bigrated complexes. So let me state this as theorem one prime, which is that any equivalence class of bigrated complex over R is represented by this data. The difference here is that now gamma lives in this infinite strip S, which is what I get by taking that infinite cylinder and cutting it open along the back. I'll say why I do that in a minute, but maybe we'll have. Do that in a minute, but maybe it will help at this point to give an example. Okay, so here's a familiar example if you know not floor homology. This complex on the left is the not-floor homology of the right-handed trefoil. So it's common to draw these bigrated complexes over R in the plane where the vertices are generators. So let's call them A, B, and C. And moving to the left picks up the power of U, and moving down picks up the variable V. picks up the variable v. So the way that we should interpret this is that d of b is u times a plus v times c and the other differentials are zero. Okay, so here's a complex. This theorem says that we should be able to represent this by an immersed curve or okay because I cut the cylinder open I may have some closed components and I may have some sort of immersed arcs whose boundaries are on the sides of the strip. Okay and that's what I get here. I have a single Okay, and that's what I get here. I have a single arc that goes from the left side of the strip to the right side of the strip, like this. Okay, so this immersed curve represents this complex. This is a good point to mention that it's easy to sort of go back the other way. So if I have an immersed curve, I can read off the corresponding complex. And I'll show you how to do that in this example. We first replace every Every marked point with a pair of base points, Z just to the left and W just to the right. And then we draw on the vertical line that goes through all the marked points. And then we take the rounded floor homology of our curve gamma with this blue line, which I'll call mean. Okay, so when I take floor homology, the generator is quite. The generators correspond to intersection points. I have three of them. So this is A, this is B, this is C. And then the differential counts immerse byons. For instance, here's a bigon that goes from B to A. My convention is that red is on the right for byons, so this goes from B to A. It covers the W base point, and so that means it picks up a U, and this corresponds to this arrow. And you can see there's another bygone the other arrow. So if I have any of these Immers curves in this Any of these immersed curves in this strip, this clearly gives me a bigrated complex. The claim is that I can sort of always go, I can always go back the other way for any equivalence class of complex I can find a curve representing it. Okay, so notice that here I'm working in the strip because that allows me to construct these curves for any complex. Complex, but if this complex comes from not floor homology, then I know a little bit more, and that's where this flip map comes in. So in that case, I can glue the sides of the strip together to get this infinite cylinder. And the flip map tells me how to match up the loose ends. So again, for knots in S3, that's not very interesting. There's just one loose end on each side. I just glue them together. But in general, I might have some sort of interesting. Might have some sort of interesting strip here before I glue them up, which tells me how to match up the MS. So combining that gives the M1 that I said before. Okay, so there's one other just theorem I wanted to state, which is that, well, not Florimandi has this really nice surgery formula. This really nice surgery formula, this mapping cone formula that allows us to understand higher formology of surgeries. And this surgery formula translates very nicely to this language of the NAS curves. So if I want to compute HF minus of PQ surgery on K, then I can do this by taking Lagrangian fluoromology in the Mark torus of my decorated immersed curve for the representing CFK with a line of slip P over Q. Okay. So I mentioned that this sort of fits in a context of related work involving immersed curves. I wanted to say a little bit about that here. So the first thing to note is that if we restrict to knots in S3, and if we consider a simplified version of knot floor homology where we set the product u times v equal to zero, then Then, and I guess if we work with Mod2 coefficients, then the analogous statements to theorem 1 and theorem 2 are already known. And they follow by my earlier work with Jake and Liam on bordered phloemology. By the way, what do I mean by the analogous statement? In theorem one, we just forget the bounding co-chain, except for that index zero part, which is equivalent to a local system. And in this theorem two, we're We recover only HF hat instead of minus, but we're taking for homology in the punctured torus rather than the marked torus. The difference is that in the marked torus, we count bygons that cover the marked point. And so this naturally is homology of a chain complex over epidoint U, because we use U to record, you know, how would this cover that marked point? Okay, so why do these simpler results follow? Suppose that we have UV equals zero in Offler. Uh, UV equals zero knot floor complex. Uh, Liches F and Thurston give an algorithm showing that this is equivalent to the bordered floor homology CFD of the knot complement. And then we show that that can be interpreted as immersed curves with local systems and the bunker tops. Okay, so what I'm describing now kind of gives us another way of cutting this corner and going straight straight to MERS curves from malfunctions, which I think. Which I think is in a on its own is interesting because I think there are people out there that are pretty familiar with not phletmology, but have maybe yet to delve into bordered phletomology and are maybe a bit intimidated by type D structures and phony modules, a sort of language connected to bordered. So, if you're in that category and you're interested in learning more about these in this curves, I think this sort of direct construction might be a good way to learn about it. Construction might be a good way to learn about it. Okay, I'm going to do this next part quickly because I'm a little behind, but I wanted to make a couple remarks about this HRW result, which is that it actually turns out to be a special case of a more general correspondence due to Hayden, Katsarkov, and Konsevich. They showed that for certain types of surfaces, they looked at the Foucault category of the surface, which can be thought of as in an Be thought of as in a natural way as type D structures over some algebra associated to the surface, and they show that that's equivalent to immersed curves in that surface with local systems. So, this is kind of the case of that when the surface is a torus minus a disk. So, our result kind of ended up giving an independent reproof of this one in certain cases, but the advantage of it wanted. But the advantage of it, one advantage of it is it's very explicit and constructive, whereas the HKK proof is less constructive and a bit harder to use in practice. And more recently, Kotelsky, Watson, and Zabralius sort of extended this constructive proof to recover this full correspondence. And I wanted to mention that in doing this, they also made a nice observation of sort of another way of getting immersed curves from not photomology. Curves from not flat homology. And their observation is just that a chain complex over what I'm calling R hat, which is R mod U equals zero, chain complex over that is the same thing as a type D structure over that. And it turns out that R hat happens to be the algebra associated to a surface. And so we immediately get a MERS curve with local systems in that surface. And the surface is basically that the cut open punctured cylinder. Punctured cylinder cut open. Punctured tor is cut open to be a punctured cylinder. And then for knots in S3, it's obvious how to sort of glue the ends back together. So we have a couple of ways that we can sort of avoid passing through border photomology and get immersed curves in this setting. The real motivation for understanding this direct arrow is so that we can generalize. Generalize, suppose that we don't set u equal to zero and we're interested in this stronger not invariant CFK minus. Well, we can't pass through bordered phlemology because we don't currently have a minus version of bordered phlemology, at least not in print, although I believe it's still in progress by Lipschitz, Elsbeth, and Thurston. But even if we have this, we also can't just sort of for free use this HKK style correspondence for this vertical arrow. K-style correspondence for this vertical arrow because that as done now wouldn't apply in this setting. But what I'm saying is that we can still sort of directly get this arrow. So one quick comment about this that's nice is that, okay, even though we don't have sort of word HF minus, one would probably expect this diagram to sort of commute in some sense. So this now gives us a So, this now gives us a candidate for the immersed curve version of border of HF minus. And so, we would hope that then the pairing would extend to arbitrary pairings, where the Sergi formula just sort of pairs an arbitrary manifold with a solid torus. And the takeaway that I wanted to stress is that I guess I'm interested in what's the difference between Between the sort of minus and the hat invariants. How are they structurally different, and what's the nature of the extra information in the stronger invariant? And so it seems that the difference between minus and hat in this case corresponds to the difference between working in the Foucault category of a marked versus a punctured surface. And I may not be using those two terms in the same way that someone who studies the Foucault category more than me would. So I apologize for the confusion if. For the confusion, if that's not consistent. But what I mean by that is what I said before: that in both cases, the MRIS curves don't hit the marked or punctured point. Homotopies of curves can't pass it, but I do count discs that cover a marked point. I don't count discs that cover a punctured. Okay, and also, so I'm interested in like what exactly is the extra information I need to encode to bump up from hat to minus, and I have a pretty clear picture of that. And I have a pretty clear picture of that now. It's exactly decorating the symmetric curve with a bounding coaching. Okay, so if bounding coachings are so important and they're the big new thing, I guess I should now finally tell you what they are. So Adam Levine, sorry to interrupt, has a question. He says: Does this recover the hat immersed curves bordered invariant in the case where the manifold isn't an L-space? Yes, I believe so. I mean, I would have to think more later in case I'm forgetting something stupid, but basically this should sort of encode the immers curves for knots in arbitrary manifolds. If the knot isn't in an L space, if the three manifold isn't in an L space, then you end up getting sort of multiple. Uh, you end up getting sort of multiple multiple curves and sort of multiple screen C structures. So, you're not just going to have one copy of this infinite tor infinite cylinder, you might have multiple copies of it. But yes, I think that you should you should recover the curves in that case. Okay, so I want to tell you about bounding co-chains. And I'm not going to give the most precise or the most general definition. Bounding co-chains are something that arises. Bounding coachings are something that arise naturally in the immers Lagrangian floor theory, but I'm going to try to tell you sort of what they translate to in this very special case of immersed curves in a surface, which is much easier. And I'm going to try to sort of motivate a bit where they come from. So let's say I'm looking at fluorhomology. And by the way, if it's not clear, when I say fluorhomology, I mean I built a chain complex. I mean, I built a chain complex generated by intersection points and the differential counts immersed by gons. You can think of this as being like putting a symplectic structure on the surface and this is all a grounded floor homology, but it turns out we don't have to do that. For curves on a surface, we can define this all combinatorially. So, for example, here I have that dx equals y, so then there's nothing else going on in the diagram. Now, what I would like Now, what I would like is that I would like for homology to be preserved if I change these curves by a homotopy. But if I allow the curves to be immersed, I can run into problems. So I can, for instance, do this. So here's x, here's y, but I've killed this immersed bygon. There's no immersed bygon in this picture. And so here, dx is zero, and clearly that homology will change. That homology will change. Okay, so that seems bad. You may say, well, maybe I just want to not allow these types of homotopies for some reason. Another argument that there might be a problem is to think about just checking that d squared is zero. So the standard argument for d squared equals zero for immersed for embedded curves, let's suppose I have differentials from x. Suppose I have differentials from x to y and from y to z. There's a few cases to check that are all kind of similar, but let's suppose I have a bygone from x to y above this blue curve and then from y to z below. So I can continue this curve. If it's embedded, it has to escape this region somehow. And if it's embedded, it can't cross the red. So it has to cross the blues here between X and Z at some point W. And now I also have a bygone from X to. Have a bygone from x to w and one from w to z, and that cancels, so I get d squared of zero. So d squared x equals zero. But once again, if I allow my curve to be immersed, then there's no reason it can't just escape through the red curve. And then depending on what it does after that, I may not get anything that cancels. So I may get x, y, z, and d squared x. And d squared x equals z, which is non-zero. Again, that's that's not good. So it turns out that in both these cases, I can sort of trace the problem to the existence of a monogon, like a fishtail or a teardrop-shaped disk that has a single corner that's bounded. That's bounded by the curve. So the problem is monogams are bad, and we can say. Are bad. And we can say in a more precise way algebraically that sort of monogons give an obstruction to b squared equals zero. Okay, so what do we do about this? Well, one solution is we just don't, we just declare, we decree that no monogons are allowed. And this is something that we can do. And a MERS curve is called unobstructed if it doesn't bound any of these monogons in the surface that we're working in. And this approach is. And this approach is fine if we're working in a punctured torus because we can always, up to homotopy, we can always remove any of these by sort of pulling the curve tight, unless it encloses the puncture. But if it encloses the puncture, I don't care because I don't count disks or things that cover the puncture. But this becomes a problem when I pass to the marked Taurus because these do count, and in general, These do count, and in general, I can't remove eights. Okay, so I'm not going to get very far if I restrict to curves that don't have any immersed monogons. Okay, a little bit better thing I could do is just require that all the monogons cancel, that the sine count of them is zero. And this has a much better hope of working, and very often it is sufficient. So here's an example of an immersed curve that comes up very often for Often for not floor homology, it's this figure eight curve, and we see that there's a monogon here, but there's also a monagon here with the same corner. If you care about signs, then they have opposite sign because the curve is oriented oppositely around each of them. So these cancel. So we can still say in this sense that algebraically speaking, there are no monogons. So like I said, this gets us a lot farther, but it Gets us a lot farther, but it's still not always going to be possible. For instance, this isn't going to help us to understand this example because there's only one monogam. There's nothing that can sense it. And I would like to be able to allow this homotopy. Okay, so the other solution is that we can add something to the submerged curve, and that thing we add as a bounding co-chain. It's called a co-chain because it lives in. It's called the co-chain because it lives in the Lagrangian IV co-homology complex of this Lagrangian with itself. Specifically, it lives in the odd degree part of that. And well, that as a vector space, that is generated by self-intersection points of gamma and also one point per component of gamma. So, as I said before, would be a linear combination of those things. Those things. Now, once I have this, I'm going to modify the floor differential. And the way I like to think of this is that I let myself make left turns, 90-degree left turns, at intersection points that are in B. So the way I think this is commonly written down is that we modify the differential to instead of counting bygons, it counts k plus two gons, where all but two of the corners are in B, are our intersection points in B. B, our intersection points in B. I prefer to think about this a little bit differently, which is that I'm going to replace my immersed curves with an immersed train track. So a train track is just a graph where it makes sense to talk about smooth paths because at every vertex, all the edges come in on a common tangent line. And what I do is anytime I have a point. What I do is anytime I have a point in my bounding co-chain, I'm going to add these two sort of like on-off ramps that let me switch from one curve to the other. And then I'm going to do floor homology with this immersed train track. So the boundary of a bygon has to follow this train track in a smooth way. But for instance, would be allowed to take that path, and this could be part of the bygone. Cargo bygon. Okay, so this modifies the notion of counting bygons. It also modifies the notion of counting monogons in the same way. So now I can finally give this sort of defining condition for bounded co-chain, which is that with this modification in mind, now there are algebraically no monogons. And that means that all the problems sort of go into exceptional brief notes as well. So Jonathan, there are a couple of questions in the chat. Questions in the chat. Vera says it looks like there are more ways than one to add the corners. That's a great question. Okay, so yeah, I didn't mention that. So these curves are oriented. And so there's sort of two pairs of quadrants I could choose. First of all, these sort of on-off ramps are oriented. I only allow my boundaries to follow them in a certain way. And the orientation is that I want this to be. And the orientation is that I want this to be: you know, a left turn is allowed, but a right turn would not be allowed. So I only want to be making left turns. And then I want to be making turns that are consistent with the orientation on my immersed curves. So if this is, you know, this one's oriented this way and this way, so I can go with the orientation to with the orientation, or I can go against the orientation to against the orientation, and that tells me which two buttons I have. Orientation, and that tells me which two buttons I've answered all the questions. Okay. Okay, one thing I'll just mention briefly is that when I make these turns, I sort of pick up a weight. For one thing, there is a linear combination over F, so each of these turns picks up some weight in my field. Field. To be simple, you should just think of Zma2 coefficients, so you don't have to worry about that weight. But also, we may need to be weighted by a power of U. But this isn't extra information we have to encode. The power of U that would be picked up is determined by the Maslow gradients. And actually, this is that index I mentioned before. The index is the power of U that would have to be there if there was a left turn. Maybe that will be more clear when I show some examples. Okay, so it's a little bit hard to absorb these definitions quickly. So I wanted to show a few examples. Here's the one that we already saw. The complex for the trefoil. We got a single curve. Remember, it was an arc in the strip, but then I glue the. In the strip, but then I glue the ends together. So, this is a closed curve in this infinite cylinder. Another nice example is the knot farm module of the figure eight knot. This has two components. This square gives me this figure eight component. Like I said, this curve component comes up in many examples. And then there's a second component, which is a curve that. Which is a curve that wraps horizontally around the cylinder. Okay, so these are two immersed curves. Neither of them has a bounding co-chain, or rather, it's the trivial bounding co-chain. For the trefoil, that's obvious because it's supposed to be a linear combination of the intersection points, and there are no intersection points. For the figure eight, there are a few intersection points we could consider, but it turns out the boundary coaching is still just nothing. Okay, so I want to show you an example. Okay, so I want to show you an example that needs a bounding co-chain. It's actually kind of hard to find one, but here's one that I came across. So the exact knot doesn't matter, but this comes from some knot. The complex is bigger, but this is sort of the interesting direct summand of the not for homology. Okay, so I want to first draw the curves. And by the way, I'm not sort of, I'm not going to take time to talk about the proof of where these curves come from. I'd be happy to say. Of where these curves come from, I'd be happy to say more in the discussion time later if people are interested. But the strategies: we first write down the immersed curves, which comes from the UV equals zero simplification, and then we try to sprinkle in the boundary co-chains to recover the diagonal curves. And writing down the curves is very easy if we're lucky enough to have a nice basis, horizontally and vertically simplified basis, for those of you who know what that is. And we have that in this picture. So we ignore the diagonal arrows, we just look at the horizontal and vertical, and we can. The horizontal and vertical, and we can draw a curve pretty quickly. This sort of staircase part of this is going to look like this. And then we have like here, we have a vertical arrow of length three that's going to look like this, and then a horizontal arrow of length one. And then these curves, by the way, are always rotationally symmetric. They come from a not in S3. Okay, so here's. Okay, so here's our immersed curve. But we need to add a bounding co-chain. And one, we know that because the trivial bounding co-chain is in the valid bounding co-chain, right? Because we can see there's a monogon here, and that needs to cancel with something. And the only thing that it could cancel with is if we include this point in the bounding co-chain, which if we were to draw on the orange. If we were to draw on the orientations, you would see corresponds to these terms. And so now we get another monogon here. And similarly, for the same reason down below, this point has to be included. So these gray points are in my bounding co-chain. It's clear that these should be weighted by a power of uv if I want these things to cancel out, right? Because the Because the monogon up here covered the puncture twice, so it's gonna the mark point, so it's gonna cover Z and W twice each. So it's gonna pick up sort of U squared, V squared. And so if I want this to cancel, this new monogon picks up one copy from covering the puncture, and it also picks up another copy from the weight when I make this left turn. Okay, so now we can. Okay, so now we could go back and see if this encodes the right complex. And basically, we want to look at the diagonal arrows and see if we recover them. So some of them we recovered without the bounding co-chain. Remember, we're going to draw on this vertical line to the mark points and take floor homology. So for instance, here we have a Z and a W, W here. Down here we have a bygon that covers W twice. That covers W twice and Z once. And it turns out that that corresponds to this, that gives us this diagonal arrow here. Similarly, there's something that recovers this one. But without the bounding co-chain, I just, I wouldn't get the other diagonal arrows, which is another way of seeing that I need it. But now that I have the bounding co-chain, I once again make these turns. And so I I get a bygon here, which covers W once, and it also picks up a Z and a W from that left turn. And it turns out that that corresponds to this of L. Okay, so here we see an example of a non-trivial bounding co-chain being needed to recover the diagonal arrows. But it's still the case, as I said, that there was no choice to make here. The bounding co-chain is just determined. Choice to make here. The bounding coaching is just determined once I know the curve. So I wanted to show an example of where that's not the case, where I have one curve that has two different non-equivalent choices of bounding co-chain. I actually don't know yet of an example that comes from a knot, but this is an example, algebraic example that I learned from Zhen Hong. And it's sort of this big square, which is going to give me a big figure eight component. And then And then our horizontal curve. So remember, I draw the MRIS curves by ignoring diagonal arrows, just looking at the horizontal and the vertical arrows. That's the u v equals zero simplification. So that's going to be the same on both sides. On the left, I'm done. There's no bounding co-chain. There's no diagonal arrows I need to pick up. But on the right, I want to include this point in my bounding co-chain. This point in my bounded coaching. And the orientations are such, I didn't draw in the orientations, but they're such, I guess I should maybe like that. So I can make the turns as drawn. And now this point, it turns out, will pick up a power of u and v. And so this little tiny bygon that makes a turn is going to give me this diagonal. This diagonal here. Okay, it's known that these complexes are not homogeneously equivalent to each other. So these are these, this choice of bounding co-chain is actually like encoding some information in this example. Okay, so I want to just mention one property that's maybe might be apparent from these examples that is going to be relevant in the last. Examples that is going to be relevant in the last few minutes of the talk, which is that if these NOTs come from S3, I have this multi-curve. I'll call the components of it gamma0 up to gamma n. And this multi-curve, if it's a nod in S3, intersects sort of the back, the vertical line in the back of the cylinder, as x equals plus or minus one half. It intersects that exactly once. And so up to reordering the components, I'll always assume that this distinguished component that wraps around the cylinder. component that wraps around the cylinder, I'll call that gamma zero. Gamma zero turns out to be very interesting and it carries a lot of nice information about the knot. For instance, it turns out to be a concordance invariant. This isn't a new concordance invariant. Gamma zero is equivalent to the epsilon equivalence class defined by Gen Hom. But this is kind of a nicer way of writing down an epsilon equivalence class, I think. And a lot of other concurrency variants that we care about can be easily extracted from this curve. Like tau is the height of the first time. Tau is the height of the first time this curve hits the vertical axis. And epsilon tells you after that first time it hits the axis, does it turn up, turn down, or go straight? And these phi i invariants count sort of arcs in gamma zero of different lengths. Okay, so that isn't really important for this talk, but I do want to point out that gamma zero is like an interesting feature of these curves for not semester. Okay, so I wanted to. Okay, so I wanted to end by trying to show you why this geometric perspective on AutoDMAD might be useful. And I'm low on time, so I'm going to skip through this first application that I have in my notes. But really, all I wanted to say is that this kind of gives us a very explicit way of seeing what is the extra information in minus. Information in minus, and the answer is in a lot of cases not very much. It turns out that very often, at least for small examples, the bounding coaching is determined once I know the curves. So there's only one choice of bounding coaching that's valid, two equivalents. So this tells me that in those cases, Cfk minus is determined by this UV equals zero complex, which is handy because the UV equals zero complex is now very easy to compute using the border tangle invariance of usbaf and zabo and a very very Very powerful computer program that Zoltan wrote. So we can sort of compute the immersed curves, then stare at them and say, like, is CFK minus determined by this or not? And for instance, for all amounts up to 15 crossing, as I said, I don't actually yet know of an example where CFK minus is not determined by U equal to a complex. If anyone knows of such an example, I would love to see it. Okay, but the application I wanted to end with. The application I wanted to end with is some obstructions to some progress on the cosmetic surgery convector. And this is, I think this just nicely demonstrates, I should say that this application doesn't actually require a minus. It's enough to work with HF hat. So we don't need this boundary co-chain stuff. But I think this nicely demonstrates how when we shift our perspective from staring at these algebraic invariants to looking at these pictures of immersed curves. To looking at these pictures of immersed curves, in some cases, it can allow us to notice things that were overlooked before. And of course, I could give a whole talk on this, so this will be very quick. I just kind of want to give a flavor of how these inverse curves play into proving something like this. So the cosmetic surgery conjecture says that if I do two surgeries on the same knot K, and I get diffeomorphic manifolds, then the surgeries had to be the same surgery. Serveries had to be the same server, the same slope. I'll just briefly say a couple things that were known. And this is by no means an exhaustive list, but I want to highlight how Haggard floor homology has been used especially. But first, I'll point out that just by looking at H1, the first homology, it's clear that the numerator of the two soaps has to agree. So using Hager Florimology, Azubath and Zabo combined with a result. Combined with a result of Wu shows that these slopes actually have to have opposite sign. Really, Azaboth and Zalbo show that the slopes have opposite sign or the knot is an L-space knot. And then we'll observe that we can rule out all L-space knots using an earlier obstruction in terms of the Alexander polynomial. Because L-space knots have a very special Alexander form of Alexander polynomial. Another big step forward was the result of Ni and Wu. Of Ni and Wu that showed that if there's a potential counterexample, a potential cosmetic surgery, it would be called, the tau invariant has to be trivial. The slopes are not just opposite sign, they're actually opposite. And there's a condition on Q and P. Q squared is converted to minus one mod P. As far as I know, this was pretty much the state of the art for obstructing these cosmetic surgeries until recently. And I want to say that, so both of these. And I want to say that so both of these use Hager-Flohr module, which kind of makes sense because, so, how would we go about proving a statement like this? We would want a three-manifold invariant to distinguish the surgeries, and we would want a good way of computing this three-manifold invariant in terms of surgeries. And so, we have that with Heger for homology, a pretty good three-manifold invariant and a nice surgery formula, this mapping comb formula. formula. But the thing is that the mapping cone formula, for those of you who are familiar with it, it's pretty cumbersome. And I think it's hard to sort of extract all the information. So both of these results only use partial information about hydrical homology. So this uses the total rank of HF hat and Ni and Wu used the D invariance, which you can think of as, so all the generators of HF had our grade. So, all the generators of HFHAT are graded and they split over spin C structures. And in each spin C structure, there's one like special grading, and that's the deep thing. So, we use a total rank, and we've used a special grading in each spin C structure, but we haven't used all of the information there. So, what I did was just use the full HF hat as a gradient vector space. And I was able to show that if I do have a cosmetic surgery, a purely cosmetic A cosmetic surgery, a purely cosmetic surgery. We know already from Nien Wu that the slopes are opposite. Oh, one other thing I wanted to say is that the Ni Wu proof is actually it shows something a little bit stronger, not just that tau is zero, but that this component gamma zero is trivial, which I'll use later. Okay, so if we have a counterexample to the cosmetic surgery conjecture, then I Example to the cosmetic surgery conjecture, then I know that p has to be one or two. If p is two, then q is one and the genus of the knot has to be two. And if p is one, then I can give an upper bound on q in terms of the knot, in terms of the genus and the Hegridforth thickness. And there's also a bunch of other constraints on not phlohomology that would have to be satisfied that are not easy to concisely state. But the point is that like the stars kind of have to align for this to happen. The not-phorometer has to have a very particular form. Not floating modgi has to have a very particular form, and it doesn't happen very often at all. So, this is a very strong obstruction. You know, it can be used to sort of prove the conjecture in a lot of cases. So, for instance, by a computer, we can just check, you know, I check up through 16 crossings that the conjecture holds. There's some other families that follow from this, or combining this with other work, with other techniques that people have done. Okay, and nearly out of time, so. And nearly out of time, so I just want to give you a flavor of how this proof goes and where immersed curves come into it. And basically, the proof is mostly summed up in this picture. Sorry, not the proof, but the key observation, the key observation that we work with with the proof. So assume I have my MREST curves. As I said, we know by the new and we result that gamma zero. That gamma zero, the distinguished component is trivial, so it's just horizontal. All the others then can be sort of live in a neighborhood of the vertical line through the puncture, through the punctures. In this picture, to make the picture cleaner, I'll sort of unroll the cylinder to the plane. But we can assume that those that the other components are sort of a bunch of vertical segments away from the punctures. And then they match up in some way, like maybe. Like, maybe I do that, but away from these mark points, I just get a bunch of vertical segments. So, if I stare at this picture, for instance, oh, and then the surgeries, the claim is that HF hat of the surgeries are given by fluorohomology with this blue and the green line. These curves are in minimal position, so there's going to be no differentials. So, the fluorhomology is just generated by intersection points. It's clear showing at this picture that, for instance, the total rank agrees. That, for instance, that the total rank agrees, which isn't surprising because we already use the total rank as an obstruction to get down to this case. But it's clear that the total rank agrees. And also, there's sort of an obvious sort of bijection between the intersection points. And this gives us a non-graded isomorphism between the two HF hats. So I would like to obstruct these two HF hats from being graded isomorphism. Of hats from being graded isomorphic to each other. Of course, it's not enough to show that this map doesn't preserve gradings, that this map never will preserve gradings, but there could be some other map that does. But what's nice about this map is I can very explicitly say what this map does do to the gradings. So I'm working, I'm going to work with sort of a shifted version of the grading. A Maslow grading is shifted by the deep environment. And it turns out that And it turns out that the sort of difference, the grading of phi of x minus grading of x, is just given by 1 minus the area of this shaded triangle, where by area I mean number of punctures covered. And in particular, that area is always non-negative, and it can only be zero if this point sort of happens on one of these. On one of these middle height vertical segments, because otherwise I'm at least going to say pick up that one. Okay, so my grading goes up by one if I was coming from a height zero vertical segment, and otherwise it goes down by at least one. And then the proof is to just play around with this and see what kind of conditions have to be satisfied for the set of gradings to be preserved when I apply a fee. As one simple example, we can. As one simple example, it was already proved by Wang that the conjecture holds for genus 1 knots. This gives, I think, a nice reproof of that because if the genus is 1, the genus is the maximum height of this curve. So if the genus is 1, the maximum height is here, the minimum height is here. So all the vertical segments are at height 0, which means all of the generators have their grading go up by 1 under this map, and there's nothing that decreases. And so there's no way this sets of gradings could be the same. That's great. I'm skipping the same. And playing similar games, we can sort of come up with a lot of obstructions on the form, not form on GS. Okay, I ran a little bit over, so I will stop here. Okay, let's all unmute and thank Jonathan. That was a really great talk. Why don't we save questions for breakout? I'd like to give people a little bit of time. To give people a little bit of time to
