Okay, well, first of all, thank you. I want to thank the organizers for this wonderful event and of course for accepting this talk. I'm very happy to be here because actually this is my first time as a speaker in an international conference. So I'm very excited about it and of course for the opportunity to share with you. Course, for the opportunity to share with you the things that I have been doing with Deborah Oliveros and Jorge Ramirez Alfoncin for my PhD project. So, thank you again, and I hope you enjoyed this talk. So, let me start talking about the Borsu problem, which I think is a very well-known problem, at least for all of us. Actually, on Monday, Andre talked a little bit about it, but just in order to but just in order to have a starting point let me recall this uh this problem i think the beauty of this problem is that you don't need a very strong background in order to understand the question so in 1933 carol borsuk asked in one of his papers the following question is every bounded subset s of r d the union of at most d plus one subset such as such that each of which Such as such that each of which has a smaller diameter than the diameter of s. Several mathematicians start to work in this problem. And I think nobody knows when this question became a conjecture and for several years was known as the Vorsuk conjecture. And a lot of mathematicians thought that this conjecture was true, but at the end of the day, But at the end of the day, well, I think everyone here knows what happened. So just let me rephrase this problem in terms of the Borsuch number. So the Borsuch number of a subset S of R D that we will denote as A of S is the least number of subsets that S can be partitioned such that each of which has a smaller diameter than S. So the Bursu conjecture can Borsou conjecture can now be written as follows. So, does every bounded set in Rd have Borsuk number at most d plus one? So, that's the famous Borsuk problem. So, what has been done around this problem? Well, the problem is true in dimension one, which is actually trivial. In dimension two, Carl Borsuk proved himself that it was true. Prove himself that it was true also. And in dimension three, Perkel, Eglson, and Gruban prove it true using universal coverings. Another interesting result is that every subset in Rd with smooth boundary has World Sub number at most d plus one. But sadly, in 1933, Jeff Kahn and Jean Khalai proved it false for each dimension greater than 2014. And later, more controversial. And later, more contract samples were found. And until today, as far as I know, the conjecture is false in dimension greater than 63. So this is still an open problem, right? So just I want to recall that. But however, the question that we have been working on is a little bit different and it is more like a kind of characterization. kind of characterization. So the question is how are the subsets S of R3 that have the maximum number, the maximum Borsouk number? In other words, how are the subsets of R3 that have Borsouk number 4? That's our main question. So the motivation of this question is that Volcransky proved in R2 that a subset S has Borsouk number 3 if and only if it has a unique completion to a body of constant width. So a natural thing. With so a natural thing is to try to generalize this idea to R3. Unfortunately, this approach is not true because if you take the tetrahedron, which has Borsuk number four, there are at least three bodies of contact with that I know that cover the tetrahedra. So, this idea doesn't help in R3. And also, in 2014, Michali Hunter and Schott Lange. Michali Hunter and Schott Lange started to characterize the finite set of points with Borsouk number four, and they did it up to seven points. So our main result is that we were very lucky to find a characterization for all the finite set of points in our tree that have forsook number four. And that's what I want to talk today. Our approach was to use ball polyhedra that are very useful objects in this kind of problems. So I know that most of you have worked with ball polyhedra before, but just to be on the same page, let me recall the definition. So ball polyher essentially is that you have a finite set of points with circumgradi less than one. You take all the balls with central. Take all the balls with center in these points and then intersect all of them. So, what you get is a ball polyhedron. And the nice thing about these objects is that these objects have several cool properties, as we can define phases on the boundary of these objects in a very natural way. So, for example, we can define a facet of a ball polyhedra. Facet of a ball polyhedra as the set of points on the boundary that are just in one sphere. We can define also the vertices as the set of points on the boundary that are in at least three of the balls. This kind of vertex we call it principal vertex, and we have also dangli vertex, which are the vertices that are exactly in two walls, but this. Balls, but these points have to be in the original set of the ball polyhedral. And then we can define also a set of edges on the boundary. And the idea is just to take the points in the intersection of two walls that joint two vertices. So it's like very natural way to define the faces of these objects. Of these objects. In particular, the one skeleton of this ball polyhedra is the set of vertices and edges used as a graph. So we can study these objects from the one skeleton. This set of vertices, including the full face and the empty phase, is what we call the spherical phase complex. But this structure is not necessarily an algebraic lattice. Necessarily an algebraic lattice by contention, which means that it's not kind of a polyptope in several cases. But, well, in a very natural way to proceed is that, well, you add that condition, and then you get a very cool object, which is called a standard ball polyheron, right? Adding this property, you get that the one skeleton of a standard ball polyhedron is. Of a standard for all polyheron is simple planar and tree connected graph. And this was proved by Lange, Nasodi, and Besdek and Papez in 2007. So a very popular family of standard ball polyhedron are what is the family of Rouleau polyhedra, which is a standard ball polyhedra, but adding that condition that But adding that condition that the vertices of this ball polyhedron are actually the set of points of the center of the balls where that we use to create that object. So let me put all this information in a chart. Just we start with the bulb polyhedra family and then we got a condition and we got the standard bulb polyhedra and then we got the rouleau polyhedra family. So any questions of far? So, any questions so far? It's good. Yeah. Okay. So, another approach to study bulk alhira is to use the Vasongi problem, which is also a very well-known problem and very simple one too, I think. And it says that what is the maximum number of diameters over all set of points of all sets of points. end of the of all sets of endpoints in R tree? That's the question. And there are several papers solving this problem. Actually, Conrad has a very cool paper about this problem, a new proof, I think. But what we are going to use in this case is this extended GHS theorem proved by Cupids, Martini, and Perlis in 2010, because this 2010, because this theorem, of course, answers the Vasenji problem, but also give a characterization of all the extremal configuration for this problem. So how the points has to be in order to attain this maximum number of diameters, which is actually 2n minus 2. So the condition of this set in order to have this This set in order to have this number of diameters is that the set has to be tight, which means that when you create the ball polyhedron over V and you take one of these points of V, the induced polyhedron is different than the original one. So in other words, all the points in V are necessary to construct the ball polyhedron. Polyhedron. And the other condition is that V is actually the set of vertices of this ball polyhedron. So it's a very cool theorem because it says how the configuration has to be. And then in the same paper, they gave some structure about the one skeleton of these objects. So given a tight finite set, subset V. Finite set, subset V of R3 with at least three points, the one skeleton of this polyhedron is planar to connect, right? So it's a little bit weaker than the other proof that we saw because we are not asking for an algebraic lattice in this case, but well, it's still some, it has some structure. And another theorem that they prove is that if you have a set of That if you have a set of points in extrema Vasongi configuration, there is an involution from V to the facets of the polyhedron that satisfies that V is not in tau of V and U is in tau of V if and only if V is in tau of U. So this is actually kind of natural involution when we study this problem. Problem. And this involution is called the canonical involution, and it can be actually extended to the edges in a natural way in order to preserve contentions. So going back again to the chart, we have two ways to study ball polyhedron. So an interesting thing about the Valjendi problem is that it has a relation with the definite version of the Borsu. With the definite version of the Borsou problem in R3, right? So we can prove through Vasangi problem that the Borsou problem is true for a finite case in R3. Then in the same paper, the authors prove, well, define a new subfamily of extremal configuration that they call critical configurations, which is the family that avoids. Family that avoids dangly vertices. So, these vertices that only have two diameters, they say, okay, let's remove it because they are like these vertices of these points are not so important. So, they remove it. And then they gave a different family, another subfamily of extremal configuration that they called strongly critical configurations. That actually is a family that doesn't allow subsets in extremal configurations. Subsets in extremal configuration for the Vasenji problem. So, in other words, it's the minimal structures that have the property of the Vasenji problem, right? So they said in that paper that this family actually were different, but they didn't prove it. They just say that they had an example of a configuration that is critical, but not strongly critical. But they didn't put the They didn't put the example, they just said that there's an example of a point. So we actually made this example and we are very convinced that these families actually are different. So finally, another interesting thing is that it's already known that the vertices of a roulette polyhedron it has Vorsouk number four. Hasbur soup number four. And this was proved by Lang. Well, it was mentioned by Lange in one of his papers. But the proof that I want to recall is the one that Luis and Edgardo did in one of their papers using graph theory. So the idea is to define this self-dual graph, which is called a strongly involved polyheron. Polyheron that is simple, planar reconnected. So, if we have an involution from the vertices to the faces of the graph that satisfies that v is not in theta, theta of v, v is not in theta of v. And the second condition is that u is in theta of v if and only if v is in theta of u. So, this is very familiar, right? It's like the This is very familiar, right? It's like the almost the canonical involution, but in roughs, okay? So, notice that since the set of vertices of a roulette polyhedron is in an extravagal configuration for the Basungi problem, then the one skeleton of a roulette polyhedron has the canonical involution, which implies that this is a strongly involutive polyheron. So, study this graph, it's almost to study the one skeleton of a The one skeleton of our loop polyher. Another definition that we are going to need now that we are in the graph theory world is that a set of points V in R3, a finite set of points of R3, the diameter graph of this set of points that we are going to denote as dg of V is the graph with the set of vertices V and two vertices have an edge if and only if Vertices have an edge if and only if the distance between them is equal to the diameter of B. So, this is actually a very natural definition. And clearly, if you find the chromatic number of this graph, then you have the Borsuk number of this set of points. Another definition, but this is for a graph, for the graph that we have defined. So, let G be a strongly involved polyhedron, the diagonal graph. polyhedron, the dianonal graph of this, I'm sorry, the diagonal graph of this graph is the set of points vertices V, which is the vertices of this graph. And X1 and X2 is an edge if and only if X1 is in theta of X2, right? So these definitions are almost the same, actually, in the rouleopoly here. Actually, in the Roulette polyhedron world, it's the same definition, but in general, we don't know if all the strongly involutive polyhedrons are actually a roulette polyhedron. So I just want to recall the little difference between these two definitions. Well, using the second definition, as I said, Luis, Edgardo, Eric, and Miguel proved that the chromatic number of the Prove that the chromatic number of the diagonal graph of a strongly involved polyhedron is four, right? And they use a very cool operation that they call the delayed contract operation. So if we, if this, well, since this theorem is true, if V of B is a rouletop polyhedron and G is the one skeleton, then the The diameter graph of B and the di isomorphic to the diagonal graph of G, and therefore the Borsuk number of the Borsuk number of B is equal to the chromatic number of the diagonal graph of B, which is equal to the chromatic number of the diameter, the diagonal graph of G, the diagonal graph of G, and it's equal to four. So this is. And it's equal to four. So, this is kind of the proof. So, this is the background where we start to work. So, I don't know if there's any question. I think all of these terms are very well-known things. So, what we did, it was first to prove that the vertices of Aroullo polyhiron are actually critical Borsouk configuration, which means that. Configuration, which means that if you remove any of the vertices of the Rouloup polyhedron, then the Borsuk number decreases. So, this was our first step. So, in order to do that, we extend a little bit the results that Luis, Edgardo, Méric, and Miguel did, only adding the fact that, well, the diagonal graph of an involutive polyhedron is for the chromatic. Polyhedron is four, the chromatic number is four, but also is critical in the sense of the vertices. So you remove any of these vertices, the chromatic number decreases. The idea of the proof, it's a little bit tricky because it's very technical, but what I think is cool about this proof is that we can embed this graph on This graph on this sphere in a very nice way. And in a nice way, I mean that there is a paper that Luis Montejano, Jorge, and Ivan Rasky wrote about antipodal graphs, where they know how to put an involutive polyhedron on a sphere in such a way that you have control over all the diameters of the graph. So that's a very cool embedding of the graph. Embedding of the graph on the sphere. And then, if you take any of the vertices of the graph, then I can make a coloring for the remaining vertices of the graph. And this is basically the idea of the proof. I don't have enough time to show you a little bit more about it, but yeah, that's the way that we did it. So we have this implication here, which is the key lemma, and we call it key lemma. The Kilema, and we call it Kilema because it's the result that is going to help us for almost all the results that we have. So that's why we call it Kilema. Then there was a conjecture also in the same paper as Coopits, Martini, and Perles that they said that if you have an extreme male set V for the Bason D problem, this subset has a polytopal. set has a polytopal which means that it has algebraic lattice of the ball in in the ball poly polytope induced by this set if and only if is strongly critical for the basongy problem so this family is going to help us to characterize these other sets and we did prove this conjecture using first some First, some graph theory, and then we used the key lemma. So, the theorem that we prove is that let V, a subset R3, be an external configuration for the Vaccine G problem, and let G be the one skeleton of this ball polyhedron, then V is strongly critical if and only if is a simple planar and tree connected graph. So, it's almost the same that they prove for the standard. They prove for the standard bulb polyhedron. So, the first implication, it's almost done because if you have a strongly critical configuration, then you can prove very easily that it's simple, thanks to the involution. You can prove that it's planar and two connected by the result of Martini and Perlet and Cupid. So, the remaining thing to do is to prove the three connected property. Property. But this is actually a very technical proof also in graph theory. You have to, well, we proceed by contradiction, supposing that these two connected only, and then we saw the structure and we counted the diameters there, the edges, and we got a contradiction. So I'm going to skip that thing, but it's actually true. The second implication is more interesting, I think, because we use Lemma 1. use lemma lemma one to well key lemma for for this uh for in order to prove this so first of all we take uh well g since g is simple planar tree connected and is in extremal configuration for the basong problem then we can say that g is a strongly involutive polyhedron because there is this canonical involution um then by key lemma uh g is four critical And let's proceed by contradiction. If B is not a strongly critical configuration, then there is a subset V1 of B, which it is. Then, by the first part of the proof, the one skeleton of this new subset is simple planar and reconnected, then G1 is also a strongly involved polyhedron. So, this diameter graph of G1. Diameter graph of G1 is for critical two holding a contradiction. So basically, what we use is the criticity of the result. So if B is a strongly critical configuration, then by staining this characterization, B of B has an algebraic lattice. So B of B is a standard ball polyhedron. Furthermore, by the extended GH theorem, B of B is a roulette polyhedron because all the vertices. Because all the vertices of this ball polyhedron are actually B. So, what we got so far is the equivalence between the vertices of our below polyhedron and the strongly critical configurations. So, I think this is a cool overview of the thing that we have doing. And finally, our main result is that is the following one that says that let V a finite. That let V a finite set of points with at least four points, the following three statements are equivalent. So, V is strongly critical for the Vasenji problem if and only if the diameter graph V is for critical, and this is if and only if the ball polyhedron B of B is our low polyhedron. That's our main result. One implies two, three, and three implies one. Three and three implies one, it's already proven in the last theorem. So three implies two is actually the key lemma, and the only remain proof is that two implies one, right? And again, we are going to use Kilema to prove this. So since the diameter graph of B is four critical, then each V of B has degree at least three in the diameter. at least three in the diameter in the diameter graph and then by definition v is a subset of vertices of b of b so v is tight all the all the all the points are required for for the construction of this ball poly here then we have two cases case one is well if v is uh all the vertices of v of v then by the extended gh theorem v is external for the vast genius problem Extreme for the Vasjondi problem. And if we proceed again by contradiction, if B wouldn't be a strongly critical configuration for the Vashonji problem, there is a proper subset V1 of B, which is strongly critical for the Vashony problem. But since one implies two, then again, the diameter graph of V1 is four critical, which is a contradiction. So in this case, it has to be an strongly critical. To be a strongly critical configuration. The second case is that V is not all the vertices of B of V. So by the extended GHF theorem, again, well, this is not an extremal configuration for the Valjean problem. But since the subset is tight, then we can find actually, yeah, and we can suppose that there is not an uh there there is not an an extremal subconfiguration there is not an external configuration in v because uh by the same argument that in case one that that would hold again a contradiction so let's uh let's take a point in the vertices of v of v that is that is not in v then v has to be adjacent to at least three diameters so defining this new set v1 Set V1, that is the union of V with this point that we found, which has at least three more diameters, this subset is closer to be a vagina extremal configuration because you are adding three diameters and you are just adding one extra point. So we can repeat this process in a finite number of times in order to get. Number of times in order to get a new VR, which is actually external configuration for the Vajrayan D problem. And then again, since this subset has not an external configuration for the Bashan-Pri problem, then this is a strongly critical configuration for the Bashmi problem. It's the first set that has this property. Then, again, since one implies two, the Since one implies two, the diameter graph of this new subset is for critical, which is a contradiction because it contains another subset that has actually, that is for critical. So this is the proof of this equivalence between vertices of Arboulo polyhedron, the extremely critical configuration for the Bashoni problem, and the critical Borsu configurations. So finally, So finally, just say, generalizing this result for any Borsuk, for any set with Borsuk number four, we have these three equivalents. So a V subset of R3, a finite set V of R3 with at least four points, the following three statements are equivalent. So V has a subset for which is an extremal configuration for the yeah, V has a subset in extra extra. V has a subset in the extreme configuration for the Vashani problem. Sorry about it. This is equivalent to say that V has Borsuk number four, and this is equivalent to say that there is a subset V1 of B such that when you take this ball polyhedron, it's actually a roulette polyhedron. So this is a cool, I think, relation between two famous problems and this structure that is also very, very common structure. So thank you for the attention and I don't know if Thank you for the attention, and I don't know if you have any questions. Okay, are there any questions? Oh, yeah. So, my question is: Can you show the key lemma again and just say a couple words about it? Oh, yeah, of course. Okay, so let me go back. Oh, yeah, sorry. Okay, sorry. Okay, so the key lemma says that if you have if G is an extremely volatile polyhedron. G is an strongly volatile polyhedron, then the diagonal graph of this graph is four-critical. This means that the chromatic number is four, and deleting any vertex of this graph, then the chromatic number decrease. So what we had is just the criticity, so this part. And the idea of the proof, as I said, is to find a very cool embedding of this strongly involutive graph. Of this strongly involutive graph on the sphere. So, the idea is that if you have antipodal self-dual graph and you see the incident graph of this graph, then you can find an embedding of this incident graph in an antipodal way. So, this gives us a lot of information about the diagonals of this graph. So, since we know how are the diagonals of this graph, we can color it very carefully. We can color it very carefully, just splitting the sphere into regions and say, okay, this region is going to be this color and this color and this color. So it's a very technical thing because we have to analyze a little bit more about these kind of graphs to say, okay, if you find, if you see the dual face of this vertex, where you see it, blah, blah, blah, then you can find a coloration of this, a coloring of this new graph. So, if you take any vertex of this graph, then I can show you, I can give you a trick coloring of the remaining points using this embedding. So, yeah, that's actually. Okay, yeah. Well, the idea is that they prove that if you have the sphere and you And you have an strongly volatile polyhedron, you can define the incident graph. The incidental graph is actually, I think Conrad used it, kind of used it for the proof of the Vajroni problem. But the idea is, for example, if you take the tetrahedral and you define the dual graph of the tetrahedron, then you can put stars here, I don't know, here, here, here. Here, here, you always can find an antipodal embedding of this graph, of this incident graph, the point, the original one, and the dual, in such a way that each point is antipodal. So furthermore, they prove that there is an odd cycle of the original vertices that you can put in the Ecuador, such that there's the thing that you have in the In the North Umifer are the same thing that you have in the Southern Uniform. So you have a symmetry there. So if you have a symmetry there, then you can know, for example, that the diagonals of this vertex is actually in the south part of the sphere. And also for the vertices in the south part of the sphere, the diagonals go to the north part. And if you take the vertices on the Ecuador, they go. They go among them and they can go to the north and the south, but you can actually do a very good coloration with this information. So you just have to be careful to try to split the sphere in order to avoid to give the coloring. So that's mainly the idea. Any more questions? Any more questions? Comments? Yes. For any, yeah, the last one, right? Yeah, for any finite set. That's an excellent question. I think that we can use this approach to generalize this result to any set using solid density of the Roulette polyhedron on the bodies of constant width. But we are not have that result yet. What we hope. That result yet, but we hope we think that is true. That's our guess. That's a good question, actually. That's something that we are working on right now. Any more questions? Maybe for the people online. If you have questions, just shout, please. Okay. Well, if not, let's thank Jivan once again.
