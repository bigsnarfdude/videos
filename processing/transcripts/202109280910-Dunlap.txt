All right, we're going to talk about circadian ribbons today. So I've organized this to give a background on sort of scientific American level background on clocks for the non-biologists, and then talk about some molecular and cellular biology for just to give a context for how different. How difficult some things will be to model that aren't amenable to molecular biology, and then go on to talk about some of the progress we're trying to make with modeling out ofput. So a good place to start is with definition of circadian rhythms. So they're free-running, sustainable oscillations with a period length of about 24 hours, universally associated with latent temperature perception. They show entrainment. Perception, they show entrainment to daily environmental changes. The clock operates within defined physiological limits, and the period length is compensated against changes in temperature. So, as a for instance, here I have sound recorded from forecaster canadensis in Canada in the early spring of 1971, since this was supposed to be a meeting held in northern Canada. So, you'll recall that Castor County. So, you'll recall that Castra canadensis is the North American beaver, and beavers live in beaver lodges. So, these guys, scientists, put a microphone in a beaver lodge in March, and you can see, see, can you see my pointer? Yep. Okay, so up here, there's not much to do in the Beaver Lodge. Chew some bark and have a martini late in the day, and get up late the next morning. So, they're free running with a period length of about. Free running with a period length of about 27 hours here underneath the snow in the lodge at constant temperature. So they lost recording here. This is the spring thaw and they re-established recording again. And now the beavers are exposed to full spectrum sunlight. They entrain and now they're locked in to 24.00 hours and they're busy as beavers. So clocks like this are found a lot of Blocks like this are found a lot of places in the tree of life. So, here are the three great groups: the archaeobacteria, eubacteria, and the eukaryotes. And groups in blue are where clocks have been described. So, we see here in the archae and eubacteria and synecococcus, sporadically in the protists, and universally here in the organisms that emerged around the Cambrian explosion. And groups in red are where clocks have been studied here in halobacterium. They've been Studied here in Halobacterium. They've been identified, but not really studied. A lot of work done in Senecococcus. And then up here, we know about how plant clocks work from work in Arabidopsis and Plamidomonis. I want to draw your attention to this junction point here. Fungi and animals share a last common ancestor, and that's why fungi are such good models for things that happen inside of animal cells. Within this group of organisms, we know how clocks work, work, and neurons. We know how clocks work in neurospora and Drosophila, and by extension, now we know how clocks work in humans fairly well. So, clocks arose independently at least three times in plants, in fungi and animals, and in bacteria. Within each cluster, the mechanisms tend to be very similar, but between each cluster, mechanisms are completely unrelated. Regardless of this difference, all circadian feedback loops close within cells. So here we have fibroblast, a liver cell, cardiac myocyte, a CNS neuron, and neurospira. And all these clocks work in this way. They're positive elements, two different proteins that make a heterodimer. That's a transcription factor that drives expression of clock genes. They encode RNAs that encode proteins that make a complex. Encode proteins that make a complex, negative element complex. That complex negatively feeds back and physically interacts with the heterodymeric positive element and turns off its activity. This is a one-step negative feedback loop. And the product of that feedback loop is rhythmic activity of the positive element. When those transcription factors bind to genes whose products don't impact the feedback loop, you get circadian output. Those are the clocks. Circadian output. Those are the clock-controlled genes, and they give rise to rhythmic metabolism and behavior. So, they're nearly identical molecular regulatory architecture in the clock feedback loops from fungi and animals. So, here's neurospira, here are the mammals. The business end of this is in the light box here, the cycle of transcriptional activation. So, in Neurospira, FREEC and FRH make a Freak and FRH make a complex with casein kinase 1. That complex physically interacts with the heterodimer of white collar 1 and white collar 2, turns off its activity and its ability to drive expression of free. In mammals, cryptochromes and PERS interact with CK1, make a complex. That complex physically interacts with the heterodimer of BML1 and clock turns off its activity and that prevents it from activating expression of cries and purrs. Expression of cries and purrs. In Neurospora, where I'm going to focus most of our work, most of the talk today, is the cellular circadian clock drives a rhythm and developmental potential. So in this cartoon, this is constant light transfer to constant darkness. Mycelia growing across an auger surface at the time of this light-to-dark transition are set so that. Transition are set so that the mycelia won't differentiate, but sometime in the late subjective night to early subjective morning, myceli that are laid down will differentiate. And then as time moves on, they won't, and then they will again. So picture of this neurosper growing across an auger surface. This is the light-to-dark transfer, and these growth fronts are 24 hours apart. So you can see here, and this is an allelic series from the frequency gene. Like the dark transfer, myceli won't differentiate, and then they do, and then they don't. 24 hours later, they're in the middle of the night, and they're not, but in the subjective morning, they are, and so on. So, you get this record of where the clock has been over time. So, that's a static picture. It's interesting to look at a time-lapse. This is neurosper growing on the surface. Here, myceli aren't differentiating. Here, the mycelia that are laid down will differentiate. Will differentiate and the clock cycles on. Subjective day, they don't, subjective morning, they do. More recently, we viewed biluminescent reporters. So this is the clock controlled gene promoter driving firefly luciferase, again growing across an auger surface. You see this rhythmic expression of the clock in the growth front, but also behind the growth front, the clock continues to cycle. So, how does this clock work? So, this is a simplified elements and dynamics for neurospira. The heterodimer, white collar one and white collar two, comes in from another dimension, and it can bind at two different places in the free promoter. One's involved with light resetting, because white collar one is a photoreceptor in the light, as well as being a clock positive element in the dark. And there's also a site involved in rhythmicity of the clock box. So, we're only going to talk about. Clock box. So, we're only going to talk about rhythmicity today, so we'll make this one go away. So, the heterodimer binds to DNA, drives expression of freak RNA, which goes into the cytoplasm, is translated to freak protein. It dimerizes, interacts with FRH, and takes kinases, chiefly CK1, into the nucleus, where they phosphorylate white color 1 and white color 2 and turn off their activity. Creak becomes phosphorylated and moves into the site. Becomes phosphorylated and moves into the cytoplasm, interacts with some other things. White collar one and white collar two become dephosphorylated or resynthesized. That restarts the cycle of expression of freak RNA. And that cycle repeats about every 22 and a half hours. Meanwhile, in the cytoplasm, freak becomes additionally phosphorylated. It makes it attractive to its ubiquitin ligase, FWD1, which takes it to the protein. Which takes it to the proteasome and it's turned over in acts of cellular housekeeping. But these events are not essential for the cycle, whereas these events are. Output happens when the same heterodimer, white collar one, white collar two, drives expression of clock-controlled genes. Giving rise to output. I'm going to talk about two things. One, about an RNA binding protein, PERD2, that binds to casein. PER2 that binds to casein kinase I freaky mRNAs in a perinuclear phase-separated membraneless compartment. And second, providing some context and model background for modeling of circadian output, starting with the transcriptional output. So, first, I wanted to give some cell biological context. So, this is a hyphae of neurospira. We're going to take off the We're going to take off the outer wall and nuclei are marked with Sun 1, which is a nuclear marker. Here's Freak inside nuclei. Now we're going to zoom out and look at white collar 2, also in the nuclei, and they're co-localized with Freak. These are cells from constant light. So, these are very old data from, I think Phil said, from when dinosaurs roamed the earth. But one of the things that struck us about this was that there's a significant lag between freak mRNA and freak protein peaks. And that's surprising because, as we all know, you can make protein directly from RNA. You don't need a four or five or eight-hour lag. So, we wonder where this came from. This was taken on by a grad student, Brad Bartholomew, who developed for neurospira for fungi methods for single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization to identify individual freak transcripts. So these are the nuclei, and here you can see individual transcripts. Using this, we counted freak transcripts and their localization as a function of time of day. Function of time of day. They cycle as they're supposed to, high in constant light, low in the subjective night, increasing the subjective morning, cycling back down again. And interestingly also, the percentage of active nuclei cycles. So it's high in the light. It cycles following the transcript, but there's an enormous amount of variability here. So even at the peak of freak expression, there are nuclei that aren't doing anything. So, Brad wondered: are freak transcripts simply randomly distributed, or does there seem to be some organization within the cell? And to get at this, he used spatial spatial statistics to detect time of day cycling. So, this is a model of the three dimensions in the cell. Here's the nucleus, and these are the transcripts around it. This is from Subjective Morning. This is from subjective morning and subjective evening. So, to look at clustering, you take a center point, so this is the centroid of the nucleus, and move out from it and simply count the number of objects. So random modeled here and clustered modeled here. So, if you count these moving out from the nucleus, and if they're randomly organized, the number will simply increase linearly with distance. But if they're clustered, this won't be linear anymore. So, you take all the objects, do So, you take all the objects, do a hundred-fold simulation to get error bars around this, and turn it on outside, and that's how the data is presented. So, doing this for freak, in the early morning, there's distinct clustering. So, here's the nucleus. So, within one to two microns of the nucleus, there's more There's more freak than there is much further away. Going through the subjective day into the evening, the clustering is reduced and completely lost by midnight. But then circadian time 23 in the subjective morning, the clustering comes back again. So Greg wondered what facilitates the clustering. So here we enter this RNA binding protein per D. RNA binding protein PERD2. So PERD2 is originally isolated in a non-biased genetic screen. It turns out to have arisen from an interstitial chromosome translocation or inversion that flipped the promoter of this gene away from its coding region. And that strain has a long period length. So, Tina Kelleher picked this up and showed that. Casein kinase 1 mRNA levels are reduced in PER2, and also that's because CK1 mRNA is unstable in PER2. So, all that suggested that PER2 might be an RNA binding protein, which she was able to show. So, here's the positive control. PUF4 is an RNA binding protein. Its target is MRP1. And here's CK1 being bound by Bound by PERD2. Brad went on, so PERD2 binds to CK1 RNA. Brad went on to show that it also binds to FREC mRNA. So again, enrichment of FREC and a pull down with PERD2. So loss of an RNA binding protein that binds to casein kinase 1 and freak mRNAs results in a lengthened circadian period. And the punchline here is that the spatial clustering of freak is lost in PER2. So here's the cartoon. In wild type, you have nice clustering of freak around nuclei, but this is completely lost in the PER2 knockout strain, both in the light and also in the subjective morning. This is the control showing that the mRNA per nucleus is still the same. So, what are the characteristics of PERD2 that promote this? This. For some reason, this video always takes a long time to load. Okay, so this is a micrograph showing mycelium in neurospira. The dark points are nuclei. And the multicolor lookup table here tracking PERD2, which is tagged with neon green. So bright light. On green. So bright light is high concentration and going down into very low concentrations of PER2. So we'll play the movie. You can see the cytoplasmic streaming here, nuclei are moving, and PER2 is moving around the cell. We're going to focus in on a small part of this here. All right, nuclei moving, cytoplasm moving, and purge. Cytoplasm moving and PERD2 in here, you can see looking sort of like showing elastomeric properties where it's together and it pulls apart and it follows this nucleus, cytoplasmic flow going down here. So an RNA binding protein, PER2, binds to casein 1 and freak mRNAs in a perinuclear phase-separated membrane. Nuclear phase-separated membraneless compartment. Transcripts and coding components are temporally organized. Hey, Jay, if I was to look at where tubes are in this picture, where would I see them? Microtubules? Yep. So can you see my point? See, can you see my pointer? Sure can. They'd be running through the cytoplasm here, not pulling the nuclei. The nuclei are moving. It's not entirely clear what's driving nuclei movement other than hydrostatic pressure. And it's an object of a lot of study, actually. Of a lot of study, actually. So, in the cytoplasmic streaming, I'm showing here nuclei are moving fairly slowly. If looking in mycelia, like over here on the left, generally they move slowly. See if I can get this but like this. Like this. But occasionally, when one is looking at a broad field, there'll be clusters of nuclei that just zoom through at about 10 times this rate. So it's really quite an interesting phenomenon. Yeah, it's super cool. I was just curious whether PERD2 might be associated with astromicrotubules, and that's where you see it kind of trailing that nucleus as it pulls away from the septum. It's possible. Um, it's it's possible. Um, Brad has tracked uh PIRD2 with microtubules and shown that sometimes it flows towards the, it can move in both directions associated with microtubules. So we don't know if that's carrying these two RNAs or carrying something else, but you can you can see it moving. I went through. I went through this series of slides just to give some sense of the things that are hard to get at, that are important for the biology of the cell, but hard to get at through the kind of modeling that we do the molecular biology genome genomics-based modeling. Cool, thank you. All right, so now I'm going to switch to move on to output. So, the circadian cycle is driven by dynamic phase-specific changes. By dynamic phase-specific changes among a constellation of proteins. So here's the positive arm, white collar one and white collar two driving the negative arm. The kinase temperature impacts the clock through Freak. Light impacts the clock through white collar one, which is the photoreceptor. And this drives circadian output. And collectively, that is driving this daily cycle in gene expression, which gives rise to the cycle in developmental potential shown here. Shown here. So we wondered what genes and proteins are clock controlled and through what pathways are they controlled. So the first step of this was to look at transcriptome, at the circadian transcriptome via RNA-seq. This is work by Jen Hurley when she was a postdoc here some years ago. So we sampled morospor every two hours over 48 hours in triplicate did the RNA-seq, and that's shown here. Subjective evening, subjective evening. Subjective evening, subjective morning, subjective evening, subjective morning, the daytime second day. The clock exerts control over a significant part of the genome. So we detected 92% of the transcriptome. Of that, 40% was rhythmic. So clock control is enormously pervasive. 3,800 and some odd rhythmic genes, and that's about 40% of the genome. 40% of the genome. Expression of most clock-controlled genes peaked in two dominant phases. In the subjective morning, genes involved in energy production and metabolism peaked. And then the subjective evening, ribosome and protein biosynthesis genes and modification genes peaked. We wondered, how are all these genes controlled? So again, dynamic phase-specific constellation of proteins. Phase-specific constellation of proteins. And these are some of the outputs: connitation, pigmentation, stress responses, development, membrane signaling, intermediary metabolism. These are all driven directly or indirectly by the white-collar complex. So I mentioned also that the white-collar complex is a photoreceptor in the light, as well as being its clock protein positive element in the dark. So we reasoned that. So, we reasoned that because the white collar complex drives both acute light-induced expression of outputs as well as circadian regulation of outputs, we could study the transcriptional network downstream from the white-collar complex by using light induction as a proxy for clock control. So it was that paradigm that drove these experiments. So, as an example, sub one is a light-induced transcription factor that regulates downstream genes. Regulates downstream genes. So it's light-induced. This is just QPCR. This is a sub1 target gene. It's also light-induced. And if you knock out sub1, the light induction is largely lost. And likewise, if you determine a consensus binding site and eliminate the consensus binding site, you lose light reduction. So that gives rise to the simple model where the white collar complex drives subone, sub 1 drives targets. Targets. The cell mode is also clock controlled. So here's QPCR: hours in darkness cycling from high to low to high to low. This is using the bioluminescence reporter following the sub one target gene and Cu6597. So in wild type, it cycles. In the sub one knockout, you lose cycling. If you mutate the late responsive element in the promoter, you lose cycling. So it's all consistent. So, it's all consistent with the model where the white-collar complex drives sub one and other transcription factors, and they drive CCG targets, and that's how output happens. So, targets of the white-collar complex and downstream transcription factors can be identified by ChIP-seq. So, you probably all know how this works, but I thought just in case I shouldn't go through it. So, for ChIP-seq, I say. C isolate nuclei are isolated and cross-linked with formaldehyde. That cross-links transcription factors that are bound to DNA, cross-links them physically to the DNA. DNA is then sonicated into small pieces, and antibodies specific to the transcription factors is added. That allows you to immunoprecipitate the transcription factor and the DNA to which it's bound. Cross-links are reversed, and this DNA can be sequenced in the sequence. Sequenced and the sequence runs piled up. You get the forward and reverse, and the combination of those two gives a nice peak for where the transcription factor was bound. So it's a snapshot of where transcriptions are factors are bound at the time that the cells were treated with formaldehyde. So here's an example. This is ChIP-seq data for transcription factor BOST1 binding to the CSP1 gene. 0, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after lights on. And here's CSP1. So you get a nice series of peaks. So from data like these, you can begin to define the regulatory network governing light and flock regulation. So this really is a hairball, but you can begin to see patterns. Here's a transcription factor potentially binding to a whole bunch of Binding to a whole bunch of output genes. Here's another view of this. So these are the 63 transcription factors that we've shipped, mostly just at one time, a couple of them in time series. And on the inside of this are the transcription factors to which they bind. So some transcription factors regulate a small dedicated number of genes, but the typical transcription factor regulates on the order of a few hundred genes. Most genes are regulated by just one or two transcription factors, but some are regulated by many transcription factors. And these would be the hubs integrating information. Hey, Jay, sorry to interrupt, but I was thinking about our discussion yesterday. Is there a sense for what we were talking about yesterday was the difference between nodes that are part of the control of periodicity? The control of periodicity and nodes that are really just effectors of that periodicity. So, is there some sense for how many of these transcription factors, if you deleted them, would have an effect on clock function? Like, is there feedback from any of these? Are they really just directional out away from the kind of core clock elements? Yeah, they're nearly all directional away from separated from core clock function. Clock functions regulate. Clock function is regulated really by only a few things. That is only directly regulated by a few things. So the core transcription translation negative feedback loop has just a handful of transcription factors involved with it. It can take input or be influenced by a number of things, including Number of things, including light and temperature. Also, there's metabolic feedback that can impact the clock, but isn't required for the clock. If that makes sense. Got it. Yeah. No. So the way to think of these is they're all just effectors. They're all outputs of the clock, not really feeding back on clock function. Their role in life is not to feed back on the clock function. Got it. Thank you. But I. But I should emphasize that some of them do feedback on clock functions. So through post-translational modifications. So this is in the clock field. This is something that people are still getting their arms around. And it's one of the things that we would like to model, as you'll hear about in some of the later talks. So, for instance, transcription factors can be acetylated. And so output rhythms in, or they can be NAD-elated. So output rhythms in redox potential or in NAD metabolism can feed back and impact the clot. The top. Rhythms in many transcription factors are regulated by phosphorylation. So rhythms in output kinases can potentially feed back on the clock. But none of those things are required for the feedback loop. Got it. Thank you. Can I ask a really naive question? Please do. I was hoping for more questions here. So when you say a typical transcription factor, Transcription factor regulates on the order of a few hundred genes. What does that really mean? Yeah, I'm not even quite sure how I ask this question. What does that mean? I mean, I think of a transcription factor regulating because it's produced a protein, right? So if I'm going to produce 100 proteins and I'm going to try to regulate a few hundred genes, that seems to me to kind of become completely wrong. Seems to me to kind of become completely random, right? It depends which protein hits which gene. So there must be something else going on that I'm. Does my question make sense? I'm not sure, but I can try to answer it anyway. That is, I'm sure it makes sense. I'm not sure I'm grasping it. So the transcription factor will bind to any gene that has its consensus binding site in the promoter. And some genes bind just, or some transcription factors bind just a couple of genes. For instance, the white collar complex, the heterodimer, seems to bind only 25 or 30 at most genes. This transcription, no, I'm sorry, it binds to about 70 genes. CSP1 here is. CSP1 here is a repressor and it binds to about 100 genes. So, right, so that's my, okay, so how many, I mean, so if I produce 100 proteins, right, and I'm going to bind to 200 genes, then it means that, you know, the probability that, I mean, pretend they all have the equal binding energies. Have the equal equal binding energies, right? Then it's a coin flip as to which gene is going to get bound to, right? Right. So I um I think, Jay, the Confucian. You'd have more than 100 copies of the protein there. Right, so 100 different proteins are expressed in various levels. I think how many copies of the transcription factor actually are in a cell? Yeah, the question is about abundance, right? So if I have a transcription factor that only has 100 copies, how can it bind to 200 genes? And my guess is that if you're binding 200 genes, that you're going to have more than 100 copies of that protein made. That's correct. When you, it's a good question. Uh, it's a good question, and it brings up so this is a slide that I did not put in, but for the exemplar I gave for sub one, which was the light-induced transcription factor. So we've done a time course on that. So sub one is light-induced. So comparing dark 15 and 60 minutes in the light, there's about five to ten times. Five to ten times more sub one after 15 minutes of light than there is in the dark. So when you do chip-seek across that time series, you see that it's binding to a lot more promoters after 15 minutes than it is in the dark. So the binding is very definitely concentration dependent and probably could be post-concentrated. Probably could be post-translational modification dependent. But Steve's point is correct in any case that the number of proteins made by a promoter is variable. And in the cell, the more genes a protein Genes a protein transcription factor binds to the more copies there would be. So, Jay, Jay, this is John Tyson. I wanted to ask a question. If you have these transcription factors binding to sites on different genes, it's a dynamic process and the probability that it's bound to any one site or not depends upon the dissociation constant. And that's going to vary, presumably, from one gene to another. Yes. But when you do the chip. But when you do the chip seek, you derivatize the interaction, right? You covalently link the protein to the DNA. And that presumably depends on the probability that the protein is actually sitting on the DNA when you do this, I guess. It has to be sitting there, yes. Yeah, but you, but essentially, you convert all the interactions, weak or strong, into a covalent interaction. Into a covalent interaction and then bring them down. So you can't really distinguish, can you, between which of those bindings of transition back to the gene are tight and which are weak? You can infer it from the height of the gene, the height of the peak. Of the peak, okay. Let's see, I can go back to that. So these peak heights, in fact, we can probably go back to here. The peak heights are variable. And in fact, they're variable over three log orders for different transcription factors in different sites. In some cases, if the background is four, you can easily see a peak. Uh, is four, you can easily see a peak that's 12, um, uh, but you also see peaks that are over a thousand. So the snapshot you would get would reflect the height of the peak, if, or at least we infer that it does. If binding is very tight, the transcription factor will always be there. You'll always be getting a sequence readout, and the number of readouts piling up over a particular region will be very high. Region would be very high. If it's only occasionally bound, you'd only occasionally get some and it'd be lower. It's a good point because in trying to assemble the network later on, there's some fairly subjective filtering that goes on about when you call a peak significant and when you call a peak not significant. Does that make sense, John? Does that make sense, John? Uh, yeah, I'm just wondering if you can quantify it more than just the qualitative. This is a big peak, and that's a shallow peak. Well, you certainly can. You can. Can you estimate the KDs or the probabilities? One might be able to do this. Yeah, I think people have tried to do that, and it's not as quantitative as you would like it to be. So it's really, you can get. You can get a correlation between the number of reads under that peak and KDs, but I don't think it's strict by any sense of the word. Well, I'm not asking for strict. I would settle for orders of magnitude. I thought you had to have a known control in there, something that you actually know the KD of. Once you have that, you can do comparatives to kind of estimate from there. But I don't think that when Jay, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think that we know any known KDs. Know any known KDs in Neurospora. So to back calculate is kind of tough without one that we really know what's going on. In theory, going forward, you could measure that KD and then go back to all the data that Jay has and then estimate from there, but you'd have to find one where you can estimate the binding of. If you could independently estimate the number of protein molecules, you might be able to reverse engineer the KD because you. That is, you would have the peak height from chip and the number of sequence reads, and you'd know the number of proteins that were giving rise to that in the cell at that time. But we have to integrate over time somehow, right? Because that, you know, you're producing a protein which is long-lived and you yeah. Right, but the chip is only a snapshot, so you just uh you only know what is bound at the at the end. Is bound at the instant that the formaldehyde hits? Could I ask another question here? If I remember correctly, when I asked Philip yesterday how many transcription factors affect a typical gene, if I understood correctly, he said about 20 or something. And you're saying one or Or something, and you're saying one or just a few. So, I don't know if I remember correctly, if I made a mistake in what I was asking or remembered, or if it's a different species. I remember that also. And I was, I think I may have even commented on it, that 20 transcription factors regulating a single gene is a lot, or strikes me as a lot. And so it's different, it's plants versus fungi. Versus fungi. Okay. Any more to say about this? Thank you. All right. So from the ChIP-seq, you can assemble a hierarchical network, and it would look like this: with a white-collar complex driving a first tier of genes, which would drive a second tier of genes, which would drive a third tier of genes. So this is the coating. The top tier would include direct targets of white collar. Here in this model, the thickness of the edges reflects. Model, the thickness of the edges reflects the predicted strength of the interactions based on the chip peak heights. Extensive intra-level regulation, particularly on the top tier. These are transcription factors binding their promoters. And there's frequent auto-regulation. But when we started to look at the transcriptome data, the network predictions didn't look so good. So from this, we inferred that it's easy to assemble a network, but it's hard to assemble. A network, but it's hard to assemble the correct network. So this was fallow for a long time, and then it was picked up by chiefly Tina Kelleher and with some help by Jeremy Zucker at PNNL. And we started using iDrem, which is a dynamic regulatory events minor. So DREM works by taking a time series of expression data, looking for inflection or bifurcation points in the time series. Bifurcation points in the time series where subsets of genes diverge. Associating these divergence points with the transcription factors that are expressed at that time may be responsible, and thereby learning a regulatory network that identifies which transcription factors are active and repressed at each time point, along with their targets. And within pathways, transcription factors are scored by how many co-regulated genes are found by a given TF. So, this is the citation. So, this is the citation for DREM. The input data was our light-regulated transcriptome done in collaboration. Input, so DREM loves lots of data. So, these are all the neurospirit genes and a little over 400,000 peak annotations from CHIP. And from that, you get, after some months of tweaking, 10 output pathways. These are the heat maps from the RNA-seq. RNA-seq and what's in each pathway. So, this worked pretty well for highly light-induced and light-repressed genes, but not so well for the middle pathways, which represent about two-thirds of the expressed genes. So, we finally broke down and did manual curation, focusing only on the light-induced genes. So, this is the basis for the manual curation. The definition of a tier one transcription factor is it's a direct white-collar target. It's a direct white-collar target backed up by physical evidence and genetic evidence. The gene expression increases early in the light response, and the transcription factor itself binds other light responsive genes. Tier 2 is like tier 1, but doesn't have to be a direct white-collar target. So, starting with the list of 333 putative neurospirators transcription factors, comparing that with the white-collar targets. White-collar targets, you get 78 putative transcription factors in Tier 1. And these are each evaluated manually and give rise to 18 Tier 1 genes. So here's an example. This is for ADV1. Minutes after light, expression goes up and then drops down and stays down. This is the chip. Its chips goes up after light, but doesn't statistically change in a white-collar knockout that's. Change in a white-collar knockout that's lost the photoreceptor. And this is the chip data here showing a nice peak in front of ADV1. So we used IDREMLen to infer a transcription factor regulating just light responsive genes. So this is a much restricted data set. The input here is just 636 consensus. Consensus strong light-regulated genes. And the input is not 400,000, but a little over 42,000 unique annotations for high-confidence chip peaks only. So we're only looking at light regulation now. But this is starting to look a lot better. Four pathways, the transcription factors associated with each pathway are here. And these are the heat maps, obviously. And these are the heat maps, obviously. Path one looks like maybe tier one only. Path B, tier one, followed by tier two. These look a little pulsatile. They're low, come high, and then come back down. And the bottom pathway here are the repressed genes. So this is starting to be derangled to some extent, but the draft light network still suggests there's going to be a lot of delightful. A lot of delightful complexity. So here's the photoreceptor which regulates itself. For instance, it drives sub one, sub one also positively drives white collar, subject to positive regulation, negative regulation, and auto-regulation. And that's true for a number of these transcription factors. This is the repressor. Repressor and others of these are activators. And this is borrowed from Tina. This is a hairball alert because it's going to be very complex. So how does the clock regulate downstream genes? We're going to have a network of clock-controlled transcription factors, and in the aggregate, these are driving the circadian transcriptome. This is all being And this is all being driven by the white collar complex, whose activity is being regulated in the circadian circuit. Now, the interesting thing about this is that this is circadian circuit has a distinct phase. White-collar complex is active in the subjective morning and is not active in the subjective evening. So, the activity of the white-collar complex is cycling. And yet, somehow, this very space-specific morning, high, evening-low activity. Morning high, evening low activity is morphed into this pattern where some genes are active at all times of day. And that's the role of the network, which is acting as a dynamic time filter to make available all these different times of day. It's going to be additional regulation that's going to give rise to the phase differences down here. So, how can we begin to So, how can we begin to sort these out? So, we just started to mess around with this sum. So, these are maps of these are just the chip TFs, and they're light-regulated. They have a yellow circle around them. These are the light-regulated TFs, and clock-regulated TFs are outside the circle, ones active in the morning, afternoon, and night. I think a different and better way to look at this is to look at the time. Another way to look at this is to look at the time of day at which the expression of most of ATF's target genes peak. So, in this picture, there's a cluster of genes that encode transcription factors that regulate genes that peak in the morning. There's a cluster of genes that regulate genes that peak in the afternoon. A different cluster of genes. A different cluster of genes whose targets peak in the early night, and a different cluster of genes whose targets peak in the late night. So, how does the clock regulate output through combinatorial control by multiple rhythmic transcription factors. In a hierarchical network, it turns genes on and off, resulting in groups of genes having independent and specific phases. And in some way, that's giving rise to this daily pattern of development that we're interested in studying. And of course, this is transcription is only the first step in circadian control, as we're going to hear about. Acknowledgements: this is all done in collaboration with. This was all done in collaboration with long-term colleague Jennifer Loros. Talked about work from Brad Bartholomew and Tina Kelleher. These are folks in the lab now. Also showed data from people who have left the lab, Jen Hurley, now at RPI, ARCODESCOPTERTH Fred Hutchinson, Xiaoyung Zua, postdoc, who's in biotech at Checkerspot, and Jeremy Zucker at PNNL. This is the grand support. Support and with that, we can talk some more about it. I don't know where we are in terms of time. Thank you. I don't know what the time is, but I had to look. Yeah, whatever. Questions? So, Jay, I think in mammalian circadian systems, you can see in the gene expression output, something that John Hogan. Output: Something that John Hoganish calls harmonics. That's what we modeled and suggested could be due to combinatorial control of a gene by transcription factors that have different phases. So I'm just curious whether you're seeing that kind of behavior in neurospira. Jen, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't believe we saw any harmonics. Michael, please. Michael Bruner published a paper a few years later searching through this, looking for harmonics, and found some limited harmonics, but not an extensive amount. Right. So that it's sort of a question of phase averaging. And I wonder if the harmonics that are seen are happening within the same cell or between different cells. Between different cells. So, in Rospera, is one of the reasons I went over the cell biology. It's more like a muscle cell and less like a fibroblast. So, there are lots of nuclei sharing the same cytoplasm. So, a part of how we think that we get from morning, high, evening, low activity of white collar to The expression here of all times of day is that there is averaging of transcription factor binding across the day. So that if you have a transcription factor that's active in the morning and another one that's active in the mid-afternoon and they're both binding to the same gene, that you might get a peak at noon. And that's sort of where. Um and uh and that's that's sort of where we're going with this, but we haven't we haven't proven it yet. I will ask extremely naive question, which I always want to talk to Steve. So, right, I ask a question, why, which is always a bad question because biologists say this is how it is. So, if I wanted to design a uh neurospera, why would I put in 25 morning uh transcription factors? Right, in some sense, if I just want to read out the time, just want to read out the time i could design things where i have one morning one one evening one for you know like have a phase for each of them and i don't have to have 25. clearly there probably are different rows for these but if the time is the only thing which i want to read out at least in the first tier then why the complexity yeah so i think the answer is it's it's not the only thing you want to read out that uh neurospira as as in all circadian clocks As in all circadian clocks, the clock is not essential, it's helpful. So, if you eliminate the clock, the organism does just fine in the laboratory and probably does okay even out in the real world. So, all of these transcription factors would have real-world roles, and they become useful in a circumstance. Useful in a circadian context by being clock regulated. Okay. Okay. I wonder if I could ask a very simple question that this is not my area, but I did follow it a few years ago. And it seemed like the core of many of these clock mechanisms had a positive feedback. And you've shown this basically with a negative only. Has something happened to the positive evidence that I missed? No, it's totally. Uh, no, it's still there. It's it's uh um and deriving from first principles. Uh, if you don't have some positive feedback, the clock will wind down very quickly, which they they don't do. So the positive feedback is still there. Uh, you don't have to go into details, I've just feedback is still there, and it's it's a question of. And it's a question of at what level you consider it essential. So I've to try to simplify perhaps too much, I've considered what's essential for the clock to go through a full cycle. Yeah. Not what's essential to go through 10 full cycles. So, Jay, you've shown us that you have this tiered network. This tiered network of transcription factors from the white-collar complex to the first-order genes and second-order and third order. And they're connected to each other. There's a lot of feed forward loops in this mechanism, as well as a few feedback loops. And you pointed out that the different phase relationships, especially the further down you get in this hierarchy, become really complicated to understand. Really complicated to understand. I get, I think that was your message, okay? Yeah, and you said it was the hairball alert. But can we do something to get around the hairball complexity? As a mathematical modeler, I have to ask, is it possible to build models of at least some of these, modularize the network, at least look at some of the interactions that involve feed forward and feedback. Feed forward and feedback loops, and come to some quantitative understanding of the phase relationships. And then maybe if you can begin to be successful in at least furreting out some of the relationships, maybe you can begin to put them together into the more and more complex. Because it's not, it's to me, it seems unfortunate. Satisfying to just say this is a big hairball and throw up your hands and say we can't really understand it. We ought to be able to have tools that begin to understand it. So I'll be talking a little bit tomorrow about a technique to try to do exactly that. Okay, good. Yeah, and we'll talk a little bit about that on Friday, too, in my talk. We're building the model. In my talk, we're building the models from the ground up rather than the top down to simply remove some of that complexity and understand these kind of piecewise before we try to tackle the whole thing. Okay. So I think you're right, John, that that is the way to move forward. This is a figure that Tina prepared, where, at least in a wiring diagram way. In a wiring diagram, way we're beginning to do that. So you could separate out this repressor activator module here with CSP1. So CSP1 acts basically as a phase reversal. So the white collar complex is day active, night inactive, and outputs from CSP1, because it's a repressor, will be day inactive, night active. So that gives you access in the transportation. That gives you access in a transcriptional viewpoint to the whole other half of the cycle. So, one can imagine that propagating out in different ways with activators and repressors. So, they remind me of Reverb and Roar in mammalian cycle with that feedback on demol. One of them positive and one of them negative, but it's the same topology. It's the same topology, yeah. It's the same topology, yeah. Okay, Jay, I also want to uh comment on one thing. I want to see because uh, you mentioned it's a dram analysis that reminds me of work we did, which I think probably also relevant in your system. So, um, there is what I'll ask is, okay, because it's talk about in my EMT system, self-enabled transition. So, ask myself, I, you know, I need many genes, need to work cooperatively to do something. So, how the cell control the gene expression. Control the gene expression. So you realize, well, there's a motif, right? So you can have one mass regulator that controls many genes, right? Then you realize, you give a second thought, you realize in mimonian cells, that should not be enough because the gene expression, not just transfer factors, but also the local quantum environment, right? You know, epigenetic things, you have this bursting. So we have to then realize if you want to synchronize two genes, you need to put them. Two genes, you need to put them physically close. So, I asked my students to analyze RN-seq data and combine with high-C data. So, then we clearly show those genes that in the same drum cluster. So, means they are co-regulated, they have high intendency, be physically close. So, actually, we noticed there are two regions that separate by 100 million base pairs. And we high z. And we high zero they're close. We did a crisp vertica study labeling lifestyle imaging, which showed them indeed they are close. And also there are papers by Michael Levin. There is another nature paper. They show, indeed, you know, they have two genes. They may be physically close, although in the genome space, they may be far away. They physically close. Then they burst synchronize, right? They're still bursting, but they burst. Bursting, but they burst. Yeah, so I think for your case, you might have maybe that's where your target genes may have this class physical clustering. People have begun to do some high C work in Neurosper, but there isn't a lot and none in the circadian or light context. But it'd be, that's very interesting, and I'd love to pursue that. I'd love to pursue that. So, a similar phenomenon seen in budding yeast cell cycle genes. So, I think it was Oscar Aparicio who was able to show that the 4KED class of transcription factors can actually cross-link DNA. So, you can bring together 4K-regulated genes into these kind of transcriptional units. And so, I think that may be a common way to get co-regulation of genes. To get co-regulation of genes in these normal transcription factories. In the same way, people have been thinking about replication factories where you cluster origins together. So, yeah, it's a really cool concept. Well, we are close to time to start a second talk. So, Jennifer, if you can share. Can share, I think. I can do that.
