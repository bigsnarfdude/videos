Really excited to be here and also ridiculously nervous. I don't know where this is coming from. I think it would really help if I could learn some things. I know this is a strange thing to do at the beginning of the talk, but we're so small and I know that we have opportunities to meet each other, but then like for the super shy people, maybe you won't actually say your name to some people. So is that okay to spend like a couple minutes just going around saying names? Are we okay with that? Okay, I'm Julie.
