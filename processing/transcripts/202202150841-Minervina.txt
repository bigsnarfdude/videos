Yes, I will I will try. Oh okay. Do you see the presentation mode? Or you could see the slide? Yeah, it's good. Okay, so yes, thank you, Armita, for introduction. So my name is indeed Anastasia Mirvina, and now I'm a postdoctoral researcher at Thomas Lab. And we're going to take a little bit different direction. To take a little bit different direction, and I want to talk with you today about T cell response to SARS-CoV-2 epitopes, and in particular, what TCL Riperto could tell us about this response. And as you all know, T cells are an important part of adaptive immune system. They are responsible for eliminating viral infected cells, but also they are responsible for providing help to the B cells. And T cells, they recognize antigens that are presented on the MHC molecules. It's a peptide antigen, and they do it with the T cell receptor on the surface. And as T cells have to recognize a vast diversity of these antigens, there should be a huge diversity of the T cells on that side as well. That's why both chains of the T cell receptor, alpha and beta, are generated. And butter are generated in the semi-random process called VDJ recombination. And the junction between V and J segments is the most variable part of the TCR and is called CDR3. During the VDJ recombination, we get a vast diversity of alphabetic TCR receptors and using high-frop sequencing, we now can get access to this diversity. And in general, there are multiple approaches to the TCR repetitive sequencing, but all of But all of them result in those huge tables, which are very similar to the one I'm showing you on this slide. And importantly, depending on the type of sequencing you choose, you could get the information about only alpha chain, only beta chain, or if you use single-cell TCR repetitive sequencing, you could get information about the two chains or the TCR simultaneously. And each row in such table will correspond to the clone or the clonotype. And for And for each clone, we will have information about its nucleotide sequence or the CDR3, which is basically its unique identifier. We will also, of course, know the amino acid sequence of CDR3, genomic segments that participated in the assembly. But importantly, we will also have the information about the fraction of repertoire that each clone occupies. So basically, there are two types of information. The information about the clone size, which tells us how many cells of this kind. Tells us how many cells of this kind are in the organism. And then we also have the information about the amino acid sequence of HTCR, which in principle contains all the information about the specificity of this clone. And I will try to convince you that both of these information types could be valuable in understanding the T cell response and, in particular, the T cell response to acute viral infections such as SARS-CoV-2. The key feature of the T cell response is the response. Key feature of the T cell response to the acute viral infection is its active dynamics. So, when naive T cells recognize their cognate antigen, they go through expansion phase, where also the differentiation to the effector cells happens. And when all the pathogen is eliminated, the initial expansion phase is followed by the contraction, with most of the effector cells dying at this stage and only part of them remaining as a memory. Meaning as a memory. Thus, if we will look at the TCR repertoire at the different time points after the infection, we could get an idea and get clonotypes that significantly expanded or significantly contracted after the infection. And on early March 2020, we got access to samples from two individuals who were experiencing mild COVID-19. This donors also had a pre-infection. This donors also had pre-infection time points taken approximately one and two years prior to the initial exposure. And we also collected blood samples from these individuals on different time points following the infection. From all these time points, we isolated PBMCs and reconstructed the TCR alpha and TCR beta repetitors, which are in this case unpaired. And our initial idea was that at least mild cases of COVID-19. That at least mild cases of COVID-19 should not be any different from any other infections. And thus, the T cell response should go through expansion and contraction phases with the peak around day 15. And indeed, we were able to identify hundreds of responding clonotypes in both TCALF and TCL beta rebetos in both donors. And we could see the strong CD4 and CD8 response to this acute infection. As you could see, As you could see here, the SARS-CoV-2 responding clones, they were almost absent prior in pre-pandemic samples. Then they expand with the peak on day 15 and contract, but still are detectable on day 85 post-infection. So basically, this dynamics nicely correlates with our initial expectations. But what we also know about the response to the same antigen that The same antigen that these T cells might be very similar in the acid sequence. And to look at the similarity inside the SARS-CoV-2 responding TCRs, we plot the similarity networks for CD4 and CD8, TCR alpha and battery peters for this donors. And on this visualization, each vertex is a unique TCR clonotype, and they are connected with an edge if they are very similar in their amino acid sequence. Similar in the amino acid sequence. On this particular visualization, we use a simple distance measure, the Heming distance, and we allow for up to two mismatches in the CDR free sequence. But we also require this clone types to have the exactly same V and J segments to draw an edge between them. And as you could see here, there are nice clusters of similar clones in all these repertoires. And as a control, we also sampled the random number. Sampled the random networks of the same size. So, basically, this artificial repertoire with the same number of clonotypes and calculated the number of ages in them. And they were much less than what we see in the data. And this is just a particular example of what Andreas Meyer told in his talk yesterday. So, we see the signature of this conversion selection to the same antigen in this repertoire. And the most impressive. And the most impressive signal we saw was actually in the CD4 TCR alpha repertoire. Here, this one cluster has 33 participants, so it has 33 different clones. All of them have a surprisingly same TCR alpha chain, which have TRAF35 and TRASH42. And the TCRs that have this alpha motif, they also corresponded to about 16. Also, corresponded to about 16 percent of overall CD4 response of donor M. So we hypothesized that T cells that have this alpha chain, they are responding to immunodominant epitope in SI SARS-CoV-2 proton. But at this point, it was not clear whether any other donors will show the same immunodominent response. But it was not long till we saw the exactly same alpha chain again. We have collaborators in Washington University. Collaborators in Washington University of St. Louis who are very interested in T fallicular helper response to mRNA vaccination. And what they do, they sample the draining lymph node of healthy volunteers after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccination. So they get this TFH cells not from the blood, but directly from a lymph node. And in principle, after the vaccination, almost all these TFH cells sampled from the lymph node should be responsive. From the lymph nodes, should be responsive to the antigen from the vaccine. So, in this case, it should be a spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. And when we sequence this TCR alpha repertoire from TFH cells, we strikingly could see the exactly same alpha chain. And in this case, this alpha chain was not only the biggest signal, but it was also shared by all four individuals, suggesting that this response is not just immunodominant. Is not just immunodominant, it's also public. And then we had a question that for COVID-19, we are in a very good situation because there is a lot of public data available. So the idea was, could we do some detective work and try to guess what the epitope is? And to deconvolve the specificity of the TCI, you need three components. You need the alphabet eticia, you need to know the HLA restriction. To know the HLA restriction, but you also need to know the exact peptide sequence of the epitope. And from all of this, we only have the alpha chain, but we also had an idea that this alpha chain should be public, meaning that we could, in principle, find it in other data sets. And the first thing we wanted to do is to try to find a better chain that is paired with our alpha motif. And for this, we used a single-cell TCR6. Used single-cell TCR sequencing of antigen-enriched CD4 T cells published by Bajer et al. in Immunity. This is the single-cell TCR data set of CD4 T cells that were stimulated by peptides from SARS-CoV-2. And indeed, we were able to find more than 1300 paired TCAs that have the exactly same alpha chain in this data set. So we have the alphabet TCA. And we also knew that H. Uh, and we also knew the HLA information for most of the donors who shared this receptor. And the only HLA locus that was similar among all these individuals was actually DPB104, which is the single most frequent HLA in the worldwide population. It's much more frequent than AO2, and it's present in more than 60% of European population and almost in, I think, more than 10% in all ethnical groups that had HLAT. In all ethnical groups that had HLA typing. So it was very exciting for us as a biologist because though it is one of the most frequent HLAs, no one ever saw any immunodominal epitope presented on this HLA. And the third part was more tricky, so we also needed to guess what the epitope might be. But as also Andreas mentioned, there is a data set called MIRA dataset that was published by Adaptive. Set that was published by Adaptive that contains sequences of TCR betas that match small peptide pools from SARS-CoV-2. Usually, these pools are about 50 acid long. And we looked for our beta chain in this data set, and we were able to find 65 of them that matched the exactly same pool. And this pool was from spike protein. The spike protein specificity also explains why we saw. Also, explains why we saw the exactly same alpha chain, not only after the infection, but also after vaccination. And to narrow down this rather large pool, we also used NetMHT in our HLA prediction. And we were able indeed to find a strong binder, which is shown here, with the core sequence in both that is predicted to be a strong binder to DBB104. Be wonderful. So at this point, we had the alphabet ATCR, the HLA prediction, and also the epitope prediction to test all this experimentally. And what we did, we re-expressed one of these alphabet TCRs in the Jukot cell line. The Jukot cell line, it also has the NFAT GFP endogenous reporter, meaning that when the TCR is activated, the cells start to express GFP. And then we mixed our T cell line with the APC from DP. Align with the APC from DPB104 positive donor and look for the GFP expression with the presence of the peptide or without the peptide. And as you could see on this flow plot, there are no GFP positive cells in unstimulated control, but there is a nice signal with our predicted peptide. So basically, we were able to validate our prediction. And also in collaboration with Jamie Rajon Lab in Monash University, we generated Uh, we generated the MHT tetramer, and then we could use this reagent to stain and sort antigen-specific cells. And the first thing we did, we just sorted the antigen-specific cells from the blood of SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals and sequenced the appeared alphabet TCR repertoire. And surprisingly, over 80% of all the sequenced TCRs. The sequence TCRs had the exactly same motif we had we found initially. So basically, this huge TCRs sharing this alpha chain are probably the main solution to binding of this epidope. But we could also use these reagents to gain some biological insight about mRNA vaccination, and we use it to track the immune response after the mRNA vaccination in both blood and lymph nodes. Of blood and lymph nodes of healthy volunteers. And in the blood, we saw what we saw before. So we have this active dynamics of response, which peaks here at about one week after the second immunization and then contracts. But if we will look at the lymph node, we will see that this epitome-specific cells, they're actually very stable for at least three months. And in some individuals, even for six months. And all this time, the CD4 TFH cells provide cell help to the B cells, they license. Help to the B cells, they license the B cell maturation, which was very cool. So just by using this abnormality in TCR repertoire, this convergent selection of the alpha chain, we were able to guess what the immunodominent epitope would be. And then we actually use that information to gain the biological information about the mRNA vaccination. So it was pretty successful. So me and my friends, who are also great scientists. So, great scientists, Elisa Rossati and Michael Poggarelli, decided that maybe we could try to generalize this approach and try to find more immunodominant epitopes for CD4 SARS-CoV-2 reactive T cells. And we intentionally focused on CD4s because in garrison contrast to CD8, we still only know few epitopes with a known HLA restriction for CD4 cells. And what we did, we found two public We found two publicly available single-cell data sets, one from MEKIF et al. and one from Baja et al. The cool thing about these data sets is that they are produced in the exactly same way. In brief, the PBMCs from SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individuals were stimulated by peptides from spike, membrane, and nuclear capsid protein from SARS-CoV-2. And then CD4 cells that express certain activation marks. That expressed certain activation markers were sorted out and went through single-cell RNA and TCI sequencing. And the first thing we did, we just merged those two data sets together and selected high-quality cells that also had the full TCI information. And as all biological assays have a certain background, we want to further focus only on the COVID-associated TCRs. With associated TCRs. And to do this, we use two other publicly available data sets. One is very famous. It is an Emerson cohort, which contains more than 700 TCR battery repair dose from healthy individuals that were sampled pre-pandemic. And the other one is the SNIDA cohort that was recently published, which has more than 1,400 COVID-19 repair to us. So, what we did, so for each TC. Did so for each TCR better in our emerged data set. We looked if it was significantly enriched in COVID-19 patients than in controls. And you could see the results here as a volcano plot. And we could in this way pre-select 1200 COVID-enriched TCRs. We then also asked if those COVID-enriched TCRs who are occurring with certain HP. Who are cured with certain HLA alleles. For example, this alpha chain was present in 37 COVID-19 patients and in free healthy controls. And 39 out of this 40 individuals shared the exact same allele. And to calculate the enrichment, we use Fisher exact test with multiple correction across all HLE alleles, which you could see here represented as a Manhattan plot. And probably you could see that. And probably you could see that indeed this better chain is associated with this HLA allele. And we then move to the similarity network analysis of this COVID-enriched TCRs. And on this network, each blob is paired TCR alphabet receptor. And to enrich this similarity space, instead of the simple measures such as Heming distance, we use the TCR dist on both chains. Dist on both chains. And you could see that there are nice big clusters of highly similar TCIs in this COVID-19 rich data set. The next thing we did, we also looked for this better chains again in the MIRA data set, and the results of this matching are presented as a color. And we were able to find matches to more spike, membrane, and nucleotide pulls. And you could see here that matching is pretty consistent. That matching is pretty consistent for all the clusters, maybe except this one, because it's very big, but still, the majority of clonotypes are matching to the same membrane pool. And as you remember, for all those clones, we also had NHLA prediction, which with the help of NetMHT could help us to narrow down from this large 50-amino acid peptide pool to the certain epitope. And we are now working. And we are now working on the validation of this prediction for the six major clusters. However, we already might know the answer for a few of them. For example, cluster number two is the cluster I showed you before. So we already know that we exactly guessed what is both the HLA restriction and the minimal epitope. And also cluster number five was actually reported in a very nice paper from Journal Experimental Medicine. From Journal Experimental Medicine that was published last year. And we also precisely guessed both the HLA restriction and the peptide here. And to sum all of it up, I want to say that in T-slaimology, finding out that TCR, antigen, MHD combination is one of the most important things. And usually what people do to go for this epidope discovery, they rely on the antigen side and And usually perform functional assays such as peptide stimulation across the whole viral peptidome. However, the problem here is that you need a very large sample sizes to perform this peptide stimulation across the whole even viral genome, and it gets more and more complicated with larger pathogen sizes. Moreover, our immune system doesn't react to all the peptides in the same way, so there is In the same way, so there is this immunodominance problem. And usually, when you do this peptide stimulation across the whole viral genome, only a few of those peptides will actually correspond to in vivo response. And for now, there is no way for us to tell which of the epitopes will be mononominate based just on its sequence. What we propose here is what we call the reverse epitope discovery approach, when you start from the abnormality in the TCR repertoire, which could The TCR repertoi, which could lead you towards identification of those immunodominant antigens. And I hope I show you that if we will have enough public information, we could even predict both the HLA restriction and the epitope without any wet lab experiments. And as this technique is in general antigen agnostic, you could use it for any other diseases or conditions of interest. Or conditions of interest. And here I'm going to stop and I will just show you the slide. There are a lot of people who were parts of different parts of this work, but I want to say specific thanks to Thomas Lab Paul, a wonderful mentor, and also Michael Pagarelli, who is my main co-author on all these publications. Thank you so much, and I'm ready to take questions. Any questions here? Yeah, I think so that we're talking about one quick question about what's your sense of the proportion of public versus private? Okay, I don't hear well, people who are sitting very far away. I will say how I understood the question. If I'm not correct, please correct me. So, you are asking. Me. So you are asking what might be the proportion of private versus public responses. Yes, that's the question. Great. This is a very good question. Indeed, in many cases, we don't see any, there is a large response, but we don't see any similar clonotypes. But I think maybe the main issue for now is that we don't have enough data. So I think if Data. So, I think if we will have more data, something that we think is private, it will not be private. And also, one of the other problems that we see more and more frequently is that most of the available data contains only better chain repertoires. Though in many, many cases, the actual signal is inside the alpha chain. So, I think if we will have more alpha chain repertoire, it will help us to get something that we think is. Something that we think is private from the beta chain of view, but it's definitely not private from the alpha chain. But it's hard to put numbers on that if you want specific numbers. Thank you. So the next question is from Sid. Sif, just unmute yourself. I had a general question. So it was really amazing to see those clusters of epitopes, you know, post-response. And I'm starting to play with some of the data. So I wanted to ask this. Play with some of the data, so I wanted to ask this technical question. So, if one looks at the response of the repertoire in uneased patients, do you still imagine clusters which are not probably related to the response? But what's the null expectation of this clustering? Yes, you could definitely see clusters even though there is no active response, because as we are all human beings, we actually have an immune response ongoing. Actually, have an immune response ongoing all the time. So, unless you are looking at the naive repertoire, you will definitely see clusters almost every time. One of the papers you might want to look about this is called Ellis Algorithm that we published together with Mihail Pogarelli, Alexandra Valchek, and Thierry Mara. And the idea there was that we looked in just the single snapshot prepared towards one time point and look at the cluster. To us at one time point and look at the clusters. And while we saw clusters that are definitely related to yellow fever vaccination and something else, you could definitely see some other clusters that are CMV related or yeah, so you will definitely see other clusters that are not to the something you're looking for. I see. Even without having any recent disease, you're saying, even still those clusters will exist just from the past, I guess. Yeah, they definitely will be clusters from. Yeah, they definitely will be clusters from the past, and also, as I said, it's really hard to imagine a perfect human being who doesn't have an active immune response going on. So, for example, what we saw during the yellow fever vaccination, you don't, if you will get a yellow fever vaccine, you will not experience any side effects. You will don't feel sick at all. Though, if you will look at the TCI repertoire, you will see that, I don't know, 10% of your whole repertoire is now responsible. Of your whole repertoire is now responding to the vaccine, so it's really hard to tell at what point your organism is not responding to any infections, pathogens, or antigens. Thank you so much. So I guess I can follow up on that kind of related question. Did you look at the clinical presentation of this different patients with different level of this public TCR? I mean, is there a correlation with the severity of the disease? With the severity of the disease? Yeah, that's a very good question. Indeed, in the last part that I told you about single-cell RNA-seq, there are patients with both mild and severe disease. However, we did not saw any correlation with the size or the publicity of this response. The only publications I saw that are pointing towards this direction is more about whether the cross-reactive response to common cold coronaviruses. To common cold coronaviruses could be beneficial. And we will try to look into this. And there is also the huge alpha chain in the report that is shared among children that experience MISD after the COVID-19. But in our data, we did not see any correlation between the publicity and the severity of the response. So, as Paul is setting up his computer, I think. Up to uh computer, I think you're gonna ask your last question and so you showed you were looking for these clusters and you showed you know four plots and the big cluster was only one of them. I think it was the alpha chain. Do you think it's like general that's there where you would find the bigger clusters? Is there a reason you could imagine why that's the case? Like that's the case, so if I understood the question correctly, is uh whether we will find bigger clusters in alpha chains and generally? Yes, okay, as you know.
