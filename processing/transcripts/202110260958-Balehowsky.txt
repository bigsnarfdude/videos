Of distances, this is kind of a lower co-dimensional rigidity problem. So, indeed, I know the distance between those two points, let's say I have a curve instead, and I know an area of a minimal fill-in for the curve. So, more precisely, the question that we considered was the following. So, let's say I have a Riemannian manifold with boundary, and for any simple closed curve on that boundary, I note that. Closed curve on that boundary, I know the least area surface which is bounded by that curve. Can I use this information then to determine the Riemannian metric? And the answer is yes, but with certain geometric conditions. However, in some cases we don't need every single possible curve on the boundary, but rather a particular family of curves, which is much, much smaller than all of the ones we could give. And the results that I'm going to present today have been extended by many of the people in this room and attending live. So it's been extended to higher dimensions in the Riemannian signature. And also, if I look at manifold minimal surfaces which are additionally planar but have higher genus, then this has also been extended to that type of case as well. Okay, so before continuing, like the boundary rigidity problem where I'm considering distances, there's also an obstruction in this case as well. And the obstruction is if I can't reach all regions with instructions. Um are the ceiling mics on? Yeah, the ceiling mics must have been turned back. Let's try this again. So there is structure where I can't reach all these regions by minimal services. And that is kind of how I have a mini sphere. I think it is a black hole sitting in this manifold. So none of the minimal services are going to pass through that middle II sphere. So, if this is, I'm sitting in this type of case, I can't hope to reconstruct a metric in that region. You can actually detect when this occurs. If you happen to have this family of minimal surfaces, if the area is not a C1 function, you know you're going to have a jump in the area functional. So you're going to be in a case like this. Okay, okay. So what we're going to do is route out that type of obstruction. out that type of obstruction and show that well let's give myself a manifolds for which can be Fourierated and in these cases you can return on a line metric for three classes of such manifolds with some additional conditions as well as a local result where I just know some information near a point on the boundary. Very briefly the first two classes for which we can show that we can identify the Lamanay metric arise from the following trade-offs. I arise from the following trade-off. The first is we're giving ourselves the least amount of data available, where I have basically the area information for this entire foliation of the manifold, plus nearby perturbations. And that's going to impose then on us more restrictions on the geometry, which you'll see in a moment. And the third class of manifolds is where I give myself more data, but then I am allowed to then take off restrictions from the manifold geometry. Geometry. And in this particular talk today, I'm going to discuss the result that we have for the first two classes because the rest of our results, both the one for more data and the local result, kind of depend on all of the ideas in this theorem. Okay, okay, so what is this result? So let's say I have a harmonium manifold, which is going to be a class one and class two. I'll explain what that means in a moment. I'll explain what that means in a moment. And I assume that I know. I see you. Okay, so I assume that I know about the monogram on the boundary. And also I have this given foliation on the boundary. I'll explain what type of foliation I take first of simple closed curves, which induces a foliation by mixed area surfaces. For this foliation, For this fuelation and its modified perturbations, and those areas of the minimal fuel range surfaces. So, with this information, then we can uniquely determine our monitor up to diffeomorphisms which fix the boundary. Because again, those types of diffeomorphisms I can't catch with my data. Okay, so now let me explain what I mean by mental class one and class two. One of the questions. So here's the setup. I have some manifold. There's a simple closed curve on the boundary, which is not too wiggly. And I fill in by a least area surface, which I'm calling YT. This is just one instance of this, but what I really have is the entire manifold has on the boundary a whole foliation of curves and I have minimal fill-ins and these are. And these are surfaces which foliate the entire manifold. Okay, so now let's talk about what I mean by the first and second classes of manifolds. So additionally, for technical reasons, I'm going to assume that the manifold is C4 smooth. We're going to work in dimension three, and I'll explain through the proof why that's important in a moment. Additionally, I assume that the manifold has. Additionally, I assume that the manifold has a strictly mean convex boundary. This allows me to solve the plateau problem, but I don't think it's a strictly necessary condition, but let's work with it to make our lives easy. And as I said, there's this foliation of simple closed curves of the boundary, which are not too wiggly in some technical sense. I can control their derivatives. And as I said, this induces a foliation by least area surfaces of the entire manifold. Okay, so in addition to that, here's the distinction for class one. I assume that the metric is going to be C clay, pardon me, is additionally going to be C3 close to Euclidean, in the sense that if you want to think of very loosely, when I zoom down even to the level of curvature, this manifold looks pretty flat. The second class is something that we call straight thin. We called straight thin. So there's now a trade-off between the curvature in the direction of the foliation and how wide or how girthy I'm allowed to take each of these minimal surfaces. So if I have not that much curvature in the foliation direction, I allow these areas to be quite wide. But if I have quite a bit of curvature in the direction, Curvature in the direction in which I'm foliating, then I want these surfaces to be relatively full. And this is a technical condition for which we can prove uniqueness, and I'll show where it pops in the proof. Okay, so let's then continue, and I'll give you a kind of bird's eye overview and a sketch of how we prove such a result. So, just to remind everyone, our goal is to use this least area data for the foliation to uniquely determine the Ramanian metric. And we're going to use this kind of by solving for the metric from leaf to leaf to leaf of this foliation. And here is where I'm going to. And here is where I'm going to use the fact that I'm in three dimensions with two-dimensional surfaces. I can use the conformal structure now of each of these surfaces to write the metric in a very nice way, in particular like this. So now I'm just basically solving for four different functions. And why I can solve for these four different functions, it's normally there's lots of conformal structures I can put on any surface. So artificially, I'm going to extend this to be asymptotically. To extend this to be asymptotically flat, my Riemannian manifold. And when I do that, I can specify how the conformal factor decays at infinity, and that will fix a particular conformal factor, which is unique on each of these minimal surfaces. And so now the key idea in this is: I'm going to use this foliation structure and variations of these mineral surfaces to my advantage. Surfaces to my advantage to then relate this geometric data of areas to information about a partial differential equation which lives on each of these surfaces. And to do that, what I'm going to do is I'm going to take the second variation of area. And from that, we can show that this determines the Dier Schleit-99 map for the stability operator on each of these surfaces. And so you can think of as a solution to this stability operator, it's just telling you the laps. Operator is just telling you the lapse between each of the functions of how much infinitesimal space there is from minimal surface to minimal surface. And from the second invariation of area, we determine this divirier denying the map. All right, so now that I'm working kind of in this with two-dimensional surfaces, as I mentioned, they have this conformal structure. So I can rewrite. So, I can rewrite this PDE, not with respect to the Laplacian and the metric on each of the two-dimensional surfaces, but with respect to Laplacian adjusting Euclidean space that adjusts the potential that you see here by the conformal factor. But I still know the Dierschlichen map for now this conformally transformed stability equation. And when, since I have this entire foliation, I minimize. This entire foliation by minimal services, you know, that this particular operator is a positive operator, and so I can use then a result of Adrian's, which showed that when you're in this type of case, the Dierschlaton-Eyman map determines the potential that's sitting in this operator. So I now know what this function is. It's a complicated one, but it's got some curvature bits and conformal factor in there, and so I've gained this information. This information. So you can try trying to extract information out of this potential, which I did try and unsuccessfully. Or what you can say is now I know what this function is in some sense. So now I can solve the forward problem and identify any solution to this particular equation. So if I know any solution, now I'm going to use that to kind of rig up good solutions. That to kind of rig up good solutions to try and pick out metric components. And I'll show you at this stage, I already know one of them. Since I can determine the lapse between each of these minimal surfaces, I actually know the G33 component just from this result already. So now I'm left to solve for these kind of off-diagonal components and the conformal factor. So how do I get the off-diagonal components? Is to use now this perturbations of Use now this perturbations of all of my leaves. That is not a brush. Anything for the laser planner? Sure. Thank you. Okay, so I have, say, some original surface. And just by perturbing normally, as we showed, we can identify this lapse function. So identify the So identify the G33 component. Now let me wiggle this a little bit by tilting. And when I'm in three dimensions, I have like two kind of canonical tilts that I can make. If I'm sitting on the surface and I think that there's like an x1 in an x2 direction, I can tilt in the x1 direction or tilt in the x2 direction. And when I do this, I can go through this whole procedure again, second variation of area, blah, blah, blah, and determine new. Variable blah blah blah and determine new lapse functions on the new tilted foliations. All right, so now I have this kind of family of lapse functions that I've identified. And in order to get equations for now picking off what's the metric component and kind of these off-diagonal components, I'm going to now linearize this and see what pops out. Okay. Okay, so linearizing this system of lapse functions about s equals zero, this tilting parameter, gives rise to nonlinear, non-local equations in the components of the inverse metric. That's somehow the natural wave appears. And it's in the components of all the things basically that I wish to solve. But okay, so now that at least gives me equations for this. That at least gives me equations for these off-diagonal components. How do I now identify the conformal factor? Well, I know that each of these minimal surfaces are indeed minimal, so their mean curvature must vanish. And if you write that out, the mean curvature of how it evolves from leaf to leaf, you get an evolution equation for the conformal factor. So now I have this kind of ugly system, quite honestly, or complicated system of equations. And perhaps you can solve them. Perhaps you can solve them straight away. But what we did is instead is to show uniqueness. So I'm going to assume that I have all this information, say, for manifold number one. And let's say there's manifold number two with metrics number two. They give me the same area data. So I have the same foliation of curves on the boundary identical. The metrics agree on the boundary, but now I'm filled in by minimal surfaces, which might be very wildly different, but the areas of those minimal surfaces are... But the areas of those minimal surfaces are the same. So, if I have this similar data, sorry, okay. So, if I have this data now, metric number one and metric number two, I'm going to take the difference of the metric components and re-look at these equations to linearize them. Okay, so since by taking just the second variation of area for the original foliation, Of area for the original foliation, can always identify right away this G upper 3,3 component. So when I take the difference of the two metric components, that is just going to be zero. Now, these kind of complicated equations for the off-diagonal components that I've identified by doing this kind of tilting perturbation, they kind of look like this, where now I have the difference of these off-diagonal components. Great, I want to solve for this. Want to solve for this, but what sits also here is the difference in the conformal factors or the conformal coordinates on each of these leaps. Because what I've done is I've chosen in the very beginning a very nice way to write the metric. Now that's my reference coordinate system. And when I do all of these tilts, I know the expression in the coordinate system with respect to the tilted conformal factors. So to then re-express everything on this kind of base system of reference system of coordinates that Of reference system of coordinates that I've been using, I get a difference in those conformal components sitting here. And this still is complicated. It's still a pseudo-differential operator, which is acting on basically all of the things that I want to solve for, including the normal direction to the leaf of the difference of the conformal factors. All right. All right, and then this sitting here is just the equation that you get, this evolution equation for the conformal factors from the minimality of all of these surfaces. So now I have this system to solve. This work? Nope. So what do I do next? So we show that these off-diagonal differences in the off-diagonal components can be written as pseudo-differential options. Can be written as pseudo-differential operators which act on the difference of the conformal factors and this normal derivative direction. And in order to invert that system, say I can write these as these pseudo-differential operators, that's where I use the conditions of either being close to Euclidean or this straight thin condition. So now that I can invert that system. And then once we can do that. And then, once we can do that inversion, then we can re-substitute those components in into the equation for the difference of the conformal factors. And we get an evolution equation, which I'm simplifying down schematically like this. Here now, P we can show is going to be a order one pseudo-differential operator in the tangential directions tangential to each of the mineral surfaces, that is. All right. All right, and so then the uniqueness of this Cauchy problem shows that, well, the conformal factors are unique, and then thus shows that the off-diagonal components, those have to have been unique as well. So that completes the proof. Are there any quick questions? I have a non-quick question. That's okay. Maybe there's a quick answer. Maybe there's a quick answer. So, one of the things I know that we ran into with extending your work to include the four-dimensional rents in the case was constructability. As in, you can prove uniqueness, but can remain a constructive proof. Right. If I recall correctly, there's just a small step that wasn't constructive. Do you have any comments on that now? So, that small step that wasn't constructive is going all the way back to Going all the way back to the kind of what I called not this one, but the complicated system of equations, which I didn't write here because they do take up the entire slide. I don't know how to solve that. If you could, you could write down and say this is what metric component number one is, metric component number two, blah, blah, blah. But I don't know how to do that. But that is the only missing piece? I believe so. Piece, I believe so, yes. I mean, why is that not transactive? That part yeah, what part of your frame answer? That G then GP1, V32, those are metric components. Yeah, I guess that's what you're referring to as G331, D332, like to build those up. It's down to these equations. But I don't know how to do it. It's done in a very perverse way. So if you knew that there is an arm and market you do know, you are able to construct these solutions or complicated. Or complicated, right? I mean, yes, you solve you solve an operate an integral equation, right? Well, the operator is known to you. So you can solve it. It's just horribly complicated. But the operator is a numb, I think, right? It goes down to the basis of moment operator, which we know at this point. Am I? Perhaps, yes, perhaps, yes. Perhaps yes, perhaps yes in this setting. Any others? Thank you. Okay. So let me then, in the remaining five minutes, just comment on some future directions that I'm interested in and where we want to go from here. So, wonderful. So, one direction would be to consider asymptotically hyperbolic. So, if you're in the Riemannian signature of ADS CFT, this is kind of the manifold that you would next consider. It's non-compact, which perhaps is a little bit of a challenge, but we'll see. But I'm interested in looking at if you knew the renormalized area information, then for surfaces that are, say, subtended by curves on the asymptotic boundary, can you then reconstruct the Riemannian? Can you then reconstruct the Riemannian metric in that setting? More generally, just larger classes of three-manifolds. Can we relax some of the conditions when we do this type of inversion procedure or figure out a different method that kind of skirts that difficulty? Higher codimensional services, which would be quite hard as recall that one of the key pieces of the information that we had is we reduced this kind of inverse problem on a Romanian. Of inverse problem on a Riemannian three manifold to know an inverse problem for a partial differential cohesion on a two manifold, which we knew the answer to. But I don't know the answer to that question in higher dimensions. So that would be some very interesting work in that direction. And kind of maybe more broadly, as we use this foliation structure to get kind of all of this information for the Riemannian metrics, when do these foliation structures exist? We've already seen some places where. Some places where they don't exist when I have this minimal two-sphere. But if I play around with the co-dimension or what happens, like when can I foliate a manifold, would be a very interesting question I'm interested in. All right, thank you so much, everyone, for your time. And I'm happy to take any questions. And sorry to the technical difficulties, to the people online. Online, yeah. So I can easily see why you might miss a piece of the manifold if you have the surface jumping at some point. Yes. If it never jumps, so if you're so if you have like this one brand, if you foliate the boundary, it curves somehow and the minimal surface is not jump. So it's like a continuous family or the transport or something. You're a different book or something. You know, a counter-example in that situation where you still cannot reconstruct the metric. No. So you have additional assumptions that you impose, but are those. So those additional assumptions are imposed to they're technical to invert the yeah yeah but do you have like a counterexample that suggests that some of them might in fact be necessary not yet that that's a very that's a very good question um no i don't have a counterexample in this this case yet where i have the full foliation but i mean i actually kind of But I mean, I actually kind of conjecture that if I have the full foliation and the nearby perturbations, I should be able to sweep into it all the way through. Exactly. Intuitively, you're kind of sweeping all the way through. So I would expect that this is enough, but I don't know how to answer that yet. But thanks for that question. Much more related is actually a small common. We can reconstruct a small portion coming in. Yes. So that should make it easier. Yes. So that should maybe be stressed that by taking small looks around the point, you can always go with a small amount always on condition. Yes. When you want to push really deeply to some manifold very fast, then we have this technical. Yeah, that is correct. I didn't talk on the local result because of time constraint, but yes, we have this local result for which we can always just push in a little bit near a point in the boundary. There are questions online. I think you can speak up. I think we had another one in the room. Yeah, can you remind us this? You had this class one and class two? Yes. So class one was, you said like C3. C3 close to Euclidean. Yeah. Is that some like point wise or is it global kind of what does close mean exactly? C3 close? It means that when I look at the metric components, say I write them in some coordinate system. Say, I write them in some coordinate system, say the one that I have. When I look at the difference between that and whatever the components are in the Euclidean metric in the C3. So there's a point twice calls at every point. Yes. No problem. I have another question if there are important things online. Sure. I'm not quite sure how to phrase this, but in the last talk, we were talking about how you can take there are situations once you get the right answer in the point of gravity. We expect that you have some boundary data and that there's multiple ways to fill in the bulk. Is there any hope of trying to rebuild these higher saddles from some equivalent kind of pattern? What do you do if you don't have just a single geometry? Maybe that's another way to put it. I'm not certain what you mean by you just don't have a single geometry. So I guess there's. Let me see if I can come up with a good way to phrase it. I'm not quite sure what the best diagnostic is from looking at area data. Maybe somebody who's more familiar with the morphology can put it. No, I guess what I'm really saying, well, sure, about the topology. Let's take a case where you have two disconnected boundaries. Okay. And then with those two disconnected boundaries, you may have a geometry that actually connects the two, or you might have two totally separate pieces of geometry. Of course. What I don't know is I don't know from extremal surface data. What's the easiest way to see? Surface data is the easiest way to see when that happens in when do we need these second cells in the quantum gravity case. So from there's an easy diagnosis there that we could have of determining when you can fill in in one case versus the other? Well, one for me, because I'm unfamiliar with the physics side, and I'm hoping some of my fellow physicists will help here, is when do we see the area data starting to indicate to us that it's necessary? To indicate to us that it's necessary to have two different background geometries. Is there an easy way to see one that has a physics bodies? Do you mean given the boundary data, you know for sure that there isn't a unique bulk reconstruction, for example, or is it? But I think that you want to make old reconstruction is that in order to calculate whether you're trying to build, in cases where you need these separate styles. Is there a Is there a geometric prescription? Is there a characteristic of the area data that's causing that you could use to see that that's required that you're going to need these second samples? When you talk about the area data, do you really need the area that you want to be solutions? Are you really like entangling entropy in some CFT state? I'm wondering if you can tell from an entropy whether you need, whether it's enough to get just one saddle or some supercision. Or some supercision. I mean, the second thing, thank you. Then I would guess, because a lot of the equations you're using are essentially overdetermined, right? And so I would guess there's just inconsistency in trying to recover the potential term and Jacob equation or something like that. If you have contingent entropies that don't correspond as a single classical geometry. Okay, so let's imagine that we're in a case like that, where you don't expect a single classical geometry because the already data is in. Structure because the already data is inconsistent, but you still expect that there's a way of thinking about it as a sum of cells. How long you would cover that second or equity answer in that case? Because if your initial, the initial array data, entropy data that you're given, that we want to put this array data, isn't it? Very cool. Okay, we should talk about it more, right? Yeah, I would like to. Yeah, I would like to hear more information. Maybe I can ask one. So, if you do this local problem, I guess standard theorems guarantee that you can go an absolute distance inside or something. But then, what's do you know what the breakdown is? Or there are different equations or example, develop a caustic or you turn into a singularity or something. So, what is the what are the types of weight downs? What are the types of breakdowns and of your differential equations that you would look at the problem if you're going? It's not as good as my account, for example, but some different versions of it. Right. Are you talking about breakdowns of the actual services? The geometry of the surfaces or of our analysis of our system? That's a reconstruction question. Thank you. Okay. What we're saying is the surfaces, let's say they're always smooth and they don't jump. Smooth and there's no jump. If the surface geometry is not unique, we can detail that from the question: what if there is another possible structure that you can see in the multiple problem horizon? Okay, our proof doesn't go through because the elliptic problem becomes very complicated. The very concrete is we could have non-inverted immediately, some elliptic system has a zero eigenvalue. So then we can't invert. We say that doesn't happen in the case of one, two, three, three, five is the other. In other cases, you know, maybe it doesn't happen, but we don't know what to say. It doesn't happen, we don't know what that means precisely geometrically. The method is very difficult for me to subsist in a complicated equations, and there's you know, there's a zero antique, but there's a non-anticle. It's not like geometrically, these are not so geometric. This is very technical inside of it, but I wouldn't say it's geometric. Thank you. So, maybe given the time, let's thank our speaker again and say further questions for the break. We'll be back here. I think nominally in 19
