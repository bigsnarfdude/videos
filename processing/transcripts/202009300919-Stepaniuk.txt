This is Anase Panyuk from University of Jubek, and she's going to talk to us about hyperuniformity. Thank you. Go ahead. Thank you very much for the presentation. And first of all, I would like also to say thank you to the organizers of this workshop for the possibility to give a talk and also for the possibility to hear the talks of other people. I will talk today about hyperuniformity. About hyperuniformity upon sequences and about hyperuniformity on flat torus. The idea of hyperuniformity is to estimate the quality of points distribution on manifolds, and in our case on the flat torus. So we can say that hyperuniformity is another measure of. Of estimation the quality of point configuration. As a concept, hyperuniformity was introduced first in 2003 by Tercato and Stillinger to measure reality of distributions of infinite particle systems in the whole space AD. They did it with the purpose to describe idealized point configuration. Devised point configurations which have properties between order and disorder. The main feature of hyperuniformity is that the local density fluctuations have smaller order than the IID random point configurations. And a hyperuniform system is one in which the number variance of particles has the small order than the window volume. window volume so it has a small smaller order than the other the power d and the number variance will be the main object and main tool in the definition of hyperuniformity of the hyperuniformity has also a lot of applications in physics and beyond the physics for example all perfect crystals perfect quasi Perfect quasi-crystals are hyper-uniform. So, hyper-uniformity allows to classify and characterize crystals, quasi-crystals, and some other exotic disordered varieties. It also was showed that colour receptors in bird eyes have a hyper-uniform structure, also carotene nanostructures in bird feather and many other. Further and many other examples. There is a picture from the paper of Tokato of the point configuration from the left is an example of non-hyperuniform point configuration. From the right we have the hyperuniform point configuration, and in the middle we have the periodic case and which of course is hyper-uniform. In the fall of 2015, during the semester program in Schroeding Care Institute, Selidor Takato asked the question how to define the notion of hyper-uniformity on compact manifold. And Peter Grabner, Johan Brauhart, and Warden Kürsner answered for this question and they defined the notion of hyper-uniformity. Notion of hyperuniformity on the sphere. They did it in these two papers. And in the same way as they define hyperuniformity for the sphere, we will define it for other compact manifolds for flat torus. So let I will remind the definition of the flat torus. remind the definition of the flat torus. Let lambda be a lattice in a D generated by some singular square matrix and then we define by omega lambda the fundamental domain of the coefficient space. By a lambda star we denote the dual lattice such as that which consists of all points from the space ID such that for any points of the lattice lambda scalar product is integer and by b x r And by BXR, we use a standard notation for includial ball of radius R and we center X. As I already mentioned, the number variance will be one of the main object in definition of hyperuniformity. So let be a seconds on point sets on the flat torus, then the number of variants will be Then the number variance will be defined with the help of formula 1, where under the integral we have the number of points of the second which fall in the ball of radius r, center x, and minus n of multiplied by volume of this ball. And nu is the normalized Lebesgue measure. It should be noticed that number variance is closely related with a uniform distribution and also with discrepancy. I will remind also the definition of uniform distribution. A sequence xn is called uniformly distributed on the fundamental lambda if Fundamental lambda if for the balls B X R, the relation two hole holds. So it means the number of points which fall in the ball of radius R divided by N should tends to the volume of this ball. Also from the weil criterion, this definition can be written, can be Is equivalent to the following limit. So we can say that seconds is uniformly distributed if the limit 3 is hold. Another classic measure for uniform distribution is given by the L2 discrepancy, which Which is defined by the following formula, and which just equals the squared of the integral of the number of variants. And also the definition of uniformly distributed sets can be given via discrepancy. It means that the second point set is called uniformly distributed. The point Z is called uniformly distributed if the limit 1 over n multiplied by discrepancy tends to 0, as n tends to infinity. From this, we can see that all these notions are really closely related with each other. And the definition of hyper uniformity: let Xn be a seconds of point sets and point sets and second we will consider the as in the same way as of in the same way as it was done for the sphere we will consider the definition hyperuniformity for the plateau and we will consider the three regimes of the three regimes of hyperuniformity hyper uniformity for large balls small balls and balls of threshold order so as a if let's excellence of point set on on the factor then The factor then this seconds is called hyperuniform for large balls if the number variance equals O small of n as n tends to infinity where the radius is some fixed number. Its sequence is called hyperuniform for small balls. If the variance equals O small of n multiplied by volume of a ball of radius n and small balls, it means that the radius Bows, it means that the radius should tends to zero as n tends to infinity, but at the same time, the ball should be large enough to catch the point. So, we have the second condition that the radius multiplied by n to the power 1 over d should tend to infinity. And this third regime, the second is called hypothesis. The second is called hyper-uniform for balls of Techial order. If the limit sup of a number of variants of this radar is T multiplied by n to the power minus 1 over D equals O big of T to the power D minus 1. And here we take at the beginning limit as n tends to infinity and then we take the limit as T tends to infinity. From the definition From the definition of number variance, we can just make direct computation and get that number variance equal such double sum. So actually number variance can be represented some kind of generalized energy. In this case, for function f a characteristic function, function gr has equal just It will just is represented is defined by formula 10. And also the Fourier series, we can compute the direct Fourier series of this function GR, which can be represented in terms of Basel function and have the form 11. So we showed if Xn is a sequence of point set which is hyperuniform for large balls, then we have that. Then we have that for all point for lattice point from dual lattice, the condition 12 holds. And of course, from this condition, it follows that this second is uniform distributed. Because for uniform distribution, from the right criterion, we need 1 over n squared, and here we just have 1 over n. So we have even logibles, we have even more than uniform. Have even more than a uniform distribution. We also showed that if xn is a seconds of point set which is hyper-uniform for a small ball, then this seconds is uniformly distributed. And if xn is a seconds of point set which is hyper-uniform of a ball of threshold order, then xn is also uniformly distributed. Threshold order means the balls between some Between some kind of case between small balls and large balls. Another example of hyper-uniform sequences are QMC design sequences. The notion of QMC design sequence was first time introduced by Brawl Khartzav Slavan and Pombusle in 2014 for the unit sphere. And also in the same way, we can consider. In the same way, we can consider QMC design sequences for the flat torus. The so-called space Wα2 for the flat torus consists of functions such that the norm of the form 13 is finite, where f hat is a Fourier coefficient with respect to the lattice. Also, this subway space is a producer kennell space. Producal canal space and the reproducible kernel can be written in the form 14. The worst case error of the QB rule in the Sobolic space of continuous function is defined by formula 14. We have here, as usual, supremum for all functions from the sub-life space, which belongs to the unit both of these. The unit both of this sub-level space, and under supreme one, we have the difference between a quadratic rule minus the integral of this continuous function. In the paper by a group of Italian mathematicians, it was showed that the worst case error for the flat chair is less than some constant multiplied by n to the power minus alpha over d. And whether there exists some seconds that worst case error will be less than some constant multiplied by n to the power minus alpha over d. And also they show that for each point configuration exists some functions such that this difference will be larger than some constant multiplied by enter the power minus alpha over d. And then using the same motivation as was for QMC designs and this As was for QMC designs on the sphere, we can say that we can give definition for QMC designs on the flat turrets. So let alpha larger than D over 2 and then seconds of endpoint configuration will set to be a seconds of QMC designs on the sublue space W alpha R if there exists some constant independent and answer. Constant independent and n such that the worst case error is less than some constant multiplied by n to the power minus alpha over d. And we showed that if xn is a QMC design seconds for the sub-leaf space with alpha larger than d plus 1 over 2, then these seconds xn will be hyperuniform for large balls, small balls, and balls of threshold order. Threshold order. QMC design seconds are example of hyper-uniform is one of the examples of hyper-uniform seconds on flight tourists. Also, originally, the notion of hyper-uniformity comes from the comes from the with probability probability notion and that's why the of it's it is expected that the point controlation will be produced by some of by some point process. That's why the variance for probabilistic point process will be the expected value of this integral. Integral. We will consider a probabilistic point process as jittery sampling and some of the tinental point process. I will briefly remind the definition of jittery sampling. So we consider irregular partition such that the union which consists of A1, AN. Of A1 of An, such that union of this Aj give us the whole fundamental domain, and such that any of two regions are disjoint and have small diameter. The diameter of each region is less than some constant multiplied by n to the power 1 over d and the existence of such petition exists. It was approved, for example, in the paper by Gigante and Leopardi. Party. Then the jittery sampling variance integral can be written in such form where nu j is a probability measure which have mass one on the each of the points. And we proved that the Jitterian sampling point process is hyper-uniform in all three regimes. Then other probabilistic process, which you can see it was a Timinantal process. I will also briefly I will also briefly remind the definition. A random point process is called determinanto with scan okay if it's simple and the joint intensities with respect to ground measure nu are given with the following formula. And we will consider the determinantal point processes which are drawn with the kernel of form 20 where functions n have finite support and such that they are equals zero. They are equals 0 or 1. These canals were considered in the paper by Jody Marta and Otega Septa. For this, for similar determinantal point process, they computed expected risk energy. And for some similar process drawn with such canal, we will study them in the for In the case for hyperuniformity, we also consider some special subset DN, which has a boundary of measure zero and which is located in some ball of radius C0 and to the power one over D plus C1, and also it contains a ball with radius C0 and to the power one over D. And this function Kn we will choose inside. Kn we will choose in such way that it will be equals one if the lattice point falls in this set dn and equals no otherwise. And then we will choose this constant S C0 and C1 such that the trace of this canal equals N. So it will allow that the determinant point process will have exactly n points. And we showed that the segmental point process is hyper-uniform for large and small balls, and for the threshold order, some a bit weaker property holds. So it's hyper-uniform, but with a bit weaker behavior. For the threshold order, the limit of number variance of t to the power n minus 1 over d will have t to the power d minus 1 and log. Power d minus one and log t. We'll have here some extra log term. And that's all. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Tatiana. Okay, do we have any questions? Feel free to raise your hands or use the chat. In the meantime, I'm sorry, this is a question shows that I should know more about this stuff, but what do these QMC constructions on the sphere look like actually the definition on the sphere is similar to the definition of flat tory. That's why I guess here instead of large balls on the sphere, are they considered spherical caps? Okay. It's like natural and here instead of balls, instead of spherical caps, we have a ball. Sure. Have a ball, sure, sure, and you use the natural measure, okay. But I see, and the idea of the then will be the same as was for the sphere, okay? Fair enough, but but I guess I was wondering, uh, um, the actual points as it achieve these QMC error rates, uh, what do these constructions look like? Uh Q uh second. Maybe I missed something. Uh Missed something. Can you go a little further? The idea to consider KMC design seconds for the sphere was that they are seconds that are point with regression such that they achieve the order of the best possible order. Right, right, right. By order are not worse than the best possible order. And for the Taurus, it's like the same idea because we can see that the best possible order is the end of the power. Possible order is the n to the power minus alpha over d, and this order is achieved for some seconds point sets. So that's why it was defined that the QMC design seconds are such that the worst case error will be less than n to the power minus alpha over d. So it will have this order. Right, right. Oh, I guess I was just wondering how you construct a sequence that achieves this order. How you construct a sequence that achieves this order. But maybe that's not that easy to do. On the sphere, it can be like an example of t-design. Okay, I see. Because it will be canceling and in the meantime, Matthew has a question. I see a raise hand. Yeah, thanks. Thanks for your talk, Tatiana. Very nice. Very nice. I'm wondering about the Tao order metric. Do you have any results for that? It's like a fourth moment. Can I share my screen? Yeah, sure. Then I need to stop share. Yeah, you should be able to share your screen. Yeah, I'm wondering about this thing, the Kendal Tau distance. Oh, oh no, I didn't hear about it. Okay, that's fine. Thank you. But thank you for your question. I will take a look on it. Thank you. Okay. Okay. And I think we have a question in chat also from Eli. Does the analysis depend in any way on the structure of the lattice which defines the torus? Or can you just assume lambda? Oh, can you just assume, I guess, the fundamental domain. Oh, sorry, can you just assume that the lattice is the integer lattice? Actually, probably, yeah, actually, we probably can assume the lambda. Yeah, actually we probably can assume the lambda equal just equals that to the power D. Well, we'd have the same results with but but it's possible to was pro uh was possible to prove just for general lattice with lambda for any metrics. Okay. Any other questions? Okay, thank you. I will stop this recording and I think we come to And I think we come to talk about
