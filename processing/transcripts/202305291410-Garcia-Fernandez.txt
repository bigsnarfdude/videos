Okay, so our final lightning speaker for the morning is Mario Garcia Fernandez from what I assume is the autonomous University of Madrid, not the time-independent University of Madrid. He's going to talk about open questions on the heterotic G2 system. Okay, so thank you very much to the organizers for inviting me to come here. I'm very happy because this is one of my favorite places on earth. And I always can want to write. I can. So I apologize because I changed the topic of my talk. And somehow, in the spirit of what Ilka was telling us this morning, I thought this review could motivate further discussions and maybe get the interest of some young mathematicians in the audience. Some young mathematicians in the audience to work in this interesting set of equations. Let me start by telling you about this entire geosystem, so the place where the origins of this thing has to do with supergravity. So we have an n-dimensional spin manifold with some principle k-vandal over it, with k in order to take it comparable. And then physicists define this set of a. And then physicists define this set of equations, which are kind of involved. They depend on a tuple, which G is a metric, H is a three-form. Sigma for me is going to be a one-form arbitrary sphere. A is a connection on this band of B, and eta is a spinner, which is going to be a field. And then we're going to say that this data satisfies the Killing Spinner equations if the following equations are satisfied. So let me go through. Satisfied. So let me go through each of them. So here, Nabla plus is the spin connection associated to the symmetric connection, which has total skew symmetric torsion H. This bit here is hookup in terms of, so we're also saying that the sphere is varied with respect to null data. So this thing here is hookup with respect to a different connection. You take nabla one-third, which is this AGO metric connection with total exclusion with the torsion one-third of H. Of H and then we'll declare the spinner to be the Virac operator of this connection. I think the spinner is sigma times the spinner. So notice that in particular, this notion of killing spinner is different, it's a bit unorthodox, because a killing spinner will have the eta or the sigma as a companion for this, for this equation, rather than the special equation is equal zero. Sorry? Oh, this is equal zero, yeah. Sorry, yeah, sorry, yeah. Sorry, yeah, sorry about that. Yeah, so everything is homogeneous. Yeah, so this is equal to zero. And then the last equation is that, so this sigma can be sort of anti-matically as a vector field, and then this is like some sort of, instead of killing a spinner, the harmonic spinner with this, with this additional vector field. And then we have also that this connection A annihilates the spinner. So it's an instant on with respect to whatever structure that is being. So these equations are kind of complicated, but they appear for some reasons naturally in physics. So when the dimension of your manifold is 10, t is Lorentz, so it has signature 1, 9, and sigma is exact. This function typically is called the dilaton. These are the so-called Killing Eyes Finner equations in SuperBec. And these are back, these are very old equations going back to. All the equations going back to the work by Chaplin and Manta in 83, even before the string theory was discovered. This is something about supergravity capable with supercharming. Okay, so there is this, what about these equations in relation to the topic of this workshop? So there is this fundamental result by 3D. Can I ask a quick question? Sure. How does that principle bundle connection relate to the Relate to the killing spinner, these equations. Why is there? Are you twisting the spinner bundle, this principal bundle as well? No, no, no, no, no, no, no. These are probably these are like you have some independent bundle and you just declare the curvature to annihilate the spinner. Okay. Okay. So in 2002, working on previous work by physicists, Jean-Lev King, Arthurian Wadron, Friedrichs and Ivanovina, fundamental paper in the SGR of mathematics. Paper in the engineer of mathematics proved that you can rewrite these kiding and screener equations in a very nice way when you have seven dimensions. This was already being done for six dimensions by stroming neural hole and they managed to write this in terms of a natural structure, so now I'm going to be in the seven-dimensional case. I'm going to take my metric to be now Riemannian, okay? Riemannian, okay, and then the theorem says that a two-fold as before, given by a metric, a three-fold, and a real, you know, serial spinner for G satisfies this basic Linear spin equations if and only the corresponding G to structure the G to structure corresponding to the spinner satisfies this equation here. Sorry, this is not working, since this equations here. So remember from this morning. Remember from this morning that the isotropy of a vector in the spinal station for spin 7 was precisely G2. So if I have a parallel spin with respect to this Nabla plus connection, then it's going to reduce the anonymity to G2. And this is where this free form comes from. And this free form needs to satisfy the following equations. So it's going to be big phi watch phi is going to be zero. More generally, in More generally, in the physics literature and also in the math literature, people consider this corrected by some factor. I will talk about this soon. And this is telling you that up to this sigma, the three-form corresponding to the heater structure is closed. But there is this correcting factor here. And also that the connection needs to be an instant. Okay, and there is a specific formula for the tree form. For the three-form, which is given by the torsion of the D-to-shot. Also, tau and the one-form sigma corresponds to the total class tau one. Okay. And the sigma. Yes, sir. And it does not need to be closed. I mean, this theorem works in general. You don't mean edge. And the edge also does not need to be closed. Sorry? The three form also does not close. With no assumptions. No assumptions. So far, this is just about the Kili-Spinner equations. Now I go to the theoretical system. Equations, now I go to the iterative detox system. So, the iterative d2 system precisely. Sorry, can I ask a question? Sure, yeah. Go back. So, for me, the first two equations are saying that the one part and the 14 part of the torsion are zero, so you only have a seven and a twenty-seven. And the one. But the one which is sigma. No, the one is zero from the first bet, right? No, the the one no no no. The seven. Okay, oh zero. Taunt zero. Tell zero. Taunt zero. Okay. Taunt. Yeah, tau zero is here. Yeah, that's zero. Tau 2 is zero. So you have a tau one and a tau. But then the h is not purely one type or the other, right? Because that sigma would have a different factor on it. Yeah, that's right. That's right. That's both of them. Yeah. That's funny. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. So now let's go for the aeterative detail system. So what is the athletic detox system? It's the equations discovered by Friedrich Arvano supplemented. This anibano supplemented by some further constraint. What is this further constraint? The constraint is just that two constraints. On the one hand, I'm going to have this seven-dimensional ST manifold. The only additional ingredient I need is to fix some invariant in the Lie algebra of the structure group, of the principal value. Now, I'm going to say that a tuple, given by a three-form which determines a data structure, a connection. The terms of digital structure, a connection A and a function satisfy the derivative system if these equations are satisfied. So these four equations here, this is not working, these four equations here are precisely the same thing that we found before. And the only additional ingredient, the only two additional ingredients are that sigma, the one from before, is now the exact, okay, plus this other. Plus, this other equation here, which is a bit mysterious, which is called the Bianchi identity. And it naturally appears in the context of string theory as some sort of anomaly cancellation condition. Okay, so this is the editivity. This is more generally, as for example in the work by Lotte and Sarb, and also Delaos and collaborators. More generally, one allows for a non-zero tau-zero torsion, which needs to be zero torsion, okay, which needs to be constant. Okay, so the first open question I would like to pose, because I have given you this nice result by Frederic Anioun, is whether the equations with non-zero tau admit an expinodial formulation, because this is something I really don't know. So physicists tell us that this is true, but you need to go back to the Lorentz setup. So you need to go back to the 10-dimensional manifold and somehow construct the three-form torsion, which The three-form torsion, which has some legs on the Minkowski space. And that will be very interesting because if this is the case, then it means that the system has an additional two-form popping around, which probably is a B-field, which is what it means. Okay. But this is the first thing I would like to tell you about, which is unclear, or at least I don't know. I don't understand. And you don't care for instant ones on the tangent plan. Sorry? You don't care for instant ones or the tangent plan. So, okay, so this is good. So, as for the mathematics, So, as for the mathematics, this is the only thing you need. The mathematics of the system only are going to see this essentially. If you want to go into physics, then that's probably, you can probably argue about this thing, but this is all you need. I mean, because a pairing may have arbitrary signature, and you can take the direct sum of two bundles and take trace minus trace and then that's it. Okay. But this is the I would say that this is the fundamental equation they need to study from the mathematics method. To study from the mathematics. Okay. So, why do we care about these equations and what do we know about them? So, the first thing we need to know about this is that this system is elliptic. This is a nine system of equations. And it was proved in collaboration with Andrew Clerk and Cartier Clerk back in twenty sixteen, even though this original proposal was never published. And we recently published a paper in Advances in Physical Mathematical Physics, which contains that result. Physics which contains that. So, so what we prove there is that the retic2 system, as I have stated it, this equation here is an edit system, it is multi-degree because it involves this Bianca entity which other pieces which need to be taken care of. And furthermore, there is an interesting quantity which they have attached, which is a string class. So, this just comes from the Dianke entity. So, you can forget about the rest. So, the Diane entity. Forget about the rest. So the NQL tells us that if I pull back this equation, say, to the total space of the bundle, I can interpret this as having a closed 3-4 there, which is this 3-form here. It's the pullback of the torsion, H, minus the torsion of 3-form. Okay? And magically, once you do this trick of fixing this quantity, the system becomes much larger. It defines an elliptic system, but now of differential operators of. Of differential operators of order one. And I anticipate that this system is the right system to study. So the equations with fixed string class are the fundamental thing we need to understand. Okay, I should mention also that the first people who started studying this system of equations were Semyon Elsa, Maderen Laforce and Sans. So they posted posted a paper on the archive one year before us, but they were not able to prove a finalness of this ellipticity. Finances of the system electricity. We prove it in this preprint and then they reprove it with a different method in this paper in 2017. Interestingly, the method is completely different and even more interestingly, I believe that what they are doing is to prove that some other system is elliptic, not this one. But I will tell you more about that maybe. Okay, so let me move on. So, what do we know about the systems of solutions? Of solutions. So for compact solutions with tau c equals to zero, there is a first paper by Fernandez of Guattan Via Campa. And then in this recent preprint, we also constructed some solutions on T3 bundles over K3 surfaces. For example, compact solutions with Tau0 and non-zero, there is a recent proprietary De Laos and Galiano. May I say something to that one? Because I'm working with Matteo Galiano and we found that. Yeah, and we found certain mistakes there. So they have like only for some specific values of all the prime they have solutions now. So there's a slight computational mistake there. But do you mean that the equations, the solutions are perturbative, or they only work for some of the primes? So only for some of the primes. Which means that they satisfy these equations at the same time. There are some solutions in. There are some solutions in in this three seven theoretic. In spot seven sequences. Okay. And then there's this also these nice papers by Lautai and Henrique Serv, where they construct approximate compact solutions with tau zero differ for zero. And these solutions are approximate in the sense that the instanton condition is only satisfied at a certain order in some parameter scan. If you don't care for instant tons on the tangent bundle, then I think it's satisfied in the nodes. I'm going to tell you why instantons are Instantons are extremely important. So the extenton condition is extremely important. You can get rid of it when it's really something fundamental about the equations. It's not something that you just... The way I studied the system, it really involves the two connections are playing the same role, the way you know them. And the two need to be instantaneous. Otherwise, nothing works. So this is very important for the geometry. So the second open problem I wanted to pose or to argue, these are really a bunch of problems that A bunch of problems, but so it's yes, to as you see, the list is minimal. We have very few examples, and so can we construct large classes of exact solutions? Can we understand the large volume limit? So, there is a way of producing, conjecturally, there is a way of producing solutions from G2 holonomy manifolds and just taking one instant on and doing some sort of what this is we call this standard embedding. And we don't know how to do that, even though we know it for SU3K. For SU3 case. So, in this paper with Andreas, we managed to prove it for the six-dimensional astrometer system, but we didn't know how to do it for C2. What does exact mean here? Sorry? What is the meaning of exact? Will you actually solve the equations? Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, if I exactly, you actually solve the equations, yeah, yeah. Sorry. I just wanted to make a headpoint there. So, why is it why can't you do it in the G2 case? Just do the same method. Case just the same method. We tried, we tried for a while, and we you also tried, I think. I don't know what to do about that. I can explain more in the afternoon. And also, can we turn on some geometric flows which help to understand this question? And there is actually a very nice paper, recent paper in the physiology literature by Asmore, Minasian, and Proto, where they study something. And Proto-Ware, they study something called the G2 stromium stand. So, how much time I have? Minus one? One minute. One minute. Okay. Okay, so maybe I finish with two small slides. So one conjecture, which is that the modular specs of solutions of this Eternal G2 system should have a specific metric if you fix the string class. And this specific metric. And this specific metric is going to be of Haitian type. So the conjecture statistic needs a pseudo-Riemannian metric of Haitian type with this particular potential. Okay, and for this to be true, you need instant tones on the bundle you are taking. You cannot take approximately anything. So by its content, this is just a modular. Yes, basically. I'm maybe supporting this for it in these papers. You're not taking the log. Yeah, you should take log. You should take it. So the last excitement I would like to comment is about this nice construction of coupled due to insectors, which is due to this is a young mathematician, Arnon de la Sidra Jr, who is working in data math, he's a master student of Hendrique CERC, and then he's going to visit Oxford afterwards. Visit Osford afterwards. And he managed to reprove a result by the Lausanne Lafor Sandersmans who tell us about, I think, the deep meaning of these equations. What do they mean? So what happens is that if I give you a solution of the ZRTT2 system, what you can construct is another instant in a higher dimensional bundle. And this bundle is very simple. So you take a solution of the ZRTT2 system with possibly tau zero and possibly tau one not being. And possibly top one not even being exact, but just close. And then you consider the bundle given by the tangent plus the adjoint. And then you hook up this connection. So you see, this connection here in this bundle, it has the wrong torsion. It has the wrong sign. Well, the theorem first proved by Graham Larfo-Sanez-Mans in 2019, and then, I mean, Agnardo has completely understood the proof, completely detailed, and also in the. And also, it's really generalized by taking tau zero arbitrary and tau one close. Is that if you have a solution of the interdictity to system, then this D is an instant of. And very briefly, let me give you one example. Suppose that you have no bundle, no bundle. Then take this athletic T2 system with tau one close and tau zero non-zero. Then there are some nice solutions constructed recently by Lucia Martin Marchan. Martin Marchan, Prasfero. What is no bundle? Suppose that the structure group of the bundle is one, it's trivial. But since you are allowing tau one to be closed by non-exact, there are solutions which are not due to anonymity. After on geometries like S3, cross S3, cross S1, and I believe it's S3. This is three cross T4. This do the R, correct me if I'm wrong. So this geometry is carrying natural solutions of this interactive G2 system with no bundle, and therefore the tangent bundles, I mean, a G2 instant, a G2 instanton. I'm not sure if these are new G2 instantons or something that is not operating. So thank you for that.
