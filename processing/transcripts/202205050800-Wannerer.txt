To thank the organizers for inviting me and for organizing this event and bringing together so many interesting speakers. So, this talk is about intrinsic volumes and the value-cube theorem in known spaces, and it is based on joint work with Dima Feifman. So, before I start, let me apologize. Let me apologize for the improvised style of the talk. I'm currently on parental leave and watching after my 10-month-old daughter doesn't leave much time for pretty much anything else. Okay, so let's start. And so, I mean, since we want to discuss intrinsic volumes in non-spaces, let us first start with the classical case of intrinsic volumes. Intrinsic volumes in Euclidean space Rn. So, this is something which is, of course, very well known to convex geometers, but since this is a mixed crowd, I would like to go very quickly over the main facts. So, okay, so the intrinsic volumes, they are certain numbers associated to a convex body in Rn and probably. And probably the easiest way to define the intrinsic volumes is via the so-called Steiner formula. So, this has appeared already in several talks. So, we consider the volume of k plus a ball of radius r plus stands for the Minkowski sum of sets. And it turns out that as a function of r, this expression here is a polynomial. Expression here is a polynomial, and so polynomial of degree n, and we can consider, of course, the coefficients of this polynomial. And after making a suitable normalization, we call these coefficients the intrinsic volumes of the convex body k. Okay, so this normalizing constant is just the k-dimensional volume omega k. Volume omega k is the k-dimensional, the volume of the k-dimensional Euclidean unit wall. Okay, so these are the intrinsic volumes. And let's okay, so I've said it here again. So there are n plus one of them. And okay, so let's look at some of the special cases here. So the top one is just the usual volume of k. The n minus first one is just one half of the surface area of the boundary of k, and the lowest one is just constant one. Okay, so these are the intrinsic volumes. And now let us discuss some of the properties. Of course, there are many, many properties we have to make a choice here. But the most... So, for us, the most important one will be that, or yeah, so that it will be important for us to note that the name intrinsic is indeed justified because they behave in an intrinsic fashion. So, by this, I mean if you have a convex body which sits, which is contained in a, let's say, linear subspace of Rn, so you get an induced Euclidean structure on the subspace. The subspace, and so you can consider the intrinsic volume just inside E or inside Rn. But it's a fact that it doesn't matter whether you consider it inside E or inside Rn, the ice intrinsic volume is the same. So it's independent of the ambient space. So this is a very important fact and And in particular, if you combine this with this property of the top degree intrinsic volume, you see that if you have an I-dimensional convex body and you take its I-th intrinsic volume, then you get just the I-dimensional volume of K. Okay, so this will be important for us, and now let's. us and now let's take a look at other proposed other properties that will be relevant for us so the first thing is that the intrinsic volumes as a as a function of convex bodies behaves in a finitely additive way. So we have the property that if the union of K and L is again convex, then you just you can express this in terms of the intrinsic volumes of terms of the intrinsic volumes of K, L, and the intersection of K and L. And this property is known as the valuation property of this function. So intrinsic volumes are valuations. And then there are a couple of easy properties like behavior under scaling. So if you multiply like this, then with some, let's say, positive number, then you can take out r raised to the power i and okay, and then if you translate, Okay, and then if you translate, it's obviously invariant under translations. And you also have this property that the intrinsic volume is invariant under reflections in the origin. And finally, the intrinsic volume is also continuous with respect, so as a function on the space of all convex bodies, it is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff metric. Have something on the right end of your screen which uh interferes with the right part of the screen. Yeah, can you just make it disappear like this? Okay, is this better? Yes, yes, it's better. Okay, okay. Okay, so and in the following, I would like to abbreviate these five properties. And whenever a function on the space of convex bodies has these. function on the space of convex bodies has these five properties I will say that this function lies in well i plus where well stands for translation invariant and continuous variations the subscript i stands for i homogeneous so this property and the plus stands for for evenness so for this property um okay Okay, so now our first task is to try to make sense of intrinsic volumes in a known space. And so one way to approach this would be to have somehow a characterizing property of intrinsic volumes that is such that we can formulate this property also in a norm space. Okay, so this will be our next. Okay, so this will be our next goal. And in order to get this characterization, we will make use of Klein's theorem with a general fact about valuations. And Klein's theorem concerns precisely such functions on the space of convex bodies. And it says that if such a variation vanishes on all either... On all high-dimensional convex bodies, then it's identically zero. Okay. So if you believe this, then you immediately get the following corollary, which is a characterization of intrinsic volumes. So let phi be i homogeneous, so an element of Li plus, and suppose that for either. And suppose that for high-dimensional convex bodies, you have that it just gives you the high-dimensional volume of k. Then phi is equal to the intrinsic volume, the ice intrinsic volume. So another way to interpret this statement is to say, well, there exists a unique extension of the I-dimensional volume to evaluation on all convex bodies. Point is and the proof is very easy. So just consider phi minus the ice intrinsic volume, which will be zero on I-dimensional convex bodies. And hence, Klein's theorem tells you that this is identically zero. Okay, and so this crawlery is what we will use to extend the intrinsic. To extend intrinsic volumes to normal spaces. Okay. And okay, so we will consider one particular choice of intrinsic volumes in normal spaces, but I will comment on this later. So what is our setting here? So we consider a finite dimensional real vector space with a norm that we denote by f for reasons. By f for reasons that will become clear later. And we will make an assumption on the unit ball of this norm. So we will assume that it is smooth and has a strictly positively curved boundary. And as I've said, our goal is now to define variations such that with the following property, so that if we have a convex body contained in a linear subset. In a linear subspace of V. Then, so what we can consider now, we can consider E with the induced norm. And now we would like to assign to a norm these variations in such a way that if k lies in E, then computed with respect to the induced norm on E, inside of E, the ice intrinsic volume should. The I's intrinsic volume should be the same as computed inside V. So, this would be a reasonable concept of intrinsic volume. And note that in particular, what we expect is that if what our valuations should satisfy, if we have an eye-dimensional linear subspace and we restrict the subspace and we restrict the variation to this high-dimensional subspace then this should be nothing else than the volume inside inside this norm space e with the restricted norm um and as we have heard so okay so this seems fairly simple and by clan's theorem we know that if we can indeed find such a family of valuations then they will be unique um Okay, so far so good. But as we have already heard on Monday in Johan Carlos' talk, the notion of volume or how to normalize volume in a normed space is a bit tricky. And so this actually requires some thought. So first problem is it's not really clear which. So if you think about this, Which, so if you think about this a bit and take into account what Joan Carlos has told us, so then you see we have to make some choice here. And so the question is, how should we normalize? Okay, so maybe let me, for those who are maybe not so familiar with this problem, let me say in two sentences what the issue is. So of course, when you consider translation invariant measures on a vector space, On a vector space, they form a one-dimensional space. So the space of up to normalization is just one Haar measure, but the issue is which normalization to choose. So in Euclidean vector space, you could say, okay, so you take every unit cube, it should have volume one. But we don't have a unit cube in a normal space. And so the question is, how should we normalize? And okay, so there are several standard ways how to normalize. The relevant one for us, it will turn out to be the Holmes-Thompson definition of volume. So how is it defined? Let me remind you. So we can consider V times V star, which has a natural symplectic structure. Has a natural symplectic structure, and so we can consider on it the symplectic volume that we denote by volt to n. And now, um, given, let's say, Porel set in V A, we define its Holmes-Thompson volume in this way, where this denotes the unit board of the dual norm. And there is a normalizing factor. And there is a normalizing factor, so we divide by the volume of the Euclidean of the Euclidean n-dimensional unit ball. Why do we have this constant there? Well, if f comes from a Euclidean inner product, we want this definition to give us the usual way we normalize volume on a Euclidean vector space. Okay, so this is the Ernst-Domson definition of volume. So this is very good. So, this is very good. So, we have made a decision here. And so, now the above makes sense. And so, the question: we know if it exists, these intrinsic volumes will be unique. And the question now that remains to settle is to settle existence. And this was done by Alvarez Paiva and Fernando in 98. So, they proved. So, what they proved is that yes, for the Hamstockson definition of volume, these intrinsic volumes exist. So, okay, so yeah, so this is the characterizing property. I've stated here it here once again. And yeah, and so with this nice property, you also get this behavior under restrictions. Okay. Maybe one thing I want to tell you has a question. Yes, yes, sorry. So are there such theorems for other definitions of volume, or maybe it's known that it's not possible? That's a good question. So to the best of my knowledge, I know only of I know only that this extension to evaluation works for the Holmes-Thompson volume. Because there are other sort of natural definitions, right? Yes. For example, I don't know if it works for Boosemann. So I don't know. Or Chromov Maas and so on. Okay. Okay. Yeah, so but we will see that the stocks and volume has special properties. So there might be others, but certainly this has very good properties from certain perspectives. So I should also remark here that around the same time this question was considered by Schneider and Wierke with a slightly different assumption. So they assumed that That the unit ball of for the dual norm is a sonoid. So, a sonoid is a convex body that can be approximated by polytopes that are finite sums of segments, of line segments. And so, you might wonder why this assumption, why assuming this? So, it turns out. So it turns out if you want your Holmston intrinsic volumes to be monotone, so if K is a subset of L and you want the intrinsic volumes to increase, so to be monotone, then you need this assumption. And also the proofs become, I would say, a little bit easier with this assumption. Let me also point out. Point out that here there is no Steiner formula involved. So, okay, I mean, there is a proof also where that involves somehow a Steiner formula. But in any case, these intrinsic volumes, they don't, it's not just that you consider instead of unit, Euclidean unit ball, you add the unit ball of the norm and just so that's not what's happening here. So, okay, so there is no Steiner formula. So, there is no Steiner formula interpretation for this formula. Okay, and now from so okay, so let me now mention a special property of these Homes-Thompson intrinsic volumes, which is related to integral geometry and the Alaska product. So, this again was proved by Ivores Paiva and in the different and in a different was a consequence of reproof by Bernick in 2007. So there is a natural product structure on valuations. It turns the space of valuations into cumulative algebra and with an identity element and so on. And it turns out that That the Hans-Thompson intrinsic volumes respect or behave very nicely with respect to this product structure, namely in this way. And let me point out one consequence of this relation, namely, you see, when you apply this iteratively, you see that all the Holmes-Thomson intrinsic volumes are powers. Are powers of the first one, powers with respect to the Alaska product. So, and that's interesting. That's interesting, but it has also another consequence. So, only the Holmes-Thompson intrinsic volumes will have this property. Why? Because for the one homogeneous one, which is determined by the choice of volume in one-dimensional norm space, but Norm space, but the volume in a norm in a one-dimensional norm space, there is no discussion about what this is, it's just the lengths defined respect to the norm. So no matter which definition of volume you choose, all the one home, the one, so the intrinsic volume of degree one, they will all be the same. So independent of which definition. So yeah, so the definition of volume in a one-dimensional norm space, they all agree. Norm space, they all agree. So there is just one, one homogeneous one. So you see, if you want, yeah, so you see that only the Holston intrinsic volumes will have this property that all of them are powers of the first one. Okay, so let us. Okay, so let us now move to the second topic addressed in the title, namely the wild cube serum. So this was mentioned already in Cho Fu's talk on Monday. Let me repeat the statement of the theorem. So Hem and Weil proved the following statements. So let A be a compact smooth submanifold with corners in Rn. Then first of all, A, there exists a version of the Steiner formula. So you consider the volume for all points in a range with distance at most r from A. So you consider R cube. R cube around a and what happens is again this as a function of r this will be a polynomial provided r is not is sufficiently small and okay so again we normalize the coefficients suitably and call the coefficients then the intrinsic volumes of a and there is a part b to that theorem which says that these coefficients These coefficients you get, they are intrinsic in the following sense, namely, they depend only on the induced Riemannian geometry of A. So the first part of the theorem is relatively easy to prove and the second part is harder and of course much more interesting. And of course, much more interesting. And so I think you can already guess where this is headed. So, B, okay, we can B, certainly this will not, we cannot ask in a norm space because we have already seen for convex bodies this will not work. But the second, but we can at least ask whether the second part, item B, also holds in a norm space. Also, it holds in the norm space if we consider the unstorms of intrinsic volumes. And so, this was a conjecture put forward by Joseph Fu. And okay, so it says that whenever you have a compact sub-manifold with corners in your normal space V, then the Herms dorms and intrinsic volumes depend of A, depend only on the induced Finn's level. And only on the induced Finns-Lerian geometry of A. So, okay, so I think the statement is. Okay, so one should maybe think about how this is actually defined for, because so far we have considered only convex bodies, but this is a minor point. So the question is really whether this is really an intrinsic quantity or not. Is really an intrinsic quantity or not. Okay, so this conjecture is easily seen to be true for two-dimensional sub-manifolds A. But in general, it was open. And, you know, so when you, so it's somehow clear that this. Somehow clear that this will somehow relate intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of A in a way. And as we have heard yesterday in Sergei Ivanov's talk, this is a subtle business in known spaces, in field geometry. So this is currently not well understood. And let me just And let me just mention this really beautiful and remarkable fact proved in a paper by Brago and Ivanov from 2011. So they proved that for every surface, every two-dimensional Finza manifold can be locally embedded in a four-dimensional norm space as a settle surface. So when you contrast this with the Com contrast this with the Riemannian situation where this is, of course, not possible because it would imply negative curvature. So, this, yeah, so it's quite bizarre. So, yeah, so from that perspective, the conjecture would be very interesting, if true, but maybe it's a bit too optimistic. So, in effect, what we will show, or what we have shown together with Dima Feifman, is Dima Feifman is that the conjecture is not true. But what we could show also is that a weakened version of this actually holds in a number of situations. Okay, so let me, before I present the main results, let me reformulate this conjecture in the language of valuation theory. Okay, so Okay, so this has appeared yesterday already, but let me repeat it. So let M be a smooth-oriented manifold, let's say, and let P of M denote compact submanifolds with corners in M. Then a valuation, a smooth valuation is a function on all these compact submanifolds. On all these compact submanifolds with corners, taking values in R of very special form, namely, it's given by two differential forms: an n form on M and which you integrate over A, and an n minus one form on the cosphere bundle of M, which you integrate over the conormal cycle of A, which is the outward pointing conormals to A. Okay. Okay, and this concept was introduced by Seminole Lasker and who proved various properties of this space and so on and so on. But for us here, we will just use, yeah, so we will, of this whole machinery, we will use in particular one concept. So we will So, we will make use of the pullback of variations along maps. So, if E is an embedding of M into N and we have a smooth variation on N, then we can define the pullback expected way. So, yeah, like this. And And this definition also naturally extends if E is not an embedding, but only an immersion. Yes. Okay, and now here comes the promised reformulation. So the conjecture in the above form is equivalent to the following. So suppose we have two embeddings of small. Of a smooth manifold M into normal spaces v1 and v2. And so this, yeah. And let's assume that the induced Finns-Layerian structures coincide. Then the conjecture is that the pullback of the Holmstongston intrinsic volumes along E1 and E2 coincide. Um, coincide. Okay, so now we have this reformulation. This will be useful for us in the proofs, but also we can then easily somehow weaken some of the assumptions, which will be quite convenient. So let me point out so that there are kind of two sources of difficulties, or there is an additional degree of freedom compared. There is an additional degree of freedom compared to the Riemannian case, namely, we have more freedom in changing the norm. And so it makes sense to separate, somehow consider these two sources of difficulties separately. And this is what we do. So let us agree on the following definition. So before stating the main results, let us agree on the following definition. So we say that So we say that M inside V satisfies. So we fix the embedding and we change now the norm. And so then we study what happens when we change the norm. And so we say that M satisfies the V qual principle at the point P of M if whenever F and F prime are norms on V, such the restriction to the tangent bundle of a neighborhood of P. Neighborhood of P in M coincides. Then the restriction of the Omstongs intrinsic volumes to U coincide. And now we have the following theorem. Theorem A. So we consider here V inside M. M has dimension M and V has dimension N. V has dimension n. And now, part item A of this theorem says that the VQY principle holds without any restrictions if the codimension is small. So if the codimension is either one or two. And item B says, again, if the codimension is not too large, so if it's now not bigger than M, then the big while print. M, then the Big Wire principle holds at least for dense residual subset of immersions from M to V. And let me remind you, residual means countable intersection of open dense subsets. And the topology this refers to is the C infinity Ritney topology on C infinity maps from M to V. Okay, so these are the positive results. But let me point out that we have an example which shows that B is false for all maps. So we find a counter example which is three-dimensional and has codimension three. Codimension three for which for which P yeah for which the weakwell principle fails. So we cannot have it for all. So we really, yeah, so we yeah, so without any restrictions, it only holds for co-dimension one or co-dimension two. So these are the positive results. Now let me make more precise what we know. What we know in the other co-dimensional cases. And before I can formulate this, I need two definitions. So the first one is we need to consider the tautological map. Okay, so let's fix an auxiliary Riemannian structure on V, then we can speak of the unit sphere in V, and we can speak of the sphere. In V, and we can speak of the sphere bundle. And let's consider this dottological map, which sends a unit tangent vector. Yeah, so to the element of V. So, and we call now a sub-manifold directionally regular at PV if the differential of this map data has full rank. As full rank. Okay, and now we need also a definition from classical differential geometry. Let me remind you that the second oscillating space to M at a point P is spanned by all velocity and acceleration vectors of curves in M through P. And so this contains the tangent space to P. And if To p, and if we consider the orthogonal complement of the tangent space, then we get inside the oscillating space, then we get what is called the first normal space 2m. Okay, and so now here is what we know in the negative direction. So we have assumed that m has at least dimension 3, because we know for surfaces Because we know for surfaces it holds. So let m be at least 3 and let m be directionally regular at a point. Then we prove that the required principle fails at p if the dimension of the second oscillating space is bigger than 2m. And consequence of this is that Is that since generically this second oscillating space will be big, so if the co-dimension of M is bigger than M, so which is kind of the remaining range, then generically the required principle will just be wrong. Okay, and let us, our final result makes precise. Result makes precise dependence on the norm of the restrictions. So we can say precisely on what it depends really. So let M be inside V. Then this restriction is determined not just by the restriction of the norm to M, but we also need to, is determined also by certain normal derivatives. Derivatives are derivatives, derivatives up to order n minus m minus one in directions belonging to the first normal space to m so yeah so for a why for a while principle to hold you would also need to restrict some normal derivatives okay so let me make Okay, so let me maybe. Yeah, ah, before I would like to say a bit about the proofs, but before I do this, let us maybe return to the original conjecture. So first of all, you see that the conjecture is false. But one question that we could not settle is Is whether the full y principle actually holds in dimensions one or two. So let me remind you: so these code dimensions are the situation where the weak while principle holds at least. So we can ask whether we can also when we can also change the embedding. And so in codimension one, In codimension one, when you look at the Riemannian situation, it's well known that if a hypersurface is sufficiently curved, then it's rigid. So the second fundamental form is actually determined by the intrinsic geometry of M. So from this perspective, again, I mean, to the best of my knowledge, such a best of my knowledge such a such a question such questions are wide open in are wide open in field flow geometry but if such a rigidity result would hold in in known spaces then then this could maybe this could this certainly this will imply the the right principle of in codimension one so um um for codimension two um two um i think it's it's it's unlikely that uh that it will hold uh but but two nose um okay so now um uh let me tell you how we how we uh arrived at these um statements or at least discuss some some ideas uh that go into the into the proofs The proofs. So, what really got us started? So, the first thing that we had to do, that we used, was the following theorem, using a theorem by Bernik and Prouter, which describes when a valuation is identically zero. And this is, of course, relevant for us because we have two different norms, we restrict and we want to know whether Restrict, and we want to know whether the restrictions coincide. And there is an answer to this question in terms of the differential forms defining the valuation. I've written it here. So what can you do? So you can pull back the n-form to the sphere bundle and add to it the so-called Romart differential of omega, which is a natural second-order differential operator for contact manifolds. Contact manifolds. And so this is zero identically if and only if this n form on the sphere bundle is zero. And so to every evaluation, you can associate a function, smooth function, namely just by evaluating it at points. And so if this is also zero, this function is also zero, then yeah. So if these two are satisfied, then this is zero. And then this is zero, even only if and so, um, yeah, and so okay, so this is what we wish to apply. And let me point out, because we know that all the Hans-Thomson intrinsic volumes are powers with respect to the Lesker product of the first one, we only need to consider the first. We only need to consider the first Hung Storm's intrinsic volume. So, therefore, we consider here in the following only one. And let me also point out, so if we would choose maybe different definitions of volumes, it would not change the conclusion because they all agree for degree one. So, this covers not. Yeah, so this co covers not not just the um yeah, so actually the the statement concerns also um yeah concerns concerns also the the other possible other extensions of definitions of volume in the sense that it will always fail already in degree one. In degree one. Okay, and so now the first technical step is to determine these yellow, this n-form and the zero form. The zero form is easy, so it's just zero. The n-form is more difficult. Only in small dimension were we able to get an explicit expression for this. In general, we have. In general, we have some qualitative statement which shows that this n-form depends only on certain normal derivatives of the norm in direction of the first normal space. So, this immediately implies theorem C. And so, okay, so I wish not to discuss this further because it's To discuss this further because it's quite technical. But once you have this, I mean, you're in a quite comfortable situation. You just have to analyze in which situations these normal derivatives are actually determined by the restriction of f to n, more precisely to the tangent bundle of n. Okay, so this is now the strategy for both the negative and the positive results. And so let me just state you this observation. So clearly this map data, this tautological map is important for us. So our norm lives on the sphere and we would like to restrict it to the sphere bundle. And so clearly this should So, clearly, this should play an important role in our analysis. And let me just make this observation that if this map data should turn out to be submersive in a dense subset of the sphere bundle, then these normal derivatives will be determined by the restriction of F to the tangent bundle of M. And the proof is clear. So, if it's submersed. So, if it's submersive at P, then the image inside the unit sphere will contain a neighborhood of U in the sphere. And so we get all sorts of derivatives at this point. Okay, so this is very easy, but it will be used repeatedly. And so. And so let me now tell you how this dense receivable sub-saturizes. So consider all immersions of M2V. And then we prove that there is a dense residual subset. Subset such that all the F's in W prime are directionally regular on a dense open subset of the sphere bundle. And this follows from the fact that the condition of being directionally regular can be is a condition on the two jet of this function, of this embed, of this mapping. And so you can reformulate this in a way. So you can reformulate this in a way so that you can apply Thomas-Transfosality theorem and then you get this result. In any case, you see from this lemma and this observation that under suitable assumptions, under the assumptions on the co-dimensions, as in theorem A, remember directional irregular meant that the differential has full rank. As full rank. So combining this lemma and this observation, you immediately get item B of serum A. And let me maybe... Okay, so this proves this generic maps. Much more interesting is, of course, what happens if you consider all maps. Here, the proof is more interesting and more involved. More interesting and more involved. And the most interesting case is the case of codimension two. And here, what really makes all of this work is this fact from linear algebra, which we're going to apply to the second fundamental form of M and which reads as follows. So suppose you have two vector spaces, V and W, and V and W and suppose you have a linear map from the symmetric second symmetric power of V to V to W which is linear. And suppose that the image of this map is two-dimensional. Then there exists a dense open subset in your vector space, such that for every U inside this dense open subspace, the map from The map from V to W defined in this way. So you plug in U and consider this map, this linear map. This map is onto the image of H. Okay, so this fact from linear algebra is very important for us. Why? Because the differential of theta has this form. So here is precisely. So, here is precisely what appears above. And so, now let us assume, so to prove the case codimension two, I mean, there are several cases to consider, but let's assume for the moment that the second fundamental form, that the image of the second fundamental form is two-dimensional. Then we can use this lemma and apply it to conclude that. That our map data is submersive in a dense open subset. And then we can apply our stupid lemma here and our easy lemma and get the result. There are other cases, of course. There is no reason for the second fundamental form to have two-dimensional image. Image. But if the image is not two-dimensional, then this restricts the geometry of M. So if the image is just one-dimensional, then there can be two cases. Either the M lies inside an affine subspace, in which case we first use the linear file principle, which holds, and then restrict to this hypersurface in the affine subspace. The affine subspace. Or the other case that could happen is then that the rank of this, if you, whenever you pair with a normal vector, the rank of this bilinear form is one. In which case we really have to use how this how this needs more information about this thing here and the way the second fundamental form enters. Fundamental form enters, and it turns out that most of this expression here becomes zero in this case, and so we can again conclude. I think my time is almost up, and I think I understood here. Thank you very much. Other questions or remarks? So far, I see clapping hands. So far, I see clapping hands and Andreas Bernick was the first raised hand. Yeah, hi, I have a question. So, in this case of could I mention two or could I mention one, do you have an example for the Wigweil principle where you really have two different norms such that their restriction to the manifold is the same? Um I can say it directly. So, I think we don't have an example like this in the paper, but I would assume that this certainly exists. Well, luckily, if I understood the question, have a hypersurface, you can change the normal way from the hypersurface. Like, it's a trivial thing. I'm not sure if I understood your question. But, uh okay. So the manifold is supposed to be compact or can it also be non Also be none for a compact manifold I so an isometric companion with the normal bits rate if I both start with the cases sure okay so the point is that M is not supposed to be compact okay in this case yeah thank you okay I think uh Joe Fu was next yeah great Yeah, great. Thanks for the nice talk. First, a remark. You mentioned about tube coefficients. I guess maybe it's worth remembering that these mu IFs are Lesker-Fourier transforms of mixed volumes of the polar dual. So anyway, so there's something happening there. But as far as a question, so your theorem says that these things depend on the first m minus one normal derivative. M minus one normal derivatives. Is it true that at least in some cases they depend on all m minus one derivatives, or is it possible that there might be fewer derivatives required? It might be possible because so might be possible because I mean we were not able to so this expression is quite complicated and so um And so we don't have like, we weren't able to obtain an explicit formula for this. So maybe there are some cancellations happening or so. Maybe, I don't know. Yeah. So as a related question, I guess, you know, so the original conjecture seems like, at least at this point, seems, I mean, seems extremely naive, you know, especially since you. Especially since you don't laugh, Monica. Go on. It's too late. But I mean, especially in view of the fact that even in the Romanian case, the definition of mu1 involves like connection, the connection. So maybe the, or in terms of the differential forms in some sort of abstract algebraic way. So I guess. So, I guess the next version of the conjecture that I'll embarrass myself with eventually will involve the question of whether maybe this thing is determined by, say, a connection. Of course, I guess these Finsler manifolds famously don't have canonical connections or may have different canonical connections. So, is there some sense that perhaps maybe knowing connection might be enough to determine these things? To determine these things, some okay, some connection depending. Well, it would be given by the induced by the embedding somehow. Anyway, it's just pretty, pretty vague at this point. Okay, there's a next question, Alexander Lichak. Yeah, thank you for the. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thank you for the talk. Yeah, Thomas. So what I would, so maybe I've missed it, but have you presented examples in higher quantum mention? So yes, so what you can do is the smallest dimensional situation where it fails is a three-dimensional manifold in R6, or six-dimensional norm space. Or six-dimensional normal space. And so, what you can do is you take a generic surface in R5 and take it, consider the cylinder over it. So, you take it times R and this by some, yeah, by essentially, essentially by CRMB or something very similar to the formulation here. So we Very similar to the formulation here. So, you see that it will fail. So, surface in R5 times R is a three-dimensional submanifold of R6, and this will fail. Another example, maybe more geometric one, is you can consider the segregate embedding of RP4 times RP4 in order to use the In RP8, and then yeah, so look at this in fine charts, and this will also have some kind of special structure of the second fundamental form. And for this, you also see that it's fair. No, sorry. So, some example was actually so if one can see in some, so in this example you have just presented, uh, two Presented. So, two different norms. So, can we see the reason why theory and P holds true? So, can you see? Yeah, so this tautological map, where is it that so? If you make some assumption, then you can assume that it is locally. This will be a sub-manifold in the Will be a sub-manifold in the sphere, the image. And then you can just perturb it in the norm in directions transversal to this image of data. And so there's lots of freedom. Yeah, so okay, so yeah, so yeah, you just you have to to yeah, you you perturb it and then if the normals, these normal derivatives then are different and so it fails. So thanks. Okay, there's still time for one more question. Still, time for one more question. Uh, Julia Werman, please. Um, thank you for the nice talk. Uh, so, in the beginning of your talk, you mentioned that the intrinsic volumes by Holmes-Thompson do not fulfill a Steiner formula, but it would be possible also to extend intrinsic volumes to norm spaces by using mixed volumes with a convex body, which is a unit ball of the specific norm. Ball of the specific norm, right? And so, do you know that really never for no norm they coincide with the Holmes-Thompson intrinsic volumes? So there is this formula where you can express where you can express the volume. The volume of a projection to a linear subspace in terms of mixed volumes, right? You're aware of this. And so, where are we? Yeah, and so when you're in the middle of the When you if you do what you suggest, so you take mixed volume of instead of leading unipole, you plug in your unipole of your norm. And then, so if you want it to be intrinsic, so what you should get is you should get when you restrict it to an eye dimensional subspace, it should depend only on the induced node. On the induced norm, or which is the same thing as saying the intersection of E with the unit pull of the norm. But you know, by this formula for projections and relation between projections and mixed volumes, you see that it will depend on stuff outside E. So I think this should I would, I mean, I certainly'm not sure whether it I think it looks unlikely, I think that okay, so possibly it could they could coincide for some time in Nucleian spaces yes, okay, that we know already okay, yes. Okay, yes. So the question is whether there is a convex body such that the orthogonal projection to EPERP, the volume of the orthogonal projection to EPERP will be determined by will be determined by the comics body intersected with E. This seems... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know whether there are... The conjecture would be this only works for e-points, but I haven't thought about it. Discuss it maybe in person. Well, thank you very much for the questions and also for the talk. And we continue in a minute or two. Thank you.
