In Bitcoin, in terms of Bitcoin, was in 2011 for 550,000 Bitcoin, and the largest dollar transaction was for about $946 million. There are about fifty five thousand transactions with a value of greater than ten million US dollars at the time. US dollars at the time, and most of them had a fee less than $5. So the mean size in terms of bytes is 537 bytes, and the largest transaction in terms of bytes consumes an entire block. And that is the one that cleared up the spam attack on the UTXO matrix. Is it bytes or kilobytes? Bytes. Bytes. So in the finance and economics literature there's two big papers that look at fees and most of these papers argue that there is a capacity constraint. That if you have so many people who want to transact but there's only so much space in the block, then there is rationing going on and if there's rationing that means people pay fees for that to get For that, to get ahead of everybody else. And so both of these papers argue mostly that the blocks are full, and then they try to determine what the equilibrium fee is. So they assume that miners are competitive, and the agents somehow offer fees to overcome this congestion in the blockchain. So, I want to show you a different picture. So, first, I want to present some stylized facts about the blockchain, and I have a little model, and then I want to present some results that are hopefully consistent with what we have already. So, I want to show you that the fees vary a lot over time, and in the cross-section as well, so within the same block, that capacity is not constrained, and that miners seem to leave money on the table. That miners seem to leave money on the table. So, you probably all have seen something like this before. So, this shows you that the 10% and 90% quantile as well as the median fee per block over time. And you see that this varies a lot. So, the green bars are whenever we have a capacity increase, so this is segment, this is when they kind of formalize the one megabyte blockchain. The one megabyte blockchain block size, and then we have the red bars where the fee was cut in half, the mining reward was cut in half. So on the next graph, I want to zoom in a little bit on this part, which is the part where the fees spike a lot. And what is interesting, if you just look at these days, so this was in. If you just look at these days, so this was in December 2017, you see that there's a huge variation in the fees within the same block. So the gray area, which doesn't come out very clearly in the slide, is the Bitcoin price in the background. And here you see the minimum fee is down here. And this goes on the scale here is from 0 to 50 US dollars. And you see that a lot. And you see that a lot of the fees were kind of in that range in the distribution. So the 75% quantile of the distribution here peaks at $50 roughly in this time period. And this is the time period where fees were very high. So there's a lot of transactions at that time that processed at very low fees. But at the same time, you have transactions that processed at a very high fees. Processed at a very high fee. So here you see a different scale from zero to fifteen thousand, and you see that the largest, the highest priced transactions paid, somebody paid really a lot of money to have their transaction processed at the same time where somebody else is paying close to zero. So for an economy, this is kind of puzzling. Why would you pay $15,000 for something that you could get for $2? That seems That seems a little bit unusual, and this is what we want to understand in this analysis. So, if the blockchain was really congested, how could somebody get away with paying this much and being processed at the same time as this guy who paid $15,000? Sorry, it's hard to see back to manage so closely. Yeah, is that a count of those transactions or like the dollar amount of those? Or the value of those transactions? Amount of the value of those transactions. No, this is just the quantile of the fee distribution. So you look at the fee distribution in the block and you say how much fee did this person pay, just looking at absolute terms, not standardized by anything. This is just like absolute fee. Are you saying that miners took lower transaction fees? Transaction fees and process those transactions right away and left? No, no, it just says it just says if I look at this block here, for example, you see in the same block that some transactions paid $15,000 and in the same block somebody paid for a transaction $2. And so it's puzzling why you would have such a wide dispersion in the fee, right? So if you believe that this is So, if you believe that this is really congestion, then everybody should the dispersion should not be that big. So, if you see that, oh, if I want to get into that block, I would have to pay $10, and I'm really keen, I would pay $11. But I would not pay $15,000. Consider the possibility of trying to money launder there, right? Like of someone's sending a transaction, they really want to move money to the mining pool. The mining pool. Right? That would be possibly one way to do that. Yes. But still, it doesn't explain why. So if you take out the maximum, you still have a lot of people that paid a lot of money. So it's kind of hard to think that these are all money launderers. And also could be made sure that the miner is going to, this miner is going to take your transaction fee. The top is closed. So I'm just speculating. Anyway, please tell me. Anyway, at least. I mean, there might be other reasons that could explain it, but it seems fairly irrational. The number of people paying a lot is way too high. What is that number? Is it thousands of transactions that pay payments? So you see here, for example, that half of the transactions here at this time paid 35 bucks, where kind of a lot of people got in for twenty bucks. So even if you look at the small scale, why would you pay doubles? Scale, why would you pay doubles? When was that? So that was December 2017. So this was when the average fees were the highest points. But you see all through the sample you see huge dispersions. Alfred, I have another question. So this 99%, how many transactions are done with these huge fees? So that's a good question. So I think I think this is on a daily basis. So if you think 2500 transactions, you still see a lot of... If they are full, especially they were full. So a lot of transactions, not one or two. This is not one or two. These are a lot of transactions, pay a lot of money. So this is not kind of the odd crazy person who pays that much. Who pays that much? And this is all public knowledge, right? So I can see what happened in the blog before me. And if I see that somebody got in paying $2, why would I pay $10,000? I would pay $3,000 if I'm keen. But like if you go into and you're very hungry and you go into restaurant and you see the guy before you got food for ten bucks, why would you pay offer ten thousand bucks? 10,000 bucks, right? That's because some of the transactions are in the gray zone. Still, even if it's crooks, why would you as a crook waste money, right? You're paying higher fees than the value of the transaction. Have you observed that? Does somebody pay more in fees than the actual Bitcoin movement? No. That doesn't occur. No. People didn't understand the scheme? Well, as economists, we have a hard time thinking that people are stupid. I'm thinking that people are stupid. So, I mean, that's an easy explanation. You can explain everything by assuming that people are stupid, right? So, but I don't think that is the case. But going back, sorry, to interrupt you there. So I'm not sure if I go with the people are stupid or if I go people are not always rational. I think I prefer the phrase they're not always rational actors. Yeah, but you can always explain everything. But you can always explain everything by saying, oh, people are irrational. That's kind of an intellectual shortcut to explain the world. And the rationality may come from what do you do about an Iranian who is moving, using Bitcoin to move money outside. So I think people would not pay. Why would you, if you know that you can move money outside for $10, why would you pay $1,000? Speed. Well, obviously the person with the $10 also got into the block, right? So, well, it has what we will argue is I'll give you a rational explanation why this might happen. And actually, speed is an issue there. Just the last question, then I'll shut up. Yeah, no, no. Are you able to geolocate the origin from where the. Because you know, there are trackers which show us from where. Which show us from where certain things appear. And I just wondered if you can take that into your model. Yeah, we couldn't get that data. Okay, no, that's fine. I would love to get that data. Well, Bitcoin peer-to-peer network has mechanisms to prevent that. You cannot know. Well, I did see have information on that, but I don't know if this is. You can create hundreds of modes that can give you, you can triangulate, like you can try to find. Like you can try to find the source, but it's Bitcoin has mechanisms against it. Okay, so here is some data. So we have between in these four days where the fees were on average the highest, there was 1.6 million transactions processed, 51 transactions with a fee over $10,000, but also 752 transactions with no fee. With no fee, and we had 16,000 transactions with a fee of less than $5. So, why? We want to come up with a reason explanation of this huge variation in the fees, which doesn't make sense from the first perspective. The other thing that a lot of previous research looked at is, is this a capacity constraint? And the answer is no. So, what I show you here is, first of all, the fraction of empty blocks. So, obviously. Fraction of empty blocks. So obviously, in the beginning, the blockchain was very empty. There were a lot of empty blocks being mined. So that went down a lot. But what is interesting is that it never went to zero. So there are still empty blocks being mined on Bitcoin today. And the question is, why would you do that? I'm sorry, are you aware of ASIC boost and covert ASIC boost? No. So it's a minor collusion thing, which may be actually worth cutting into the chase here. Is that what a minor collude? To the chase here is that what miners will do is secretly mine a chain to their own and then release those blocks and they're empty blocks, and they're just using it to, you know. So maybe that's where you're getting to. But you have to have the previous block to mine the next block, right? Yeah, right. So they mine both of them at the same time, they wait the first one, they don't release immediately. Why would you not do that? That creates a huge risk that you exactly. But for example, from Cornell, they have the report that if. From Corner they have the report that if you wait a little bit you can gain actually. The Aming Sirs and Ial's paper is about this selfish mining. Oh you have to send in that paper. I would love to read that please. So you don't read the first one, you wait to mine the second one, so you risk a little bit. But if you don't wait too much and if you can find, if you are lucky, if you find very soon, then you will get two block reverse instead of one. Okay. Okay, so I'm I'm gonna read that. So that that maybe that's maybe that's one potential explanation for that. The other thing is if you look at the fraction of full blocks, which is the red bar, you'll see that a lot of the blocks are not full. And we've defined full as being really like, oh, there's no transaction, we know that transactions have a minimum. We know that transactions have a minimum size, and so four means really another transaction could not fit in there anymore. So there's not that many four blocks. And so if you look at the average capacity use per day, you see that at the time when Bitcoin peaked, the average capacity use was pretty high. But also, I will show you that the blocks are not full. But the rational for that is. For that, that is clear, no? Not to me. Well, I would submit that for the miner at that point in time, the block reward is the dominating factor. And the little fees they get for the transactions is negligible. And so it's better to spend your time mining than it is. But it takes more time. It takes some amount of time. No, it takes some amount of time. Why? Well, you need to validate the transactions. You need to check the transactions. Okay, but you have to do that once, and then you've got to transfer your product. Yeah, that adds up. Okay, but even the computational effort to find a blog that's fairly significant. It's small, it's a small amount, but still. I don't know whether it's significant, but you know, even. Significant, but you know, if the block size becomes large, you know, the time we need to take for propagation also becomes large, right? Yeah, could be another factor. So I don't know whether it's a kind of a significant cost, but I think it's possible hypothesis. So it might take longer to relay that block that you found to anybody else. I'm not sure. I mean I'm not sure. I mean, if you think about what is the incremental cost that you have and how much can you collect in fees. So we did a little exercise to quantify that. So here are some examples at least. So think about December 2017. Bitcoin is trading over $19,000. There were two blocks. There were two blocks that were being mined empty by the BTTC block, but the same pool also mined full blocks on the same day. And so in the non-empty blocks, in the blocks that were not left empty, there was space for about 5,000 secret-compliant transactions on that day. So 5,000 transactions is quite a bit of Is quite a bit of money that you could have made extra at this peak demand time. So, throughout the whole sample, we find that about 1.1% of blocks are empty, and they are mined by pools. They are mined by all kinds of pools. So, there's no pool that stands really out of this. And this is a little bit surprising too, because for a poor to prohibit. For a pool to prohibit fraud, it's actually easier in a way to mine full blocks because, as you all know, how pools work, right? So you don't want the person who finds the right hash to run with the block and claim it on their own behalf. So you can avoid that by mining full blocks. So on this day, there was empty room for in the whole of December, there was room for empty room for. There was room for empty room for 25,000 transactions, and on average, there is empty space for about 600,000 transactions. So, is this because there is no demand for transactions? So, we have collected some input data. Unfortunately, we don't have individual transactions, but we found this data that has the number of transactions in the memory. Transactions in the mempool broken down by fees per byte. And I can take that and fill up the transactions, the mempool. I could go at any point in time, look how much empty space is in this block, and I can say how much more would the miners have made if they would have filled up that block. And so what we find is that on average, this is fifty five thousand dollars per day. $5,000 per day that the miners could have made more if they had filled up this block. So, in total, this over the whole sample is $38 million money left on the table by the miners. So, this is quite a significant amount. So, here is a little graph that shows you how much money is left on the table by these miners. By these miners on each day. So, this is in thousand US dollars, so this goes from zero to four hundred thousand dollars. And you can see that there is every day almost there was quite a bit of money left on the table. So, if you remember, this is the Bitcoin peak. This is where the blockchain was fairly full, so there was not a lot of unused capacity, but those people that the miners could have those transactions that Those transactions that the miners could have used to fill up the block, they were bidding a lot of money. So they were leaving a lot of money on the table because all these transactions, all these people who wanted to transact were bidding a lot of money. But on the other hand, we see that here there was probably a lot of excess capacity, but people were not bidding that high. So it's a function of how much were people bidding and how much capacity was left. I think I have a question. Yes. In the previous slide, Question. In the previous slide, you say that at any time there was 214 transactions in the metro? Yes. How did you know this? Well, this data, well, of course, from based on the data that we have, that we found on the internet from a website that collected mempool data, they recorded how many transactions in the mempool at any point. In the mempool, at any point in time, they have one-minute interval data. And so we look at the time when the block was mined, which is also an interesting issue by itself because the timestamps are not very accurate. So we try to correct for that in various ways. So we try to match that to the best of our abilities when the block was mined with the mempool at this point in time. And we can look at how many transactions were waiting. Many transactions were waiting in the mailpool to be confirmed at that time. So let me show you. So this is more of an economic model of how we should see things. So this might be a little bit unusual. So we model this by having this in a very simple way. So we have two types of agents. Let's assume that there is a patient agent, the low type, and an in-type. The low type and an inpatient agent with the high type. And so the assumption that we have is that the inpatient type has a higher cost of waiting for the next block and also that the inpatient type gets a higher utility out of having their transaction being processed. So I think about somebody who's a trader who is very keen, wants to do this now, gets a lot of utility out of doing it. Gets a lot of utility out of doing it now, but also has a high cost of fake it. So we have a model where the agents have some outside option there too, and they arrive at a certain fraction on the market and they submit bids. So for every transaction that the for every block that the agent has to wait, the incurred is certain. has to wait, they incur this certain cost C, which is different for the high type and for the low type. Okay, so how can we define what is the utility of a user? So if you think about this, what does a user get? So the user gets some value V out of getting this transaction done. So this could be the high value or the low value. And then they offer something to bid, a fee they pay to the miner, and then they They pay to the miner, and then they have to get executed with a certain probability p. So if they get executed immediately, they get just get the value minus what the fee they pay. If they have to wait for a block, they occur this cost C because they have to wait for a block. And then if you wait for two blocks, you have two C. And so you can compute the utility of the user. depending on how long they wait on the execution. And you can say that, well, we have to offer them some minimum execution probability because otherwise they would not participate. So if you know that you will never be picked up, you don't participate in the system in the first place. So we look at two types of Types of methods of serving customers. One would be competitive mining. So if you think about a perfectly competitive market, what is the optimal bidding strategy? So the miners just go, they don't think about any collusion or anything, they just focus on their own benefit and maximize their competitive and maximize. They are competitive and maximize their own payoff. So, if there's no capacity constraint, what will the miners do? They will pick up all the transactions they can possibly get, even if they pay very little fee, because I want to maximize my payoff. But if you're a user and you know that the miners will act that way, what is your optimal bidding strategy? If you're a user and you know that the miners will pick up everything, you just offer a very, very small fee. Very small fee because the miner thinks, well, I better get the small fee than zero, so they will pick up your transaction. You know that as a user, and so your optimal fee that you're going to bid is going to be very small, and the limit is going to be zero. So all the transactions execute, and your probability, your equilibrium fee is going to be zero. If there is a capacity constraint and you know that And you know that there are two types, and you know that there is the patient and the impatient guy. How much does the impatient guy bid? Well, the impatient guy says, how much is the patient guy willing to pay? And if I know that the patient guy that the patient guy is willing to pay two dollars, then I'm gonna pay bid two dollars and one cent. $2.01. So I'm just going to bid a little bit more than the next guy, and so then I know that I'll get priority and I can get my transaction executed. So the optimal strategy is that the inpatient type just bids an epsilon above what the patient guy would bid. The inpatient type gets executed with probability 1 and the patient. Probability one and the patient type gets rationed and they don't execute with probability one. So you can believe the economic model, I don't want to bore you too much with economics, but if you look at this, the key takeaway is that the bit dispersion in this type of model would be very low. Because the higher types, the inpatient type, would just bit an epsilon more. bit an epsilon more than what the patient type would be. Now the other model we have in mind is where miners can collude and commit to price discrimination. So suppose all the miners get together and say how can we extract the maximum value from those people. And this is like in the movie industry where if you want to see the movie now you have to go to the cinema and then you can buy it for digital download, then you can rent it. You can rent it and then you get it for free from the library. So, depending on how patient you are, you pay less if you're willing to wait. And if you want to see the movie today, you have to pay a lot and go to the cinema. So, the same thing is here. So, the miners say, well, from the inpatient type, we know how much the inpatient type is willing to bid. So, if I'm a miner, I charge, say, if you want to be executed today, you have. Execute it today, you have to pay me really a lot of money. But then you can execute it with probability one. And then I can walk down the line and say, well, the impatient guy, I give a discount, but the patient guy, I give a discount, but the patient guy has to wait for his transaction to be processed. And you have to commit to that, and you say that even if I have the capacity to take on the If I have the capacity to take on the patient guide today, I'm not going to do that, I'm going to wait. And if this is a credible commitment that you have, then you can enforce that equilibrium on the agents because now it's well known that if you pay a lower fee, you have to wait for your transaction to be processed. Even if there is spare capacity on the blockchain, we don't take your transaction because. Take your transaction because you have to really pay a lot of money to get executed today. So, this is unusual, and this only works if you have collusion. So, the miners somehow have to agree on this implicitly that they all follow the same strategy and extract that money from people. Which is kind of remarkable because if you think about this blockchain and decentralized finance systems, the idea is that all the The idea is that the existing system is corrupt, the banks make too much money, so we create this new system that is decentralized and everything will be more efficient. As it turns out, that's probably not the case. Can you compare this with the known clusters, mining clusters? You are aware of mining clusters. I'll show you some evidence of that. So, obviously, collusion is easier if you have. Honestly, collusion is easier if you have fewer players, right? If you have a million small miners, it's hard to collude. If you have seven mining pools, it's much easier. The market seems to understand that you have these websites where you see how much you have to bid to get executed within a certain number of blocks. So here you can say, well, if I want to confirm within six blocks, how much do I have to bid? So I just said this. This is easier to maintain that collusive equilibrium if you have a small number of mining pools. And also you want to sign your block. What's also interesting is that the mining pools always sign the blocks they mine. And one way to see this is to brag about, hey, we are the so-and-so pool and we are really cool. Another way to see this is, Another way to see this is you say, here's my pool, and I commit to this pricing strategy, and you can see that because I don't fill up my block. And so you can see that everybody else is following this collusive extra. I have a question. So we cannot expect that all the miners are actually belonging to coalition, so there should be several individuals, small miners who don't participate in coalition, but participate in collision. Yes, that could well be the case. Then you know why don't each minor pretend to be their individual minors and try to secretly violate the agreement? Because it gets kind of known how much transact how much mining capacity every pool has, right? So if your mining capacity from one day to another drops in half, because you now In half because you now pretend that you're a small miner who deviates, it's obvious. It's okay, it's detectable, yeah. Okay, I think. You might be able to see that somebody's deviating, but you don't know who, right? Because mine is anonymous. But if the mining tools are always disclosing the identity by declaring it on the block header, basically we can. Header. Basically, we can observe the frequency of the mining process that generates the frequencies of the broker generation of each miners. And if it is decreased, we can detect that miners will be doing something else. So here is some last part. I hope I still have a little bit of time. So in the last part, I want to convene, show you some evidence that is at least Show you some evidence that is at least consistent with the idea that from the predictions of our model. So, here's some general drivers of transaction fees. So, here we look at a bunch of characteristics. So, let me point out that the most important characteristic for determining transaction fees is the size of a transaction. And here we look at weights, we don't look at bytes because with SegWit, bytes. With SegWit, bytes are somewhat meaningless of a measure for transaction size. So we look at transaction weights here, which turn out to be highly significant. What is statistically significant but economically not significant is the dollar amount that you sent, which is also interesting from an economist's perspective because you would think that if I sent 10 million dollars, I would have to pay more than if I I would have to pay more than if I sent $5, but that is not the case. There is a higher fee if you send more money, but it's really the impact is really small. The size of that effect is very small. So we look at the OP return transactions. What is also interesting is that you see that people in general pay higher fees if the money gets spent again in the next block. So this might be somebody. So this might be somebody who has who is very keen to move that money s around. So obviously those people, and that's kind of one way, one finding that's consistent with our model, that the people who are keen to transact are those who want to spend the money again very soon. And we see that these people pay higher fees. And so this is true for the next block, but it's also true for. also true for in general so if it takes you longer to spend your money you pay a lower fee so in general people who seem to have a more urgent need to transact because they want to spend that money again seem to pay a higher fee so another thing that is consistent about our our model Our model is that when you look at average fees on different days of the week, so I should have, so this is Friday, on Friday are the highest fees in the Bitcoin market. And this is also the day when Bitcoin futures settle on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So we look at this. On the weekend in general, fees are lower, probably because the hedge funds of the world are not trading in Bitcoin on the weekend. Are not trading in Bitcoin on the weekend or the financial institutions. And we also see that Bitcoin fees are significantly higher during trading hours of the Bitcoin futures on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So that again points to the idea that at the time when institutional traders are trading, Bitcoin fees are higher. So some other evidence that people who are That people who are more keen pay higher fees are we can single out with known wallet addresses payments to and from exchanges and to and from gambling sites. And these are probably two types of users who are more keen to transact quickly. So, if you want to trade, sell your Bitcoin, or if you want to gamble, you're probably more keen. You're probably more keen than other users, and we see that these people pay higher fees on average. One second, how did you identify them as gamblers? So there is a list of known wallet addresses on the internet, and we just looked at payments from these wallets or to these wallets. And we find that this is these people pay more. So, what is interesting is So, what is interesting is that in this table, we look at a bunch of, again, the usual control variables that we had before, and we look at payments to and from exchanges. And even within, if you look at traders, they are very keen to trade when there is good trading opportunities. So, one measure of these trading opportunities is the size of the kimchi premium. So, the kimchi. Kimchi premium. So the kimchi premium is the price difference, what do Bitcoin cost in Korea versus what do Bitcoin cost in the US? And as you might or might not know, there can be substantial price differences across markets. So here we look at the kimchi premium and we look at we control for payments to exchanges, we control for the size of the kimchi premium, but what we find here in the first line. But what we find here in the first line is that if you make a payment to an exchange at a time where this kimchi premium is high, you are paying a much higher fee. So those are people who are really very, very keen to trade because you want to make that payment to an exchange at a time where trading on that exchange is probably very profitable. And we see that those people pay way higher fees. Way higher fees. So, this explains in part this graph that I showed you before: where why do some people pay so much in the same block versus other people pay very little in the same block? And our idea is, or our story is that those transactions were not submitted at the same time. The guys who pay the very high fee at a certain point in time were executed immediately. Executed immediately. And the guys who were in the same block but paid a lower fee were actually waiting for five blocks in the mempool before the transaction was picked up. So I also have some time series evidence and we cannot use really, if we look at block per block data, we cannot Block data, we cannot really look at fee levels, but one of the key predictions in our model is this fee dispersion. And so we look at the difference between the 90% and the 10% quantile in the fee distribution measured per block. And this look at what drives this fee spread between the very high and the very low fee transactions. So, what we are Actions. So, what we argue is that this mining, minor collusion, if there is stronger collusion amongst miners, we should see that fee spread to be higher. And so, we measure this in two ways. And we find, we look at the Hirschmann-Herfendel index of mining activity, and that's an index that measures how concentrated is the mining activity amongst miners. So, it's an economic index used usually. Economic index used usually in curtailed regulations where regulators measure how concentrated is the supermarket industry or something, and you can measure that in terms of market share of the large players. So, we use that measure here for Bitcoin mining. And we find that the more concentrated the mining industry is, and we can measure that on a daily basis, the higher is the spread between what the Spread between fees within the same block. We also find that the aggregated pool share, if we look here at the fraction of mining that is done in pools, also significantly impacts the fee spread. Then if there's more mining done by mining pools, this difference between high and low fee transactions increases. So the question is: Is this economically significant? And we argue yes. So our sample has about $844 million in total fees for all the transactions in the sample. So that's an important number. And if we would not have this collusion, if we would have true competition, then we would have from our From our model, that people would pay whatever the low type would pay, that just makes it into the block. So, in our model, we approximate this by the 10% quantile of the fee distribution. Those are the people who have the low fee or the patient types, that's what they are willing to pay. And if the system was competitive, that's what everybody should pay. So, what we find is that in total, if we use that as a measure, Total, if we use that as a measure, we have about $500 million that people pay too much to use Bitcoin because of this minor collusion. So this is an estimate of these excessive fees. So you see here the Hirschman-Herfender index, the mining concentration over time, and you see these excessive fees that are being paid, and so we see that. And so we see that it's hard to do eyeball econometrics. If you want to see it, there's some correlation in the graph. But at least this is not a phenomenon that just occurred when Bitcoin was very priced very high, that there was excessive fees being charged. This is throughout the whole sample. This HHI index, is it better to have a high index or a low index? Or a low index? So a high index means higher market concentration. Fewer miners. Fewer miners, yes. Less competition. So I think this is related to my previous question, also Mark's question, but to sustain collision, basically miners mining crews should disclose the identity by making a declaration as a block header, right? Block header, right? And indeed, you know, in block header, typically, you know, mining pulse make some sort of a signature on it, and we can observe that kind of data. Yes. And by observing this kind of some sort of a panel data, can't we estimate the strategy of log generation each mining pools are taking? And then I think we can directly measure whether each mining pool is using a colluding strategy. Using a coloured story? I tried to look at at some of these things. It's very hard to find come up with a good way to measure that. To measure different rob creation strategies by pools. So what I'm working on at the moment with my students is that we are trying to really trace transactions from when did the individual transaction enter the mempool to when was it? To when was it mined into a block. And then we can trace this on a transaction by transaction basis to see how that really works. But we don't have that data going back into the pods because the manpool data is discarded. And we were just lucky to find this aggregated, partially aggregated data on manpool activity. But if you have somebody who has detailed manpool data, So, EPFL people have a paper from 2014 or 15 about mempool data. I just wanted to say they discovered that it takes around 12 seconds for each block to reach 99% of the network. This is from the earlier discussion you were saying why they would hesitate to add more transactions into the block. So, they don't lose that much actually. That much actually. Okay. So the blocks reach very fast. The blocks reach very fast. Do you think if you ignored empty blocks that this analysis would be the same? Because I think we have a very plausible explanation for why empty blocks occur. Yes, okay. Yes, we found... Well, I don't have to... I couldn't show the numbers to... I'm just curious whether you think that would have happened. Yes. Well, the empty blocks are pretty evenly distributed amongst the systems. Amongst the system. And so you could, for some reason, you could lower that. It would be a uniform shift downwards a little bit, but there would still be a lot of unexplained emptiness in the blocks. So especially what I showed you, most of the numbers were for this peak period, where there was really a lot of transactions that waited to be processed. But if you don't look at December 2017, Look at December 2017, look at all the other times. There's plenty of unused capacity in each block. And it's not obvious why that would be there. At the same time, you have mempool transactions waiting in the mempool. And so there's no clear explanation why you would leave that money on the table. As I understand it, and this is something that we should And this is something that you should back check, is there's no the mempool, right? Like, nodes have mempools. It's a distributed system, there's different things in different mempools. When you say the mempool, like... In the mempool data that we have. But we don't have any reason to believe that this is particularly biased in a systematic way. This might not be the true mempool. And at some point in time, this mempool data that we have might have more transactions or less transactions than the average. Or less transactions than the average, but there is no reason to believe that it's always more or always less, right? So there's no systematic bias in that mainpool data that is. This is extremely challenging work in a number of ways, right? Yeah. Dealing with mainpool data is not straightforward. Could you give some intuition about this index, how it is computed? How is it computed? Just intuitively. So intuitively, you look at the relative market share that each mining pool has out of total mining. You square those market shares, add them up, and divide it and add it up. How do we get the market shares? So you look at each day, what we do here is at each day I look how many blogs were mined in total, how many blogs were mined. How many blocks were mined by this mining pool and this mining pool and that mining pool? And you know that because of the signatures? Because of the signatures, yes. Otherwise, they would be classified as all the ones that don't have a signature count as independent miners. But actually, most mining most blocks are signed. Take a look at this. Take a look at this up on my blockchain info or something. There's always these daily charts of how much each memory pool contributes. So I went through all the mempool signatures, I ran some scripts to identify the mempools, and then I looked at the ones that the computer couldn't classify, looked at a bunch of them manually, and those could be identified, and I looked at these identifiers. Identify as well from the different mainputs. The distribution of empty blocks, does it ever change? Or is it very? It's pretty stable. So I don't fully buy the story that this is quite a lot of money that is left on the table by mining an empty block. So, of course, so we're talking here about, I don't know, maybe a few thousand. Don't know, maybe a few thousand dollars, right? Yes, it's not that big compared to the block reward, right? Of course, right? But if I give you the option, hey, you can get 5,000 bucks or zero. Well, it's not quite that. Have a look at that paper that you mentioned that came out of Cornell. It actually explains that quite well: how a miner can look at. Another thing is you say. Another thing is we can say empty blocks, but uh we can also have blocks that are completely empty, that only has the coin-based transactions. Yes, those are the ones that I'm talking about. Okay, so not the capacity. No, yeah, these are these totally empty blocks is that's what I call an empty block, and then there is a lot of blocks that are not filled to capacity. So if you go back to this graph here, it was 1.1%, right? It's about 1.1%. It's about 1.1% that are completely empty. So and you have some, if you look here at the average block capacity, so that no, probably look at the red graph. This shows you the completely full blocks. And you see that not many blocks are completely full. So that means that there is a lot of spare. There's some spare capacity. Are they signed as well? Do you know where they come from? The empty blocks? Yes, they're signed too. They come from the large mining pools. So most of them are signed? Most of them are signed, yes. And in a way, if you think about collusion, I mean, yes, maybe that's true what you're saying, but if you think about collusion, it's all about if you're a miner, you want to signal to the world and say, look, if you don't pay a lot, Say, look, if you don't pay a lot of money, I won't process your transaction. So, what better signal is there to the world than to mine an empty block? Then you say, huh, look, I'm just going to mine an empty block to show you that if you don't pay a lot of money, you won't get processed. And you sign that block to show to all the other miners that, hey, I I am leaving some money on the table, but if we all do that collectively, we are better off, right? Because you have to think about the other way. So each miner individually is leaving some money on the table, but the point of collusion is to do that, right? The point of collusion is if everybody leaves a little bit of money on the table, we can increase the size of the total pie for the miners, because now everybody has to pay a lot more. Has to pay a lot more. That's the same thing as any other form of credit that you have. You artificially restrict supply. I have a comment about this. We will go to coffee. Let's thank the speaker. Okay. Thank you very much. So, Alfred, the the one of the two papers you mentioned in the beginning, the second paper was a speaker in our Samsi event this November. I wish we could have invited you there as well. Could have invited you there as well. So he analyzed this block digestion, congestion, and then they reached the conclusion that in order for a blockchain to be sustainable, so the miners are going to work on it, it has to be congested. It has to be part. It has to be congested. It has to be congested and the fees should be high. So you cannot have a nice blockchain with very big block sizes because miners will just leave. Sizes because miners will just leave it. But you're just talking now about proof of work consensus, right? Because miners are spending a lot of electricity, so they need to have high fees. So why are you so focused on proof of work? Because it's the only one that really works in real life. Look at distributed. Look at work as in team committees. I mean, you can have bit you can say we're on the committee, we trust each other, that works, right? But and trust this environment only proves the work that you have. Look at Depos. You also use Dipos very uh Depots where the ordinary nodes can vote for the miner. And the miners are now driving the ordinary users to mine the next node. So nothing, other than proof of work, I have not seen anything that really works in mind. Or you would have a consortium. You are aware that Hyperledger doesn't use proof of work. But it is a closed consortium. Okay, so that's a key. Yes, public project. So then, I mean, one thing we are. I mean, one thing we argue is that it's not totally clear that this is a bad thing, what's going on, because all these fees go towards probably extra mining capacity, which makes the system safer, which it benefits the user. So it's not totally clear that this is a bad thing. But we are not there where the idea of DeFi is to have a more competitive and more efficient system that we have at the moment. That we have at the moment. I mean, if you look at the banking system, we let banks earn rents so that they don't do stupid things. Why was Canada not so much affected by the financial crisis? My humble opinion is not because the Canadian bankers are smarter or the Canadian government is smarter. That's because banks in Canada earn a ton of money from selling checking accounts. So, if you make a lot of money from selling checking accounts, why do you have to do something crazy? And so in a way, if you let the banks earn rents, economic rents, that they shouldn't really deserve in a competitive environment, but if you let them do that, that makes the system safer. And so that happens in the traditional banking system, that rents exist through collusion. Canadian banks probably collude as well. And so we it's not too surprising to see that. It's not too surprising to see that in Bitcoin too, in some sense, emerge. But it more resembles the traditional system that people might think. Okay. Yes, yes.
