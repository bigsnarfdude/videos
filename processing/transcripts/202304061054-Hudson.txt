Sorry, I can't be there with you in Banff. I've still not succeeded in getting to Banff. I've been invited multiple times. I'm currently in California, so I'm not so far away, but it still would have been complicated to come. So yeah, I'm going to talk about joint work with Philip. So you're lucky to have my co-author to ask lots of hard questions to in the break afterwards, if you wish. And I'm going to talk about some work that And I'm going to talk about some work that we did kind of over the course of the pandemic, I suppose, but also before that, thinking about the evolution of elastoplastic materials, where we're connecting that evolution of the plasticity to the flow of distications. And so, maybe just some motivation. I know that there are many experts in the audience who I don't need to tell about this stuff. Tell about this stuff, but just for those of you that may be less familiar. So the crystal plasticity, so that's the plasticity theory that really governs how, say, metallic solids particularly evolve. It has been known for a long time is related to the concept of slip. So you can see this picture of a rod of cadmium here. I should actually do this. I should actually do this. So, this is a rod of cadmium that's been put in a testing device and pulled on. And it's been carefully aligned with the axes of the testing device so that you see this really nice pattern of slipped crystalline planes. So if this is a completely reasonable visible micrograph, it's not like some special electron microscopy, you can really see the planes that have. Planes that have slid over each other to allow plastic deformation to occur. So, plasticity is irreversible deformation. And so, it has been known for a long time that this is the mechanism that causes irreversible deformation in crystals. And in the early 20th century, it was also, well, actually, this is kind of a victory for theoretical science in the sense that three people simultaneously came up with the idea of. Came up with the idea of how exactly this slip occurs, which is through the motion of line defects through crystalline materials, which are called dislocations. And so prior to that point, it wasn't really clear exactly how this happened because some of the theoretical predictions did not really match up with the idea of kind of coherent slip occurring across whole planes at the same time. Okay, so let's now talk about what material scientists. Talk about what material scientists actually use computationally to model plasticity. So, there's a whole range of theories that are actually used by computational material scientists to make predictions, particularly when it comes to new materials about what might happen. And so at the lowest length scales, you have things like density functional theory and molecular dynamics. So, that's really where you're treating individual atomic nuclear. Individual atomic nuclei and moving them around. And so, you know, things like defects can naturally be encoded there because they kind of just can be put in quite easily. But at higher length scales, we have PD theories, which I guess we're all much more familiar with in this audience. And so you have, for example, elastoplasticity modeling up here at the very longest length scales where you want to actually do engineering. And at some kind of intermediate scale, you have the theory that I'm going to talk about. The theory that I'm going to talk about, which is dislocation dynamics. So, the idea in this hierarchy of models is really that if you have a fixed number of or fixed computer, even a very large fixed computer, you only have a limited number of degrees of freedom that you can afford to simulate. And the theories down here require very many degrees of freedom per unit volume, if you like. Per unit volume, if you like, so and per unit time as well. So, for density functional theory, really, we need many, many degrees of freedom and very large computers, even to do very small boxes of atoms. For molecular dynamics, we need very large computers to maybe do billions of atoms, but that's still way below the scale where we have any kind of relevant physics for engineering, let's say. Whereas up here, we can start to get closer to something where we can make predictions that. Something where we can make predictions that could be used for human-scale engineering, let's say. Okay, so like I say, the focus in this talk is really at this scale, which is kind of just above the atomistic scale, but is well below kind of the continuum scale where everything is really continuum. And so what is the idea of disciplication dynamics? So going back to what I said at the start of the talk, the idea is that in crystals, we believe that plasticity. Crystals, we believe that plasticity occurs through the motion of dissipations, or in fact, we know, I think it's fair to say, that this is the case. And so, if we want to understand how plasticity occurs at kind of short, small length scales, then we need to basically think about how dislocations move around inside a crystal. And so, the idea of discrete dislocation dynamics, which kind of goes back as a computational method to the early 90s, is really. Early 90s is really the idea that, well, we can, if we just discretize where the dissipation lines in the material are, then we need only degrees of freedom that govern where those lines are, morally speaking. So we don't need to put every single atomic nuclei down and treat those individually. We can just discretize these lines. And you can kind of see in this picture, right, there are clearly nodes that are being used to discretize this picture. This picture. And so, if I move those nodes around, then I can much more efficiently simulate larger volumes at longer time scales than I could with atomistic models. And so this means that this theory has much better numerical complexity. It's cheaper to compute than it would be for if I wanted to simulate this with molecular dynamics. And there's also another advantage, which I've been learning about whilst I've been here at UCLA, which is that, I mean, now. Which is that, I mean, now molecular dynamic simulations are so large that actually processing and understanding the data that comes out of them is getting to be harder and harder to do. Whereas if we actually just treat the individual defects that we care about, then we can kind of look at the simulation slightly more easily and actually understand what's going on, maybe in a way that we can't with this very big data problems. And finally, of course, like this is the level at which we're just above the atomic. Which we're just above the atomic scale, but well below kind of macroscopic continuum theories. So, this theory is really a bridge in between those things where we can pass predictions upwards. Okay, so this is the good news about alternation dynamics, but what is a little bit more complicated is from the mathematical point of view, these are some issues with it. So, at the moment, there's not really very much in the way of a well-posedness theory. Of a well-posedness theory, especially not, definitely not for the 3D model that people use. And there's not really any numerical analysis that is done. I mean, of course, people do convergence tests for their numerical schemes to check whether things are going right, but we don't actually have kind of good, you know, mathematically rigorous numerical analysis for the kind of models that we have. And that's connected, of course, to the fact that we don't necessarily have a well-posed in this theory for this model at the moment. For this model at the moment. I guess another thing that is believed, but is not really known, is exactly what the constituent relations are for the motion of the dissications in the material. And that's something that you would have to, and people do, try to measure from molecular dynamics or more atomistic theories. But when it comes to these very complicated knots that you see in this network, there's, I think, a lot of questions about exactly how those should. Lot of questions about exactly how those should be treated. And so that's definitely another scientific question that's open. And another thing that is a major thing that needs addressing is also to think about not just the interactions of the dissertations themselves, but with other defects. So things like brain boundaries, point defects, and so forth. So those are treated in some codes, but it depends. There's not really a well-developed theory. There's not really a well-developed theory in this area that would allow you to kind of unify those ideas together in a nice way. And finally, I guess the other thing that would be interesting from a mathematical point of view is really to come up with some kind of homogenization theory, right? So we've got individual dislocation lines in this picture shown up here, but actually, as Amit was talking about earlier in the week, we want to maybe go up to higher scales. So treat kind of fields of dissipation. So, treat kind of fields of dislocations or really crystal plasticity modelling at higher scales and make predictions that come out of this kind of model, discrete dislocation dynamics model, and try to treat or give some predictive information that goes into those theories. So we can kind of pass information all the way up this hierarchy of models. Okay. So, the focus in this talk is The focus in this talk is going towards a formulation to resolve problem one. So, the world positiveness theory. So, what I'm going to now talk about is essentially a way to use or an idea of using currents to really think about how to move dislocations around. So, there's close connections with what Paolo talked about earlier on. I would also say, I mean, Philip and I are by far not the first people to think. By far, not the first people to think about dislocations and plasticity. There's a huge number of people, including lots of people in the audience. And the idea of currents really goes back to, I think, work by Adriana and co-workers, so Sergio Conti, Analisa Massachusetts, and also Ricardo Sculler, Nicholas Pengurtham, and lots of other people that I probably will forget in the names of. So, you know, this is not a new idea. This is not a new idea in that sense, but maybe we've hopefully seen something that might be interesting to actually allow us to develop this theory more in the future. Okay, maybe before I go on, are there any questions? Because I know that this is always a little bit less interactive when I'm online. Okay, no. Okay, so I'm going to. Okay, so I'm going to basically now give you an overview of what our model does kinematically. So the idea is that, as usual, when we're thinking about elasticity modeling, we're going to take some reference configuration, omega, which is drawn down here, and we're going to think of a deformation map, Y that is going to move. That is going to move points in that reference configuration to points elsewhere on space at a later time. So that's our omega primed over here, which is the deformed configuration. Okay, so that's the deformation map. And points, I will refer to points in this reference configuration as X, and I will refer to points in the deformed configuration as Y. As y. And now, what we want to think about is dislocations in this setting, right? So that means that what are dislocations fundamentally, they are lines. In fact, they're loops, closed loops inside the material. So what I'm going to imagine is that I have some kind of closed loop or many loops, in fact, that live somewhere in the reference configuration. And of course, if I push that forward through If I push that forward through this deformation map Y, then I will end up with a different loop in the default configuration. And of course, that push forward is going to depend on the time parameter, you know, the time at which I do the push forward, because it would be in the deformed configuration at time t. So was there a question? Was there a question? No question, keep going. No question. Okay. So far, so good. So, okay. And so that's all fine. So this Y, if I really just think of it as a deformation, then I'm basically in the setting of elasticity, right? So if Y is an invertible diffeomorphism, you know, if I map forwards and backwards at different times, then I just get reverse. Times, then I just get reversible deformation. So if we want to encode kind of irreversible or plastic deformation, then I need to do something in addition to this. And so that's where we're going to introduce a further kind of space in this picture, which is, let's actually draw it slightly differently. So I'm going to introduce a structural space, which I will explain in a second. Which I will explain in a second, that is going to live kind of outside of this picture, which is going to be where we think about some kind of ideal lattice structure that the material has. So this is going to be the structural space that lives up here. Okay, and so the idea of this space. And so, the idea of this space is that if we want to encode plasticity and dislocations, then one of the key things about dislocations is that they somehow are a geometric defect in the lattice. So they're a place where it's not exactly clear how to sort of embed a lattice into the material. So, when we have elastic deformations, if you imagine a lattice being deformed elastically, that means really. That means really that if I zoom in close enough, the lattice is just being stretched in some way. But when I have dislocations present, it's no longer clear exactly what the lattice that I'm stretching is. And so in order to encode the kind of incompatibility, what I'm going to do is think about the kind of local embedding of this lattice into either the reference configuration or the default configuration. Or the default configuration. And the way that I'm going to do that is by introducing a couple, well, quite a few more arrows on this diagram. So the picture is, so if you're familiar with kind of classical elastoplasticity and the corona decomposition, then the idea is that I'm going to have a plastic distortion that takes me from the reference configuration into. From the reference configuration into this lattice space, and then I'm going to follow that by an elastic distortion, which takes me from this imaginary lattice and stretches me into the default configuration. I can also think of going backwards and forwards between these things. So these maps here, you should think of them as being matrix valued. But I'll say a little bit more about that later on. More about that later on. So, the point is that this p is a matrix-valued function, if you like, or a linear map-valued function that takes a point in time and a referential point and maps it into this structural space up here. And then E is again a mapping that then takes me from the structural space into the deformed configuration. In fact, into the tangent space to the deformed configuration. But there we go. There we go. And we're also going to add the inverse mapping. So Q is equal to P inverse as a kind of matrix inverse, if you like, which is going to be called the scaffold that takes me kind of from this lattice space and embeds me back into the reference configuration. That's what Q is here. And so the idea is that I have Q and E, which are both maps that come out of the structure. Are both maps that come out of the structural space and into both the deformed and the undeformed configuration here. Okay, and so the other thing that I want to put on this diagram is that, of course, as usual, we have f of tx, which is the gradient of y, which is going to be the deformation gradient. And the point that And the point that of what I've drawn here is really that f is equal to e times p. If I think of this, if I think of f as a map that lives on the reference configuration, then all I've said here is that if I do P and then I do E, then I get to the deformed configuration, and I want this decomposition, which is the corona decomposition. So the point is that if F point is that if f were compatible, so if f were an elastic deformation, then of course as usual, I would have that f is just the gradient of y. And so then this plastic part should be the identity so that f and the elastic distortion are exactly the same thing. And so in that case, I just have an elastic thing. But when p is not the identity in general, I'm going to get something that is going to give me plastic deformation. Okay. Okay. Any questions about what I've said? No. Okay. And great. So the key ingredients for our theory are now what I've kind of hopefully laid out on the previous slide, which are we're going to have the deformation gradient, which is something familiar from elasticity theory. We're going to have a plastic distortion P that's going to, we should think of as a map from the tangent space of the. As a map from the tangent space of the deformed configuration to this structural space that encodes lattice vectors, basically. And finally, we're going to have dislocation currents, which are going to live in the reference configuration in this case. We could also put them in the deform configuration, but for the sake of simplicity, let's just keep them in the reference configuration. Tom, can I ask you a question, Adriana? Yes. Question, Adriana? Yes, yeah. Why do you call it the reference configuration? It looks to me that it's rather so it's one state of the material body and then you are looking to a change of the material of the material body. So they are both material configuration, and I would say that the lattice that you put on the side is the reference configuration in a sense. So you compare that these two states with the reference configuration. These two states with a reference configuration? So, I mean, I think that's a valid question in the sense that we're using that to make the analogy with elasticity, I guess. But yes, you're completely right that there's, you know, in some sense, this is the reference lattice and this has two configurations of the body. Yeah, so if you were doing so, yeah, yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, exactly. So it's a reference configuration just because it's a reference. Is this acting could be referred to? Yeah. It's not like some special configuration, as you say. It could be, we could take this at any time we want if we have a nice evolution. Exactly. Okay, so yes. So what we're going to do is we're going to encode things as I said. So we've got these dislocations. Things as I said. So we've got these dislocations, which are going to be currents that live in one configuration, which I'm calling the reference configuration. And importantly, so in a particular material, typically you have only a limited number of possible Burgers vectors for your dissertations. And so these Burgers vectors B here are going to live in this lattice space that lives in between. So yeah, basically I will have a finite collection of Burgers vectors in a particular Burgers vectors in a particular lattice that corresponds to the material that I will actually observe in practice, right? So they might be sort of, you know, they're normally the shortest vectors in the lattice. So there will be some symmetry relationship between these burgers vectors, but there are normally finitely many that we would actually observe. So for each Burgers vector I have, I get a current that matches that. And there's a certain orientation I'm kind of glossing over here. If I flip the Burgers vector, I should also flip the orientation. Burger's vector, I should also flip the orientation of the dislocation line. And so there should also be a symmetry there. But in the interest of time, I will gloss over that. Okay, and as I said, we could equivalently, instead of p, use q, which is just the inverse of p, and we could also use the elastic distortion instead of the gradient of y. Okay. And so, okay, now we've introduced some kinematic framework. Of course, if I want. Kinomatic framework. Of course, if I want a model, I should tell you how I should connect the evolution of all of these variables as they evolve. So what we would like is something that kind of connects the evolution of these quantities. And because I'm looking for something where I expect plasticity or the plastic distortion to evolve, and because of the motion of dislocations, that means that I should probably have some kind of constituent. Should probably have some kind of constitutive relation or some equation that tells me how does p change in response to the motion of dislocations. So, in this case, we're talking about something where I maybe have where the dislocations are and also what their frequencies are. And that should tell me something about how the plasticity has changed. So, now going back to Paolo's talk, I mean, in general, until relatively recently, this is now a very hard problem to solve because. Hard problem to solve because if I'm thinking of TB as really being some kind of one current or boundaryless one current, deciding on what exactly I should mean by such an evolution is kind of a pretty hard thing because I have some very irregular object that I'm taking a time derivative of. And in general, this how this evolves should depend in a coupled way on the stress in the material, because that's what we expect from kind of Kind of the theory of dislocations. So, this is going to be a very nasty object in general. Okay. But in view of ideas of Philip and others, one of the key observations to make is that actually we can kind of make sense of this by thinking in space-time rather than just spatially. And so, going back to what Paolo was talking about. Paolo was talking about, the kind of way to make sense of this in a nice way, mathematically, seems to be to lift the problem instead of from just thinking about it in space, to thinking about it in space-time. So if you, this is a cartoon of a dissertation loop in 2D moving in a 3D space-time, but you should really think about this happening in one-dimensional loops in 3D moving in four-dimensional space-time. And so, what we do. And so, what we do is we introduce the concept of a slip trajectory, which is a space-time current, two current. So that means that basically I've got a two-dimensional surface that's evolving in 4D space-time. And so then that's kind of what's being swept out here, right? I've got a two-dimensional surface in a three-dimensional space-time. And so there's going to be certain restrictions on those surfaces. Going to be certain restrictions on those surfaces if I want them to really be kind of physical trajectories. So, for example, it cannot be the case that if I have such a slip trajectory, I should not be able to basically have any kind of motion of these loops in the kind of orthogonal to time direction. So, in a space-like, purely space-like direction, right? So, if I had a loop, if I had a connection between this red. Connection between this red, this blue loop, and a red loop elsewhere in the same plane. So the surface extends across this plane in that way, then that would correspond, if you think about it carefully, to some kind of jump in the position of the dislocation, instantaneous jump in time. And if we want really a nice trajectory, then we shouldn't allow such things. So that means that basically, if I think about this manifold, this S. About this manifold, this SB in four-dimensional space-time, that means I should always have a tangent direction, or almost always, let's say, in a measure of theoretic sense, I should almost always have a tangent direction on this manifold, which points somehow in the time-like direction, as shown by side B here. Okay, and so the point is now with geometric measure theory tools, suppose that I have such a split trajectory. Suppose that I have such a split trajectory, I can start to think about what the physical relevance of this two-current is. And one way to think about this is, well, basically, I can, at any point on such a manifold, I'm going to have, because it's a assuming it's nice and decomposable, I will have kind of a well-defined two vector, which describes the tangent plane to the manifold. Tangent plane to manifold at me point on it. And like I said, one of those, I can always choose a tangent vector if I've got this nice evolutionary property to point in the time-like direction. And then by construction, if I maximize the length of that vector or maximize the component in the time-like direction, I will get something which has purely space-like component, this TB here. And so, if you think a little bit more about what this means, this Bit more about what this means. This really means that this thing is encoding something about the velocity of the dislocation because it's moving in a time-like direction, and the other component is actually telling you about the orientation of the dislocation. So it also turns out that because dislocations are oriented and these SB are also oriented, you can make sense of all of these things in a kind of self-consistent way. Paul, may I ask, may I interrupt you just a quick question? Yes. Are you? Are you assuming this is an assumption of your slip trajectory that you can find such a vector? Is it called this an assumption? Because it doesn't follow from the slip trajectory being continuous. No, so if we want something physical, then we kind of need it as a restriction on the slip trajectories that we take as admissible. So basically, you're saying admissible slip trajectories fulfill this automatically this condition of having a tangent. Of adding a function to a vertex point state. Exactly. And so, well, then there's a question about whether we can guarantee that in a well-positiveness theory, right? So that's a big question that I'm not going to address here. Really, what I'm going to do a lot of formal stuff here and not prove any theorems. So there's lots of theorems to be proven, I think. But yeah. Yeah. So hopefully that is clear enough. Clear enough. So, yes, indeed, there's some admissibility criterion that we should enforce on these slip trajectories in general that, in a well-posedness theory, we would need to check. Exactly as you're saying. Okay. So, yes. And so the nice thing about doing this is were we to have such an admissible slip trajectory, we can now time slice this trajectory and get the dislocation configuration at any particular time. Configuration at any particular time, right? So that's what is shown here. So if I have such a two current in 4D space-time and I have nice properties, I can basically take a time slice and then I will see the 3D spatial loops that I expect at that particular time. Okay. And so this is, I guess, the key idea that I'm sorry, Tom. May I interrupt you? Absolutely. To you, absolutely, uh, frankfurt. Um, I don't understand where is the okay, the space, spatial direction. Where are you? Um, so right, this is uh so it's kind of hard to imagine, but okay, so I've got I mean, I mean, uh, where are you? Because you're changing configuration. You're changing configuration. So, your loop is not with respect to it's with respect to what? Where are you? So, so what you should think of is the space. Yeah, so I think I see what you're saying. So, the space for this loop, we're now ignoring for the moment the kind of change of deformation, right? So, we do have to resolve that. You have another kind of configuration. New configuration space or get we can so you have another another resonance so this is in omica right at a fixed time but yeah you're absolutely right that I can move both the the the omica and the loop as well and exactly how those two things interact is complicated yeah um and I'm not saying that we resolved everything here to be clear about that yeah Yeah, um, okay, so now we need to basically say, okay, so exactly as you were saying, we need to kind of understand what exactly does this motion mean and where is it occurring, right, in some sense. And so the way that we're going to encode this is through something which is going to be called a slipwright. So the idea So, the idea is that if I want to think about the change of plastic distortion, well, then I'm going to say that this is driven by basically something that comes out of the motion of dislocations and the B, which is the Burgess vector, which is a slip. You know, basically it's the quantum of slip that's occurring due to the motion of the dislocation. And here, the geometric slip rate is something that encodes the kind of Is something that encodes the kind of velocity, the slip rate that occurs due to the motion of the cation. And you can understand this in a kind of GMT sense, which is over here, but let me just tell you what it means in a kind of more physically understandable way, which is that the slip rate is the velocity of the dislocation, which we can construct from the psi b, this time-like vector. This time-like vector crossed with, in the cross-product sense, with the orientation vector of the dislocation and multiplied by the multiplicity of the dislocation. So if I have a Burger's vector of one at some point on the line, this is basically telling me how much dislocation has passed me per unit time in a particular bug's vector direction at a point in. Direction at a point in reference space. Can I ask a question? Yes. So the only part that matters of this velocity vector is that it's the normal component, so to speak, right? Because in any case you take a wedge product, but then it doesn't matter if there is a target component. But you assume that the normal component, the tangent component is zero or simply. On volunteer, or simply won't care? So, in fact, it's uh, if we go back to this um this slip trajectory construction, it kind of occurs by construction. So, uh, the way uh Philip will hopefully correct me if I make a mistake here. So, um, the idea is that, so going back to this tangent vector that exists with maximal time-like component, we can Timelike component, we can basically take its projection onto the space-like directions, p of sigma v, and then I can divide by the length of the time-like component, and this gives me the velocity. And because of the way it's instructed, it automatically is going to be normal to the dislocation direction. I think I had a problem with the picture before because the vertical vector looked completely vertical. Well, it has a space component, right? A space component, right? Yes, it's this. Yeah, let me draw on. So this angle is not. Yes, fair point. This is supposed to be a little bit of a parallelogram to indicate that this is rotated a little bit. But yeah, I agree. This could be much better. Yes. Okay. Yes. Okay. Yes. Are we happy? Relatively happy? Say happier. You've got all minutes 52 seconds. Yes, I'm aware that I'm running out of time. So, okay, I'm going to ignore what gamma B is, but you cannot fill it. So, okay, then we can go through kind of standard continuum mechanics machinery. So, if we assume hyperelasticity, then Assume hyperelasticity, then we know that we should represent the internal elastic energy as an integral functional that depends upon some elastic energy density that's a constituent relation of the material. And then if we think about the rate of doing internal work, well, what we're basically saying is that should be the change of the internal elastic energy plus work that is done by moving the dislocations around. So we can introduce basically if GB is the velocity or the GB is the velocity or the rate at which the dissipations are changed, we can introduce a kind of stress that is conjugate to those things and then think about what the implications of that is. And in essence, I mean, you can do what turn turn the crank now and find that, well, you can derive appropriate equations. So let's just go straight to what the equations are. So the first one is basically So, the first one is basically the one that you would imagine from elasticity. So, I have basically a force balance of the type that you're probably very familiar with. So, I just get a kind of y double dot times the density minus the divergence of an appropriate stress is equal to any bulk forces that are occurring. But more interestingly, I guess for what we're interested in, is we can also say what this dislocation conjugate stress is. Conjugate stress is. So, if you're familiar with dislocations, you should think of this as being like the equivalent of a peach collier-type force, right? It's conjugate to have a slip rate of dislocations, and it has some expression that you can write down, which is maybe not that illuminating. But maybe if you're familiar with the peach colour force, you'll notice that in the peach colour force, you have sigma b cross with the tangent factor to the dislocation. To the dislocation normally. And here you see some kind of sigma times B without this cross. And that's because the GB also takes into account that crossing with the dissipation direction. Okay, so now if we want to close the system, what we propose is that we should choose some kind of flow rule that now depends on relates the rate this flow. The rate, this flow rate GB, to the stress in some way. And then we can kind of try to close the system in this way. And as usual, if we want to obey the second law of thermodynamics or some version of it, we should choose something which has a kind of a nice convexity property. Okay, so I know that I'm very close to running out of time, so I'm just kind of quickly mention some things which I've kind of already mentioned. Kind of already mentioned, which is so one thing that's a good sanity check for this theory is to see whether if you formally linearize, you actually get what you expect. And in this case, you do indeed get that. So if I formally just go to kind of elastoplasticity, so I think of the elastic distortion as being a perturbation of the identity that is small and the plastic distortion as being the same thing. Then you can check that when you linearize this conjugate. This conjugacy relation between the slip rate and the stress gives you exactly the product between the dislocation velocity and the peach colour force, which is what you would hope because that's exactly how Peach and Kohler derived the force in the first place. So they basically said, what's the energy dissipation rate which is caused by the motion of the dissipation through an elastic medium? The other thing that we can encode quite naturally is, which I won't go through this calculation, but essentially the determinant of P should remain one, or equivalently, the determinant of Q should remain one if I assume plastic incompressibility. That's a kind of very classic thing that you see. Like the motion of dislocation does not actually cause volume change, it just normally occurs by glide only. This is a thing that's said. Only. This is a thing that's said. And so you can see that that then imposes some restrictions on what the flow rate should be relative to the dislocation line. So basically, what comes out is that the flow rate should be orthogonal to the bogus vector that you observe. So that's somehow a volume conservation property that you expect. So this can be interpreted as saying we get plastic incompressibility. Get plastic incompressibility if only we get glide motion of dislocations. Okay, so I'm going to stop there and take any more questions. So what I've done is presented a new theoretical framework for crystal plasticity, which is kind of non-linear, geometrically non-linear in character, right? That's kind of the driving force behind what we're trying to do here, that connects plasticity driven by dislocation flow and. Driven by dislocation flow and unifies lots of ideas. So, I should make that very clear: like lots of the ideas that we've ingredients that we've included in here are already present in other forms of models, but we've tried to unify them in a framework that hopefully can be attacked using the tools of GMT. And so things which are ongoing and future work are with Philip and Giacomo and Paolo, we've been discussing the idea of doing a frank read source. The idea of doing a frank read source and working out what exactly is predicted by this theory in that case and whether we can do well-posedness in that case. And thinking about contitup relations, linearization, and numerical methods are obviously all to come, and hopefully, possibly, who knows, some kind of homogenization result. If you want to read more, then this is published in the following article. And Philip also has some further things that he can point you towards in terms of. Things that he can point you towards in terms of the theory. And with that, thank you very much for your attention. And I'm happy to take any questions. Questions? Comments? Yes, please. I have a very basic question which might show that I didn't understand much about the talk, but let me ask you. So, who had, let's say, a plastic? A plastic or whatever, it's moving because you are changing the boundary condition, say, in time, and there is a plastic evolution. Then, the point of view is that you know everything about what's happening inside the body, the stress and whatever in time, and you predict how this location moves. You know, these locations are transported somehow, are passive with respect to the evolution of the body, or really, well, because there is written something like plastic. Is written something like plastic driven by dislocation. So, which of the two? The dislocation are current. Once you know everything about stress and what's happening to the reference, to the body, then you know what this location means. That's your point of view. So, the point of view is that you know everything. So, you know both how the dislocations move, how the stress evolves, how the elasticity evolves, and so you the point is to unify all of those things together. All of those things together. So it's kind of what is the chicken and the egg, is, I guess, what you're asking. And the point is that they're tied together in a hopefully theoretically consistent way. So the point is that you can only have plastic distortion evolving if dislocations move, but the dislocation motion can be driven by the internal stress, and that also has an effect on the internal stress state. So everything is tied together in some sense. And so Together in some sense. And so, yeah, I'm not saying, you know, maybe Philip can comment, but like, I mean, we're still far from understanding fully the well-posedness theory of what this theory might be. But my feeling is that this is maybe the right way to put things together in a way that you can hope to have some kind of well-posed theory. Other questions, comments? Other questions, comments? If not, then I have a couple of remarks. First thing is, it's the couple more. The stress affects the dislocation. Oh, 100%. Seriously, Kofi. So dislocation motion affects the deformation as well as the stress, and the stress affects the dislocation motion. In this model. In this. Well, yeah, in this model, too. Okay so yeah okay so Tom very quickly so in your way of thinking about it suppose I mean an elementary question would be I give you a collection I mean a distribution of what you would call currents and you calculate the stress the data is I give you the current distribution in your mod do you have equations to calculate Do you have equations to calculate the stress corresponding to that?
