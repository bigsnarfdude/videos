So, today I'm going to speak about quantum toroidal algebras in untwisted types. So, a little bit more generality than what we've seen so far this week. So, I'll be coming at this from a pretty algebraic point of view. So, if people have perspectives on potential connections to geometry or physics, I'd be very interested to hear and learn about this. And please do interrupt me at any point if you have some questions or would like me to clarify something. Would like me to clarify something during the talk. And yeah, just a note on the institution. I've just finished my PhD in Oxford and I'm in the process of moving up to Edinburgh, which is why I've kind of included both on the slide. Okay. So just to kind of cover a bit of overview on what we'll be covering today, I'll start with some basic setup, which should be pretty familiar to most, just getting us all on the same page with regards to the preliminaries for the day. Regards the preliminaries for the definition and basic properties of quantum toroidal algebras, as I'll be considering them in this talk. And then I'll move on to sort of the first main result, which will be a braid group action on quantum toroidal algebras. So we'll recap two presentations of the affine level of this, the affine braid group action on quantum affine algebras, and then we'll define the extended double affine braid groups, which are going to be the appropriate braid group object on the Troidal level. On the troidal level, before proving that these act on quantum troidal algebras. And this braid group action will really be a key tool for us. So throughout the rest of the talk, we'll try and exploit it as much as possible to obtain and prove various results for quantum toroidal algebras. And one kind of class of these results will be horizontal-vertical symmetries for these algebras. The main kind of The main kind of theorem that we'll have is the existence of an anti-involution which exchanges the horizontal and vertical subalgebras. And then, as a quick corollary, we'll obtain a generalization of the Mickey automorphism to all untwisted types except G2, but I'll mention that later. And then I'll discuss some applications to the representation theory of untwisted quantum droid algebras. And this is kind of work in progress, so I'll try and be clear what I've proven. What I've proven so far, what I kind of expect, and maybe what's more of a dream or a hope. And then we'll finish with some congruence group actions on quantum troid algebras. This will be of the central extension of SL2Z, so exhibiting further symmetries for these algebras. So the talk today is kind of based off of two documents. So one is my thesis, which is available online as online. Which is available online as of about two weeks ago. And then the other is a paper that I put in the archive, which should be accepted within a couple of weeks after I find time to make some minor revisions. Okay, so for our setup, we're just going to take a Cartan matrix of untwisted affine type. And of course, this is going to correspond to one of the diagrams, Dinkin diagrams on the board. The labels won't really be important in this talk. Important in this talk, apart from maybe in one remark. But just for completeness, the black numbers, if you can see them, are the vertex labels. The blue numbers are these AI numerical labels, as in Katz's book, which kind of pop up everywhere. And in red, I've put the dual labels whenever these are different, but fine, not too important. The reason why we're going to consider untwisted types in this talk is really so that the main So, that the, well, the main thing is so that the horizontal and vertical sub-algebras of the quantum toroidal algebra will be of the same untwisted affine type. And this is going to be important for our symmetries between horizontal and vertical later on. But I will mention at different points where our results either extend to or have analogues in twisted types also. And also, people can ask me about this a bit more at the end. And yeah, I should mention that we're actually really going to. Mentioned that we're actually really going to ignore type A1 untwisted in this talk. The reason for this is our first main result, this braid group action, will require the Dinkin diagram to have at most triple arrows between any two vertices. And of course, this is not satisfied for A1. And so, yeah, we'll kind of ignore it. But I'll say a bit more about that later on, of why that condition is there. Okay. Right. So, as Right, so as we all know, quantum affine algebras have two equivalent presentations. Familiar to all of us, you know, on the left, we've got the Drimfeld-Jimbo realization, which just takes the affine Lie algebra built from one of the diagrams on the previous slide and quantizes its enveloping algebra. So you have finitely many generators, the usual finite set of relations, and they're indexed by the nodes of the affine-Dinkin diagram. Find Dinkin diagram. So throughout this talk, I'll be using this kind of illustration style in the middle. So Kat's Moody style presentations will be in blue, and this will be pretty much every slide. On the other hand, we've got the Drimfold new realization, which gives a loop-style version of this, obtained by applying quantum affinization to the finite quantum group or quantizing the loop Lie algebra, or the central extension of the Loop Lie algebra. Called the central extension of the looply algebra. And so we have infinitely many generators indexed by the finite Dinkin diagram satisfying some loop versions. And I'm not going to include the loop relations because we've all seen them before and we all know how horrible they can be to put on a slide. But loop style realizations will be in red. And I've put affine A3 as an example at the bottom of the slide. But of course, each of these presentations has value. The Drimfold Jimbo. The Drimfold Jimbo is useful for highest and lowest weight theories, co-product structures, and crystal and global bases, which are sort of missing for quantum toroidal algebras or in progress for quantum toroidal algebras at this stage. While the Drenford new realization is good for studying finite dimensional representations and constructing vertex representations and so on. And so we do have this kind of machinery for quantum Troy algebras, of course. So really, all I've put on this slide is. Really, all I've put on this slide is the commutativity of the following diagram. So you've got your finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra, and you can either affinize and then quantize, or you can quantize and then perform quantum affinization. But of course, we can also do this once more and get the quantum Froid algebras. Algebras. Okay. So perfect. So this is how we're going to kind of illustrate these quantum droid algebras in a diagram which is highlighting the horizontal and vertical sub-algebras. Of course, one is in each presentation from the colors and they intersect in a copy of the finite quantum group. And together they generate the entire quantum droid algebra. And droid algebra. It's not super clear on the slide, but each contains a central element. So obviously the vertical has this central element C, and then inside the horizontal is this is a K delta corresponding to the imaginary root. Okay, fine. And both for us will be of the same untwisted affine type. Okay, and the diagram also makes clear the sort of standard obvious. Standard obvious Z grading of the generators in the vertical direction, and this will play a role later on. And I've included some basic properties on the slide, which will be relevant for us. Two successes, I guess, and two difficulties for quantum Troid algebras. So the first success is this Drimfeld-style topological co-product, which maps to a certain completion of the tensor square. And it's written in. And it's written in terms of a formal parameter v. And also, we have this loop triangular decomposition where the x minuses form the negative part, the x pluses form the positive part, and the rest forms the cartan. And this obviously leads to loop highest weight theory. But unfortunately, there's no known co-product. And so studying tensor product representations and module categories for quantum droid algebras is, of course, difficult. Quantum droid algebras is, of course, difficult in general. And one thing that we'll want to address later in the talk, or maybe solve to some extent, is that this delta V does not give a well-defined tensor product for these loop highest weight modules. So later, as an application of our horizontal vertical symmetries, we will construct a well-defined tensor product in general. Yeah. Yes. Yes. The V is just, so there's a paper earlier this year by Ilaria Damiani, which proves that this Drimfot co-product does apply in all types, uses some quite complicated detailed methods. But yeah, so she uses this parameter V, which just records the grading of the second factor. It's not necessarily well-defined. It doesn't necessarily give, even for specializing V, I think you can show that it won't, in general, produce a well-defined module structure. So, is it true that in type A it always Is it true that in type A it always works? Okay, I'll come back to this and maybe you can ask again. Yeah, later. Yes. Okay. Oh yeah, it's worth noting that delta V is still very useful, right? It was used to exhibit Fox-based representation in terms of as a semi-infinite limit of exterior powers of a vector representation by Fagan, Jimbo. Representation by Fagan, Jimbo, Niwa, and Mukin. So it still has some uses, of course. Okay. So the final thing to recap. So we've done our setup, and we're now going to move on to our first result, which is a Bray group action for quantum Troid algebras. And so it will really be built by fusing together two copies of the affine action in some appropriate way, which is classical, you know, due to list. Classical, you know, due to Lustig and Beck. So, in particular, we're really going to need for our applications, our braid groups to be extended. And so, what this means in the Coxeter presentation is just that we have our T0 to Tn satisfying the braid relations as per usual. But then we also semi-direct product with omega. And this is the outer automorphism group of the affine-Dinkin diagram. Okay. But it's pretty clear that this extended affine braid group acts on the quantum affine algebra. I'm not going to bother putting all of the relations on the slide. You've all seen them before. But just philosophically, I kind of think of it as Ti intertwines generators at vertices adjacent to I with those at vertex i, so you get some q-commutator expressions. So, you get some Q commutator expressions and so on. And outer automorphisms just permute around the generators accordingly. Okay, fine. Now, the Bernstein presentation of this extended affine braid group occurs as the semi-direct product of the finite braid group T1 to Tn with the finite co-weight lattice. So I've got these X betas indexed by beta in the finite co-weight lattice. I've got the fundamental co-wait ones there. ones there. And so really we can illustrate it as on the left. But if you view the affine action with respect to these two loop style presentations, the difference is just that the X's shift generators on the right-hand side up and down the grading. So I've put the key example, which is the ith fundamental co-weight. This shifts generators in the ith column up and down and leaves all the other columns alone. Okay, the reason that I'm focusing on this is. Okay, the reason that I'm focusing on this is because really we're going to fuse these two presentations together to give a double affine action. Okay, so yeah, of course, break group actions are useful and fundamental results for studying quantum algebras. And so, yeah, I mean, the combination of these two presentations on the left with this action was used or was crucial in Beck's proof of the Drimfeld new presentation for quantum affine algebras. So now we're going to sort of see what the analog on the Troidel level is. See what the analog on the toroidal level is before kind of trying to use it as much as possible to study quantum toroidal algebras. Okay, so the particular result that we've proven is an action on the quantum toroidal algebra of what's called the extended double affine braid group. This braid group is really formed by fusing together two extended affine braid subgroups, one in each presentation. Subgroups, one in each presentation, as we've got on the left, similar to the formation of quantum toroidal algebras. And this is reflected in the relations, right? So the Ti's satisfy the braid relations, the outer automorphism group elements kind of just permute around the T's and the X's, and then the T's and the X's interact with each other via some reflection style relations. Okay, this is all kind of hopefully somewhat familiar stuff, I guess. Hopefully, somewhat familiar stuff, I guess. It's worth noting down here that this SI of beta, this reflection, is, well, it really is defined by embedding the finite coate lattice inside the affine coate lattice at level zero. And this is where the vertex labels come in, which is because you take. Labels come in, which is because you take the ith fundamental co-weight and you map it to the ith fundamental co-weight minus AI times the zeroth fundamental co-weight. And this will be important for our brave group action that we prove. Okay, so everything makes clear: horizontal and vertical copies of the affine thing. This is all shown in the diagrams. So, in terms of the action, So, in terms of the action, it ends up looking like, yeah, a combination of what we had on the previous slide. So, particular things to note are that the horizontal subgroup preserves the horizontal subalgebra, the vertical subgroup preserves the vertical subalgebra, and each of these restricted actions coincides with Lustigenbeck's affine action. Okay. And the why do I need Why do I need the rather than just rather than just a quantum affinization in general? So I will mention this. You don't need to. This is the one result where it really extends. Yeah, I'll mention this in the proof. Okay, so yeah, the other thing maybe to note is just in contrast to the affine situation, these X omega checks shift generators in column I and column zero. I and column zero up and down this grading. And this is because of this embedding at level zero that I just mentioned here. Okay, and this is very important for various proofs of things that we do later on. Okay, so I will outline the proof, but the key difficulty for us to note when proving this is how to define how Ti acts on generators at vertex i. In particular, how does it act on In particular, how does it act on these XIM plus or minus generators? So, and really, this is as the size of M gets large. Okay, so this is the difficulty that we have to overcome, because even in the affine case, when you're looking with respect to the Bernstein and Drimfeld new presentations, these expressions are really defined recursively on M. So, if you want to define how TI acts, this is saying that you have to define it on infinitely many of these generators, which we obviously On infinitely many of these generators, which we obviously can't do. So we need to work around to get around this. And so the key way of getting around this problem is with a lemma that gives a simplified presentation for quantum Troid algebras and will extend to a broad class of quantum affinizations. So in particular, it only involves generators, well, finitely many generators and relations, and only generators that And only generators that lie in the zero and plus or minus one levels of the grading. So it actually becomes a manageable task to define how these TI should act without too much work. So on the left-hand side, I've put the quantum Troid algebra in its usual presentation, at least as far as my diagrams allow me to. And on the right, we put an algebra where we just define it to be generated by only these generators I've got on the screen. Generators I've got on the screen, and the relations on the left that only involve these generators. So, in particular, it's a finite subset of generators and a finite subset of relations. We want to show that these are both presentations of the same algebra, and so we want to get an isomorphism between the two. Mapping from the right to the left is clear. You're applying more relations, so the map is obvious. That there is a morphism is obvious, that it's surjective. Obvious. That it's surjective is just a quick check that these generators generate the entire quantum droid algebra. So we have a map from right to left. How do we get an inverse morphism from left to right? This is more complicated. But really, it's built from the rank two sub-algebras, by which I mean it's built from this has stopped working. Okay, well, it's built from the sub-algebras which are generated by. Which are generated by all the generators at two vertices of the Dinkin diagram. So just in two columns of this diagram on the left. And these are copies of the quantum affine algebra of type A2, C2, or G2. And so proving that we have a well-defined homomorphism from the left to the right really uses the correspondence between the two presentations of the quantum affine algebra. And this is why we really require three arrows. We really require three arrows at most between any two vertices in our underlying Dinkin diagram, this correspondence. And this is why we're forced to exclude type A1, as we mentioned before. So then we get our lemma, which is that the right-hand side gives a finite presentation for the quantum Troid algebra. Okay, and yeah, as was mentioned, it's clear from our proof that by the same reasoning, our simplified presentation will extend to Presentation will extend to all quantum affinizations where the underlying Dinkin diagram has at most triple arrows. And so, in particular, this includes all untwisted quantum affine algebras, all quantum toroidal algebras in untwisted and twisted types, except for the rank one cases, so except for a For A11 and A22, but from my perspective, this is kind of okay at this stage. And then hence our braid group action will also extend to all of these cases, provided that we appropriately define some affinized braid group. The just that one of these ranks subalgebras will be a quantum affine algebra? Well, I think such a picture of I think you'd think you'd be that way. You're saying just like the subalgebra which you created by parallels. I think, I mean, unless we are looking at different, I mean, if you look at the presentation, yeah, okay, so I was under the impression that in this situation, it is not, it shouldn't be a problem to. It shouldn't be a problem to show that no other relations have shadows inside this subalgebra. The difficulty or the difficult element of this that I have encountered is really when you look at the horizontal subalgebra, it doesn't seem obvious to me at all that relations outside of this might not have shadows inside. And this is something that I will talk about later, but maybe we can talk about this afterwards. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So yeah, so I think it's worth noting that this kind of simplified presentation should, or it feels like it should be of independent interest or use, at least kind of computationally, for these quantum autonizations. Other than this breakgroup action, it's not something I've really exploited thus far, but feels like it should be useful. Okay, so. Okay, so that allows us to define the TIs and proving that they satisfy the brave relations and we get a brave repaction is not so complicated from there, so I won't talk about that anymore. So now we'll for type A, I can write it explicitly on those generations. On those generators? Yes, can I do it at the end if I get my thesis up? I mean, okay, okay. So maybe let me say that the TI on everything in the zero level is just the same as Lustig's action, as Lustig's breakgroup action on the quantum group. So this is not too complicated. So you would get expressions like Ti of X J 0. of x j 0 plus is some commutator, I mean, if i and j are adjacent, is some commutator of maybe I'll get the order wrong, but maybe like q inverse or some power of q when i and j are distinct, changing the number here to plus one. To plus one doesn't do anything, that's fine. When i and j are equal, then it creates issues. And I'll get it and I'll write it at the end. Yeah, yeah. Yes, I do have the formula, but maybe not to hand right now. Okay. Okay, so right, now we're going to move on to proving some horizontal-vertical simplicity. Move on to proving some horizontal and vertical symmetries of quantum toroidal algebras. The major instance of this that already exists is the Mickey automorphism in type A, which has been sort of instrumental for studying the type A quantum toroidal algebra and has opened up numerous perspectives on its structure and representation theory. So this was one of my motivations really for this work going forward was to generalize this to a wider generality. So our main theorem that in this direction is That in this direction is the existence of an anti-involution psi in all untwisted types except A1 and G2, which swaps the horizontal and vertical sub-algebras. And in particular, it does so via some standard anti-involution of the quantum affine algebra. So let me write this. It's just this sigma. So it fixes. So it fixes any xi plus or minus, and it inverts the cartan generators. Okay, so we know kind of how this psi acts on these horizontal and vertical subalgebras. And in particular, since these two subalgebras generate the entire algebra, then this determines psi uniquely. Okay, so our proof uses the Bray group action. Okay, so our proof uses the break group action, and this explains why A1 is not included. I'll say a bit more about why G2 is not included in a couple of slides' time. The results should extend. It's just that my techniques don't quite hit this yet. A couple of relations need to still be satisfied, need to be checked. Okay, but one thing that was important for the proof outside of the ADE case was noting that psi indicates the importance. Indicates the importance of a third quantum affine subalgebra, a diagonal subalgebra, I've called it, just because it somehow lies in between the horizontal and the vertical. And it's picked out because it's fixed by psi. And psi restricts the same sigma on this diagonal subalgebra. So it's generated just by the copy of the finite quantum group lying inside the intersection of UH and UV, together with Together with some X0M generators in the plus and minus one levels of the grading. And then some extra Cartan generator, which just sort of makes its central element C, which is that for the vertical subalgebra, times K delta, which is that for the horizontal. So it's the product of the two. Okay, so this is the initial. This is the initial result, but in fact, we're able to obtain an automorphism that extends Mickey's automorphism to all untwisted types except A1 and G2. And this comes as an immediate corollary because all we have to do is compose with the standard anti-involution of the quantum Troidel algebra. So I'll write out what it is, but really, I mean, it's ETA, it's used pretty frequently. So it Really, it's thought of as just flipping in the zero level of the grading to some extent. So H I R goes to minus C to the R H I minus R and I'll just put and so on. But yeah, notice just that the M goes to minus M and the R goes to minus R, and this is really just saying that you're flipping. Saying that you're flipping vertically in my sort of illustration. Okay, so this has sort of been touched upon a little bit, but maybe there's some more explanation that I can give. But just as a small corollary to the theorem is that the horizontal mapping of the quantum affine algebra into the quantum Troy algebra is shown to be an embedding. I suppose if you agree. I suppose if you agree that the vertical map is an embedding, which maybe requires some, which will, yeah, we can talk about this. But because of that, combined with the duality between horizontal and vertical, you would be able to deduce that the horizontal map is an embedding also. Which very much doesn't seem obvious to me because relations between generators high up and far down might have shadows a priori inside this horizontal. A priori inside this horizontal subalgebra. Okay, so I'm going to move on to how we go about proving it. But does anybody have any questions at this point? Psi eta psi psi eta psi. Uh I This is a different okay, I wouldn't want to say for sure that it cannot be obtained, but it doesn't seem obvious to me that this would be something to do. Yeah. To do. Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, how do we go about proving this theorem? Well, the first step is to define psi in the first place. So, recall our braid group action. It's not hard to see that every generator or simplified generator of the quantum Troy algebra is equal to some braid element applied to something inside this intersection of UH and UV. Of UH and UV. This is just a quick check. And moreover, elements of the horizontal subalgebra are reached with the horizontal subgroup, and elements of the vertical subalgebra are reached with the vertical subgroup. So the idea or the philosophy is to take an involution of the braid group, T, which swaps the horizontal and vertical subalgebras, and in some sense pass it across the action to obtain something which swaps the Which swaps the horizontal and vertical sub-algebras. So, and this is just defined by sending each b.z to t of b.z. Of course, there's some work to do to actually prove that this really does extend to anti-involution, but I'll leave this for the next slide. First, I just wanted to sort of discuss this T a little. So, I've illustrated the braid group on the left with both the affine. With both the affine subgroups presented in a Bernstein presentation. This doesn't lead to any kind of nice presentation for the entire group, but what it does do is allow you to define t very easily. So all it does is it exchanges corresponding elements of the vertical and horizontal lattices and inverts T1 to Tn. Okay, so we have this nice involution. And maybe there's a slight subtlety that I'm So, there's a slight subtlety that I'm kind of skating over, which is that technically we use an alternative Bernstein presentation for the horizontal subgroup, but this is not so important, so I won't dwell on this. But it's worth pointing out that T descends to the double affine Hecke algebra, or the extended double affine Hecke algebra. And I believe that what you get when you descend is either exactly or essentially the same as the duality for double affine Heck algebra. The duality for double affine Heck algebras that was used by Chrednik to prove the McDonald evaluation conjectures. So, in some sense, you can kind of see our anti-involution psi as a quantum analogue of this in some way. Okay, but I'm a little hazy on that side of it. So, it's just a philosophy. Okay, so how do we actually go about proving that our definition of psi extends to an anti-involution? The rough idea The rough idea is that by construction, it's pretty easy to show that if a relation lies entirely inside the horizontal subalgebra or entirely inside the vertical or entirely inside the diagonal subalgebra, then it's preserved by psi. So this gives you a bunch of relations almost for free with very little work. And then the idea is to you apply elements of the raid group and then you can reach the rest. And then you verify that this is at least an anti-homomomorphism. Verified that this is at least an anti-homomorphism, and it's clear that it becomes an anti-involution. So, maybe for time reasons, I won't explain that first bullet point, but this is like the rough idea. Okay, so the reason why type G2 is not included in our proof is that So I sort of said that you get things in, you know, relations in UH, UV, and UD for free-ish. And then to get the rest, you apply some of these y betas. And the thing about type G2 is that the finite co-wait lattice, when it embeds at level zero inside the affine co-wait lattice, At level zero inside the affine coate lattice, it's not large enough in some sense. It doesn't see enough, and so you don't have enough of these y betas to get all the remaining relations. Okay. So it's worth mentioning that in my paper, I first just addressed the ADE case, and it's only in the thesis that I extend to untwisted A through F. And the way that, or the two key ingredients for doing this were, firstly, realizing the importance of the diagonal subalgebra. Diagonal subalgebra. And secondly, an understanding due to Jon Sahi and also maybe Churednik of the Braid group as a quotient of a Cochster group. So these double affine Braid groups and extended double affine Braid groups are not Coxster groups themselves, but they are shown to occur as nice quotients of Coxer groups. And maybe let me outline how this is done, because it would be interesting to get something analogous in the Analogous in the quantum setting for quantum Troid algebras. So, okay, so what you do, and I'll do this with type D as an example, is you take the affine Dinkin diagram and then you replace the affine node with three affine nodes. You connect them to the rest of the diagram in the same way and to each other with four arrows. Okay. So this is called a triple diagram sometimes. You take the braid group of this, and note that in the braid group, you have three copies of the affine braid group, one for each of these nodes, and they're all, you know, they're not tied together in any way, right? They don't satisfy any relations. Any way, right? They don't satisfy any relations with each other at the affine nodes. But to do this, you quotient by one single relation, except in type CN, where you have to quotient by something else, but that's not important. So I'll explain what this is. So what this is saying is just that the product of the The product of the three affine generators times by Ts theta, which is S theta is this reflection in the highest root, is equal to one. And it's not so important what this is really saying, but it ties this together. And this gives you a presentation of the double affine braid group. And then, if you want to get the extended thing, you just tensor product with, or semi-direct product, sorry, with two copies of the outer automorphism group. Automorphism group. So maybe we'll label these one, two, and three. And then it's worth noting: you know, how does this, how do we see the familiar diagrams that we have on the board for these brave groups? How do we see these inside this presentation? How do we see the horizontal subgroup, for example? Well, this is really the horizontal subgroup corresponds to just the affine subgroup corresponding to the first affine. Affine subgroup corresponding to the first affine node. Okay. The vertical subgroup corresponds to the same thing, but for the third affine node. And then by looking at the second affine node, we see a third affine subgroup, which is the diagonal subgroup, which really corresponds to the diagonal subalgebra. To the diagonal sub-algebra that we defined before. So it preserves it under our braid group action, restricting to just the normal affine action. I think this presentation is interesting because it'd be nice to get something like this, but maybe, well, some sort of Drimfo-Jimbo-style presentation for a quantum toroidal algebra, if this is possible, some nice-ish quotient of a quantum group, because it might make clear some sort of symmetries. Some sort of symmetries that we're already seeing. So this presentation really makes clear the horizontal-vertical symmetry as just exchanging the first and third affine nodes. So you can really see some nice stuff in this presentation. And it really feels like you should be able to get something in the quantum setting. So if anyone is interested in this, please do come and chat to me. Okay. So, okay. So okay, that's fine. So let's maybe say that again. The reason for the four arrows is just because I suppose it's in standard note or common notation, it just means that before you quotient, you have no relations between the corresponding affine generators. So I don't know what, maybe people use different notations. Different notation, but this is the one in Jon Sahi's book. But it's that they sort of, yeah, if you have things connected by four arrows, then if you have T1 and T2, these satisfy no relations, and that's what they want. Yeah, any other questions? Okay, so I wanted to discuss some representation theoretic. Discuss some representation theoretic applications of this work so far. So, this is very much work in progress at this stage and things that I'm currently working on. So, recall that this loop triangular decomposition in the standard way leads to ideas of loop Verma modules and their unique irreducible quotients. And then there's a classification of the integrable ones by Drumfeld polynomials. So, this extends results. So, this extends results of Chari Presley in the Affine case and in Type A, it's due to Mickey, but then in general, it's been proven by Hernandez. On the other hand, we have this topological co-product, delta V, landing in a completion of the tensor square, and dependent on this parameter v. And I've included an example expression on the slide. I've lost the use of this laser point. Ah, okay, fine. So, yeah, so some version of. Yeah, so some version of this was introduced by Drimfeld in type A, and then, as I mentioned before, Damiani proved it in full generality earlier this year in a paper, which is not on the archive, but is on the journal website. The issue is that, at least as far as I understand it, this delta V does not, in general, produce well-defined tensor products for these loop highest weight modules. Of course, if you specialize the parameter in certain cases, you can, but I thought that in general you could not. That in general, you could not. So, yeah. On the ah, uh, okay, so delta V on the cartan does not act so. Yeah. Okay, so I guess maybe that's cleared up. Yeah, I mean, I really think of some of this issue as being that delta v is kind of infinite in the vertical direction, which you see by there being infinitely many of these x i m minus l pluses in this sum. But also loop high sweight representations are sort of also infinite in the vertical direction in the sense that infinitely many of these x i m. Of these xim plus things could act by a non-zero element on some vector. So, my proposed solution is to instead twist this topological co-product by our horizontal-vertical symmetry psi, and then you get a different coproduct, but I've checked that this does, in fact, define always an integrable module structure on tensor products of loop heist weight representation. On tensor products of loop heist weight representations. And there's no specialization of V that you need to have. So, this is what I've done so far. The next steps would be, well, to show that this module is not only integrable, but is also highest weight and loop highest weight and irreducible. And maybe that the Drimfeld polynomials are the product of those for its factors. And then study R matrices satisfying the Yang-Baxter equation on these. And these first three. On these. And these first three steps have been done in type A by Mickey using his automorphism. So now that we have this duality, we should be able to extend this treatment to a more general setting. And then this is maybe more of a further away thing, but if you get R matrices, you perhaps open up the opportunity to explore some Shaval dualities in the style of Kang, Kashuara, Kim, and O. I mean, this would have to be to some sort of affanized chaos. Be to some sort of affinized KLR algebra, affinized quiverheck algebra using the R matrices, maybe just in simply this case. But this is more of a pipe dream at this stage, I think. And this would, of course, be distinct from the Varaniola-Vassaro Chauval duality in type A with the double affine Hecker algebra. Okay, so I have maybe five minutes. So, I sort of promised that I would talk about congruence group actions. So, let me, there's a bit more on this slide, so I apologize for this. I'll try and take us through it. So, this is one sort of final result from this work in my thesis. But recall that we have these three affine objects inside the double affine thing. So, we have the horizontal, the diagonal, and the vertical. Okay, we have this on. Diagonal and the vertical. Okay, and we have this on both sides and they correspond to each other under our brave group action. In untwisted types, the congruence group is the central extension of SL2Z. Another way of thinking about this is just as the braid group of type A2 or the braid group on three strands. So SL2Z Generated by two elements subject to the braid relation ABA equals B A B. Okay. And Chrednik in Untwisted Types, I think, and then Jon Sahi in All Types, Twisted and Untwisted, showed that congruence groups act on the brave group side. group side. So one of the generators A, as you see in the top left diagram, sort of moves the or sends the horizontal subgroup to the diagonal and fixes the vertical. And then the other one, the other generator B, sends the diagonal to the vertical and fixes the horizontal. Okay, and then these become an action of this SL2Z central extension. We've already discussed taking T, the involution, and passing it across to get psi. And so And so, by the construction, it's sort of, I guess it's not surprising this proposition that T and Psi satisfy some sort of compatibility with regards to our braid group action. But actually, you can also show that A and B also satisfy compatibility with some appropriate automorphisms of the quantum Troy algebra. So, A, which is sort of this like moving up and down on the left, corresponds to just this chi-zero inverse, which just moves generators at vertex zero up and down. Just moves generators at vertex zero up and down the grading. And B relates to the twist of chi zero by Psi. Okay, and then you can deduce from this a quantum analog of Jonsahi's congruence group action. So the congruence group acts on the quantum Troidal algebra in all of these untwisted types, except G2, right? And I suppose because of the compatibility with our braid group action, Because of the compatibility with our braid group action, you can combine the braid group action with this SL2Z action into a semi-direct product, which has some nice description, which I won't cover for time reasons. And then also you can extend to GL by including our anti-involution psi. So maybe let me just finish with a couple of rough questions, in addition to what I've sort of said before. So this Yon Sahi. So, this Yonsahi Costa style presentation, involution T, and the congruence group action, they all extend to twisted types also. So, can we similarly extend our treatment, the horizontal vertical symmetries, and so on, to twisted quantum troid algebras in some appropriate way? And then I'd also be interested to see if we can understand, or I think maybe people would know about this already in the audience, but can we understand? In the audience, but can we understand either our duality with psi or the Mickey automorphism or this SL2Z action? Can we understand them in a geometric setting, maybe with equivariant K-theory and quiver variety realization due to Makajima, or maybe in a more physics direction? Okay, there's more I could say, but I think I'll leave it there.
