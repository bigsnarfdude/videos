Okay, so thanks for having me. And I'm going to talk about the evolution of spike proteins. As we realized about an hour ago, you should still be thinking about spike proteins and their evolution. They're not out of the forest yet. So, yeah, I decided not to talk to Deg about the work I've done. About the work I've done on the universal flu vaccine. I can tell you about this offline, but I'll talk a bit about something which connects timely more to what we've been hearing, which has to do with the geometry and how it relates to evolution. Okay, so first of all, let's remind ourselves what are the players in the system. So we start by talking about the influenza virus. Talk about the influenza virus. This is the influenza virus, so it is schematic of the virus. And you can see that on the surface of the virus, there are those blue protrusions, right? Those are called spikes. And our virus uses the spike to bind and penetrate the host cell. The spike of the influenza virus is called hemoglutiny or HA, and I will use those terms. Those terms throughout the talk. The spike of the coronavirus is called the S-protein. So different viruses have different spikes. So an antigen is a foreign molecule that elicits some immune response. That's another important term. Now, what you see here on the upper right, that's an antibody. And antibody has two arms, both of those. Arms. Both of those arms can bind specifically to some oracle, an antigen. The distance between the arms is approximately 50 nanometers. Just for you to have an idea of the scale that we are working with here. What you see here are two antibodies that are bound to our spike protein, hemagglutinin. Now, hemagglutinin is a trimer, and that's actually. And that's actually common for all spikes. We have those three units, and what you see here is that this antibody is bound at this side with a characteristic binding energy, the green side, and the other antibody binds to another location with another binding energy, which is purple. So the location where the antibody is bound is called an antitope. This bound is called an epitome. And every antibody bounds potentially at a different algorithm. Okay? Let's continue. So let's take a closer look at hemagglutin. Roughly, we said we can split it to two regions, the head and the stem. And the color coding here of the different residue is indicative of how. Indicative of how variable those are. So you can see that red ones are highly variable, and indeed you can notice probably that the head is more variable than the stem. Okay, so not only that, we also know that the head attracts more immune response compared to the stem. So this phenomena of having more Of having more antibodies acting against you is called immunodominance. So we say that the head is more immunodominant than the STEM. And this is actually a problem generally when we think about vaccination, because those areas, they don't mutate as much. So ideally, you would want to attack them. Then the virus cannot mutate and escape. That's not what is naturally happening. The virus actually takes advantage of the fact that. Takes advantage of the fact that the head attracts more immune response, you know, as you can see with antibodies, and that makes it easier for it to escape. Okay, so what I was interested in is see if we can come up with a rational way to define and potentially even compute immunodominance. I can tell you that defining B-cell immunodominance. Defining B-cell immunodominance, that is the one related to antibodies, is one of the most important and open questions in immunology. I just don't have a way to estimate or to compute which areas of an antigen will be more immunodominant. If we were able to do that, as I just mentioned, we would be able to potentially manipulate the immune response through the area that are more concerned. So finally, So finally, I will argue that potentially we can predict the mutability if we had access to the immunodominance profile of a person. So people have thought about it in the community for a while. They come up with various factors that might contribute to immunodominance. One would be the initial number of those different antibodies targeting different epitopes. And if we jump to the end, And if we jump to the end, people have spoken about anti-chain accessibility before. That's actually the last element, is what I'll show you that we can potentially imagine. Okay, so to do that, I'm going to introduce a coarse-grain model of an antibody. Something very, very simple. That's what it looks like. We have the center part, and we have this is an arm, and this is an arm, and those And those yellow tips, this is what will connect to our epitops tube. And I constructed it such that the average distance between the two tips is again approximately 15 nanometers. So it more or less represents the physical dimensions of an arm. Next, you see here the post-grain model of hemoglutiny, where every Where every one of those bits is a surface residue, and I'm going to define each and every one of those bits as an epitope. So an epitope is just one residue to which the TPU can bind. So when I think about this problem, I'm going to have one antibody that affects this part, another antibody that affects this part. So we'll have as many different antibodies as we have. Antibodies as we have epitopes or surface residues in this coarse brain model. So, what I show you here is a simplified coarse-brain model of a virus. You can see that the spikes are organized around a sphere at a density which corresponds to the density of that we see in a in the influenza virus. And now I'm just running an inference passage time simulation. Passage time simulation where I'm asking how long it takes for one for either of my arm to find its respective epitope. And we do it many, many times. And from this, we can compute the ON rate. So this would be the ON rate for the first arm to find its target, to find its habitat. And I superimpose the results of all those simulations on the structure of the spike. Of the spine. So the color here corresponds to the ombre. So you can see that the head is white-red, while when we go down along the main axis of the spine, we have residues, the on-rate of the antibody to them is lower. And this is simply because it's more difficult for an antibody to penetrate deep into the basis of the spike and find its respective. Respective resonance. Now, all that I have here in this simulation are Leonard Jones interaction between different bits of our antibody and the spike. The spikes themselves, they don't move, and we do allow the antibody to sort of oscillate as we expect from what we know about the biophysics of those particles. Okay, so far we discussed how to construct the rate, so some proxy for the rate of an antibody to target different parts. And now let's use some data. So we went and looked for sequences of the seasonal flow H1N1. And what I've done was to compute the entropy of residue at position J. Residue at position J. So we compute the entropy of all residues along the linear sequence of the protein. So intuitively, it just means that positions where the entropy of the residue is zero are highly conserved. And locations such as this one where the entropy value is large mutate a lot. This is just by summing up over the probabilities that our Probabilities that are observed within the sequence of the star. Okay, so now what we are doing is superimposing this entropy map, which is proportional to the mutability of our protein, on top of the structure of the spike, where areas that are in cyan are areas that are highly variable, while areas that are deep purple are very The purple are very uncertain. So you can see an interesting pattern that emerges. And what I'm doing here is just to show you the result of the previous simulation, just changing the color coding. Again, areas that are in cyan are areas to which the on rate is very high. And here I also show you the result of what would happen if we were just to simulate. If we were just to simulate the interaction between our antibody model and the spy, but only using a single trimer. So the way that the antibody sees the trimer is very different, right? Because it can easily approach the base of the stem and interact with it. And as a result, we don't have this gradient of colors that we observe here. You can see how different those maps are. So, what I'm showing you here on the left, this is coming from the simulation. On the right, this is coming just from the sequence data. And just eyeballing it, not doing any analysis, you can already see that there is a high degree of similarity between those two maps. So, you see, for example, those areas, those protrusions here at the top, we have high on rate against them, and at the same time, they are highly variable. Time they are highly variable, and we also see that the further we go down, the spike the area those residues are both more conserved and the affinity to them, at the on-rate to them by their respective antibody is lower. And so, what I argue is that using geometry alone, we could explain the variability of the spike to the first hole. So, next, I wanted to quantify to. So, next, I wanted to quantify it a bit better. So, what I've done was take my residues on the surface that are sort of on top of the spike and use a diffusion app transformation that would allow me to better cluster them. And then I've just done a simple clustering method, k-means for a various number of clusters chosen. This would allow. And this would allow us to actually compare between those two maps in a quantitative way. So, again, what we have here on the x-axis, this is coming from the simulation and is proportional to the average on rate to residues within a cluster of residues. What we have here on the y-axis, this is the peptocluster entropy. Again, just an average of the entropy of all the residues inside, and you can see that. And you can see that the correlation between the two is actually quite good. It's 0.82. Many of them do fall on this linear line. So I cover here different residues of interest. And what we have here on the bottom, for example, those are residues that are highly conserved. And you can see that they are highly conserved because their entropy is very low. Because their entropy is very low, and also the on-ray to them is very low. And the different dots with different colors, those are known as the antigenic site on influenza. And those are areas that are highly targeted by antibodies. So again, we could make the claim here that the average antibody pressure is what drives to a large extent the immutability of HF. So we can. So, we can, in essence, describe this phase diagram in the following way. If we see residues that fall on this line, it suggests that the mutability is due to antibody pressure. If we are below the line, so I'm a residue that is more conserved than what I would expect if I were just mutating due to anti-body pressure, and residues above the line may have mutation without the. May have mutation due to fluctuations, for example, escape from T cells, or a bunch of other reasons why the residue might be there. Additionally, what I wanted to show you is that if we compare between the on-rate maps that we got from the trimer with the one that we got from the variable representation, that the correlation to the entropy map. Correlation to the entropy map will always be higher for the one coming from the virus representation. And this suggests that based on comparison of those simulations to sequence data, we can actually understand what is the context at which our spike protein is interacting with our immune system in vivo, right? Essentially, it means that our immune system antibodies never see the trimer alone in a way that. The trimer along in a way that would drive evolution. Okay, so now I'm going to briefly go through what we've done for the mutability of the coronavirus. And I've done it pretty early in the pandemic, so I don't really have to tell you about that. You can know that well. What I have done was rather than taking many sequences of SARS-CoV-2, Of SARS-CoV-2, because early in the pandemic, there were not that many. I took different sequences from different hosts, so from bats and from tanglins, and pretty much all I could find, including SARS-CoV-1. And together we can just align them and try to compute the sequence residue entropy in the same way that we did before, but right now it's for the whole sub-family. Right now, it's for the whole subfamily of coronaviruses. Okay, so again, we get this symbol set. Again, we superimpose it on the structure of the protein. And the next thing was to create this cost-brain molecular dynamic simulation of the virus. And actually, the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was. Spike protein was crystallized a few months after the beginning of the pandemic. So I took advantage of that to create this model of the virus. And again, we play the same game of trying to estimate the on-rates of our antibody model to different residues along the S-protein. You can see for yourself that when we compare what is coming from the simulation. What is coming from the simulation to what is coming from the mutability map, just eye-bodying it, this looks quite similar, right? Again, we have those protrusions that are signed here and here, and we see that when we go down the main axis of the spike, we are both more conserved, and antibody affinity to those area is lower. So, what again, we could say that to the first order we have. Can say that to the first order, we actually explain the variability that we observe using those simple functions. And in a similar fashion, we can actually compare between those two maps. And here we get correlation coefficient, which is not as high, about 0.7, but still pretty decent, which suggests that potentially the average polycronal antibody pressure on the spike led to the speciation of this coronavirus spike. Coronavirus function. So, I also wanted to see if I can predict which residues are going to escape due to antibody pressure once we were sick with this virus. And so, based on the simulations, those were my predictions. So, areas in red or areas that I predicted would have high on-grade thoughts there, which would suggest that they might want to mutate. To mutate because of antibody pressure. And indeed, those areas in red are ones that were identified, that mutation were identified to confer antibody screen. But, you know, the obvious ones was not as successful. Okay, so far, we talked about the fold problem, right? We start from the structure. Problem, right? We start from the structure, we have this model, and we want to predict the mutability from it. Now, let's try to go the other way. We just start from the mutability, and we want to use some model-free approach to analyze mutability. And since we recognize the geometry is important, so maybe we can tease out different geometrical elements as contributes different to metabolism. Different to metabol. So I'm going to use approaches that we actually heard a lot about in those last couple of days. In particular, one approach to do a shape analysis, shape comparison that was described in this paper. And the first thing that we do is we take our protein and we give it some discrete representation. Representation: We just create a triangular representation of our spine. So, next, what I've done was to solve the discrete Laplace-Metroni operator on the surface of our spike protein. And what this gives us is a set of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. And the first one is obviously a constant one with a corresponding eigenvalue of zero. The next one. Value of zero. The next one, which difference from quantum is what I'm showing you here, and you see that it describes variability along the main axis of the spike, but this is that highest value and sort of go and down there. That's what it looks like when we look at the next six eigenfunctions. And you can see that each of them represents a different scale of Of different scale of the function on the spike as one would expect when we're doing this disanasis. So one question is how to relate those different components to something physical. And so the lambdas, the eigenvalues, they actually have units of one over a meter squared, right? Square, right? So they tell us something about the important length scale of this eigenfunction. And we can just compute it just by inverting it. And you can see that the larger the eigenvalue, broadly speaking, the smaller is the characteristic scales which has been described. And for the first eigenvalue, we can see that it describes a length scale of around 100 nanometers, which is again the length. Nanomoto, which is again the land scale of the whole spike, that's more or less the size of the spark. Okay, so what we're going to do next is take the mutability map, same mutability map you saw before by different colors, and decompose it according to the eigenvalues that we have found. The psi are just the eigenfunctions. But these are what you don't have an analytical form at all. I don't have an analytical form. Form. I don't have an analytical form. However, I can just find it numerically, right? I have the value of my eigenfunction on each node in the mesh, and I know what is the value of the mutability of my scalar function on the surface of the spy. And I just can numerically integrate it to find what is the value of those components AI. Right? That's what I have done. And what you see here is the transformation according to this basis. And this is actually just the spectrum of the mutability map on this surface. Maybe then rather than writing the integral, I'll think of the summation. Yeah, I just wrote an integraph, but it's just a notation. It's just a notation. It's effectively a numerical integration procedure, right? Yes. Do you have a sense of how well you reconstruct the signal as a function of how many modes? So if you're using all the modes, then it would be perfect reconstruction, right? Well, I don't think so. You have some data that you measure. have these modes that you extract from your mesh. There is no guarantee that using all the modes you can reconstruct them. This is like doing a discrete Fourier transform. There's no difference between this and the discrete Fourier transform. If you use infinite nodes, yes. The discrete Fourier transform. When you decompose a function using a discrete Fourier transform, so you can then reconstruct it. So, you can then reconstruct a practical. It's the same thing. You can do the 2D discrete forecast or 3D discrete frame, so it doesn't matter, right? And here, I'm just on this middle shape, but again, in principle, it's the same thing. And here, you're going to use all the modes. So, well, hang on. Okay, so the next thing I'm going to do, okay, one thing that I forgot to. Do okay, one thing that I forgot to say. So, all in all, we would eventually expect to see the spectrum decays, right? This is usually what we observe when we deconstruct pretty much every function, right? However, there are a few interesting things. So, we see a peak here, we see a peak here. And so, I was curious to understand what is this doing here. So, obviously, the first one has to do with this very basic property that we talked about already several times, which is the fact that when Time, which is the fact that when we go from the top of the spike to the bottom of the spike, we see that overall the mutability goes down, right? Which we understood is just due to the high density of our spikes on our vice capture. So this is really captured by the first mode. So yeah, at any case, as I said, I was curious what is going on. So what I decided to do is just think about it like applying before. It like applying a filter, right? Because we already have the spectrum. So I'm sure you all know this, but just to remind you, a bandpass filter is one that only passes components at a narrow region of frequencies, right? So essentially what I'm doing here is applying a geometrical filter on my data. Zooming in a bit, these are the modes I want to take out. Taken out, and those modes are their indexes of between 30 and 65, which allow us to compute the characteristic length scale for those modes, which is between 5 and 7 nanometer. And the question is to what this length scale actually corresponds to. Here, what you see is the full reconstruction of the mutability map using all the modes. Here, what you see here. Modes here, what is here on the right, is what we get when we apply the geometrical bandpass filter, only what is happening between components 30 and 65. And what we also know is that the footprint of an antibody, so antibody actually is not the tip of the antibody, it's not like one dot, but it has a footprint, is on the order of the same mass scale. So, I actually mentioned those before. There are five known antigenic sites where most of the mutations that are due to escape from antibody pressure occur on the influenza virus. And those are colored here. It's called SA, SB, CA1, CA2, and CB. They were actually found in the 70s, quite a while ago. Now, those are all of them. Now those are all of them. I just colored them. And here on the bottom right, I just sort of put them all together on the surface of the spec that would allow you to compare to our filtered mutability map. So here is the whole mutability map. Here is what we get when we apply the band mass filter. And this is what we get when we just merit all the actogenic sites. Merge all diatogenic sites together, and I'm not going to bother do any quantitative comparison, but again, eyeballing it, you can just see that potentially what we are catching is all those antigenic sites. So, really the conclusion here is that there might be geometrical properties of a protein that can be mapped to some evolutionary constraints that are acting on it. Constraints that are acting on it, and using such a method is one way to disentangle them. So, what we could do potentially is apply now a bent stop filter to those components, and then what we are left with is mutation due to other reasons, other components. So, that's sort of one way to think about mutability of evolution of proteins. So, that's pretty much it. This is the Pretty much it. This is the acknowledgement slide. I've done most of this work while I was still at MIT. And this is the summary. I'll open the bed to open questions. So have you thought about how adding to a second order you could take into account the conformational hydrogenity of this type or? Heterogeneity of the style or license shifting, you know, all these other processes that can affect the lighting? Yeah, actually, one thing I have done, but I don't have time to show it here, is that I try to deconstruct the mutability map using different conformation of different proteins. It's actually very interesting because you are getting different spectrum, and you know, those different spectrum they mean different things. So this is one. This is one interesting thing to try to compare this spectrum when we disentangle it in different conformations. The glycan shield? Glycan shield, so you know we can disentangle the antibody evasion and then potentially go steal with the glycan shield. But no, I did not try to incorporate the glycan shield to the structure. So to what extent does the uh geometry or the anti-body matter? Determining what geometry is important for? important one? Um I tried playing with it a bit, but uh overall because the um because this is extremely computationally heavy, these are an inface passage time problem, it's tough to properly examine this. I would say that the on-rate for the first arm probably doesn't depend too much on the properties of the anti-body. What is important, sort of, the average size to get access to plister. to get uh access to the steric uh effect. Yeah. So you showed you could decompose an immutability map onto the past version reality basis. Did you also try your antigenic sites that you should have the same basis function allowing these relations that are just using bypass relative to this button? Yeah, so the information I have. Yeah, so the information I have for the artigenic site, I don't have sort of a scalar field for them, it's more zero or one. So, but it's a good idea actually if I have more high-resolution information, but it's another scalar field that I can decompose. Have you ever tried to because it's a kind of generic approach, you could apply it to different spikes. Have you data you could use to I didn't show this, but I also applied it to both S protein, but also use the spike of HLV. Use the spike of HIV, GP120. Actually, it works very nicely with the spike of HIV. Another trimer, and again, you also see something which is reminiscent of those interesting components in the spectrum, which I suspect may have to do with escape from antibody, but again, of the HIV spike. So, I think, in principle, this should be applied to. This should be applied to any spike and potentially also for non-spike proteins because geometry might be interesting in the evolution of other proteins. I can think of multiple reasons why this could be the case. So maybe for the spectrum that you have, the modes where you see those patterns are always the same. Yeah, so so exact here the challenge is uh Is how do I characterize my eigenfunctions? Because for each structure, I'm going to have another set of eigenfunctions. So, what I've thought about so far is to use the associated length scale. That's a good measure. But maybe we want to do something more. And another idea that I had was I try to do convolution between this and like the Gaussian curvature map. And so I know what is the average curvature associated with an eigenfunction. With an eigenfunction, and then it would make sense to compare across proteins. So we just need to think more. But what are the properties that those eigenfunctions or those components represent? What do they actually capture? So now we're gonna have the student talks. They're gonna be uh shorter, but stronger face talks. Based on it. Okay, so now is a oh great.
