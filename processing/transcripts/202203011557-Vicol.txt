It's blood. It's blood. Ah, because I could confuse. No, they twitched. So the blood will be to the end. So now it's okay. So the mean. Sorry. Blood. So you are right. Can you show your screen? Share your screen? Can you share your screen? Share your screen, please? Yeah. All right, yeah, we'll see it. Do you guys see it? Yes. Awesome. So good afternoon. Uh shall we start? So um it's my pleasure to introduce Vlad Nikol, you know, who is even talking more for magnetic resistance equations. So Vlad, please. Thank you, Alexi, and thank you, Kostia, for the invitation. Happy to present this work. And this is basically a joint work with my PhD. Joint work with my PhD student, Roger Beeke, who's finishing now, and with Susan Friedlander, who a lot of you know. And today's talk is about some old equations on which we can say a little bit more, but not much more. And I hope that the talks will at least raise some interesting questions. Okay, so I guess everybody is familiar with this question. Everybody is familiar with this question. If I give you an Euler equilibrium, can it be reached by the infinite time limit of Euler? So this is in principle an open problem. We can study many Euler equilibria and we don't really know if the Euler dynamics really wants to go there. And in fact, all these works about In fact, all these works about inviscid damping show how complicated the problem is. And of course, there is a topological constraint to this, that if you give me an Euler equilibrium, it has topology. And basically, the Euler dynamics wants to move in the same topological class. And by that, I just mean that the vorticity is going to be Liad vector or vector transported. Or vector transported. So this is a classical topological constraint. But of course, we can view Euler equilibria as MHD equilibria. I've just written here ideal MHD. And if I just think of this as Euler, that I can just call u to be zero, then this equation just says that b is constant in time. If u is zero, this dies, this dies. And of course. This dies, and of course, I recover my Euler equilibrium. And this is, you know, classical. You can basically view an ideal MHD equilibrium with zero velocity as the same as an Euler equilibrium. And this is just a magnetostatic state. And it's just that the pressure has the opposite side. So, of course, you could ask the question then: well, instead of reaching the, so from here on, I will use the words Euler equilibrium. On, I will use the words Euler equilibria and magnetostatic equilibria interchangeably because they are the same. And of course, you could ask yourself: can I reach it by the MHD dynamics? And of course, that's maybe even more complicated than the Euler dynamics in many ways. But at least when you study spectral stability questions about MHD equilibria, we already know that the problem is a bit different. And by know, I mean these old. And by no, I mean these old works, which basically study eigenvalues of the linearized operator, and they discovered that essentially in the geometric optics framework, there is a difference between MHD and EU. So that's already something. And magnetic relaxation is this idea that goes back to Arnold. And here I'm referring to a 74 paper because that's the English translation. Because that's the English translation, but the paper is from the 60s, it's early 60s. And basically, going back to Arnold, the question was: okay, you know, can you reach an Euler equilibrium or a magnetostatic equilibrium by running some kind of vector transport equation? But this U doesn't necessarily have to be the U you compute from MHD. It can be just any incompressible velocity field because any incompressible Velocity field, because any incompressible velocity field you give me, this is true. So I will preserve topology. And hopefully, as time goes to infinity, I relax to a steady state. And the way Arnold, I put it here in citations, the way Arnold puts it in his paper, he basically is not looking at ideal MHD hats viscosity in the fluid equation. And he says that the magnetic field and the velocity I prescribed at initial time in the course of time. The initial time, in the course of time, the kinetic energy is dissipated because of the fluid viscosity, and the motion ceases in the end, meaning as time goes to infinity, because each particle reaches a terminal position, and the magnetic field being frozen in, which is just this, attains some terminal value. And this terminal value, of course, must be at the minimum because otherwise it would violate the fact that it's a stationary state. And this was somehow Arnold's, but the idea was. But the idea was again to use Lyadvection as a way to reach magnetostatic equilibrium. And this idea was then revisited by many authors. And here I will talk about a specific framework introduced by Keith Moffat. And basically, Moffat's idea, you could basically put it in the following words. He basically He basically wants to look at this equation and he wants to couple u to b somehow. And he's going to do it in a way that two things hold essentially. That the velocity somehow, at least formally, should go to zero at time goes to infinity because you do want to reach a magnetostatic equilibrium. And in addition, he wants the fields U and the current cross. And the current cross the magnetic field to be parallel. Moffat insists that they're literally parallel pointwise. And in this process, he basically gives up on the idea that the vector field should remain smooth because of issues that we'll see. And as time goes to infinity, you have now possibility to reach a steady state, but it's a bit subtle because Moffat discusses the idea of topological. The idea of topological accessibility, which is not the same as topological equivalence. Topological equivalence just means that you are the, sorry, a vector field B1 is topological equivalent to B0 if there is a volume preserving diffeomorphism such that B1 composed with the, it's just Liad vector basically. Topologically accessible is a weaker concept. It means that B1 is topologically accessible. B1 is topologically accessible from B0 if B1 is the limit as time goes to infinity of some vector field B that looks like that, but not for any X, just X's which are induced by a velocity field which satisfies this property, which is the correct property to satisfy if you want to have any kind of energetic meaning. Meaning. So in PDE language, the issue is about weak convergence versus strong convergence when t goes to infinity. And this already, I thought, was pretty interesting because, you know, when you have weak convergence and potentially limits drop in the weak limit, that's like a closure problem. And I thought that this is interesting for this conference. So let's talk a bit about model. So let's talk a bit about Moffat's magnetic relaxation equation, which I will abbreviate as MRE for magnetic relaxation equation. So the equation has two things only. It has the induction equation. And by the way, the induction equation, if you just naively look at the energy structure, you know, you test this with B and you integrate. And here you can integrate by parts because B is divergence-free. And you get this. So, what Moffat basically now says is that this vector is parallel to this vector. And Moffat's going to do so by simply imposing that u is exactly equal to the solenoidal part of this vector. So, that's what Moffat did, and this was revisited due to analogies with optimal transport by Brenier in 2014. This is basically an ad hoc choice. You just make the choice. And if you do this choice, of course, then U dotted with this simply becomes the L2 norm of U. And you do see that you have a very favorable energetic structure. And this is what looks like a diffusion equation, but it preserves topology. So it's like a topological diffusion. Fusion. So, to sum it up, the MRE equation proposed by Moffat is this equation coupled with this equation and this equation. And you see that something is a bit weird here because this is like a Darcy approximation of the momentum equation. And that's kind of weird. There's no magnetic field in a porous medium. So, of course, if you think about it, So, of course, if you think about it, what Arnold was suggesting is more akin to an infinite Prandtl limit, because Arnold really wanted to see viscosity. So more in line with Arnold's proposal would be to not put Darcy friction, but more like a Stopes friction, which is like an infinite Prandtl-Lamber limit, which we can discuss whether that makes any sense also. But the point I'm trying to make is that both this model and this model have the same property. They have a good energy structure and they preserve the topology of magnetic field lines. So in fact, I want to treat both of these models at the same time. I don't want to treat them separately. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put any kind of regularization parameter there, and I'm going to call the parameter. There and I'm going to call the power gamma. Gamma is zero is Moffat, and gamma is one is more like a infinite Prandtl number. And you can treat, maybe because of numerical methods reasons, any other gamma. Now, if we want to discuss, of course, magnetic relaxation, first of all, we need to talk about solutions which are globally defined in time. Which are globally defined in time. This happens when time goes to infinity. So if you stare at this equation, you may think about it, and very quickly you realize that, whoa, this equation, it's kind of not easy to prove local existence even, not even to say global existence. And in fact, the first time I've heard about this equation was in a talk by Brenier, who was speaking about this. And he basically said that not even local existence was known. Was known. So let's look at the formal properties of the magnetic relaxation equation. You preserve topology. Also, of course, you automatically preserve magnetic helicity automatically. You have a beautiful energy structure because of the choice. So here you make U is, well, sorry, you replace this one with minus Laplacian to the gamma of U minus gradient pressure. U minus gradient pressure. The gradient pressure dies when integrated against u, and it just you recover your h-gamma norm. So, this is this is why it's a diffusion type problem. And the steady states, and that's the beautiful thing, are only magnetostatic equilibria. So the steady states of the MRE equation must be magnetostatic equilibria, because obviously, if you want to be at an equilibrium, sorry about shuffling, then u must be zero, because if you Then u must be zero, because if u is not zero, then again, sorry for shorts. If u doesn't go to zero, then you can't be at a steady state. And if u is zero, well, it means this is a pressure gradient, so you have reached a magnetostatic equilibrium. So we have this model, and okay, we need to ask ourselves these beautiful formal properties. Can we say anything rigorous about them? Of course, maybe you don't want to say anything rigorous, you just maybe want to put this on a computer and. Want to put this on a computer and simulate and compute Euler equilibria with a given linking number that you prescribe in advance. That would be another thing. But I'm unfortunately a pure mathematician, so I want to prove some theorems about this. So I want to say the two results that were known about this work. So for gamma is zero, Brenier, again, using analogy. Again, using analogies with optimal transport, constructed the notion of like Lyon's dissipative solution. So these are these measure-valued solutions, and they have a weak, strong property. But of course, they can only work in 2D. And we all know that these are not even distributional solutions. And there was one more work known, actually, at the same time of Pfefferman and collaborators who Collaborators who considered the infinite Prandtl number version of this, so gamma is one, and they proved local existence of strong solutions. But of course, if you want to talk about monetary relaxation, you need to talk about global existence. All right. So, okay. The first theorem that we did is the obvious one. No matter what this gamma is, the equation is locally well. The equation is locally well posed. Okay, no surprise. So the system is actually not so bad. It's a locally well-posed system. You're given HS data, you can solve it for this much time, at least. So it's not so bad. The proof is a bit more subtle than Euler, let's say, because you need to discover a double commutator structure. So if you basically want to compute the HS. So, if you basically want to compute the hs norm, normally you would basically do an integral of b against minus Laplacian to the s of b, and I'm calling this lambda to be squared of the Laplacian. So you need to discover that there's basically two commutators happening at the same time. There's a commutator with b dot grad and one with u dot grad. And in Euler, you only have one of them. And this is maybe why at first this equation seemed like it's complicated. But once you discover this double commutator structure, it's actually not so. Commutator structure, it's actually not so complicated, and then you do your usual Katoponce commutators and then you close. Okay, I'm not even going to bother you with this. It's just silly. It's writing this equal sign that takes something. Okay, so the equation is locally well posed. Can we say anything about global existence? So, by the way, the local existence theorem was for any gamma. Was for any gamma. It doesn't matter which one gamma is. Yes, we can prove a global existence theorem, but only if gamma is this big. So if you take a gamma which is this big, then I can speak global in-time solutions, but I can only obtain a horrific bound on them. So the bound goes like e to. So the bound goes like e to the e to the t to the one-half. So obviously, this is not very good, but at least in this case, we know that we have global in-time solutions, so we can ask ourselves about the question of magnetic relaxation. So, by the way, as I wanted to emphasize that for global will posedness, we need to take this gamma large, but for local will positness, it can be anything. Plusness, it can be anything. By the way, probably some of you have already asked yourself, why do I bother with strong solutions? Why can't I just somehow look at weak solutions? Maybe those are easier to define globally in time. This was actually the project I gave Raj, one of my PhD students, to work on. I wanted him to do context integration for. I wanted him to do convex integration for this MRE equation and so construct globally in time-weak solutions. But it doesn't work. This idea of a convex integration scheme simply does not seem to work for this equation. Okay, the proof of global existence is just one slide. I'm not going to bother you with details. You basically have to do a couple of things. Once you have local existence, you want the continuation criterion. Continuation criterion. This is the usual Euler continuation criterion. And then you have the piece from the magnetic field. You notice the square there, which is important. You look at your energy identity. And this is the place where large gamma enters. Large gamma enters because if gamma is large enough, H gamma controls the Lipschitz norm. So my continuation criterion. So, my continuation criterion for velocity is automatically satisfied from the energy inequality. This is the only trick in this proof. So you basically, because of the energy inequality and this condition, this is check. And of course, now you have to verify that the gradient of the magnetic field squared is also time integrable. So you do that. I mean, the first thing you try is you just write down the equation. Is you just write down the equation for the gradient square. And it satisfies this equation. And you notice that if this term wasn't here, you're already done, because Cronwald says that as long as the integral of gradient U is bounded, you're done. But okay, this term is here. So you need to control B and the Hessian of U. B you control because it's frozen in. So you automatically get just by. So, you automatically get just by vector transport bound for b and the bound from the Hessian of U, you just get because you have an equation for u, and in fact, the Hessian of U in L infinity is bounded by B in L infinity's growth. And that's the proof of global existence. So, it's kind of obvious. Of course, the interesting question that we started this talk with is what happens for these globally undefined solutions when T goes to infinity? When t goes to infinity. First question: does u go to zero? The answer is yes, you can prove that. Of course, if you just have the time integral of something squared, this comes from the energy. This by itself being finite, it does not mean that u goes to zero, right? Not all integrable functions go to zero. You must control their time oscillations. And, okay, you do some. And okay, you do some little analysis, and you can compute that the time oscillations are actually also bounded. So, out of these two, you can do a bit of analysis massaging, and actually you can prove not just that u goes to zero, but the gradient of u also goes to zero. By the way, everything was on a torus, zero mean, so bonkaré holds. So, this is pretty, you know, pretty good. I've managed to do one of the goals. In order to reach a magnetostatic equilibrium, I first should prove that you go. Static equilibrium, I first should prove that u goes to zero. But then I also need to prove one more thing. I need to prove that B converges to some kind of B bar, and B bar needs to solve this equation. Otherwise, I'm not done. So it's very tempted to think that because you have this, you reach a magnetostatic equilibrium. Magnetostatic equilibrium. And in fact, the proof itself shows, because this is actually U, right? Or some kind of Laplacian to the gamma of U, I'm sorry. This actually does go to zero. So it's kind of weird. When we try to prove existence of weak solutions for 3D Euler, this is the thing we cannot prove goes to zero because of possible concentrations, right? Depernamaida, et cetera. But here you have it for free. But here you have it for free. So, are you done? And the answer is: no, you are unfortunately not done. I am not able to prove relaxation. Let me give you somehow a sketch of the enemy. Take a sequence of times that goes to infinity. So call Bn to be the value of the magnetic field at these sequence of times. Now, because of the energy inequality, the L2 norms are decreasing. The L2 norms are decreasing, so automatically you have a weak, weakly convergent sub-sequence. So you do know that along it, some sub-sequence at least, you do converge weakly to something. It's easy to check that this something is divergence-free. So the only thing you have to check is, does this something solve b bar dot grad b bar is pressure gradient? Well, okay. Can first of all First of all, we should ask ourselves: can we upgrade this weak convergence to strong convergence? Well, you know, these energies are positive numbers and they're decreasing. If you have a sequence of decreasing positive numbers, they converge to something. So actually, the energies of these B's do converge to something. And in fact, this limit point is greater than the initial magnetic helicity because. Initial magnetic helicity, because again, magnetic helicity is conserved, and you have the Arnold inequality, which bounds from below the magnetic energy by the magnetic helicity. So, in addition, we know that you don't go to zero. So this is a non-trivial state. If you wanted to know strong convergence, of course, you should know that the L2 norm of this weak limit is E bar. But I don't know how to prove that. Another way to pose the same enemy. Pose the same enemy is this. How could I potentially try to show that the Lara projector of this is zero? Well, what I could possibly do is I could add and subtract the n's. So I just add and subtract. Okay. This term converges weakly to zero. It's tested against a stationary guy. So this converges to zero. Fine. This converges weakly to zero against a guy. Converges weakly to zero against a stationary object, it goes to zero weakly. Fine, this term is tricky, right? Because you could have possible concentrations. But this is related to minus Laplacian to the gamma of u. Oh, my handwriting is horrible. And I've already proven that this goes to zero. So this is fine. So I have one term. And this term, you know, it's the Lyray projector of the divergence. Projector of the divergence of a symmetric non-negative tensor, which is uniformly bounded in L1, but I cannot prove that it doesn't develop some kind of concentrations into measures. And I have no idea how to attack this problem in general. And the issue is this strong convergence. I don't know how to prove this strong convergence. So in some sense, this is like a turbulent behavior in the limit as time goes to. In the limit as time boosting thing. By the way, what happens is that you can get current sheets in the limit. This is actually why there is an issue. You can start from perfectly smooth data, and in the limit, I can construct a steady state, which is a magnetostatic equilibrium, but it's a current sheet. So let me give you an example, just a simple example. You go back to the old work of Judovich and you. Go back to the old work of Judovich and you make a two and a half dimensional Anzatz. So you have for the magnetic field a two-dimensional component in the scalar, and they're both only depending on the horizontal variable. So nothing depends on X3. You take this V to be on Euler steady state. And then the question is: you plug this into the MRE equation. What does G satisfy? Okay, you do a computation. You do a computation, it satisfies this rank one diffusion equation. The dt of g is v dot horizontal gradient squared. This is like a rank one diffusion matrix, because this is like the divergence of divergence of V tensor V grad G. So this is the diffusion matrix and it's rank one. But still, it satisfies the maximum principle. So G by itself, it Principle. So G by itself, it can't blow up. How about the gradient of G, however? What I want to prove is that the gradient of G does blow up. And I'm going to do a simple example in which I'm taking just a shear flow. Of course, you can do other examples, by the way. If you take this V to be a shear flow, of course, it satisfies Euler, then this equation simply becomes this equation. Now, if you stare at Now, if you stare at this, you have to ask yourself: does the gradient of G blow up? And the answer is yes, it does blow up. One way to see it is to just take a Fourier transform in X1, because then it becomes an ODE, and you can solve it explicitly, right? K is the wave number associated to X1. And then when you take an X2 derivative, then the derivative can land there. And when it lands there, You get a T, a linear term, and you basically obviously can subjugate this term to this term. And so, if your shear flow has a non-degenerate zero somewhere, you automatically get infinite time growth. I could have chosen a different steady state, not the shear flow, but the hyperbolic saddle. Okay, if I choose a hyperbolic saddle, like a cellular flow or something. Cellular flow or something, then this rate becomes e to the t. So gradients blow up in infinite time, and in fact, in general, in this shear flow setting, you can prove pointwise convergence to this state. So when the shear is not equal to zero, you converge to something. And when the shear is equal to zero, then this is not a diffusion equation. You don't move at all. The velocity field does go to. The velocity field does go to zero, but of course, I can write a simple example. This is a shear flow, and it has, for instance, in this example, two current sheets. And the point is that current sheets are topologically accessible from smooth data, but they're not topologically equivalent to smooth data, because the topology has changed, but only it has changed in the infinite time limit. Infinite time limit because the limit was weak and not strong. So this is just an example. I wish I could prove this in general, but I can't. Does strong magnetic relaxation ever hold? Based on this example, you may think no, no way. What we could prove is that the classical setup, right, the constant magnet unidirectional magnetic field should stabilize everything. And yes, we can confirm that. If you perturb around the constant magnetic field in the E1. Constant magnetic field in the E1 direction, let's say. You can write a perturbation, you can write a velocity perturbation, you get a horrible equation, but we can prove that this equation for small data has global existence. And in fact, magnetic relaxation holds. So we have both an example, and again, this example is about small perturbations of a constant magnetic field where you have strong magnetic relaxation. Have strong magnetic relaxation. And we have another example here where you have weak magnetic relaxation because you have current sheets developing in the limit. We don't have a general theory. Let me skip this theorem, and I'm just going to finish with the last slide about open problems. I'm just listing some open problems, but of course there are many. The obvious open problem is we have global existence when gamma is larger than. Global existence when gamma is larger than this number. How about if it's less? Do you have global existence or do you have finite time singularities? And this is a kind of nice problem because it's an active vector equation. And I think not much is known. In two dimensions, of course, the magnetic field has a stream potential, which I'm calling phi. And then you actually become an active scalar equation. You just have transport plus. You just have transport plus some kind of coupling. I have no idea how to prove global existence or blow up for this. This is what I was alluding to earlier. Can you even construct global weak solutions? Forget about global strong solutions. Convex integration methods just don't apply to the magnetic relaxation equations. And of course, if you want to ask much more physically interesting questions, like if the initial magnetic field is chaotic. Initial magnetic field is chaotic, which steady magnetostatic equilibria are topologically accessible from this chaotic initial data. Absolutely no clue. And with this, I'm one and we're a bit out of time. We're a bit out of time. If someone wants very much to ask a question.
