And we're back. Hopefully, everyone should be able to follow everything that's happening throughout the whole talk. But feel free to stop me if somehow I managed to go too quickly. So, starting out, we all have this understanding of what a group is, a finite group, from undergraduate mathematics. And we think about this as sort of invertible symmetry. But it's a very Symmetry, but it's a very idealized type of symmetry. We have sort of a mathematical understanding of what a perfect triangle is, a perfect square, perfect pentagons and stuff. And we tell our students that these have symmetries, these have actions that you can do that are reversible. That you can invert these back to the original. And that corresponds to having some other elements in the group, some other symmetry, such that when you compose them, it brings you back to. When you compose them, it brings you back to the neutral state. So, we all understand this, hopefully, from a mathematical standpoint. So, you try to teach this to small children, which is great because they can actually manipulate things around them. And you give them something like a cardboard cube or a box or something, and you tell them, Well, what can you do to this box that would maintain shape? So, you do this with the small children for about 15 minutes, and you get back some. 15 minutes, and you get back something like this. So, theoretically, these children have been doing invertible symmetries for the past 15 minutes, but somehow you get back something that wasn't the original. And the problem is, is that almost all the actions that happen in reality aren't reversible. There's sort of something that has happened that cannot be reversed. So, this brings this idea of fusion, where we have some symmetries of some symmetry. Have some symmetries of some system which have something that looks like an inverse, and it does bring you back to the original state, but there's some extra noise that you've picked up along the way. Maybe one of the students sat on the box by accident. So these are sort of more realistic ideas of symmetry. So to get down to an actual definition, a fusion ring is a nice associative unital ring, but it also has a chosen basis. In basis that includes the unit and n other to x, or n minus 1, n of them in my notation. And it also has this duality, which is describing sort of what it means to be invertible in this ring. But this is only up to some noise. So our rules are that the fusion rules are going to be non-negative integers that I've represented with capital N's. And we have this invertibility condition. Invertibility condition, which says that the only thing that makes a one appear in these fusion rules is when you multiply something with its quote-unquote inverse. It says nothing about the noise that will appear in addition to that, just that that one has to appear with multiplicity exactly one. So this chronic group delta here. So we know lots of examples which come from very literally invertible symmetries like integral groups. Invertible symmetries like integral group permits. So they have a basis composed of the elements in the group, and they have a nice duality, which is just inversion. But this definition also includes the representation theory of these groups. So if you look at the character ring of a finite group, it is also an example of a fusion ring. And its basis are the irreducible characters. And the duality is complex conjugation. Conjugation. And of course, pointwise multiplication is the ring multiplication. So this definition is both group theory and representations of groups as well. So there's extra structure when we deal with these irreducible characters of these groups or irreducible representations if you want to look at them. We also have intertwiners between these representations. So there's a deeper structure. So there's a deeper structure that's happening with the representation theory of finite groups. So that brings us to the idea of a fusion category. So a fusion category is the combinatorial data of one of these fusion rings with also this extra data of how these fusions can be, oh, I have a little type of fusion rings. How this data of the fusion rings can be sewed together with these intertwiners. Twiners. So you can pick any field you want. I picked complex numbers just for simplicity of the talk. And so again, as I mentioned, our data of a fusion category is just this ring, this combinatorial data, which is you can think of just as a collection of non-negative integer matrices, which describe the multiplication in terms of the basis, and a ton of maps. So if you have a very large basis for your fusion ring, you have to have one of these associative maps, which One of these associative maps, which tells you how to move the parentheses around for every triplet of objects. So, this is a lot of data. And you want this to be cohesive, all of this data. So, you want this to satisfy what we call the pentagon equations. So if I'm composing all of these associative maps together, they should be cohesive. And you can convince yourself in the privacy of your own home that this is sufficient so that you can move parentheses all around all your. Parentheses all around all you want, and this pentagon being commutative assures that you're always going to have the same map, no matter how you match the parentheses. So again, I've said it twice, but I'll say it one more time. A fusion category is just this combinatorial data of this ring, along with solutions to an absolutely enormous system of nonlinear equations. Linear equations in just tons and tons of variables. So it is a very understandable problem to search for these fusion categories, but the solutions, they look absolutely overwhelming even in the smallest situations. But fortunately, classical mathematics gives us some examples. So from our group theory, we know that the fusion rings, the integral group rings, and their character rings for any finite group. Rings for any finite group all have categorifications. So they all have categorifications in lots of inequivalent ways as well. So for instance, for our integral group rings, these associated maps, you can write down what it means to satisfy the Pentagon equations. And these correspond to the third cohomology group of the finite group that you've chosen. So there's very classical data which describes the different inequivalent categories. Describes the different inequivalent categorifications of these rings. So, miraculously, classical mathematics gives us just gobs and gobs and gobs of fusion categories sort of for free. We already know what these categories are and what the solutions to these pentagons are. But to see something non-classical, take the smallest non-trivial example, which is a rank 2 fusion rank. So, for instance, you could have the integral. So, for instance, you could have the integral group ring on the group of order two, for example. That would be one example. Or you could have what we call the Fibonacci rings. So the Fibonacci rings have one non-unit element. When you square it, you just get one plus the only noise that you can possibly have, which is some number of copies of X. So you can start with just one copy of X, and you can immediately see why you would call this a Fibonacci rig. Would call this the Fibonacci ring. So, what would it take to have a categorification of the Fibonacci ring? Well, you can prove that up to equivalence, you can assume that all of the associators involving the unit are trivialized. So there's really only one non-trivial associator that you need to write down. It's a map from x times x times x to itself. And that object, x times x. object x times x times x is just 1 plus 2x in the fusion ring and we can assume that you know 1 maps to 1 that can be trivialized so the only non-trivial data that we have is sort of the data of how these two x's sort of intertwine with one another and it has to satisfy copious pentagon equations from our previous slide and you can prove that there are exactly two inequivalent solutions to this so there Solutions to this. So there are exactly two different categorifications of this rank two fusion ring, where the solutions, not surprisingly, involve the golden ratio and its square root. So these categories don't just have to be found by solving systems of equations. That's very rarely how they're actually found. They can always be realized by representation theory as well. So, in particular, Theory as well. So, in particular, these very small fusion categories are realized by representations of quantum groups at roots of unity, which was where my original research began. Now, surprisingly, there's an infinite series of rank II fusion rings. They're very easy to write down. They're indexed by just a positive integer, which is the coefficient of x when you square x. But there are only two of them are categorized. There are only two of them are categorifiable. So, all of these pentagon equations are unsolvable for the other infinite series of fusion rings that aren't the integral group ring for the group of order two or the Fibonacci fusion ring. So it's a very, very finite set of fusion rings for this particular rank, which is categorifiable. And that result was my advisors about 21 years ago. And so someone eventually showed that you can prove that there are exactly five categorifiable rings of rank three. That was also my advisor 11 years later. And if you go 11 years, okay, we haven't reached 2024 yet, but you think maybe in 11 years we would get up to rank 4 or something. But it's completely unknown. So past rank 3, it's not even known if there are finitely. It's not even known if there are finitely many categorifiable fusion ranks for any rank greater than three. So, the computational complexity of this problem, if you're actually trying to solve pentagons, just explodes in a very, very, very vast amount of time. So, this is a great open problem, and this would sort of cement you in the annals of history if you could even prove that finitely many of these fusion rings actually Of these fusion rings actually have solutions to these pentagons. So, the question is: why would you even care about something like this? And we saw one obvious reason that you would care, which is that this has to do with representation theory. So, these categorifications of these fusion rings arise from the representation theory of Lie algebras, Lie groups, Hopf algebras, VOAs, the vertex operator algebras, subfactors, the von Neumann algebras, any of the. Factors, the quad-Neumann algebras, any representation theory that you can imagine produces examples of these fusion rates. So they're a uniform language to study sort of all representation theory, you know, using the same words, the same verbs, et cetera. So people like Drenfeld and Borchard, just name drop, you know, Fields Medalists, you know, are sort of progenitors of this language in their respective fields. In their respective fields. But also, these fusion categories give rise to interesting grade group representations and variance of knots and links in a way that I do not have time to describe in about 20 minutes. But this is related to the work of Vaughan Jones, you know, to name drop more fancy people. And lastly, this is also sort of the algebraic shadow of conformal field theory in mathematical physics. Theory in mathematical physics. So, both 2D conformal field theory and 3D topological quantum field theory. And even more recently, it's been used to study topological quantum computation. So, this is sort of cemented as something that needs to be discussed. You can't travel forward in modern mathematics without studying objects as type. So, at the end of the day, numbers are actually. End of the day, numbers are actually running the show, though. So, this is a conference on number theory, so we should probably see some numbers appearing besides the golden ratio. So, the numerical invariance of fusion rings, just our combinatorial data at the beginning, are quite arbitrary. There's not a lot of structure to the numbers that pop out when you study fusion rings. But as soon as you assume that there is a categorification attached to a fusion ring, To Fusion Reign, that number theory starts becoming much more interesting and much more restrictive, incredibly restrictive. So, some people who study numbers might say it's so restrictive that it's not interesting. But there's so many open problems that I find that it is quite interesting nonetheless. So, for instance, when you're studying finite groups, the first thing that you notice is that the representation theory or the character theory of finite groups can be defined over a cyclotomic. Can be defined over cyclotomic fields. So, for fusion rings, this is not the case. So, you're not guaranteed that the representations of fusion rings can be defined over cyclotomic fields unless it's categorifiable. So, having solutions to all these pentagons guarantee that you end up with character theory of these fusion rings in the land of cyclotomic images, just like for finite groups. In the back of your head, you should be thinking we're trying. Back of your head, you should be thinking we're trying to sort of generalize finite groups. So, strangely, the associative data of a Pigeon category very often cannot be defined over a cyclotomic field. So, if you think cyclotomic integers are very uninteresting, then we can try to actually find solutions to the Pentagon equations, which very often cannot be realized with cyclotomic numbers. So, an interesting So, an interesting set of numbers which pop out of this study of fusion rings are what are called formal codegrees, which is what I'll spend the rest of the talk discussing. So, these are actually quite easy to define without getting into the nitty-gritty of representations of fusion rings. So, you just take this nice sort of regular element in your fusion ring, which is just the sum over your basis of all of the basis elements times the dual. Elements times the dual. And you look at the eigenvalues of multiplication by that element. So literally, this is just a big matrix of non-negative integers. And we want to compute our eigenvalues of that matrix. And this produces these numerical invariants called formal codegrees. So they're just these numbers which are eigenvalues of a matrix. So you can have an undergraduate who just took linear algebra compute these for fusion rings very quickly. Rings very quickly and study them. So the name arises because the degrees of a finite group, if you don't remember, are the dimensions of the irreducible representations, and the codegrees are sort of the inverse scaled by the order of the group. And if you compute these formal codegrees for the character rings of a finite group, you get exactly the formal codegrees on the nodes. That's why we use the word formal because it's not exactly. Formal because it's not exactly group theory and codegrees. So essentially, these formal codegrees are these totally positive algebraic integers satisfying this nice little equation down below. So you can just try to brute force, try to find which formal codegrees can arise in terms of these categorifiable fusion rates. So they're very interesting numbers that appear. So, for an example, I created one. So, for an example, I created one for this talk. I made an infinite series of fusion rings of rank four. So, these three matrices, I didn't include the identity matrix. That's how the unit acts in the fusion ring. These are just the way that the three non-trivial elements in my fusion ring act by multiplication on each other. So, this set of three matrices completely determines this fusion ring, this set of fusion rules. And we can compute. And we can compute the formal codegrees just by taking that element, you know, the basically the sum of the squares of those three matrices plus the identity matrix, and you get the following. And you compute its eigenvalues, and you get 5, 5, and the two roots of this quadratic equation. So this is an infinite list of fusion rings whose formal codegrees are totally positive, cyclotomic integers. Cyclotomic integers, so it looks like they're just right for categorification. But the problem is that you know, the smart money says that only finitely many of these should have categorifications. So the question is, is what about these numbers that are coming out as our formal codegrees tells us that this can't be categorified? There are no solutions to these Pentagon equations. So a result in So, a result in this direction involves a type of number that you may not have seen before, probably not. It's a very strange definition for most people. So we call these algebraic D numbers. So if I have an algebraic integer, we define an algebraic D number to be a number which all of its Galois conjugates divide that number. So you can immediately come up with lots of examples. So things like So, things like integers, rational integers, for example. So, they definitely satisfy this condition. What else? Units. So, units satisfy this condition as well. So, units and rational integers are the obvious algebraic D numbers. And there are copious other equivalent definitions, like if you happen to stumble into the minimal polynomial over q or your algebraic integer, then you can. Algebraic integer, then you can check to see if it's a D number by sort of comparing divisibility of the coefficients. So Ostert proved that a very strong condition for categorification is that if you have a categorifiable fusion rate, then these formal codegrees are actually these algebraic D numbers. It's sort of a Galois symmetry that happens with the formal codegree. And this is incredibly restrictive. So let's go back to. Restrictive. So let's go back to our example where we have a ranked four fusion ring, and two of its, the interesting formal codegregreges, and weren't just five, were these two solutions, or the two roots of this quadratic. So assuming that the roots aren't integers, which happens in exactly one case when A is equal to zero, so this will not factor over Q, then the two roots of this quadratic are algebraic T numbers if and only if we have this condition. Numbers, if and only if we have this condition satisfied. And you can check that this is true if and only if A is congruent to 4 mod 5. No reason you should see it right now, but I'm just telling you that that's what happens. So this D number condition, the cyclotomic condition didn't eliminate any of these from being categorifiable. They're all cyclotomic integers. But this D number condition actually eliminates about 80% of these from ever having solutions. And the beauty of that is, And the beauty of that is we didn't have to check. So we didn't have to actually try to solve these pentagons. We're just looking at very simple number theoretic conditions on these numerical invariants of the fusion rings that just say that you don't even have to look for solutions. It can't happen. So I actually don't know if the other 20% are categorifiable. So it's an incredibly difficult question. So the goal is to come up with more and more context. Is to come up with more and more conditions that you can check that eliminate the need to look for these solutions in the first place. So, in general, you could ask the question, if I have a number field, what are all the D numbers that I can find in that field? So, from the fusion perspective, we're actually trying to find out what formal codegrees could arise in Q drawing the square root of 2, for example. So, if we stick to finite groups, If we speak to finite groups or Hof algebras or something like this, everything is just rational integers. That's very classical mathematics. So, this is truly trying to look for things which are very modern, non-classical. So, about four years ago, I just, as an exercise, I just decided to do this for quadratic fields. I knew nothing about numbers at the time, so that's about when I started learning what numbers were, I should say. And I did it for, well, so for the imaginary fields, you know, you have finite. Imaginary fields, you know, you have finite unit groups, and this is a very uninteresting question. But for the real quadratic fields, you know, you have these infinite unit groups in terms of just this fundamental unit, which I'll call epsilon n. And not to give you the whole result, but just to give you an example, in the simplest case, if the fundamental unit is norm minus one, then you can write every algebraic D number just as an integer, some power of the unit, and then square root of n. And then square root of n, for example. So you'll recognize that our rational integers and our units, they're always going to appear. But really the question is, if I take the set of all algebraic D numbers and I mod out, you know, by rational integers and units, what's left? And here are just exactly two things that are left over. So I don't know enough about number theory to do this for incredibly complicated fields, but you know, it would even be an interesting question. It would even be an interesting question just to write this down for some set of fields and try to study how formal codegrees could arise in that field. So an unusual observation that I noticed from studying this is that these fundamental units, you'd think that, you know, as n rises, the fundamental units would sort of get slowly larger. That was my initial thought about these fundamental units. But apparently that's not the case. But apparently, that's not the case. Apparently, these fundamental units are just they act very, very crazily. So, to give you an example of how weird this is for the fusion, so if you look at the greatest formal codegree, or the Frobenius-Perron eigenvalue of that matrix that we use to compute the formal codegrees, we call this the Frobenius-Perron dimension of the ring. This is sort of the categorical version of the order. Categorical version of the order of a finite group. So, this is telling you how big your fusion ring is, basically. So, if you ask a question like, find a categorifiable fusion ring, and its Frobenius Peron dimension generates Q adjoin the square root of 2593, just for an example, then that would imply that its Roudinius-Peron dimension is actually greater than 10 to the 48th power. 48th power. So it's very improbable that there is actually a fusion category with this property. So this field is probably completely vacant of formal codegrees of fusion categories, which is a very strange thing because our definition, you would think our definition would allow just this huge variety of number fields to appear. And I don't know how you guys think about really large numbers, but I always type them into Wolfram Alpha and see. I always type them into Wolfram Alpha and see just how large that number is. And Wolfram Alpha told me that this is about 2% of all possible chessboard arrangements. That's how large this is going to be. It's a very large number. So with Terry Gannon, and it's one of the reasons why I came up to do a postdoc with him at the University of Alberta, we started studying things that he had been studying since he was a graduate student. So, representation. Student. So, representations of quantum groups, VOAs, things like this. And he's been studying these things for like 30 years. And these very basic observations from a number theoretic standpoint are completely new. So we wrote a paper that's going to appear in Number Theory and Physics in the future, which studies what number fields are generated by these formal codegrees of things that have been known since before I was actually born. So we define this KR to just be the field generated by the form of bodegrees. And obviously, if you have two simple fusion rings, you can always multiply them together in a reasonable way and create very interesting types of fields. So you really just want to look at the simple ones. So like finite simple groups, for example. So a fusion ring is going to be simple enough, you can't factor it into the bottom. And you can just ask which number fields appear. And you can just ask which number fields appear that are generated by formal codegrees of some categorifiable fusion route. And we looked through all known examples for the past like 35 years or something like that. And we found that they're all do adjoin cosine of 2 pi over n, with finitely many exceptions. So in our vast knowledge of fusion and fusion categories, we only managed to create what is a very, very, very, very What is a very, very, very, very small slice of actual number field. And in fact, all of the finitely many exceptions are quadratic, except for two. So there are two very suspicious number fields, degree three and five, over Q, which appear. And there's exactly one user ring that appears with these number fields that are categorifiable. And so at the beginning. And so at the beginning, when these observations were made, people said, oh, well, there's just these sort of small exceptions. And then we started discovering more and more fusion categories because we were specifically trying to find the ones that didn't create this field in particular. And people are, you know, I don't know why. I guess they're trying to pretend like they understand things very well, but every time you find a new one, they say, oh yeah, but that's all of them. And then you find another one and they're, oh, And then you find another one, and then, oh, no, but that's certainly not all of it. And that's sort of the game that's been played in this field. But it's very clear that if we keep looking, we're just going to find more and more and more of these things. So the question is, is why are these fields appearing? And why do some fields appear to be completely empty? For example, we don't have an example of a fusion category whose formal codegrees create Q adjoin the square root of 7. And it just feels like And it just feels like that's wrong. Like, there should be a fusion category out there with that very basic property. Maybe I can sort of point out this observation that this QA joint cosine of 2 pi over n is like the real part of the cyclotomic field. Sure. And then you already mentioned that, like, if you have fusion rating, then the code degrees have to be cyclotomic. So that's why that shows up. Yeah, it's definitely why this shows up, but you know, you can create a lot. But you know, you can create a lot of fields which are synchrotronic that aren't this, for example, much smaller than this one. So, I'm saying that these actually generate the entire field. So, you could very easily create something that is much smaller than this. You don't have to create the entire totally real part of that field. And all of these examples, another reason why this appears is they all come from representations of Lie algebras, and there's a very, you can actually say what this n is, you know, in relation to the Lie algebra. You know, in relation to the Lie algebra that helped create it. But there's also very weird exceptions that are here. So, this is sort of the sales pitch, sort of to end the day. So the study of fusion categories is not going away. It's intricately tied to many, many areas of modern mathematics. And numerical evidence suggests that actually we understand 0% of it. So I'm trying to paint a picture of a very So, I'm trying to paint a picture of a very broad open field with lots of nice results that have yet to be discovered. Even examples are paper-worthy, sort of in this field. And it appears that the number theoretical methods that we have are some of the strongest tools that we have to study these categories. And so, if anyone knew anything about numbers, maybe somebody in this room, you could just walk into this field and Could just walk into this field and start knocking down results left and right because it's not an area that number theorists particularly think about, representation theory and mathematical physics and the like. So there's a huge opportunity here for someone to come in and lay down some awesome results. Or if anyone knows how to use a computer. I find none of us know how to use computers in this field either. So you know anything about numbers or computers, you know. Numbers or computers, you know, let's talk and maybe we can solve some problems together. So I'll stop there so we can go have our dinner. But thank you for listening.
