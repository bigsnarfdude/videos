Eduardo was the third one. And okay, good. I couldn't see you. Okay, good. All right. Well, thank you. I mean, we will move into discussions, but the way we like to start these sessions is by having each of you give a 30 to 60 second overview of either where you think you would say your work fits into the larger. You would say your work fits into the larger field, or what the next interesting subject to pursue along the lines you've been doing is, or maybe what you see the big challenges are. Why don't we start with Alex and then Magdalena and then Eduardo? Yeah, so I think maybe the big challenges, maybe you can break them up into sort of three different things, one being technical, one being sort of foundational and conceptual, and one being Foundational and conceptual, and one being experimental. And I mean, this is a personal view on things that I think may be sort of very interesting to pursue along this page of Wooter's line. On the technical side, I think I feel theoretic formulations of the proposal are really the next thing that maybe we can think about or hope to do, although really hard. And then maybe at a conceptual level, I still think there's, you know, You know, sort of lots of connections still be made with sort of the recent literature on reference frames and also the older literature. And then maybe I can point to one problem that's interesting for me is an interpretational one in the relation between this Page Wooter's proposal and the Navredian interpretation of quantum mechanics. There's some strong similarities and there's some strong differences in the sense that these physical states are like this universal wave function in a many worlds interpretation, but there's no background unitary evolution. There's no background unitary evolution for this thing to evolve with. And then at the same time, the Avredians, they postulate this unitary evolution and then try and recover a Born rule out of it. And this conditional probability is kind of the opposite is you have probabilities in the Born rule and you can recover a unitary evolution of it. So I think thinking along that and really comparing and contrasting those things would be something interesting. And then I think from an experimental point of view, I really think. Point of view. I really think trying to find an experiment to witness these superpositions of clocks experiencing proper times, these interference experiments first proposed by Magdalena, Fabio, and Chaslov. I mean, you know, all of these are going in the same sort of direction of, you know, can we interfere relativistic effects and can we actually see them? And I think that's an open experimental question. So, however, we're going to do that. Sorry, that was rampant. However, we're going to do that. Sorry, that was a ramble, but okay, Magdalena. I unmute myself. Well, I definitely share excitement with Alex about seeing some experiments in that sphere. When it comes to theory, I think where I find one should head to for some insight, it's really to Really, to get on board in quantum mechanics, what happened in classical physics with the Copernican revolution, I think we, with this, with all the research on quantum reference frames, and I think also our approach with realizing that coordinates are just ways to label states, and you can re-label them essentially by using unitary transformations, not just any unitary transformation. Transformation. So, hopefully, this will enable some better insights into what essentially when and why we should expect different physical effects. Because on one hand side, in classical physics, we would all agree that whether Earth is in two different locations in summer and winter, or whether the sun is in two different locations. Or whether the sun is in two different locations in summer and winter. It's just a matter of how you choose to describe the solar system. But in quantum physics, we would say that there would be very different physics if we actually attach quantum states to those systems. And if the mass was very, Earth was very tiny and sun was as big as it is, we would say that only one of those is a physical state and the other perhaps is not physical or requires new physics. And so I see a tension here between what we consider completely indistinguishable classical situations and what we insist are distinguishable quantum scenarios. This cannot be consistent. And I think that the work on quantum reference frames and coordinates can bring some light into that. So that's, I guess, both speaks to how I see the relevance. How I see the relevance of the projects I've been showing, and also where I think important insights can come. Okay, thank you, Eduardo. And over to Edu. Yeah, so what I talked about slightly different, obviously related, but slightly different than what Alex and Magdalena that are more related were talking about. The framework in which I see what I've done is related to the fact that it's several impacts. It's several impacts. Again, I'm going to do the same as Alex, right? There's the foundational one, in which indeed the measurement problem is a non-trivial problem in quantum mechanics. It's much worse when you have relativistic quantum mechanics, and in particular in quantum field theory. It's far from being a solved thing. We take for granted this big, if you want, gap between experimenters working with relativistic quantum fields, doing quantum optics, and being comfortable with measuring photons, measuring modes of a field. And then when we try to write formally what that means, then we realize what that actually means. means, then we realize, well, that actually makes no sense. How do we understand this? Right. This is a big, this is a big shock as in like you can actually work with them almost quantum mechanically, which is what in quantum optics people do. Let's forget a little bit about relativity, because it works for regimes and experiments where relativity doesn't play a role. But are we hearing here? We are at a time that we can do experiments in which relativistic aspects cannot be neglected and are non-trivial. So from the foundational point of view, of course, understanding a measurement theory. Of view, of course, understanding a measurement theory of QFT is important for understanding of quantum mechanics. Above all, if we want to go even beyond QFT and try to talk about what's going on with gravity and the structure of space-time as purely quantum mechanical and dynamical, we need to understand very well what's going on with QFT, which is the best we have actually so far that works. That's foundational, right? But there's also the fact that we need to connect to experiments. I think we are at a point, we are talking about phenomena, phenomena that hasn't been detected yet, quantum interference. Quantum interference in reference frames, quantum interference of time dilation, if we want, entanglement harvesting, things even like the under effect, those are things that have not been experimentally realized yet, at least not directly. And if they're very well understood from the formal perspective, translating this formal perspective to experiments is complicated. And it's complicated because oftentimes we miss a bridge in which we can actually write the rigorous things that we can actually study and derive and understand very well. actually study and derive and understand very well in QFT in terms that experimentalists can easily understand and translate into their experiments. So I would say there are two things, right? I guess Fuseder, the Fuster, I'm not going to be able to do it. Fuster Virtues, I call it, because I butcher. I feel you, Virtue, because people butcher my name too. So I feel you totally. But the point is that we're at a point where this is the most rigorous way of formulating thing that I've seen. Formula anything that I've seen. Problem with that, there's no way to connect it to a practical experiment that I know of. Then we have intermediate tools, something like a classical, or you want classical center of mass android-wide detector that is a quantum system semi-relativistic that is in between. Then we have also, we can actually place this in superpositions of motion of the center of mass. Okay, nice. What if we place something like that in a curved space-time? We have control. Now the switching function is a quantum system as well. These are very interesting. system as well these are very interesting questions addressing them formally is non-trivial very non-trivially translating it to experiments is even less trivial so that's why i see the future way i think this is an important line trying to understand the measurement problem and what it means what experimentalists can measure to the rigorous theory of qft we understand what is the translation what is the formatism and we should understand it and that's the frame in which i put it it's certainly related with what alex and mageriana were talking about as well even if not as as directly as their two topics As directly as their two topics, okay. So let's uh broaden the discussion. I don't see any hands up for questions yet, but I do understand uh Alex and Magdalena had questions for each other, and I'm not sure of what the causal order was. So why don't we let Magdalena go first? Yeah, I actually wouldn't mind if Alex had a question to my talk because maybe people still remember. And I told you I was gonna dap it away. Go ahead. Alex, it's awesome. Also, in case I would be interested to catch up with Alex on that, yeah, in a bigger capacity. So it's not necessarily. Yeah, yeah. So it's actually, the question is actually, I think the work that Eddie was talking about and what Magdalena was talking about is actually more related in some sense. Or a question I have is that when you have these quantum controlled switching, right, what is the observable induced on the field? And how is that different than when you have a classical trajectory? When you have a classical trajectory. So I know if you do it with just a classical regular one, you can expand it order by order and you get products of the field operators smeared with, I forget. But I'm wondering if you get something qualitatively different with these quantum controlled things, because they're somehow probing non-local observables on the field. So. Well, my answer would be: you have to wait a bit. It's one of the things we actually are looking with some. Things we actually are looking with some of the people. So, what are the transformations on the field that result from having a detector with this additional quantum control when you prepare and measure more general states? One thing I can say that if one sets up the scenario very idealistically, you may guess Um, guess, um, and perhaps it will be a correct. There's a good chance the guess will be correct in an idealized case. If you so, if you just consider control of some semi-classical cases, you can again play the game with mapping the control to a single state and then all your matter to some quantum one. And then essentially, you will see that your detector interaction with the field will produce some kind of Will produce some kind of state, yeah, in some sense, or the localize in an appropriate sense, depending what you're switching. And you could calculate that kind of backward. So in that case, you can always use this mapping to start from the end for which you know how things are already from. Are already from, yeah, you can even link it probably with some results. Although, I think that perhaps in those cases, like there is no end where the result is already available, but you could choose which way would be simpler for you to obtain it. Because you can shift what is in a quantum state from the field operators to the system coupling to those operators, and you will get. You can map the results. I think what probably is interesting is to consider someone that is actually trying to set up the scenario and they define the field or somehow set up the field operators relative to them or detector relative to them, so to say. And then those two scenarios, of course, become physically different because if you set up some cavity with a field and you prepare it in a different state, or if you prepare some probe in a different cavity in some particles, say, Cavity in some particles. And of course, these are not, nobody claims this is the same physical situation, but there would be a mapping. I have one follow-up question to that, if that's okay. It's related to... So I was in Laura Henderson's PG Defense and very interesting looking at all these cases of precisely this that we're talking about. There's one that can sometimes, sometimes, depending on what you do, of course, depending on how you handle the information on which path, right, and what you do with it, you can end up with a case. Do with it, you can end up with a case that looks a lot like you have two smearing delocalizing two bumps rather than a proper quantum thing or not. There's something that comes to mind, and again, it has to do with causality and the consistency of the model. Typically, the analyze weight model, when you make it near, one thing that we say is like you would not use as a physical system an analogy model to make predictions that are below the lycrossing time of the atom, those scales, because obviously there's no atom, there's no physical non-relativistic systems, there's limit to the scales you can consider. There's a limit to the scale you can consider. Now, when you have superpositions and you measure which path or you interfere and so on, those phenomena that's going on, that's not relativistic in nature, those parts. They're not controlled through relativistic dynamics. And I wonder how it interferes with the notion of having a good causal model, right? When you have, I understand that as an experiment that can be done. I'm not saying it's an impossible situation. You can get an atom and split it in two. That's fine. Split it in two, that's fine. You can get two trajectories. It's how we model it, right? How we model it with an under-the-weight detector with a control variable for the switching or the smearing. I wonder how that plays along with causality, if it's similar to the way a classical smearing would play, and then we have limits on the scales that we can do it, or if it's different. That would be very interesting. I integrated with Alex how, if we were to actually measure that detector later, what is the POVN induced on the field for that? Does it update within a light core? Does it update in a cost? That's enough that in a cost that is something that I'd be very interested to know as well. Yeah, actually, I think I've been addressing the question of what will be the induced state of the field when I've been addressing Alex's question. And I think he also meant that, in fact, so what are the induced states in the field? So I would say there is a difference when you consider this quantum controlled smearing to when you just have some smearing function, because here you have a degree of freedom that correlates with the smearing. And so it will induce different you will have different effects. You will have different effects. Essentially, it's like having a superposition versus an entangled state. And so I would not expect that things would be exactly the same if you just forget about the control and have some double kind of camo shape switching function. I think these are genuinely different physical situations, and you can understand the first one from this quantum. The first one from this quantum control is that you prepare a control, then you measure, and then conditionally, you have this coherent smearing, and then you have some additional control to maybe put that in some superposition. So it's, I would expect in general that there would be a difference. And of course, I think the full model would have dynamics, consistent dynamics of these control degrees of freedom, because that's something that we are not including at the moment in the formalism. So in the moment, Formally. So, in the moment, we assume that there is essentially experimental control over when your detector can be switched. And the scenarios that are superposed are far enough from like in far enough regions that they will, you will not expect some fundamental issues because it's this regime where you are far away from the coherent spread. But of course, they are relevant questions and they are fundamental ones too. They are fundamental ones to address. But I think to make it fully address that, one would need to model the control itself as a dynamical system, has its dynamics and the mechanism for how the superposition is created. And I imagine the different models and the different dynamics would then elicit slightly different effects because obviously that's because naively if you are the generic, so I would see the difference again as. See the difference again as having an understanding of the meta-way Mark Zender, like Mark Kasevich is doing, where they can get away with describing the very big superposition and high-precision experiments, just essentially ascribing two semi-classical trajectories to the atoms. And we know that, first of all, there isn't a single atom in the path, there's always a cloud, and there are even interactions between them. And additionally, each atom is not in a superposition of two paths. Not in a superposition of two paths. It's all spread out. But there is a regime where you can describe the physics that arises with this simplification. And I see our work as being in that regime versus describing all full-blown path integral formalism for the atoms. I mean, that's how I see where this picture fits relative to the bigger physical picture in the analogy to how. In the analogy to how atomic interferometers can often be described relative to the full picture. And so, of course, the question is when the simplification breaks down. And of course, fundamentally, it is a really interesting question to get away. I mean, get away in a sense, move away from the simplification and complete the model as much as. So let me interject here. This is a discussion time for more than just. Discussion time for more than just the three of you. Not that it's not interesting, but I'm just wondering if anybody would like to ask a question. I don't see any hands raised, but maybe that's because they felt they couldn't or shouldn't do that. Do we have any audience questions, especially from students? No, I'm not seeing any. Well, why not? I'm not seeing any. Well, why don't we keep going? I think, Alex, you were going to answer one of Meg Delina's questions. Max has a hand up, but we wrote. Oh, Max does. So I'm sorry. Now I see it. Max, please go ahead. Yes, now. Hi. Sorry, I might have a very naive question, and it's concerning this concept of quantum reference frames. And I would be interested. And I would be interested in, well, in your opinion, what's the best way of thinking about them? So, when I think about, well, quantum field theory on a curved space-time, I have kind of a classical background, which is kind of my reference, right? I have a manifold, I have some metric there with respect to which I describe everything, which kind of is my reference frame. And then I have some. My reference frame. And then I have some. Usually, when we describe measurements or interactions or interventions on a field, we have some external entities like observers or experimenters that kind of live outside of the theory. So at the end of the day, we would want a theory of quantum gravity where everything is kind of or positive, but this is what we want, where everything is consistently described internally with some completely relational observables, where everything is respect to some other fields. To some other fields, which are at the end, hopefully all quantum. So, on the way there, what would be the best way of thinking about quantum reference frames and transformations between them? I would just be interested in your views. Somebody go ahead, Alex. Yeah, I can have a go. I mean, obviously, I'm biased. I can have a go. I mean, obviously, I'm biased, so but I think the best way is to think of the reference frame is nothing special. It's just another physical system. So we should treat it as much as we can like any other quantum system with the Hilbert space and observables and states of it. And then I'm sympathetic to this approach of formulating things in terms of constraints and then asking these conditional probability questions. These conditional probability questions. And so then now you asked about QFT in curved space, and there the reference frame is like the background. I would maybe argue there's two ways to go. Do you have quantum systems in a curved space? And then you can ask, okay, what does the curvature do and play that game? Or you can, okay, well, now what's my reference frame in QFT? Well, it's a foliation through space, right? And this foliation is going to act analogous. Going to act analogous to a reference frame, or different leafs of that, I would say, correspond to different orientations of a particular reference frame. And then now how to like, I think at least formally there's ways to map it onto what's already been done, but technically there you have infinite Hilbert spaces and all of that, as you well know. And so things get quite difficult. But I think conceptually it's there with the tools that have been presented. Alex, I. Alex and Mariana, perhaps, can you do relativistic quantum reference frames? No problem. Maybe I'll just shortly say we are not really doing quantum reference frames in our approach for a particular reason in that, at least I've been personally interested in understanding even the role of coordinates that we use to parameterize. That we use to parameterize states. So I'll just let Alex talk about the reference frames. So I think conceptually, again, yes, but I still think there's interesting questions to ask. And in particular, I know a paper by Sadminia or Escoban, I think was the first author, Alessio in Chazab, also wrote something recently about relativistic quantum reference frames. And in particular, the model that I showed, like one of the things that Mehdi and I wanted to do was kind of Wanted to do was kind of keep generalizing this Page and Wooters thing as much as we can. And the next step was relativistic quantum mechanics. So that was really the main motivation for our original work. And then this other effect that I talked about was kind of a side thing. So I would say there it's under control for like mechanical, relativistic mechanical systems. Flamenia has a question. Yeah, actually, yeah, actually, I just. Yeah, actually, I just want to comment on this quantum reference frame business. So, in our approach, we have so I don't know what the best approach is. I can tell you what we have done. And so, in our approach, a reference frame can be associated to a physical quantum system. And originally, we did it for Galilean quantum mechanics, so because it was just easier and it was easier to address some conceptual questions. Easier to address some conceptual questions there, and then we further generalized it to a special relativistic quantum system, so, in particular, to the one-particle sector of a Dirac field. And this was, okay, we did it for other reasons, led to define a relativistic stern Gerbach, but still the idea even there was to use the quantum field itself, well, the state actually, as the reference. As the reference frame. And finally, in a work with Charles Lab and myself, recent work, December it came out, we also addressed the superposition of space-times and a particle on quantum space-time. Sorry, on a curved space-time. And there, what we did was to still consider a particle as a reference frame. So we have a formalism to describe a quantum system in. To describe a quantum system in curved spacetime and in a superposition thereof. And there we have the assumption that the different solutions of the gravitational field. So you have a set of manifolds and on each manifold you have a classical gravitational field. And in each of these manifolds, there is a quantum system living, which is the reference frame. And then we need to introduce another system. And in order to system and in order to define what the coincidence is across this set of manifolds. So we have an option of basically the well it's not really a crossing of world lines because we don't have world lines anymore, but we define the coincidence of these two quantum systems as a way to localize things in the superposition of manifolds. So that's what we have done recently on that. So, this is, yeah, of course, out of ignorance, though, maybe what I should ask you is to give a seminar at some point. But, when you say things like superposition of manifolds, I just don't understand. What's the Hilbert space of that, right? I mean, I understand though using building a reference frame out of a quantum field or some sector of the Hilbert space of a quantum field, I can understand. There are still some questions that come, right? Because the only, for example, in flat space-time, the only invariant, the only state. Time. The only invariant, the only state that has all the symmetries, right, is the vacuum. So I guess you can use the vacuum as a reference frame, but I have some issues with what would happen with maybe a subset of reference frames that are interesting, right, you can do. Yeah, actually, this is a particle model. So it's really a particle on curl space-time. So we don't take a field description, and we also do not take a field description of the gravitational field. So it's a very abstract formalism. A very abstract formalism. We associate a cat G to each space-time solution, basically. And we assume that linearity of quantum mechanics still holds so that for each so basically each solution is macroscopically distinguishable from a different solution. So so you assume that there's some Hilbert space that you don't care that much about? Yeah, we don't describe it like in detail, but we assume that we are in this regime. We are in this regime. And we don't consider the dynamical degrees of freedom of the gravitational field. Yeah, always the problem with these things is that to do QFT or anything else, right, you need to do canonical quantization, you need a foliation of space-time to start. Yeah, no, we don't do that. Yeah. Okay. On this last point, because from our work on quantum coordinates describing Coordinates describing something like the Citarin superposition of curvatures, you actually see that you can formally describe superposition of metrics, even such that would be non-defomorphic, not difomorphically related to each other. So not just, say, metrics that come from putting a mask here or there. And the way you see you can describe the scenario is really because you can harness the fact that you can describe with the same set of parameterizations or coordinates differently. Parametrizations or coordinates, different metrics. This you can do on the formal level, and then from there, you can work out a description of scenario where you assign Hilbert spaces to, for example, the curvature. And with this, you then carry everything else that describes a given metric. And then foliations are implicitly defined, or in the process, become defined by this particular choice of common coordinates. Now, the point is here that Now the point is here that this means that if you would choose a different coordinates that parametrize space-time in a different manner and then quantize a different property, you might end up in a different physical scenario, different quantization, which I wouldn't see will be a problem. But in this way, you see that if you start to address a particular question, and like in Flaminia's case, not dynamics of the method. Dynamics of the metrics as such, but dynamics of some transition amplitudes of a particular physical system, some test system, then you can use a lot of the structure that is already there in filtering curve space-time to extend this little bit into the regime where you have formally a Hilbert space for some degree of freedom or some parameter that becomes. Degree of freedom or some parameter that becomes a degree of freedom of the metric. So, I guess the point is: you can't do this, it is not a way to do full-blown quantum gravity with dynamical gravitational degrees of freedom. It doesn't even properly, I think, address what are the genuine or the true gravitational degrees of freedom, the quantities. Like this is not addressing this point, but it shows you can construct or consider Hilbert space in which some states. In which some states of different metrics live and describe some processes through their probability amplitudes. So you have to ask specific question and then you can move forward. If you want to be too general and just describe quantum gravity dynamics, then I think it's not probably such a good starting point. It should be part of the final dynamical theory, but perhaps. Dynamical theory, but perhaps this approach will not tell you exactly what is the dynamics and what are the dynamical degrees of freedom of so in that sense, I like a lot of relational dynamics and the power that it could have to do something like that. I mean, assuming that there's some struct, some Hilbert space that you can associate universally and how gravity or space-time emerges. It's just, I still struggle. I understand the concept, the abstract concept. Oh, I just write a kid representing one space-time structure, one causal structure, another kid. One causal structure, another responding distinguishable one. But I still struggle because when I try to, in practice, think about how to go about it, I always trip over the QFT I know in which I need to have a foliation of space-time. Either that is emergent from something else, then I would understand it. You have some dynamics from which that emerges. Then it's difficult. I can follow the abstract and talk about it, but then in practice, how do I put a field? How do I do experiments in it? If it's not a part, if I don't. In it, if it's not a part, if I don't have particles or classical particles moving or even quantum particles moving around, I have a field in it. I struggle. I wonder if something like relational dynamics could solve that problem, right? As in like, yeah, certainly your causal structure emerges. This is how it emerges. And that would be great if that's something that's coming on. I don't know if Alex has thoughts on that. That's the weed or the weed, right? Kind of approach. This might have to be the last thought because we're at the end of our time. Go ahead, Alex. Go ahead, Alex. Okay, I also want to get back to Magdalena because I think she asked a very interesting question, and I quickly looked at her paper. And so, anyway, okay, well, first to, yeah, I agree with you. I mean, this is something we're thinking about is like really how to do this with the field theory. And there's these things called parameterized field theories. And what you do there is a similar thing. There's analogy. Thing is analogous to this parameterized free particle model. I'm not sure if you're familiar, but basically, you can take the usual Lagrangian that you would study and then extend it onto a larger phase space where you have now a clock. You can play the same game, but do it in field theory. And then you have embedding fields that define your foliation. And it's really hard to define the Hilbert space because this is an infinite dimensional Hilbert space. So, and that's, I'm reading a lot about infinite dimensional hubby spaces. So, I guess one quick question is: do you see future there? Is something that you see promising? I hope so. Yeah. And I mean, and I'm banking, I'll make an argument from authority in one of Don Page's early articles. He said, I see no obstacle to extending this to relativistic quantum field theory. So I'll appeal to an authority on that. So it's just a matter of translating to non-dump page. Of translate to non-dom page, yeah, exactly. Okay, I think we'll have to end this here. So far, I think these have been interesting sessions. And the morning is forward causal order. And as Magdalena said, the evenings are backward causal order. So it is in keeping with the spirit of the meeting. Let's thank all our participants again with the, I guess. With the, I guess, silent or actual clap. Thank you guys for organizing. Yeah. Well, thank you for coming. And I guess we'll meet again at 9 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time, which I guess is 11 p.m. Australian time, or Brisbane time, rather. So
