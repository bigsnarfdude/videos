And so then they had played a very important part of mathematics. For instance, in this speech, I want you to consider these circles which are tangent and consider that you. And consider that we generated a reflection on them. So, for instance, if we reflect with respect to this circle, a copy of the exterior goes into it and so on. So, if we continue with this process, at the end, we obtain a fractal cure. So, we are interested in this construction but in higher dimensions. So, there is a very natural way to extend the definition of climate groups to higher dimensions. Well, I was saying that we are interesting in this configuration, but it's in the Riemannian sphere, but we will have to extend this kind of construction. So, uh well so and the purpose the purpose of this talk is to present some results uh right related with the equivalence of dynamically defined wild nodes. Well, let me remind you the definition of a wild node. So, consider a node in the tree sphere and a point in the node is locally flat if we can find a neighborhood of it such that the note in that neighborhood The node in that neighbor looks like an interval. Otherwise, the point is said to be a white point. For instance, if you consider this point and you take a neighborhood, you will find an infinite number of copies of the threefold node approaching to this point. So this is a wild point. So now we're going to consider our construction. This is in the trius field. Is in the in the tree sphere. So, this is a necklace, and this is a necklace, is that the union of a consecutive tangent round balls in such a way that if we join tangency points by a linear segment, we obtain a knot called the template of this necklace. And of course, if we Of course, if we have a necklace, if we have a node, we said that a pier necklace is subordinate to this polygonal node if we can find a collection of n consecutive closed balls such that consecutive balls are tangent. And of course, our original note is containing this necklace, and then the note enters Intersection with each ball is an unnoted arc. And now consider the group generated by reflections on the spheres. So this group is a discrete subgroup of the Mobius transformation of the tree sphere, and the limit set is a while not. But let me explain a little bit this process. So suppose that we have this node. So suppose that we have this node and we have here a ball and consider the inversion with respect to this sphere. So a copy of the exterior goes into it. So in particular, a copy of this knotted arc goes there and with the necklace subordinate to it. So we have something like this. It's a schematic picture because in here this is not here this is not um we had to squeeze uh some points some disc here because we we we must have here a collection of tangent round boards but this is more or less that than that picture that you can have in mind so when we finish our first stage so we we get a new necklace k1 and also we And also we have a new necklace, T1, with a new node, K1. And this new necklace, T1, is contained in the original one. For instance, suppose that we have this three-fold note, this threefold necklace, and in here you can see the reflection. Of course, in this picture, the reflection... In this picture, the reflection is on the boundary. In our case, it is inside the bulb, but you can see more or less how the first stage behaves. So, we continue with this process, and in the M stage, we again apply the corresponding reflection. So, this is, for instance, a second stage. This is a second reflection here. This is a second reflection here, and in diameter stage, we get a new necklace in the previous one. And this new necklace has a note subordinate to it. So, for instance, in this picture, so this is the first step, this is the second one, and this is the third one. So, you can see how So, you can see how we are getting a collect a sequence of nested necklaces. And here is a little bit more detail. So, this is the first stage, this is the second, this is the third, and some fourth stage. And so on. So, at the end, so we are obtaining an Are obtaining a sequence of necklaces, and the limit set is the inverse limit of this sequence, which is equal to the intersection of all the necklaces. And what was proved by Musket and Kapovis that the limit set is a wild node. We call this limit set a dynamically defined wild node because was obtained as the limit set of a Klanian group. And well, a very basic question. A very basic question is given two one nodes of obtain a limited set of Linux groups when they are equivalent as a nodes or we can distinguish them. Of course, we can compute the fundamental group, but in this case, the fundamental group is an infinite free product of the fundamental group of the node with itself. So some general So some years ago we proved the following result that if we start with a node which is a thin fiber node and we consider a necklace subordinate to it and we apply this reflection process we get at the end that the limit set is also a fiber knot and the fiber is an orientable infinitive surface with one end in such a way that the closure of the fiber Way that the closure of the fiber minus the fiber is exactly the one node. In other words, we get an open book decomposition of the complement of the one node. And the idea of the proof is the following. So just consider the fiber, S. So when we reflect with respect to a sphere, for instance, this one, we obtain a copy of the fiber into it. And this copy is glued with the original one. Glued with the original one by an arc. So, in this way, we are extending the vibration map during the reflecting process. And as a corollary, that universal covering of the complement of the white knot is R3. So, if we start with the fiber, the node so we have the monodromy of the fibration, but when we But one way to understand this monodromy is considering the Furchetung conquer map, which in our case, I mean the complement of our fiber node, is the flow that cuts transversally each page of its open boot decomposition. So now consider the appear necklace subordinate to this note. So we apply again this reflecting process. So when we reflect Reflecting process. So, when we reflect, a copy of the fiber and a copy of this flow goes into each ball. So, this allows us to extend the Poincare map at each step. So, at the end, we get the monodromy of the white node, which is a copy of the monodrome of the original note initially by parts. So, in this way, So in this way, we have that a monodrome is an invariant for dynamically defined fiber wild nodes. But now we are going to study this question, but involving the necklaces. So we start with two necklaces with the same number of pairs. So the necklace D, which is a union of B, I, A. Of VI close round balls and the necklace B, which is a union of the CI tangent round balls. And we say that B is equivalent to T if we can find an homeomorphism from the sphere to the sphere, sending one necklace to the other one. And of course, considering that sending balls to balls and tangency points to tangency points. To tangency points. In particular, two equivalent pure necklaces whose templates are K and L, we have that these nodes, K and L, are equivalent nodes. So this allows us to move a little bit the necklaces, but keeping the tangency condition. So So then we prove that if we start with two equivalent n-necklaces, then the corresponding limit says are equivalent wild notes. So the idea of the proof is the following. So we start with two necklaces and consider a homeomorphism from the sphere to the sphere, sending one necklace to the other one. necklace to the other one and consider the group the corresponding groups generated by reflections on the corresponding bulb spheres and again we are going to use this this reflecting process so in the first stage we obtain a two new necklaces d1 and b1 and we are going to define To define a homeomorphism sending one this T1 necklace to the other one in the following way. So consider this function. So just using the reflection in the corresponding ball, apply the map, the original map, and then apply the inversion. And so we extend. And so we extend where we define this map H1. So in this case, this map, this new map H1 is a well-defined continuous function and satisfies our requirements. And we have also this commutative diagram, where the arrow maps are the inclusion maps. And we continue with this process when the stage we define the map. stage we define the map HM in very similar way and we have also this commutative diagram so summarizing we have this construction so our limit sets are the inverse limits of these nested sequences of necklaces so using the universal property of the limit the inverse limit we have a Limit, we have a continuous function from one limit set to the other one, and using the same idea, but now consider the inverse map at each level, we have also a continuous function g tilde from one necklace from one limit set to the other one in such a way that this. One in such a way that this composition is identity map. So identity comes because it's the identity at each level. So this proved that these two equivalent wild nodes are, I mean these two limit sets are equivalent wild notes. We are going to reformulate our definition of a necklace and for that we are going to use And for that, we're going to use what we're going to introduce the definition of a trivial necklace. So, consider the space, this is a circle on the x-y plane, the unit circle, and we place a closed three walls, so in the end partitions of the unity, in such a way that the consecutive closed walls are touched. So, this is a So, this is our trivial necklace. And well, the idea is that we can get an empirical necklace just cutting this trivial necklace to a tangency point, note it and pasted it back. And of course, we recite the symbols, but we preserve the tangency condition. So, using this trivia. So using this trivial necklace, we define an MP necklace as an embedding from the trivial necklace to a string with this condition that the image of each ball is a ball and keeping the condition on the TNC point. And we say that two necklaces are equivalent in the same way, but now consider that each necklace is a function, so we define Is a function, so we define in this way. So it's equivalent to our original definition, but we can allow us to define the concept of isotopy between two necklaces. So anisotopy is the usual definition. So we have this function from the trivial necklace times 0, 1 to S3 such that in the level 0 is our necklace T, in the level 1 is our in the level one is our necklace B and as at each level is an N-field necklace. So we have that if we start with two isotopic n-field necklaces, then the corresponding limit sets are isotopic one notes. And the proof of this theorem is very similar to the previous one, so we use the same kind of idea. So, we use the same kind of ideas. And thanks. Are there any questions? I have a question, if that's okay. Thank you for a very interesting talk. For wild knots, if I recall correctly, there's a categorization into like in terms of how wild the wild knots are. Terms of like how wild the wild knots are, like how many bad points. I don't quite remember what the categorization is, but do you know? Can you say anything like about how wild these wild knots are in the scheme of wild knots? Yes, all these wild knots have the property that each point is a wild point. So they are homogeneous. So we can find a function from the S3 to the S3 sending. From the street to the street, sending one node to the one node and one point to another one. So they look seem equal. There are one question. So do you have examples of non-equivalent nodes? Or for example, you take the trefold node, one necklace for a trefold node, say weight, 20 more. With 20 balls and another necklace with 40 balls. Do you get different notes? We think no, because at the end we have an infinite number that I mean, every one note is a connected, infinite connected sum of the node with itself or the mirror image of itself. So if we apply this process, Apply this process. If we start with 20 volts or 40 volts, it doesn't matter. So at the end, we're going to have an infinite number of copies of the node there. But we don't know how to prove it. Okay. So if you do everything, you you probably You probably get the same thing, so that would just be exhibiting a homeomorphism, I guess. But if you suspect that it's actually, well, in this case, you suspect it's true, but otherwise, let's say you're doing this construction on different knots, you would suspect to get different things. Do you have invariants though that actually work in this setting? Like if you do the construction with the trefoil versus doing it with a figure eight, do you have It with a figure eight, do you have a invariance that distinguishes between the resulting nodes? No, right? No, interesting. No, no, because I mean the fundamental group of the original nodes are different, are not isomorphic groups. But these wild nodes, the fundamental group of these wild nodes is the infinite free product of the original. Original fundamental group with itself. So I don't know if there is a way to distinguish these sequences, these infinite sequences of free products. So for instance, for that reason, we are searching for different properties. One interesting property how many wild points have these nodes, but not all. Nodes, but not all of them are homogeneous. But I don't know how to distinguish in that case, for instance, that is very simple case, two very common notes, and we know a lot of things of these two nodes, but we don't know too much about the limits. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thanks. Okay, well, thank you very much for interesting talk. Those are beautiful pictures, too. Thank you. See you tomorrow.
