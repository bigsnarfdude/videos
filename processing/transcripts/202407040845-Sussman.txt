This is really a little bit different than what I usually do in most of my research. So I have an alternate title here. You know, usually, I at least feel like I know what system I'm trying to analyze mathematically. Like, we've seen beautiful analysis of Ginsburg-Landau theory in this conference this week. And this is a case where I kind of want to emphasize that I don't really even know how to write down exactly the equation that we should be analyzing to understand. That we should be analyzing to understand systems that I care about. Okay. So, yes, this is a little bit different than what I usually do. Most of my research group is really computational in nature. We focus on kind of large-scale simulations of biologically inspired systems. We do interesting simulations of soft matter on arbitrarily curved surfaces. I like elephants, I guess, so that's nice. You know, I like to start and end my talks with a little bit of thank you. A little bit of thank you. So, first, you know, my research group, who really makes the job worth doing. I even found a picture of them all on top of a bunch of granite, which felt appropriate for our setting here. And of course, the funding that lets me hire all these people. Good. You know, I also like to thank the organizers for putting together a really wonderful workshop and giving me the opportunity for what I assume will be the only time in my career that I will give a presentation on the 4th of July. On the 4th of July. And at the panel the other night, we heard about the importance of artificial intelligence and data science. And so I thought, I will ask artificial intelligence to help me celebrate this occasion. And so here you go, a festivity of science and America. And I'm not sure what's going on here, but it's all very nice. But you know, I was actually pretty impressed with the kind of artwork that I was instantly handed back. And so for a brief moment, And so, for a brief moment, I thought, oh, maybe I'll just have, you know, Google generate my entire talk for me. And it was starting to get a little bit worrisome, maybe a little bit nightmarish. I want to remind everyone, you know, our future AI overlords will look back at how we treated their ancestors. So, you know, please remember to be polite as you interface with these tools. Okay, good. Well, that's all very nice. All right, so. It's all very nice. All right, so let's talk a little bit about how we usually think about moving between the actual Microsoft systems that we're working on and the kinds of theoretical descriptions that are usually used to describe them, at least in some domains. So here I found this beautiful picture of presumably it's 5 CB because that's what the website told me. How would I know otherwise? And you look at this, it's beautiful, and we know that going on. And we know that going on at the microscopic level, at least presumably, we believe at the microscopic level, there's atoms and molecules. And we kind of believe in the tradition of statistical physics that actually keeping track of all of, you know, Avogadro's number of degrees of freedom is a hopeless task. And what we should instead maybe care about, if we want to do something still beyond just thermodynamics, is do hydrodynamics or some kind of continuum description of our system. So we say, you know, let me. So we say, you know, let me look in spatial regions, let me average together the behavior of many of these molecules, and write down not a description of the evolution of the actual degrees of freedom, but of some kind of slow field variables. So maybe you write down the field of density and velocity and orientation. And we've seen over the last few days examples of like active Barris Edwards, for instance, where maybe you start with, oh, you've got some continuity, you've got some description. You've got some description of how the time derivative velocity depends on the stresses in your system. Maybe those stresses are themselves coupled to your orientational fields, your compression molecules. Those, if it's a new slow field, you need to write down the evolution equation for that as well, and on and on and on. And because I'm not actually going to be talking about liquid crystals today, for that, many of you have my apologies, I don't want to dwell too much on the details of. Too much on the details of this, so much as to say, how do we usually move between this picture, Avogadro's number of complicated molecules, to this kind of continuum description? And at least in my view, there are kind of two fundamental ways that you go about this, right? You know, option one is to stare with a certain fervored intensity at all of the microscopic details of your problem and start writing down an explicit coarse grading. An explicit course rating, invoke the many, many approximations that you'll need along the way, but then end up hopefully at some kind of to do description. The disadvantages of this are obvious. You need only look at what it did to Boltzmann to understand this is maybe not how you want to spend your life. But the benefits, of course, is that at the continuum level, you at least believe you have some understanding of how the microscopic details of your system enter into the coefficients in front of the different phenomena. Coefficients in front of the different phenomenological terms. So that's one way of proceeding with things. Of course, the other way of proceeding is, you know, to kind of wistfully gaze off into the distance and think about what are your slow variables, what are the symmetries, conservation laws that govern your system, and then just write down all the hydrodynamic terms consistent with those slow variables that are consistent with the symmetries of your system. The advantages of this approach are manifest. It is. Manifest, it is radically easier than this version of things. And the disadvantage is that you end up with phenomenological constants parameterizing this continuous structure. Okay, good. So I want to outline these two basic approaches because I want us to come away from this talk, sharing my ignorance of how we could do either of these things in the kind of systems that I'm going to describe. Okay, so what kinds of systems are we going to be? What kinds of systems are we going to be studying? You know, soft active matter has been amazing and progressing for many years now. And there's just all this beautiful stuff. You know, you've seen this image from this very paper several times at this conference. I just, I can stare at that video all day. Here's something where I think these are like actual droplets of different complex chemical oils that, because of chemotactic interactions, have this kind of predator-prey interaction. Have this kind of predator-prey interaction. It's kind of bizarre and beautiful. And the question that I want to ask is: you know, if we want to start applying these ideas of soft matter physics approaches to not just soft active systems, but actually soft living systems. What do we need to do? You know, it was a famous author who I believe once said, you know, all equilibrium systems are alike. Each non-equilibrium system is out of equilibrium in its own way. It's out of equilibrium in its own way. And, you know, certainly from the perspective of writing down a Landau theory, this is kind of right. You know, if you don't know that you're in equilibrium and you don't know how maybe degrees of freedom communicate information across scales, there's nothing to constrain the zoo of new terms that you might write down. So are there any ways of like coming up with some sort of framework that lets you describe out of equilibrium systems and often very out-of-equilibrium systems? Often very out of equilibrium systems in some kind of systematic way. Okay, right, so on this point of soft living matter, you know, as beautiful as these kind of things are, like, how do we move from describing systems that are like this to systems that are like this? I believe we saw the flocking video already in this talk. Also, these beautiful bait balls that coalesce eventually into these terrifying cyclones of fish. Of fish. You know, somehow it feels like in the move from writing down a theory that might describe something like this to a theory that might describe something like that, it feels like we need some kind of new physical intuition, physical insight, physical insight. And there was something else that I was going to say on this slide, but I've forgotten. I no longer have a long-term memory. So I apologize. Very good. Okay, so what are we going to do in this talk? You know, I want to be able to talk about hydrodynamic descriptions or large-scale simulations of these flocking organisms. So I'm going to tell you a little bit about some of the core variations of basic models of flocking that have been used in the physics community for decades at this point. One of the things that I wanted to come away with is that in some ways, you know, I'm studying an old problem, and I think there's still something that we deeply don't understand about this problem. So I'm going to be studying models of polarity. So, I'm going to be studying models of polar active matter with a few different variations. I'll tell you a little bit about some of the very large-scale simulations, some of our attempts at highly damp descriptions for those things that we do. And then I'm going to try to connect to this last point and say, okay, great, if we want to describe actual collective behavior in living systems, coarse-graining a bird at the level of an interacting particle, surely we need to consider some kind of unusual new Rogan symmetries in the system. New broken symmetries in the system, how might we write down these theories that include those? Okay. Okay. And I should say, of course, as I go, if there's any questions, obviously interrupt me, and I'll do my best. Very good. Just because it's going to come up a little bit later, and it's one of the cleanest ways I know to motivate something that I want to talk about a little bit later. You know, flocking phases, collective emotional phases in. Collective motional phases in living systems occur in all kinds of crazy contexts. Of course, there's the organismal scale where you get flocks of birds and fish or flocks of locusts, terrifying as they are to think about, but also, for instance, at the cellular scale. And by taking a dense epithelial monolayer and changing something about the complex biochemical regulatory pathways, you can actually induce them to go from a quiescent state. Epithelia, after all, wants. Epithelia, after all, want to act as a stationary barrier to a state where they collectively flock over really quite large scales across the cells. And that's important too, because epithelia also need to close moons. So flocking occurs at all these different scales, and not all of them look like birds or fish or whatever. Okay, so what is the canonical model of polar flocking matter? It's the V-Check model. And the way that I think it's easiest to think about what the V-Check model is. It's easiest to think about what the Vichev model is, especially for people with a physics background, is to start with the XY model. Imagine you have a lattice in two dimensions of spins that can point anywhere in the plane, evolving according to some Hamiltonian that wants to align these spins. It's a well-studied model, beautiful, beautiful domains and collective behavior you get out of it. It's all very nice. And VCHek's idea was fundamentally to say: let's take something like the X, Y. Let's take something like the XY model, but allow the spins to move off the lattice. In fact, to let them self-propel in whatever direction they happen to be pointing. Now, it's a little bit different than the actual XY model in the details. The original model, very much I should say, inspired by work in the computer graphics community almost a decade earlier than when we checked and collaborators were working, was to say, you know, at every time step, at every discrete update of this system of automata, update the Automata. Update the positions of particles by some kind of self-propulsion speed in whatever direction they happen to be pointing. So all of the interesting dynamics are in the orientational step, where you say, at every orientational update, look around at your neighbors. In this case, you know, everything that's within these red circles. Look around at your neighbors and try to adopt the average orientation that those neighbors are pointing in. And then that. In and then that orientational alignment is going to compete with both. Now, heuristically, how might you, because I don't want to actually do Boltzmann course reigning in front of people, right? Heuristically, how might you imagine deriving a continuum description based on these kind of microscopic dynamics? One way that you can kind of heuristically get to what's going to be the right answer is to imagine that you're back on the lattice and you want to. On the lattice, and you want to understand what happens relative to some lattice site, some agent on one of these lattice sites. If you want to understand, for instance, this orientational term, you can just do some kind of finite difference approximation and say, fantastic, the change in the orientation of this angle is whatever this is, minus theta i at time t. And that's going to be equal to the average of your neighbor's spins. Neighbors spins minus theta i at time t to subtract multiple signs. And then if you do, if you stare at this expression, you say, oh, that's just a finite difference version of the Laplacian, it's the discrete Laplacian. So in fact, this kind of orientational alignment term turns into something that looks like angular diffusion of the angular fields. And so one of the things that you would write down in your continuum description is this kind of Laplacian. Laplacian dynamics. And then you could repeat this exercise for other kinds of terms here. I wanted to have gone through, you can do this kind of heuristically because I'm going to do it again later on when I'm much less confident that it's correct. So because there's no objections, I proceed. And say, you know, what happens when you go ahead and coarse grain these kinds of microscopic models into macroscopic fields? The fields that I'm always going to be considering are the average density. Be considering are the average density field, and I'm going to go back and forth between a momentum field or a spin field. It's interchangeable, and don't worry too much about some of the details. I'm saying don't worry about the details because I'm going to be writing down equations that I think are not even the right equations, so over-analyzing them is maybe not the way to go. But so, the basic hydrodynamic description that you want to write down for these kind of flocking models are the famous kind of toner 2 hydrodynamics. Tone or two hypothetamics. Here I've simplified them a little bit by neglecting terms that definitely exist by symmetry but that don't control the overall phase behavior. You know, you have something that's like a continuity equation. You have a term here, an advective term, with a free coefficient in front of it. Normally, the coefficient in front of a vection would be set by the fact that your system has to be Galilean invariant. Here, because the system is out of equilibrium, because they're self-proportioned. System is out of equilibrium because they're self-propelling, you have this extra coefficient here, which is a signature of being out of equilibrium. And then you also say, well, there's some kind of generic alignment mechanism here, and I've written it in a different way because we're going to be varying that in different variations of this model. But you write it as some kind of Landau potential that favors a phase transition between the disordered state at high noise, when the birds just look like a crazy gas. Birds just look like a crazy gas and some kind of ordered flocking state. And so you have just like a very standard Landau potential, low-order ingredient, et cetera. Okay, so I said that was a simplified version of Toner 2. More generally, you could have... Yeah, please. One question. Can I get a picture of the previous slide? I just want to. Oh, yeah, of course. Yeah, the energy is this kind of Phi 4 potential of the sort that we saw in a previous speaker's talk. Yep, absolutely. Okay, so I could have proceeded in the Landau spirit, much more generally by symmetry, and said, you know, let me keep my continuity equation. And then for the time update of the velocity field, or momentum field, or whatever, I could have just written down. Or whatever, I could have just written down all the terms that I can think of that are combinations of velocities and gradients. Toner wrote the Landau potential as a u, so that's what this thing is doing out here. All the things that transform the right way that are consistent with the very limited symmetries of my problem, and then importantly, you know, plus some extra noise field about here. And this equation is quite complicated, and in fact, it's even worse than it looks because we remember that when we write down lambda. Remember that when we write down Landau descriptions, Landau-like descriptions, it's not just that we have low-order expansions in the fields themselves and the gradients of the fields, but also that all of these parameters, the lambdas, the D's, et cetera, are themselves analytic functions in things like the local density and all the coupling constants of our problem. So in fact, this equation is disgusting even if you believe everything is a constant sitting in front of these terms, and they're probably not constants. Probably not constants. Okay, good. Okay, but in the immortal words of John Toner, dadib, dadib, that's all, folks. Any other terms that you might have wanted to write down will have more gradients, so they'll be subdominant at long length scales, or they're not consistent with the symmetries of your problem. Okay, so before I come back to that very point, let me at least tell you a little bit about how these models behave in case you haven't seen, in case you haven't seen this, right? Seen, I guess you haven't seen this, right? So, indeed, here is just like a random simulation that I pulled of a large-scale system in the flocking state. So, at low noise, you get to this point where these millions of points are just flocking off in some direction. I think that's supposed to be represented by this schematic here. At very high noise, you just have a disordered state, and then you have this panoply of slightly more exotic states as you cross from the disordered. States as you cross from the disordered to the ordered state. So it's well known that even though you wrote down the land out potential that you think is consistent with continuous transitions, this is actually a model with a discontinuous phase transition. And so in between the ordered and disordered states, you have these microphase separated, or you have these phase-separated states that are often called the banding states. And because I want to talk not just about these Because I want to talk not just about these particulate simulations, but also what the fields are doing. If you take these kinds of simulations, coarse-grained regions of space into density fields and velocity fields, this is kind of what it looks like deep in the flocking state. I find these videos kind of pretty to look at. The density field is just doing its thing. The velocity field or the spin field in the direction of flocking is almost all aligned, and then there's these kind of short-lived fluctuations away from the flocking direction. Fluctuations away from the flock direction. And fluctuations transverse to the flock, that's the goldstone or the system, are actually quite large. Just with no particular structure, but there's large fluctuations transverse to the flock. Okay, so that's what you kind of expect to see. Now, it's clear that TONAR2 theory is a model of out-of-equilibrium polar active flocking systems, but does it actually have all of the relevant terms that you'd want to describe flocks of living organisms? Describe flocks of living organisms? Does it even have all the terms that you'd want to describe flocks of the VCHEC model? And I would argue, you know, despite the confidence with which it has been asserted that this model should also describe your flocks of living organisms, provided the flocks are large enough and have the same symmetries and conservation laws of VT, the standard V-Check model. I want to argue that it's not even obvious that that statement is correct. Is correct. Okay. In a fun way. Okay, good. Good. All right, so one of the things that I want to bring up, actually, this was mentioned in Cody's talk, I think, for the potential non-reciprocal interactions between plus a half and minus a half defects with this sort of deflection argument. It's very beautiful. So what's the idea? You know, when you're a classical particle, you kind of have to obey Newton's laws of motion. But when you are coarse graining over some non- Coarse graining over some non-equilibrium environment, and then looking at the behavior of the particle-like description of things that you're left with, there's no need for Newton's laws to actually still all obtain. So maybe you've been in the situation where you're trying to follow somebody in a crowd, and if they turn, you know, you turn too. So, if I treat you as a point particle, it's like there's a torque that the leader exerts on the follower. On the other hand, if you turn, Hand, if you turn, the leader does absolutely nothing. They just don't care. Maybe they care, but they don't notice, and there's a time-delayed interaction. And so you have this kind of non-reciprocity of torus or of forces that can come up when you have coarse-grained your system over some non-equilibrium background. So it's kind of obvious that that kind of mechanism would exist in real birds. One question that I want to ask is: can we understand how these kinds Can we understand how these kinds of broken symmetries, breaking kind of the symmetry of classical mechanics, affects the hydrodynamic descriptions we want to write down? And then I'll also want to ask, maybe this is present even in just the standard VGP element. And I'm glancing at the time and noticing that I'm going a little bit more slowly than I wanted. So I'll just say, again, actually, it's pretty generic that if you're coarse-graining, especially living systems or even non-living systems, Or even non-living systems, but whose interactions are mediated by a non-equilibrium environment, like these complex plasmas that are studied by a group across the hall from me and Emory, this kind of non-reciprocal style of interaction is actually quite common. Okay, so first, the V-Check model actually has exactly this feature buried inside of it. It's not at all obvious, I think, but there you go. You know, when I wrote down the XY model, I wrote down a potential. I wrote down a potential, and once you write down a potential, say your forces are negative gradients of that potential, you don't have to worry anymore. But the VCheck model had a slightly different character. It kind of said, your angular update depends on the average orientation of your neighbors. And when you say that, suddenly the number of neighbors that I have enters into my description. So for instance, if I have these cells and they have some kind of orientational alignment, I can think about how does the orientation of cells Does the orientation of cell zero influence the six cells around it, and vice versa? And just because the cell in the center here has a different number of neighbors than the cells on the periphery, you could say, ah, the way that zero influences one is normalized by a slightly different number than the way one influences zero. It's very subtle. It depends only on the fact that you might have a slightly different neighbor number than your neighbors. Than your neighbors. Okay? But this is enough to at least give you some kind of very weak, very modest non-reciprocity in the way your aligning interactions work. Okay, so I want to tell you how you kind of move from this observation to some kind of new continuum term. And then I want to ask, of course, should we care? And presumably we should, otherwise I wouldn't be telling you. But I'm not that confident. So, yeah. Now, how heuristically, again, without Now, how heuristically, again without actually doing Boltzmann coarse graining in front of you, how heuristically should I generate a new continuum term based on this microscopic dynamics? I'm going to go back to this kind of lattice description. So I'm going to say that my averaging dynamics, you know, updates in theta with time depend on the number of neighbors that I has. And then I can kind of quantify the amount of non-reciprocal force here by some kind of inverse. By some kind of inverse ratio of how many neighbors do I have versus how many neighbors does my neighbor have, and then summed over all of my neighbors. I then say, okay, I'm just going to put on a lattice both a density and orientational field, and I'm going to say at each lattice location, everything happens to be pointing in the same direction. I do some kind of finite difference approximations, and that gives me a sense of what new continuum terms I should be writing in my hyperfinamics. Okay, and I'll write this a little bit. And I'll write this a little bit more cleanly on the next slide. So, what do you end up with? You end up with these very weakly non-reciprocal hydrodynamics. Again, hydrodynamics where the non-reciprocity is just in this neighborhood potential fluctuations. Very good. So what do you have? You basically get what you started with, toner 2, but now you have these two new terms. And I'm going to be switching notation for the coefficients all over the place. For the coefficients all over the place, so I apologize for that. I just named this. You have something that looks like the Laplacian in the inverse neighbor number field. And here I've written this into the Landau-like potential just because you could, well, the term that I got on the previous slide, you can write as the derivative of some free energy. It's fine. But then you have an advective term, so inverse neighbor number, almost acting as a source of advection for the fluid velocities or for the spins. Fluid velocities or for the spinths. And that's not something that I could derive. So I have these two new terms, one of which I suppose in principle could have been there even in an equilibrium description, presumably at weird higher orders, and presumably also in terms of some additional field. And usually you say you don't just add new hydrodynamic fields, they probably relax quickly relative to the slow variables. So you might have Slow variables. So you might have written down something like this, probably not with an inverse field, but you might have. It's allowed in equilibrium. But the really novel thing, in some ways, is this advective-like term. And we'll come back to that in a little bit. So what is this neighbor field? And I need to tell you about a few different variations of these VCheck models that are super common. Of course, the most common is just to say I choose neighbors within some range, right? Within some range, right? And in this case, it's clear why you get a new, you don't actually get a new field, because the neighbor number field is just going to be proportional to your density field. That's fine. On the other hand, when you have sets of flocking epithelia, or it's even been argued when you have birds, you know, birds don't carry around a ruler with them and a line only with things that are within some fixed distance. People have argued for some kind of more graph-based or topological way. Based or topological way of choosing neighbors. And the easiest way to do this is to kind of choose a Voronoi partitioning of space and say, you know, a point is a neighbor of another point if the Voronoi cell shares an edge. This is why I started this project. I had constructed computational algorithms to do this step very efficiently in the context of cell models, and I gave, as a rotation project, to a student in 2019. Project to a student in 2019, something that I thought was going to be trivial. And I realized more and more how little I understood about the problem. So it's been a fun trip. So, okay, so this is just what I said. In the metric case, the neighbor number field is really just another name for the density field. Please ignore the fact that I've written proportional to one over density. That's definitely wrong. But the character of it is kind of correct. When you do a vorn. When you do a Vorn-Way partition of a random point set, or even a quasi-random point set, regions that have low density tend to have many more neighbors, and regions of high density tend to have many fewer neighbors. So there's some kind of monotonic relationship between the average neighbor field and the average density field, which is monotonically decreasing rather than increasing as you switch between these different fields. And I'll argue that that's important. They wrote it. They wrote it. Uh, good. Good. Okay, so great. You have this hydrodynamic description. What is the standard strategy for using it to try to predict some kind of new collective fields? The standard strategy is to posit the structure and existence of a phase that you already suspect exists, and then ask, are these hydrodynamic equations stable to perturbations? So, for instance, I believe that there's going to be. Instance, I believe that there's going to be a uniform flocking state where everything is mostly moving in the same direction. So let me assume that my density and here again I've switched back and forth, my momentum fields are like some bare homogeneous values plus fluctuations. Fluctuations of the density and then fluctuations both parallel and transverse to the direction of the average one. Okay, good. Okay, and then we remember. And then we remember that actually the hydrodynamic equations also had this noise term. It's a multiplicative noise, where the number of particles in some coarse-grained region amplifies the amount of noise in the system. So you pull out Landau Lifshitz, you do this kind of standard fluctuating hydrodynamics machinery. You say, I'm going to start with these continuum equations. I'll define averages with respect to realizations of the noise. Realizations of the noise. You realize that the evolution of these average fields depends on the structure of the correlations of these fluctuations. You write down a time evolution equation for those. You figure out in Fourier space what those different fluctuation correlators are. You integrate to get back to the real space fluctuation or real space correlations. There's some interesting scaling functions. You remember that you also needed to have correlation. Needed to have correlations of gradients of these fluctuations. One of the reasons that I'm not spending very much time on this is that, again, I'm not even confident that I started with the right hydrodynamic terms. I mean, among other things, I started with simplified tone or two with these novel terms. Not even full tone or two. And doing this for full tone or two is already something that people just don't do. They look at it and they say no thanks. So, so, and it's not. And it's not nice even at this level. Oh, but what you find by working through this machinery, at least one of the first things that you find, is that these fluctuations re-normalize the Landau potential for the order parameter field that tells you if you're in the disordered of the flocking state. One thing that jumps out is that you get what would correspond to a phi cubed term in the Landau potential, this thing right here, which already tells you that you suspect. Which already tells you that you suspect that it's actually going to be a first-order transition rather than a second-order transition. And then you learn some other interesting things about the relative strengths of these fields, and you can go and measure the simulations. It's all very nice. Some of the predictions and quotation marks that you get out of this is, again, you suspect that non-reciprocity favors discontinuous transitions, even in topological versions of this blocking model. This is a very technical point that I think. Technical point that I think resolves something in the literature. And here you can see the existence of the first band. It turns out you needed to simulate million particle systems in order to see this, but it is what it is. You also get some detailed predictions about how the critical point moves around, as you can see the variations of model, that makes sense. You add details and detailed things like the location when they're obviously allowed to change. But I thought maybe I should. But I thought maybe I should give you a much more visceral demonstration of how important just adding this little bit of non-reciprocity really is. So let's look at how non-reciprocity, just this subtle non-reciprocity in the density field, neighbor number field, affects collisions. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to have a simulation of a few hundred thousand of these flocking agents in a disk moving on a collision course. And because of the data that my student sent me, The data that my student sent me, the videos are going to start at the moment of the collision. But this is the geometry of what's about to happen. So, all I'm going to show you is the difference between, okay, something that could have been derived from a potential, so that the angular interactions depend on just some constant relaxation term, versus if they depend on the number of neighbors that each particle actually has. So, in the reciprocal case, in the normal case, I collide these two. Case, I collide these two flocks and they scatter. It reminds me, I once saw, not in person of course, but on a video, a collision of two asteroids colliding together and they did the same thing. It was beautiful. Okay, great. So just by changing this alpha from, I think we used six in the simulation, to one over how many neighbors do I have, what's going to happen? Heuristically, we know what's going to happen. We believe that there's going to be some. Going to happen, we believe that there's going to be some source of advection along directions of one over the neighborhood fields. Does that matter? I believe it does. Okay, so great. Somehow, I want to say that the long-time, large length-scale hydrodynamics of what's going on over here, very, very different from what's going on over there. All because of just the super tiny breaking of a symmetry that. Tiny breaking of a symmetry that we knew didn't really exist, but we assumed didn't matter. And shoot, like, I said that I wanted to understand how we move from this to this, and somehow, do I say this on this slide or the next? I'm not sure. Somehow it feels like I've tackled the least important part of the problem in moving from here to here, right? Just this very subtle point. Just this very subtle point about some very random computational model from the 90s. And already I don't really understand how that works. I should emphasize, by the way, that the kind of hydrodynamic terms, hydrodynamic equations that I wrote down over here, but imagine the continuum non-fluctuating versions of them, don't really anticipate something quite as dramatic as this going on, which is why I think we don't really completely. Why I think we don't really completely understand what the continuum description should be. Partly, it's because these kinds of models lead to very non-trivial fluctuations in the density fields. So all the things about gradients in higher order gradients and density being small compared to other terms start getting thrown out the window. And then I don't even know what to do. Right. Yes, yes. So neighbor number meets. Right, yes, yes. So neighbor number mediated anonymous process is surely the least important gap between the kind of models that I've been considering and these kind of systems. You know, I really don't want to have to think about doing even lattice-like coarse graining, let alone legitimate Boltzmann coarse greening, when I ask, what about the microscopic interactions that might be going on between actual birds or between actual locusts or fish or whatever? So we saw that in this case, one of the things that happened was that we got this kind of anomalous. That we got this kind of anomalous advection term, where one over the neighbor number field is the thing doing the additional advection in the system. And actually, there's this beautiful paper by Sarah Luce and Sabine Klapp in which they argue that the kind of Landau-like heuristic of what kind of continuum terms should you be writing down is to say when you've broken reciprocity at the microscopic level, what ends up happening? Level, what ends up happening is a kind of anomalous adduction where the thing doing the adduction ends up being related to the way you broke reciprocity in the first place. So in our case, we broke reciprocity by these neighbor-number-mediated interactions, and the thing we derived is some kind of neighbor-number-mediated advective term. This actually helps explain why some of the ways that birds are different from flocks actually don't matter for the hydrodynamics as much as worrying. For the hydrodynamics, as much as you are. Because, for instance, in this like vision cone version of things, the thing that breaks reciprocity is also something that depends on the direction that you're pointing in. And so the thing that does the advection might end up being folded into the coefficient in front of the normal advective term, right? So some breakings of reciprocity give you similar hydrodynamics, where you have maybe even less certainty about what the coefficients are, but you didn't believe you understood. Coefficients are, but you didn't believe you understood the coefficients in the first place, so that's fine. So that's at least one way of getting a handle on what's going on here. But I want to spend the next few minutes with a different kind of broken symmetry in these flocks that I even more deeply don't understand how to deal with. And that's this idea of time delayed in rhetoric chains, right? This idea that maybe if I'm flying. Maybe if I'm following someone and they turn, I do something, and if I turn, it takes them some time to realize something has happened. On the one hand, actually, this very same paper argues that you can kind of write a time-delayed interaction as if it is an equal-time but non-reciprocal interaction, but in a complicated way. I actually don't understand the argument, so I've been trying to understand it for the last few years. Um so so maybe there's a connection between the first part of my talk and the second, but I'm not sure. Part of my talk in the second, but I'm not sure. Okay, but so what do I want to do? I want to understand just what this broken symmetry of reaction time updated might be. When I do the numerical implementation of these continuum equations, of these particle-based equations, the V-Check model or its variations, you update everything in synchrony. So you calculate the forces, you update the positions, you update the orientations, you go in them, right? You go to them. Now, in real life, of course, we know that there's some distribution of how fast things react to other things. So, this is often measured by the classic. I don't know if you've ever tried the Uler test where, I don't know, it's fun in its own way. And I found this random humanbenchmark.com website, which felt intimidating, that measured some interesting distribution of reaction times in human subjects. You know, it's not the broadest distribution in the world, I guess, on the scale of things. I guess on the scale of things, but it's definitely not like a delta function. So in the simulations, it's kind of trivial to include this kind of effect. You can say, rather than updating things in synchrony at every time step, maybe you still assume some separation of time scales. But you can say, oh, you know, like I'll move the particles, I'll let particles think about who their neighbors are, but then I'll say, you know, this particle gets to adjust its orientation before that one does. Before that happens. It's a trivial change in the code to make. It feels motivated by the way actual flocking aligning systems might work. I don't know at all how to write this in the continuum language, but I know that it matters. So if you just do simulations of these large-scale flocks, so here is the same evolution of density fields that I showed you before. The density field is flocking. In this case, I'm always aligning the flock direction. I'm always aligning the flock direction to the right. The magnitude of the spins in the flocking direction is large with these fast, uncorrelated fluctuations, and the transverse fluctuations are large, but with no particular structure. If you just add this kind of, at every time step, some things change their orientation before others, you self-organize spatially what these transverse fluctuations are. What are these transverse fluctuations? And you end up moving into this PT symmetric phase. So now I still have, on average, things moving to the right just as strongly as up here. But now I've organized into counter-propagating bits. So the fact that it's a PT symmetric phase surely tells me something about the new terms that I ought to write down, but not in a way that I can comprehend. Yeah, please. This might be a very simple question. It's just a terminology question. Question. It's just a terminology question. What do you mean by PT symmetry? Yeah, I mean parody and time. So in this case, if you imagine playing the movie backwards and flipping up and down in these videos, the videos would look identical. Okay, good. And this kind of PT symmetry breaking at least reminds you of the kind of self-organized chiral phases that you see in actual flocking. Phases that you see in actual flocking systems, is it the right mechanism? Probably not, right? I mean, like, there's this whole zoo of potential ways that fish are much more complicated to be out of equilibrium than the sorts of simple-minded models I'm writing down, but it at least has some of the right flavors. And then we've done some work to kind of characterize the fact that this is indeed, you know, some kind of interesting phase transition between, in this case, between the normal flocking phase going through. Normal flocking phase going through a critical point, this kind of PT symmetric flock. And I'm sorry, Daniel? Yeah. Professor. Couldn't you have delays, like differential delay equations? Would that capture some of it? You could definitely write down differential delay equations. I don't know. Sorry, I'm too ignorant to understand the technology. Ignorant to understand the technology that would let me evaluate what phases are then stable with those terms added to a background of tone or two-like equations in the first place. So that's the thing. Maybe the answer is it's just the machinery is too difficult and it's too bad. But I would prefer if there was a simpler, non-time delayed framework that I could then at least try to apply the standard machinery to. It's disappointing. Those things explain things like how a PC signal turns into AC. That's right. That's right. That's right. And so maybe when I'm already in the flocking phase and I can neglect some of the terms in my hydrodynamics, maybe what's left over is explainable by this. That's exactly right. Given the time, I think I want to just briefly mention that the existence of this phase may be sensitive to the presence of these kind of other non-reciprocal terms that I mentioned about, or that I talked about. You can make some kind of arguments asking whether the existence of this term here stabilizes or destabilizes these phases. And it's interesting, but it's not the core part of the talk. And so, in the interest of The core part of the talk, and so, in the interest of time, I'll just move to the summary and say: you know, when we move from these active systems of study to systems that are like collections of biological agents, we're coarse-greening even more dramatically than we were in the case of just active matter. And this really radically expands the set of terms that you might have to consider in your Heidi-Mann equations, for instance, to understand this. In your hiding end equations, for instance, to understand this, in ways that it feels like there's no handle level. So, one nice thing is that there's this argument that these kind of non-reciprocal terms that you might end up with generically might correspond to anomalous invective-like terms. It's not clear to me the right language to also fit time-delayed interactions into this, but that all of the actual phases that you might observe could be exquisitely sensitive, even just to very subtle changes in microscopic patterns. And of course, let me just close with thanks again to my research group. And most of this was done by a senior graduate student, Charles Packard, who should be graduating this coming semester. And if anyone is on the market for a postdoc, you should let me know. All right, thanks very much. Thank you. Questions? So I understand correctly that the metric model has a cutoff distance.
