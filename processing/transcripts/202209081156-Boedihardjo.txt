So it's going to talk about non-mentioned property of signatures. So please go ahead. Okay. Yeah, so thanks to the organizers for the chance to speak here. So I want to talk about joint work with Seeken from Melbourne, who I wrote this work with. So I guess you've heard about signatures many times already, but Lectures many times already, but in this talk, we're going to focus on bounded variation path. And actually, for what we're going to talk about, the theorem that we're going to establish is actually not true for rough path. It's only true for bounded variation path. So given a bounded variation path, the iterative integrals of bounded variation path can be defined in the classical minor. So we're going to study this. So, we're going to study the signature of our band variation path, which is a sequence of iterated integrals, the nth term being the order n iterated integrals of the path. So, fundamental motivations of everything that we want to do, of all what we're trying to do here, is to try and extract geometric information about the path or not. Path or not any information about a path from a signature. So there's some relatively straightforward information you can extract from the signature. So the first term of the signature is the increments of the path. It's kind of a one-dimensional information increments. And you can also get a two-dimensional information from the second term of the signature. So from the second term of the signature, So, from the second term of the signature, you can get, first of all, the increment square, tensor square of the increments, plus anti-symmetric parts. The anti-symmetric parts, it's probably easiest to describe the anti-symmetric parts when you have a planar path, so two-dimensional path that is a loop. And in that case, this A01 is the area enclosed by the loop. The area enclosed by the loop, but there's a generalization of that even if your path is not a loop. So there's one remark I want to make, which is that in some sense, the second term contain more information than the first term. I mean, in the second term, you can get the area as well as the increment square. So in some sense, up to a sign, you almost get the increments back as well. Almost get the increments back as well. In fact, if you move further and further along the sequence, then you get more and more information. I mean, you get your tensor is higher and higher dimensional, but in fact, you have a strictly, you have almost a strictly increasing set of information. And the high-order term in the signature contain information. Information, well, the high-order terms of the signature, in some sense, tell you what the low-order term should be, because well, the second-order term tell you about the increments in some sense. So these two are kind of the two basic information you can extract, two basic information about a path you can extract from the signature. But what is perhaps less well? But what is perhaps less well known is that you can extract something more complicated. You can extract the length from the signature. And this is not particularly trivial because the length, I mean, to calculate the length, I mean, in some sense, the signature tells you the integral over the whole path. To calculate the length, you somehow have to chop your path into little bits and then calculate the norm of each small. Calculates the norm of each small increment and add them up. So, in order to get the length back, you have to kind of get the local information about the path from this global information, which is the signature. And that is really difficult. I mean, it's a bit like, you know, from the Fourier transform, you try to get that, get the function back. So, but under regularity condition on your path, this is possible, and that was shown by. Path, this is possible, and that was shown by Hambley-Lyons and Lyons Shu that if your path is parametrized by unit speed, and under this unit speed parameterization, the path has one continuous derivative, then the limiting asymptotics of the signature would give you the length of a path. So we already said you can recover the increments and the area of the path. This is a third piece of information that you can recover from the path. From the path. So, I mean, I want to focus on this limit because the proof of Hembley lines really require us to take a limit superior rather than the limit. So, then motivated by this formula, linking the length and the signature, an interesting question which is first raised by Chang Lyons and me. Need and answer by them as well, which is whether this limit superior actually exists as a limit. So, I mean, limit is a lot easier to calculate than limit superior in some way. So, we can maybe explore this question first through an example, but before that, maybe. But before that, maybe let me first describe what is the condition on this norm, because Hamble Lions actually proved their theorem under conditions on the norm. And we need the condition we have on the norm is stronger than the condition we need for rough path theory to work. For rough path theory to work, we need our norm to be admissible. Our norm to be admissible in the sense that if you take the tensor product of v and w, it's less than or equal to norm of v times norm of w. But for in order to prove Hamble-Land's results and in order to prove the results of Chang, Nians, and Ni, we need this to be equality because we need some kind of lower bound on the norm as well. So this is the first condition on the norm. This is not a test. The norm. This is not a terribly restrictive condition, but we have to assume this in order to get our results. Second condition we have is a kind of permutation invariance on the norm. So if you take your n tensor, which is n r d vectors tensor together and you permute, reorder the tensors, then the reordered 10. The reordered 10. So, this defines a map on tensors, but then you can extend this as a linear map on the whole degree n tensor to all degree n tensors. And then this defines a linear map from degree n tensors to degree n tensors. And then the norm is invariant under this sigma map. So your norm is in some sense. So, your norm is in some sense doesn't care about commutative with respect to the places the tensors are. So, we're going to see why this permutation invariance is important, but let me perhaps just say that this classical norm, which is the Euclidean norm, by identifying the The this basis, tensor basis with a Euclidean space, is this satisfies all the conditions we have. Sorry, I mean to say it's a cross-norm and it satisfies both the permutation invariance and this multiplicative property. So we can have a look at why these why this first condition is important. So let's look at the So let's look at the simplest kind of path, which is kind of the only path where we can write down the signature quite explicitly. So this is the example where you have a line segment. So Xt is equal to a RD value vector times t. So in this case, you can plug it into the formula for signature. And then you see that this is a tensor to the power n divided by n factorial. Divided by n factorial, so you can rearrange this and then put the n factorial on the other side. Take the norm, take the nth root, you get the norm of a back. And in order to show this, you already see that you need the multiplicative property to hold. And well, in some sense, this is a special case of Hambley lines. Formula is the trivial case of. Formula is the trivial case of that because the norm of A is also there. If you take the Euclidean norm, then the norm of A is also the length of the path X. So this is an example where you can recover the length of a path from this limiting asymptotics, albeit a fairly trivial example. And another thing to note is that in this case, the limit exists, not just the limit superior. So, can we generalize this to a more complicated path that is not a line segment? I mean, already for a piecewise linear path, there is quite non-trivial. I mean, the piecewise linear path, the nth terminal signatures can be written out in a way. Sorry, this A is meant to be A1. And because you have a sum here, so You have a sum here, so you've got terms which may cancel out each other. So you may have some positive terms, may have some negative terms. I mean, this a1 and a2 may not both be pointing in the same direction. So there could be cancellations between terms within this sum, which makes trying to get a lower band for this norm more complicated. I mean, you can get an upper band using triangle, you can call it the norm in. Triangle you can quality put the norm inside the sum, but getting a lower bound is very complicated. Just to see why this is complicated, I mean, in fact, if a1 is minus a2, this is actually zero for n larger than or equal to two. So you need to carefully analyze and make sure that a1 doesn't cancel with a two. Cancel with A2. So this is a non-trivial problem to even just show that this exists for general path. And for rough path, I mentioned that it's not true for rough path, what I'm going to talk about in this talk, because for rough path, for a particular rough path called the pure area path, I'm not going to define this, but I'm just going to assert that for this pure area path is zero in the odd degree. In the odd degree term, and then is it decays like n over 2 factorial in the even degree term. So if you multiply that by n factorial and then take the nth root, the even degree term tends to infinity, the odd degree terms tend to zero. So you have two sub-sequence tending to a different limit. So in that particular case, this limit does not exist. So what I'm going to talk about, so the existence of limit, even if it's So the existence of limit, even if it is true, is very specific to a bounded variation path. So we want to understand the sequence of real number. Do we at least know that it's bounded? Showing that it's bounded is very, very easy. It's classical because signature is invariants and the reparameterization. So you can reparametrize your path by unit speed. So there is limit. By unit speed, so that is Lipschitz. So, this is what I mean by parametrization invariance. There is a Lipschitz path with the same signature. And the Lipschitz norm is the one variation of the original path. And then let me perhaps illustrate where does the n factorial come from. So, if you try and imagine you try to prove this inequality holds for. If the quantity holds for all n, try to prove that by induction, then you can express the nth term of the signature as an integral. You can express the n plus one term of the signature in terms of the integral, the nth term. And then you can use triangle inequality and then put the norm inside. Then you have the derivative of x, which is this dx. We can use this Lipschitz relation to ban. Lipschitz relation to bound bx. So we have this term here, and then we use induction hypothesis to ban the integrand. And then now you see you're integrating s to the power n and integrate s to the power n give you an n plus 1 factorial. So getting an upper bound is extremely easy. Getting a lower bound much harder because you can't just put the norm inside the integral. So we know that, so remember, we are interested in this sequence, and we know now that it's bounded. Does it exist? And one really important observations, which was made by Chang Lai's Ni is that the group-like property of the signature is key. But maybe let me first recap what do we mean? I mean by the group-like property. So I'm going to just So, I'm gonna, there's various ways you can formulate the group-like property, but for our purpose, the tensor product formulation is the most convenient. So, if you have a sequence of tensor, we say that group-like, if the tensor product of AN and AM can be expressed as a permutation of, can be expressed as a linear map, a linear combination of the n plus m tensor. So, product of two. So, the product of two low-order terms can be expressed as a linear function of a higher order term. And this sigma has, we know exactly what this sigma is, the permutation of tensor and it's a specific kind of permutation of tensor, which is called a shuffle. So, the precise definition for the purpose of our talk is not. Purpose of our talk is not particularly important. Important thing is that there is n plus m factorial divided by n factorial times m factorial of them. So these kind of permutations preserve the order of the first n number and the last m number. So in total, there's n plus m factorial permutation, but because you were fixing the ordering of the first n, so we Of the first n, so we divide by n factorial, and we're fixing the order of the last m, so we divide by n factorial as well. So, I mean, the more important thing is that you can express a n times a m in terms of a linear combination, and this linear combination have these many terms. So, using this property, Chang Lai and Sni managed to show. Chang Lai and Sni managed to show the following results: that given a group-like elements, you can given a cross-norm, this limit single symptotics actually exists provided that you take the limit along a sequence of non-zero signatures. So, you can only take the limit along a sequence where the terms are non-zero. So, this gives rise to a natural question. I mean, it's a bit inconvenient if we always have to only take a limit along non-zero terms in a signature. So can we improve that into a limit along all terms in the signature? And this is our main result. So if x is a, if you have a bounded variation continuous path, continuous path. If your path has infinitely many, if infinitely many terms in the signature is equal to zero, then it must be equal to zero for all terms. And this is possible for tree-like path. So tree-like path is the only path whose signature has infinitely many zeros. And this is specific to bounded variation path because in the case of too rough path, we need In the case of two rough paths, we know that all the even degree terms are zero and all the odd degree terms are non-zero. So the bounded variation assumption is important. And combining this result, this non-zero result with the Chang-Lyons-Ni theorem, we know that this limiting asymptotics exists and is actually, well, we already show that it's finite. Well, we already showed it's finite because we have shown an upper bound before. And when is it zero is zero? The only time when it's zero is when your path is tree-like. So I won't have time to go through the proof, but I do want to go through a proof of this key lemma, which we use and which was also used in Chiang Lai and Snee's results, is first proof in Chang Lion's Ni's paper. Paper. So, and what is striking is that group-like property, which is primarily algebraic property, really gives you a very strong analytic lower bound. And in fact, using a group-like property alone, you can show this inequality that if you multiply the nth term of your group-like elements by n factorial and multiply the nth term by nth factorial, then this is bounded up. Factorial, then this is bounded above by n plus m well, bounded above by the same thing, but with n plus m replacing n. I'm going to show you the proof. Proof is three lines, and this really shows you how powerful the group-like property is in understanding the norm of signature. So I'm just now copying the definition of group-like property, tensor product of the nth term times the mtherm is this linear combination of the nth. Linear combination of the n plus m term of the signature. So now I'm going to take the norm on both sides. So on the left-hand side. So on the left-hand side, by the multiplicative property, this is the norm of g n times the norm of gm. This is using the fact that it's a cross-norm. This is why the cross-norm assumption is so important. Right-hand side, we use the triangle in the corner. Use the triangle inequality, which is why we get a less than or equal to here. And now remember that we know how many terms are there in the sum. There is n plus m choose n, that many terms. And so, oh, one thing I forgot to say is that here we also use the permutation invariance. So when we take the norm of sigma g n. The norm of sigma g n plus m this can be replaced by just the norm of g of n plus m. So all of the terms in this sum have the same norm, which means that when we take the sum of the norm, this can be replaced by the number of terms in the sum times the norm of each term. And so you get this super multiplicative property. So I haven't got time to go through. Time to go through more of this, but Chang Laio's Ni's lemma and what we are trying to prove basically, you know, really just stem from analyzing this lemma. And I think probably I have to stop. About three minutes with questions. Okay, yes. Yes, I'll stop here then. Let's turn this off, and then let's see. So, do we have
