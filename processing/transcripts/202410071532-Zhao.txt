The first speaker is Professor Xinyu Jiao from University of Tennessee, Knoxville. And she's going to talk about her work on fabrication problems in the pre-boundary model for early agnostic late developments. Thank you. And thank you for having me here. It's my great pleasure to present my research book at first because Ben is. Because BEF is always a dream place to visit for me. So, I really want to thank the organizers for the kind invitation and the wonderful organization. So, today I'm going to discuss the bifurcation analysis in a free boundary platformation model for early atherosclerosis. And you have seen the model in the morning session in Evana and Faith's talk. But I will add more details about the research. Details about the research and the result. So let's begin with some backgrounds. Atherosclerosis is a disease in which there is a buildup of plaque inside the artery. And you can see this image for a normal artery and an artery with a buildup of plaque. And you can see in the top of this figure, a normal artery is like a hollow tube where blood can flow freely inside the tube. The tube. And if a plaque grows inside the artery wall, the region where the blood can flow freely gets narrowed. And it often leads to high blood pressure in patients. And what makes things worse is when the plaque accumulates more and ruptures. So when plaque ruptures, it will cause a large amount of blood loss, which may come Blood clots, which may completely or partially block the artery. And if that happens, then some severe heart disease will happen. Here is some data I found from the NIH website. Atherosclerosis is the underlying cause of about half of all deaths in the Western world. And in the United States, about 610,000 people die of heart disease each year. Each year. So it is biologically very important to analyze the plaque formation process. And in this project, I will use a grid boundary model to analyze the process. And before we look at the mass model, let's use a couple minutes to discuss the process and understand some key components. The process of plaque formation is largely determined by two Is largely determined by two kinds of cluster. One is LDL and one is HDL. You have seen that in Bayes' talk. LDL is short for low-density lipoproton and HDL is short for high-density lipoproton. Both LDL and HDL can be oxidized with free radicals in the internal, but they will play totally different roles in this process. So briefly speaking, LDL is a bad guy. We don't want that. Is a bad guy. We don't want that. It is bad because after LDL gets oxidized with free radicals, then the oxidized LDL will attract microphages and be ingested by microphages. And the ingestion of a large amount of oxidized LDL will make microphages fatty and heavier. So then the injection, the large amount of injection, will make microphages. Will make microphages to become form cells, and accumulation of form cells lead to the plaque formation. So, in general, briefly speaking, LDL is bad. And this process can be slowed down by HDL, which is the good cluster. HDL is good for two reasons. First, HDL can remove microphages from worm cells. It is a process called reverse cluster transport. Reverse cluster transport. And secondly, HDL can also be oxidized with free radicals. So HDL will compete with LDL on free radicals, and it will reduce the amount of free radicals that are available to oxidize LDL. So you have seen this figure. This figure illustrates the interplay among these key components. You can see LDL promotes the transformation from microphages. Transformation from microphages to form cells, while HDL blocked this process by reverting form cells back into microphages. And I want to mention that the microphages after this reverse cluster transport are not the same microphages for the original microphages. So you can see we have two different names for these microphages, M1 and M2 microphages. So M1 microphages are the original microphages which are capable Microphages, which are capable of combining with oxidized LDL and generate new form cells. And M2 microphages are the microphages after reverse cluster transport. And they lose the ability to combine with LDL and generate form cells. So this M2 microphages will not contribute to this transformation. And in order to simplify the model, one can combine these two. Model, one can combine these two microphages and use a single variable to represent the combined density of M1 and M2 microphages. And in our work, we will use that simplification, so we only use one variable for microphages, but it combines M1 microphages and M2 microphages. Another key simplification we made in the model is: we assume the artery is a very long civil cylinder, and we assume the Cylinder, and we assume the radiance of that long cellular cylinder has been normalized to be 1. And with this assumption, we can focus only on a cross-section of an artery, which is a 2D problem. And you can see here, the cross-section of an artery is divided into two main regions. The white region, this white inner region, is the blood flow region, so this is the region where blood can flow freely. Can flow freely, and the shaded region is the plaque region. And since plaque can evolve over time, so these two regions depend on time. And these two regions are separated by a free boundary, which also involves over time. In the Plaque region, we let L and H to be the concentration of LDL and HDL respectively, and we denote M by the density of microphages. The density of microphages and F by the density of form cells. So these four variables satisfy the following equations. And as mentioned by Bei in the morning session, this model is a simplified model of the original model. The original model was proposed by Friedman and Howe in 2014, and if I remember it correctly, there are in total 17 variables in the original model, which makes a big challenge to carry out any theoretical. Big challenge to carry out any theoretical analysis. So, in the next year, Friedman, Hao, and Wu proposed this simplified model. In this simplified model, it is assumed that the microphages ingest oxidized LDL in this rate as expressed in a mechanic-mental form. And it also causes a loss of microphages. A loss of microphages at the same rate and the production of form cells at the same rate. And this negative rho 1 is the decay rate of LDL. Then in the second equation, the loss of HDL comes from two parts. One is from the reverse cluster transport, and it also caused the same rate loss of form cells and the same rate increase of the microphages. Of the microphages, and row 2 is the decay rate of HDL. In the third and last equation, the row 3 and row 4 are the death rate of microphages and form cells, respectively, and there is an actual term. So this term is actual. It does not appear in any other equations. The explanation of this actual term is based on two parts. So the numerator is So the numerator is the ingestion, is the ingestion of microphages, is the injection of oxidized LDL by microphages. So the numerator accounts for the formation of form cells. And the denominator we have H, it is based on the fact that HDL removes free radicals. So HDL, remember HDL, block this process because HDL will compete with LDL on free radicals. With LDL on free radicals. So HDL is in the denominator. And then we made another assumption. We assume the total density of cells is a constant. So we have the total, the combined density of microphages and form cells is equal to a constant M sub 0. With this assumption, we can replace M by M 0 minus F. 0 minus f. So we further reduce one equation. Well, and then given that this combined cell density is a constant, so if the plaque is growing, we have more form cells, then the volume of the plaque is also growing. And the volume change gives rise to an internal force because cells are moving, pushing each other. Are moving, approaching each other. So it gives rise to an internal pressure and a velocity, which was included in the previous equations. And we can assume the plaque is like polarized, so the internal pressure is given by Darcy's law. And as a result, we derive this equation for the internal pressure P. And in terms of the boundary conditions, we assume non-flux boundary condition on the blood vessel wall. This non-flux boundary condition simply represents that there are no exchange on the blood vessel wall. And on the free boundary, we assume the following boundary conditions, where L node and H node are the concentration of LDL and HDL in the blood, and we assume there are no form cells in the blood. Warm cells in the blood. And this kappa means the mean curvature of the free boundary. And finally, since it's a free boundary problem, we need one more equation to account for the evolution of the free boundary. So for that, we simply assume the velocity is continuous up to the boundary, and we have this equation for the normal velocity of the free boundary. So combining everything together, this is the model. Together, this is the model. Obviously, this model is more complicated than the second problem, the tumor growth model, and the Hidden Shaw problem mentioned in the moding section. And notefully, this system does not have any explicit solution. So, in tumor growth model, we have the explicit solution for the radiantly symmetric stationary solution. But in this model, since But in this model, since it is so complicated, all the variables are coupled together in a nonlinear way, even when we assume radial symmetry, we cannot find any explicit solution. So it's hard to analyze this model. And Friedman, Hao, and Hu made a theoretical breakthrough for this model by identifying a readingly symmetric stationary solution in an annular Solution in an annular region, so they establish a solution in a ring with the radiance ranging from 1 minus epsilon to 1. However, in real world, the plaque will not exhibit perfect radiosymmetry. So we ask whether non-radially symmetric solutions also exist in this framework. So that's our goal. And in order to answer that question, we carry out the bifurcation analysis. And the main tool for the bifurcation analysis is this Krandel-Wi-Binumu theorem, and for short, I will refer it as CR theorem. And it requires us to verify these full conditions in the theorem. However, applying this theorem to our model is still challenging. Model is still challenging for two reasons. Firstly, in the CR theorem, there is only one bifurcation parameter. But in our model, there are a lot of parameters. So it's tricky to choose the correct one as the bifurcation parameter. And secondly, as I mentioned, there is no explicit solution. So without any explicit solution, it's hard to verify the conditions in Lithuania, especially. Conditions in this theorem, especially the conditions involved the brush derivatives. And in order to overcome these difficulties, we choose a combination of parameters as the bifurcation parameter, and we derive a lot of careful estimates to overcome the difficulty of no explicit solution. So the following slide shows what we did. We let mu to be the bifurcation parameter while mu is a The bifurcation parameter will mu is a combination of many parameters, and this combination represents a balance of LDL and HDL, which require to obtain a stationary solution. And for simplicity, we assume all the parameters are fixed except L0. So if we change the values of the L0, it is equivalent to change the bifurcation parameter mu. Okay? Okay? And then recall that the radially symmetric solution exists in the ring-like region with r ranging from 1 minus epsilon to 1. And on the boundary, when r is equal to 1 minus epsilon, we have this third type of boundary conditions. So based on this information, we use the sub-super solution method and we derive the following estimates for the radially symmetric solution. And after that, we impose a small perturbation on the inner boundary. To be more specific, we now consider a family of perturbed domains where r is between 1 minus epsilon plus tau s to 1. And these three figures show some examples of the non-radiantly symmetric plaque. We derive So recall, the plaque lies in the perturbed inner boundary and the fixed outer boundary. So if we choose S of theta to be cosine 2 theta, we will have a plaque looks like this. If S of theta is cosine 3 zeta, then the non then the non-radiantly symmetric plaque looks like this. And this is the shape of the non-radiantly symmetric plaque if we choose S of zeta to be cosine for zeta. S of zeta to be cosine for zeta. Okay, then we define the operator in the CR theorem F to be the normal derivative of the free boundary. If it is equal to zero, if it equals to zero, it means the derivative of the free boundary is equal to zero, which means the free boundary is fixed, is stationary. So we derive a stationary solution. And in order to Solution. And in order to compute the fresh derivative of this operator f, we expand our solutions in tau. And then with these expansions, we can derive the first-order fracture derivative of f in this form. So this first-order fracture derivative only involves the zeros-order term and first-order term. And while the zeros-order term corresponds to the radially symmetric solution. To the radiantly symmetric solution. Then, for the first order term, we let s of theta to be cosine n θ and we seek a solution of the following form after using separation of variable. And then we plug all these expansions back into the system and get rid of the high-order terms and derive the so-called linearized system. And from there, we can derive estimates of all the first-order terms. The computations. Order terms. The computations were very lengthy, but we were able to derive the following estimates for the first order terms. And using these estimates, we plug them back into the expression of the fraction derivative, and we derive this equation for the first order fracture derivative. Now, recall that in the CR theorem, we need to prove the kernel of this fracture derivative is a one-dimensional space. So, in order to derive the So, in order to derive the kernel, we let this equation to be zero. This equation is zero if and only if the entire expression inside the big parenthesis is zero, and it leads us to the bifurcation points. So in summary, we derive this bifurcation result. We prove for each integer n no less than two, we have these bifurcation points approximately taking these values. Taking these values, and at each equals μn, there is a bifurcation branch bifurcating from the radially symmetric solution. And I want to point out that this n is greater than or equal to 2. And the reason for that is we want to guarantee the kernel is a one-dimensional space. So, in order to make the kernel is a one-dimensional space, we actually need to prove all the bifurcation points are distinct. So, we need to prove. So we need to prove mu n is not equal to mu m. Say if mu n is equal to mu m, then in the kernel there is not only cosine n theta, but also cosine m theta, there is not one dimension. So the key point is we have to prove all the bifurcation points are distinct. And with this idea, let's then look at this bifurcation, this bifurcation equation. When n is Equation. When n is equal to 0, the first term is 0. When n is equal to 1, the first term is also 0. So which means both mu sub 1 and mu sub 0 are of order big or epsilon. Okay? So this estimate alone cannot guarantee mu sub 0 is not equal to mu sub 1. And then in a subsequent paper, we went to the next order and we showed that and we show that mu sub 0 is not equal to mu sub 1 in the next order. And then we derive another result. We show that the first bifurcation point is mu1. And in bifurcation analysis, the very first bifurcation point is often the one with meaningful, with biological meaningful. So with that idea, So with that idea, we put a solution in the first bifurcation branch. And here is the image for the actual image for the actual plaque in reality. We can see the plaque is thicker on one side, which resembles the pattern we predict in our first bifurcation branch. So we think this result can be helpful to explain why plaques exhibit this kind of shapes in in reality. Shapes in reality. How many minutes? So, yeah, after that, I want to share some recent studies following our work. And I think Bay already covered most of them. So other researchers also considered the longitude bifurcation and also combined latitude and longitude bifurcation. And in this work, the authors, you Work, the authors differentiated M1 microphages with M2 microphages. And so they used one variable for the M1 microphages and another variable for the M2 microphages and derived a similar bifurcation result. And I remember they found that by adding the M2 microphages does not change the bifurcation points in the model. And in this work, the authors replaced the mechanics-manton form into holling. Into Halling type 3 functional response, and they derive a similar bifurcation result. And yeah, that's all I want to talk. And I think this platformation model is a very interesting topic which needs more attention because it is crucial for understanding heart disease and finding better ways to prevent heart disease. And there are a lot that we still don't know. For example, the optimal control. The optimized control of the model. A lot we still don't know. So I hope by starting it further, we can do some real progress to make people healthier. And that's all. Thank you. So we can have one or two questions now that next. Yeah, thank you very much for the very nice talk. I'm curious to know how To know how explicit is the bifurcation number. There is some HTU parameter in there? In your formula for mu n, which is a bifurcation formula. Yes. How far is the explicit? Because at some point you say it's very complicated to have a a formula for the for the radio so you can accept in a ring KA. So here everything is explicit. Uh no, we've we use Astronauts. No, we use estimates. So we estimate the solution. Even though we don't have the explicit formula, we can get some estimates because the region is very small. So we, yeah, so again, these are estimates. You can see we have big OF on the higher order terms. But we have the lower order terms explicit. So using this information, we derive new ant. Yeah, it's very cool. I mean, at the end, there is no. Yeah, there was a question. Thank you. Okay, so let's thank the speaker again. For the guests and the participants, I want everybody to have a chance to introduce themselves and find funny chats. Okay, so our next speaker is Michelle Romanas, and she will be talking about dynamic regulation of causality in structural environments. In structural environment, drives spatial organization of bacterial clouds. So, with the outside.
