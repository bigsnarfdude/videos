Today is Ibunan Yao. We will be speaking about numerical knotting complexity estimator for random knots here. Thank you. Thanks, organizers. Wonderful gathering. So I will have to ask for your excuse that I'm not going to stand on the sit here because I won't be used to add here. Okay, so this may be. This may be potentially the most disappointing talk. It's also nice in its own way, right? You will remember it. The reason I say that is because this is just an idea which has not been tested, so it may or may not lead to anything actually. So, but I'll go over the idea with you. Deal with you. So, I will start with a motivational question. So, if you are looking at some kind of knot-of-mitted diagram, right, as you randomly look at it, now the only thing you know about it is, okay, well, you know the rise of this thing. Okay, so the price is 10, it's 100, okay, or negative 50. If you know that much information, what can you say about it? That much for me. What can you say about this? It might be. Well, for the people who are not serious, right, you may think that's, oh, that's a lot of information. But if you work in Non-Siri, you know, well, that is not in various. So it does not tell you anything. Because I could potentially draw something, you know, for instance. Something, you know, for instance, I can just draw something like this and close it, right? You can keep doing this, right? This thing is an add-on, right? But the rights can be as large as you can keep doing this. It's the same rights repeat, right? So that's an example of saying, well, you don't really know much if you only know the rights. So let me modify the poison with that. So We agree that if you only know the rice, there isn't much you can say. However, if you also happen to know a little bit more, you know, something like the geometric information, I'm not going to talk about computing the polynomial. Because I'm not talking about the variable, right? So no polynomial. So suppose you know something, for example, if the random knob you're looking at, actually the diagram. Looking at actually, the diagram comes from the polygonal button on the cubic atoms, and you actually know the lens of this atom. Okay, so suppose the length is 1000, just 40 detector, okay, and you know in this case, well, the rise is actually pretty big, 4000. Now what people say? Okay, well I'm gonna hold it answered, okay. I'm going to hold the answer until the end. Then we make it something. But that's the most reasonable question. So, my point is that when you do know some additional information like this, potentially, you could actually say something about the top itself. Don't you know the right growth like a random wall or something like that? Yes, you you do. So you have some problems. But but there's a big range, right? Yeah, there's sort of called big. Wait, let me argue a little bit. Like, if you knew that Rad was very big, would you know the diagram is very close to being alternating? Alternating diagrams without obvious simplifications really likely to be not it? Well, but then you will need uh the the very concrete uh evidence, right? Oh, I mean that that's that's the extreme case, right? That's the extreme case, right? They're like all folescents. Yeah. But there should be some information like that. That's right. So, how to relate that? How to retrieve that? That's basically what I'm trying to get into. Okay, cool. Okay, so, well, it's going to be a story that I have to link several pieces of information together to get to the end of the story, right? So you bear with me. So I know people here who not really. Not really expert in not theory, so I have to go through some basics. So here is the braid, right? So you draw an open braid, the left side, you close it up, you get a closed braid, right? So simple examples. What we know is that if you have any not or mean, you can always present it as the closed frame. That's both doubt. So the minimum line. So the minimum number of strains you need to present your link or not as a closed grid is called the grid index. So and but I want to look at the brain index from different uh point of view. So I want to look at it in terms of the cipher circuit decomposition. So you have you start with uh uh North diagram, right? Not diagram, right? It has an orientation on it. So you will go ahead and smooth the crossings. So whenever you see a cross like this, right, you smooth it in a way that you would preserve the orientation like you would smooth this way, like I showed here. So in this diagram, here a simple diagram here, you would smooth this one like this, right? You would smooth it to preserve the orientation. See, if you do that for every crossing, then at the end in the diagram, there are no longer... And in the diagram, there are no longer crosses, right? So, what's lever, what's left must be the topological circles between cyclical circles, right? So, in this case, here, this is the figure eight, you've got three cycle circles. So, it turns out the number of cyber circles and the brick index is closely related. So, this result due to your harder. This result due to Yahada basically says that the green index of an orange, not only is the minimum number of cypher circles among all of its regular projected diagrams. So in his proof, basically he can convert any diagram once you have the cycle circle decomposition, he can convert this like in this back here. Convert this, like this guy here, this is not close to bridge, right? But he can convert this guy into a brick with the same number of cipher circles. Okay, so that's what his algorithm does, right? So therefore, from any diagram, you can, once you have the cipher circle decomposition, you can make that into a brain, a closed equation. You have the number of strengths equals the number of the cipher circles. Circles. And the a closed grid, when you do the cipher circle decomposition, well, you get the number of strings is exactly the same number of cipher circle when you do the decomposition on the curves. That's why now this is the case. Which means it's easier, you know, if you don't see how the If you don't see how the colours of bridge look like, right, you can just count the number of circles, and that will give you at least an upper boundary. So, well, we all know the home flight PG polynomial. So, although I said I'm not going to compute it, but I still need to use it. So, the polynomial is defined using some regular, you know, normal conditions and Normal conditions and also the scale relation. The different versions. The one I'm using here, I missed here in the second one, that's my scale relation. It has two variables. In this case, my A variable is the one on the left side, the Z variable is the one on the right side. So there is something significant about the Holocaust conforming with the breed index, which is due to Is due to several people like this here. So, in my writing here, I have two things: upper E of the K and lowercase E of the K. Those are the highest A power in the home 5.14, and that's the lowest A power. So, it turns out if you have Turns out, if you started with a diagram of this log A, where S of D is the number of cipher circles, and that's the rise of the diagram. And then, actually, those two guys will be invariant, right? They don't change. But those two things are always satisfying these two equalities. So the capital E is less than or equal to S D minus. WE is less equal to SD minus WD minus 1 and so on. So this can give us something. So the idea here is that although the home front PD polynomial is a powerful one, but we know when my random knot is really complicated, even with simplifications, it may still be very difficult to compute. However, However, I'm saying that, well, maybe SD and the WP are pretty easy to calculate. What you say? So, I read now and you can do confirm BA. That's much easier. I don't really do it, but I think maybe it's easy, right? Anyway, so if you can do the things, then you know, if you're lucky, right? For instance, well, if for this guy, when he found that oh, For this diagram, he found that oh, Sd is 31, you know, W be negative 40. Well, what does that tell you? Well, then, in this case, if you apply this into this inequality, you see your EK bugging the number, that will give you 10. So that means you are the lowest power of A for this guy is at least 10. Which means it cannot possibly be Xina, right? Because I normal the power of the A. Because I want the power would be zero. And in the case your rise is a big positive number, like in this case here, in this example here, well, then if you use this equal with the capital E, right, in this case, you will find out it is a negative number, which also means it's nine on. Oh, it's not, it's non-trivial, right? Because it's called Ion. Because if it is, it would have to be zero, right? But now you know this guy is less than zero. is less absolute. So in general, this argument would always work if the absolute value of your rise is equal or equal to the number of cipher circles in your diagram. So whenever you see that, you know you are looking at a non-tricky problem. There's no more calculation you need. Of course when we see that cannot be a calculation The caveat of this. For this to be useful, you have to be lucky. The absolute value of rise has to be bigger than or equal to S D. How likely is this going to happen? Well, I would say usually it's very unlikely when it's going to look at random diagram, right? I'm showing you some kind of I'm showing you some kind of local thing where you see a few screens. You can imagine that those guys here don't have to be very long, right? They just have stock things. So even though the total length of the things here are not necessarily very long, but if you look at the cipher circle decomposition, so here I have 2k here and 2k on this side, so the total length here can be something in the order of 4k.11. Something in the order of 4K, 4811, right? But you do the decomposition here, you find out: well, there are lots of Little Cycle certainties in here, and they can be in the order of 2K times K minus 1, so in the outer K squared order. So because of this, in general, when you look at the random diagram, well, the number of a cipher circles can be on the order of your length. Let this square easy, right? Which means it's unlikely for you to be for this to be useful. Alright, so well, however, when we look at a diagram, you know, we have this idea of a simple line, right? So, well, so there is a possibility you can, your diagram is actually. Your diagram is actually, you know, special in a way, so you can simplify it. So before I do that, okay, I need to give you the concept: like, how do I simplify it? So the first concept I need here is the so-called elementary tangles. So it's a tangle with strings, right? With many strings in here. But my tango is a layer. So you can imagine my triangle here, start with what? The first string there. What the first string now, right? Then the second string is below that first one. The third one is below the first two, and so on, right? So they all are different layers. If that's the case, it's called an inventory tackle. And why it is so nice about it? Because the layers, so you can actually slide the strings any way you like. They will not get into each other's way. Into each other's way. Because of this, then you know that in the extreme case, as I in the previous picture, you can get a lot of local cipher circles. But here, in this case, I want you to look at how I do it. So, this is the URL elementary tango. On the boundary of the tangle of the ball, I want you to choose an. Is here. I want you to choose an oral case. There are two choices. Either way will be fine. And once you choose it, well, the way I want you to simplify is that, for example, if you take the top line here, the orientation is like this, right? I want you to slide this thing so that it's close to the boundary, the circle, to match the orientation. So, see, this one goes from here to here. See, this one goes from here to here, right? So now I want you to go this way because your boundary goes this way. So I want you to go that way. And you do that for every string. And that way, see, they all follow this orientation. Why is that good? Well, because if they all go that way, when you smooth, they all smooth exactly the same way. So. So, well, here if you smooth it, so in this case, remember I had how many strings? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, right? I had 6 strings to begin with, right? But at the end, in this case, there's only one focal cyber circles. And those are still partials, right? Because if this is in an entire non-diagram, those guys will have to be. Those guys will have to be connected to other guys to form eventually a final cyber circle. So I call those partial cyber circles. So you start with these strains. At the end, you end up with exactly six partial cyber circles, which needs to be connected to other partial cyber circles to make a whole one, right? And this is the local one. That's the one you get. So the question is, how many can you get? You get so if you the answer is that the short answer is that if you have six to begin with, the most you can get is five and you can actually do better if you choose the directs more carefully. But the worst scenario, which is pretty easy to prove, it's that number minus one. So, like in this case here, you know, well, so in this case, I had six, this side, six, this side, right? So, I had 12, right? This side, right? So I had 12, right? So, but if I would follow the same thing I did, and you see, I would get 12. In this case, I have 5. So I have 12 strings, right? But at the end, I end up with 5 circles. Not that number squared, right? So you can see it's it's actually linear, right? So it's a bunch of smaller. Bunch of some work. Okay, which is also the partial cycling synchronous. So, alright, so my talk ends up over time. Oh, I got bunch of time. Alright. So they are four people. Therefore, because in this elementary angle, you can have at the most n minus 1 cycle circles, right? You started with n strings, right? And you have n partial cycle circles. But each partial cycle circle can only contribute to half the whole one, right? You need a two to make one, right? And therefore, the total number you the contribution. The contribution from this y-inventory angle to the whole thing would be 1.5n minus 1, because you got this guy here plus the 0.5n, right? Excuse me? Yeah, so the partial ones, they contribute half each in that giving this. That plus this, the worst scenario you have. Scenario you have done, right? But you can usually do much better. Alright, so that's why I say that some improvement definitely is possible here if you do it in the more careful analysis, like how to choose the orientation. And in general, of course, you can imagine that when you have a number diagram, it is always possible to decompose it as the Worst of the worst, each crossing has its own, right? So that's possible, right? The question is, you know, can you do better, right? How good can it be? So in general, if it's just like a collateral random polygon, you know, just think of lattice, I really don't have. Things off latest, I really don't have a good way to tell you like how to do that. But if it's self-avoiding polygon on the proving lattice, well, in that case, I actually have a pretty good idea how good you can do this. So, suppose now if I'm looking at a set of water points, right, which I call a K of C plane C is true. Plane C is true. And so suppose you go ahead and choose a projection plane, and XY plane, Y is equal to your favorite. And then when you do that, then it turns out in the case of the polygonal lattice, your elementary triangles can automatically choose those unit squares. So the unit squares, so what I'm drawing here. U square is so what I'm drawing here is this length is one half inch. This is a lattice point in the center. This is not. Okay, so you will have to extend another half to get to the next lattice point. Okay, so if you look at a lattice point that's occupied by your knock, that's the one you can choose, right? Then you will draw a unit. Draw a unit square around it, and I'm claiming that will give you a pretty good start point. That would give you an inventory timing. Of course, I mean, the projection may not look just like that. Could it be like this, right? Could it be like this? Could it be like this, right? It's all possible, right? But why is it an inventory? Because this whole thing here can only go up. Yu this whole thing here can only go up and down in the middle. That's where the safe direction. In this direction. For example, you you may see something comes in here, it goes down, it goes out here. But the next one will have to come in from, say, from here, go to the next one, maybe go out, right? So, so, but those remember, those are not his point. It's halfway. They cannot go out and back. They cannot go up and down. So, this structure naturally divides those strains, you know, the steps that come in into different layers, and therefore they are giving you an mechanical structure already. So that would be more. That would be more or less kind of like the tango summation I was talking about. So you have several tangles like this, right? But if you divide it up, if you divide it up, under this guy here, you may have several guys. You may have several guys if you look from the side, right? Going from one side to the other side. Well, to see it as if the way I was drawing it, you probably need to push those back. You probably need to push those guys a little bit out of the thing so you can see they are actually strings, right? Several strings going that way. So they are connected out of track. So this is how big is connection. So that's more or less the decomposition I was talking about. So how does this help us? So we need to do a little bit of analysis here, right? So for each of this tangles, of course, Angle, of course, there's a number of strings, right? Which is kind of like the number of combinated components, right? So for example, for this guy here, I could have one guy comes in like this, and one of them could have another one come in, goes down, then goes out again, right? And I could have several of those guys. I could have several of those guys under this structure, for example. But for each one of them, there's a half length coming in, there's a half length going out in the X and Y directions. There might be some Z directions you need, but for now, maybe just ignore the Z directions. I will just count the X Y directly. Because right now, suppose I'm looking at the X Y plane, right? So each component in So each component in your elementary triangle actually has a length one combined, right? Half in, half up, right? It has each component has a total length in the x and y direction. If I just ignore the z direction. So if I do that, well then combine all of this together. Okay? So So in all of the elementary triangles, you look at all the components, all the strings, right? What is the total? Well, the total is going to be exactly the length of all the X and Y steps on equal points. Which I call X of K C and Y of K C. And remember earlier I was. I was telling you that each elementary triangle, the contribution of those each elementary triangle to the total number of cypher circles is 1.5 times the number of the number of strains in there, right? But the number of strains in there is the same as the length. Lens in that time group. There was a minus one, but we forget about that, right? So you will just add all of these guys up, and at the end, that's what you can end up with. So this is telling us the total number of ciphered circles you can get. You can get the worst scenario is bounded above by this 1.5 times the x kc plus ykc. That means the length of your polygon by tanking only the x to y direct to forget what the third director. Of course, that is less than what? This would be less than the total length of your polygon, right? Okay, so remember in my GME exam, say, what if the total length is 1000? Is 1000. Well, then, this is 1.5 times that is that I know it's less than 1500, right? And I was saying, well, the rice was 2,000, right? So it's way bigger than that, right? And therefore, in this case, I would certainly know this is very naughty, right? Because it will have that much influence. So this calculation is only trying to convince you that Trying to convince you that the number of cipher circles when you do this. Oh, I forgot to mention that when I was making those changes in the adventure triangles, those changes do not change the price. So at the end, you have a diagram still with the same price. That's important to know. So this is really convincing you that the number of a cipher circles you get out of the edit. Get out of the head should be fairly reasonable, actually. Potentially, it can be much, much better than this. This alpha is all actually done. So, I suspect it can be much better. Why? Because you can potentially check to see whether those tangents here can be combined. You don't have to use them all separately. You could actually, as long as this you satisfy the condition of a metric triangle, right? The strengths go in, they don't. The strings go in, they don't. So, as long as you see that something goes in, what you don't want to see is that you see a string cutting, it goes down in the redirection, eventually it returns. So, there's a gap in between, but in the meantime, there was something else that passes through that gap, which would cause a situation where you see a situation like this. Like this. Right. And that would destroy the requirement for an image environment, right? Something goes, a string goes wrapped around the alpha market. But that should be something very easy to check. And I would think that you give me a random diagram, a lot of places of places where you can actually. Actually, extend your adventure time, make it much bigger, but maybe just total number of cipher certainty smaller. So, potentially it can be more useful. But that all depends on someone actually do some calculations and how much I have or so this is uh the topic this is uh  Any questions? Say you haven't implemented it? Say you have not implemented it? I have not. I have no student who can do this out of college. Ah, okay. Because, yeah, I mean, that's there are a lot of interesting questions there about what the distribution of cipher circles is. Yeah, you can practice. Well, this is the multi-basic thing, right? That's just the motivation thing, right? But I think it is probably something there. I failed at the fun time to cure the tasks. Let's take your non again.
