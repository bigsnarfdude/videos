And density cross. It's joint work with Sarah Biddy Razafi Mahatratra and Pablo Spiga and a couple other people too. So what I'm looking at are permutations and I say that they intersect if they act on a base set, if there's some element in here, that they both map to the same spot. So two permutations intersect if and only if I take the inverse of one multiplied by the other, that has to have a fixed volume. The other that has to have a fixed point. That's the point where they agree. So a permutation is called a derangement if it has no fixed points, and two permutations are intersecting if one times the inverse of the other is not a derangement. So once I have a definition of intersecting permutations, I want to look at a set of intersecting permutations. So the sets intersecting if any tooth in the set are pairwise intersecting. And then the big question is, what's the largest Question is: What's the largest set of these things that I can make when I'm holding on to a permutation group? Stabilizer of a point, that's the set of all the permutations that fix an element. The coset of a stabilizer of a point, I call it Sij. These are all the permutations that map i to j. Clearly, these guys are going to be intersecting. I call them the canonical intersecting sets. Whenever we're looking at a transitive group, and I'm going to We're looking at a transitive group, and I'm going to stick just with transitive groups. Whenever I'm transitive, my stabilizer has size of the group divided by the degree, and so I can always have an intersecting set of that size. And so then the big question is, are my canonical intersecting sets, so my cosets of the stabilizer of a point, are these guys going to be the biggest? And this question is obviously inspired by the Erdős-Co-Radeau theorem. So the Erdős-Co-Radot theorem says you take a bunch of The Erdős Kore-Redeaux theorem says you take a bunch of k sets, you want them pairwise intersecting, what's the biggest you can do? And the numbers right here, what that number means is you take all the sets that contain some fixed point. So same idea, but with permutations. Okay, so what I'm going to look at is I'm going to hold on to a group and I'm going to define the intersection density of a set. So I'm going to pull out an intersecting set. Going to pull out an intersecting set. Its intersection density is its size compared to the size of my canonical intersecting guys, so compared to the size of the stabilizer of a point. Clearly, the intersection density of my canonical ones have one, and the intersection density of the group is just I take the maximum over all the different possible intersecting sets. So it's the ratio of the largest intersecting set compared to my stabilizers. For sure, my intersection density is going to be at least one because I've got my stabilizers. And the groups that have intersection density one, sometimes we call this the Erdős-Ko-Red Dough property, because if the intersection density is one, our canonical intersecting guys are the biggest, and so that's like having a version of the Erdős-Kille Red Dough there. Okay, there is a ton of questions we can start asking. How big can your intersection density be? How big can your intersection density be? So, if you have a group, how large could the density be over all the different groups? Can we find bounds on the intersection density? Can we find groups that have intersection density one? Can we find group properties that would tell us the intersection density is one? The intersection density is always going to be a rational number. When is it integer? And if it's not integer, does that give us any extra information about the structure of the largest intersecting system? Of the largest intersecting sets. One thing to note is: I'm talking about this like it's a property of the group. It's really a property of the group action. Yep. Do you have any intuition as to why it being an integer or not would be an important property? Yes, because a lot of the examples I get where it is an integer, like say it's an integer and it's not one, it's often the union of two stabilizers or it's an. Of two stabilizers, or it's another group. So these are sort of nice natural intersecting sets, but when you're getting irrational numbers, not irrational, when you're getting non-integer, they're often sort of goofy sets, like not groups, not unions. Yeah, it's a great question. Okay, so it's a property of the group action. So anytime I have a group and I have a group action, I can represent it as an action on cosets. On cosets. So if I have an element in my group that fixes a point when it's acting on cosets, what happens is there's some coset that it fixes. So what that means is this sigma that has a fixed point, it's conjugate to an element in the group that's defining the action. So what we're looking for are big sets so that any pair of elements in the set, one times the inverse of the other, is conjugate to something in this big H group, which defines the action. The H group, which defines the action. So it's a weird sort of group theory sort of thing as well. Folks, I guess you guys. Okay, here's my example. The alternating group, usually think about the alternating group acting on the elements 1 to n, but it can act on lots of different things. It's going to act on the pairs from 1 to 4. The stabilizer point is this group of size 2, but this subgroup, and you see how it's a union of the group and its coset, this is another. Coset. This is another group. Any two elements in here are going to be conjugate to an element in H. And so this is an intersecting set. And so the intersection density of this guy is 2, because it's twice the size of the stabilizer. And if you look at this, it's not so hard to see that this is actually the largest. Okay, is that good? Okay, the way I like to approach these problems is to switch it to a question in graph theory. So I define a thing called. So, I define a thing called a derangement graph. So, the vertices are the elements of my group, and I make them adjacent if they're not intersecting. So, if one times the inverse of the other is a derangement. And so, this is an example of the derangement group on the dihedral group before. The way I've set this up, I've exactly defined it. So my intersecting sets are my independent sets. I like to call independent sets cocliques. I hope that's okay. Seems more natural. I hope that's okay. Seems more natural, clique, co-clique. And so the size of my maximum independent set is just my alpha. So I haven't done anything other than translate it to a graph theory problem, but that gives me a lot more tools to work with. This graph is really super pretty. It's regular. The degree is the number of derangements. It's a Cayley graph. And the connection set is the set of derangements. And the set of derangements is lovely because it's a union of consciousy classes. So it's closed. So it's closed under conjugation, so that means it's a normal Cayley graph. Normal in the sense that the connection set is closed under conjugation. My group is a subgroup with the automorphism group, so I'm a vertex transitive graph as well. So this forms a super pretty graph. And so once we have such a nice graph, we have a bunch of tools we can use. The first tool we can use is the Click Co-ClickBound. We can use the clique-co-clique bound. So, when you're looking at a regular vertex-transitive graph, the size of the clique times the size of the co-cliques are no more than the number of vertices in your graph. So, if your permutation group has a sharply transitive set, then your intersection density has to be 1. And what happens is that if you have a sharply transitive set H, it's going, and this, because it's sharply transitive, the size of it will be the degrees, your N. No two elements in H can map. No two elements in H can map any single guy to the same spot, because it's sharply transitive. So it's going to be a clique of size n. And then you apply your clique co-clique bound, and no independent set is larger than the size of your stabilized point. So this is super easy. Whenever your group has one of these subgroups, you've got your intersection density. Franklin Dessel noticed this in Deza, saw this in 1977. They didn't write it this way, but they said the symmetric group. Write it this way, but they said the symmetric group has the EKR property, and that's basically the proof they gave. Just a sense of what sort of results you can get. If your degree is prime, you're going to have intersection density one, because you'll have a sharply transitive set. Other results that are sort of like this one, looking at the degree. There's a group in Slovenia who've done a lot of really interesting work lately. They said that if your degree is the product of two odd primes, then your intersection density is going to be one. Then your intersection density is going to be 1 or 2. So it's going to be an integer, it's 1 or 2, and they could actually list out all the groups that have intersection density too. Just some more examples of the different types of questions and problems you can have. If we're holding on to a permutation group and the degree is greater than 3, which is, you know, we're not the symmetric group on two points, then your derangement graph for sure is going to have a triangle. So we can go through and show that there's always. So we can go through and show that there's always going to be a triangle somewhere in your derangement graph. And so that gives you an upper bound on your intersection density using your click-co-click bound. And there are groups that have intersection density n over 3. We found like four of them. We don't have a general construction. We don't know if there's more. There's just these four goofy guys. This proof came second. The first thing we actually showed is that if you're holding onto your derangement graph, it's never going to be bipartite. It's never going to be bipartite. So we were pulling up groups, making their arrangement graphs, looking at them. We found complete multipartite, but never bipartite. And we're like, what's up with that? And so we were able to go through and show that you're never going to be bipartite. And then we took a step further and showed that you always have this little triangle. So I think there's some interesting questions about what sort of graphs could possibly be derangement graphs. Okay, another tool that we have that's really easy. Okay, another tool that we have that's really easy is graph homomorphisms. So if I have two derangement graphs, so I have groups G and H, I can do a homomorphism from the derangement graph to the other, then I have that the intersection density of the guy I start with is bigger than the guy I land in. So we can bound the intersection density using our homomorphism. And the best example is by the group and the subgroup. The subgroup is going to have the biggest intersection density. So if the subgroup has So, if the subgroup has the EKR property, then the big group does too. And this is a really nice reduction because if I want to show things to have EKR property so that they have intersection density one, I just go through and I use minimal transitive subgroups. So it's a nice reduction. Okay, so the last tool that I'm going to just mention and go into a little more detail is my favorite tool. It's the Dessert-Hoffmann ratio bound. Del Sartre-Hoffmann ratio bound. So I always think of this as the ratio bound because it relies on a ratio right here. But some people call it Delsart, some people call it Hoffman, and then it gets sort of confusing. So I just do all the names. If we're holding on to a regular graph, we can take its adjacency matrix. We can take the adjacency matrix, and the largest eigenvalue will be the degree. And this tau in the formula is the smallest eigenvalue. And the ratio between the largest eigenvalue, And the ratio between the largest eigenvalue and the smallest eigenvalue drives the bound on the size of your coclates. You can actually strengthen this. Instead of just using the adjacency matrix for your graph, you can do a weighted adjacency matrix. Essentially, you put weights on the edges and you adjust the weight so that this ratio gets as big as you possibly can get it, and then you get a better bound on your coefficients. So, what I'm actually going to do is weight an adjacency matrix. Weighted adjacency matrix. So we print the ij entry, gets a non-zero only if they're adjacent. But we can weight our edges with zeros. We can throw away edges in this and it's still okay. And we want to keep the row sums constant and it's symmetric. So my derangement graph is a Cayley graph and it's a normal Cayley graph because the connection set is closed under conjugation. Closed under conjugation, I can calculate the eigenvalues for a Cayley graph using the irreducible representations of the group. So I grab an irreducible representation, I sum the value of the representation on the connection set, and then I divide by the degree of the character. And that gives me my eigenvalues. And so when I'm in a derangement graph, things are even better because my connection set is a union of consciousy classes. So I just go to my Classes. So I just go to my consciency classes, pick out the ones that are derangements, grab a character, evaluate it, evaluate the character on an element for the consency class, multiply by the size of the conjugacy class, and that will get me my eigenvalues. So computationally, getting our eigenvalues, if you have your characters or you understand them, it can be really, really straightforward. But what I actually want to do is form weighted adjacency matrices. Adjacency matrices. And if I'm going to weight the edges, it seems impossible. You can put any weights on any edges, too many possible things. But what we can actually do is instead of weighting all the edges, we put the weights on our congency classes. And if we weight all the things in the congency classes, we can get a weighted adjacency matrix without too much trouble. Okay, so when I'm holding on to my derangement graph, it's actually a union of Cayley graphs. What I can do is take my consciency classes, take the ones that are derangement. Consciency classes, take the ones that are derangements for each consciousy class that's a derangement, make a Cayley graph, and then sum them all up together, and that's my derangement graph. And those graphs of Cayley graphs where the connection set is a congregation class, it's a super nice family of graphs. They form an association scheme, they've beautiful algebra, they commute, you can simultaneously diagonalize them, and it's the best possible situation. So I can do a weighted adjacency matrix. Adjacency matrix, and what I'm going to do is take the adjacency matrix for the Cayley graph where the connection set is a single consciousy class of derangements, and then I put a weight on that, and I can sum it up. And then when I get my eigenvalues, I can actually calculate my eigenvalues like before. So I go through my consciency class of derangements, the value of the character on the class, the size of the class, but then I put a weighting on each of my classes. On each of my classes. And so I can calculate my eigenvalues without too much trouble. And this gives me a really convenient way to find a whole lot of weightings where I can still calculate the eigenvalues. Okay, does that make sense, sort of? Okay, good. So the weightings are actually way easier to find than I expected, and you can actually go quite a ways with this. Okay, so the question is, when can we weight the condency classes so that the ratio bound holds with equality? Ratio bound holds with equality. That's sort of the goal. And you can actually, there's two approaches. You can just set this up as a linear programming bound. So if you have a situation where your character has a really pretty, where your group has a really well understood character table and you know all of your characters, you just write it out as well and you're programming that. What I want to do is maximize the ratio between the largest and the smallest eigenvalue. So I set up weights on the consciency classes. I make a rule that my eigenvalues all have to be bigger than. My eigenvalues all have to be bigger than negative 1. So my least eigenvalue is going to be negative 1. And then what I want to do is maximize the eigenvalue for the trivial character, because that's going to be my largest eigenvalue. So it's a linear program, quick and easy to solve. Sometimes you don't, like say symmetric group, you don't know all of your irreducible representations, but you can still use this because there's a specific character that we sort of care about. The permutation character, it's where you take the number of fixed points. It's where you take the number of fixed points, you minus one. It's not always going to be irreducible, but it's a character. So you take the irreducible characters that sit in this guy, and you set your weighting so that all of those guys give you an eigenvalue of negative one, and then you cross your fingers and hope for the best. And it actually works for the symmetric group and the alternating group to use this approach, which is kind of amazing. Two transitive subgroups are a treat here because Treat here because if we're too transitive, that eigenvalue, that character eta, so number of fixed points minus one, that's going to be irreducible. So it's going to give you an eigenvalue. So if you use your eta, the eigenvalue that corresponds to it is super easy to calculate. So eta is the character fixed points minus one. We're feeding a derangement. So for every derangement, it's going to come out to be negative one. So we can write down exactly what the eigenvalue is. So if I take this eigenvalue and I shove it into This eigenvalue and I shove it into the Hoffman-Delsart ratio bound, I get exactly the number I'm hoping for. So if this guy is the least eigenvalue, the Delsard-Hoffmann ratio bound tells me that the intersection density is going to be 1. So the two transitive groups are really convenient. There's this little sketchy bit. This guy's not always the least eigenvalue. Sometimes there's other pesky characters that give you smaller eigenvalues, but you can usually work around them. So there's a bit of a So there's a bit of a question when you're looking at two transitive groups, when is eta going to give you the least eigenvalue. Okay, so a couple of years ago, Paolo Spiga and Thief and I proved that if you're a two-transitive group, for sure your intersection density is going to be one, that this method more or less always works. We used two reductions. If you're sharply transitive, we're done. So all of those two transitive groups off the table. If it has a transitive subgroup, If it has a transitive subgroup with intersection depths D1, so using that result that we get from the graph homomorphisms, then the big group has intersection depths D1. So right away, we only needed to look at our minimal transitive subgroups of all the simple type. And these guys, we know a lot about them. There is a lovely little list of them. And so it was actually pretty easy. We just went through and solved them. And these guys are color-coded by how we solved it. To how we solved it. The ones in red, they're finite. We just told Gab or Magma to do it, and they told us the right answer. I think maybe the purple ones, the blue ones, I think we just did the ratio bound. The purple ones, I think we had to find an appropriate weighting. One of these was pesky. Anyways, some of these weightings were weird in that we were able to throw away a lot of edges. We were able to weight some of the consciency classes at zero. So we'd have a consciency class of derangements, which is a lot. Conscious class of derangements, which is a lot of edges in our graph, and we threw it away and our coat pleats didn't get any bigger, which is, I thought, was weird. Okay, oh, and I think PSU was a little pesky because it had a character that was giving us a smaller eigenvalue and we had to work around it. But we could argue why we didn't have to worry about that particular character. Okay, this approach has been used for other group actions as well. For other group actions as well. Alice Friedgoot and People did 2010, they had a lovely paper. They have a condition that your n needs to be big, but if you have your symmetric group, and now here we change the action, so the action's on these cosets. So that's equivalent to looking at the symmetric group acting on ordered T sets. So two permutations are going to be intersecting if there's some ordered T set that they both map to the same spot. So it has to fix TL. So it has to fix t elements. They're able to use this approach to say if your n is sufficiently big, your intersection density is going to be 1. And Ellis did the same thing. He switched the action. So the action on the cosets of this, that's equivalent to the symmetric group acting on T sets, so where the order doesn't matter. And the same approach worked. And Razafino Hatratra and a couple other authors, I don't know how to say the other names. I don't know how to say the other names. They did the same approach, and they were able to get exact results for small specific values of t. So here they want your n to be large, and there are conjectures about what sufficiently large is, but their method just says make it big and eventually be okay. They did for tbing 2 and 3, getting what exact values of n would work. Okay, let's see. Oh, okay. Let's see. Oh, okay. This is my last slide. There's a whole lot of other problems that are related. For example, I was looking at intersecting sets. You can just ask for the groups that are intersecting. And the problem gets a whole lot easier because it's way easier to find groups and subgroups in a group rather than sets. So you can just look at your groups. People have looked at the intersection density not for a specific action, but for all actions. But for all actions. So you could hold on to a group, look at all the subgroups, look at the action on the cosets, and figure out the intersection density for each of those different actions. And for example, if you start with G being nil potent, every action is going to have the EKR property that your intersection density is just going to be one for everything. We can also ask for what transitive groups have interesting intersecting sets as permutations. So that first example with the alternating group. The first example with the alternating group: that there's this nice subgroup that was much bigger and was intersecting. So maybe when is your maximum intersecting a subgroup or the union of different, not the union, I said the union of subgroups, but I meant the union of cosets of a subgroup. And like, what other things can happen? What graphs can be derangement graphs? Like, could you have a strongly regular graph being a derangement graph? Being a derangement graph in a non-trivial sort of way. And we've also found Razafi Mahachatra, he just finished his PhD with me and he's been working on this. He's given examples of families of transitive groups where the derangement graph is a complete multipartite graph. And those were the graphs that hit that upper bound of having intersection density n over 3. What complete multipartite graphs can be derangement graphs? We can find a bunch. Be derangement graphs. We can find a bunch of examples. We know we can't have a complete multipartite graph that's actually bipartite, so it just has two parts. But you should be able to get some sort of results that say if you've n parts each of size k, can that be a derangement graph or not? And when can you construct them? Okay, that's it. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Are there any questions? So, yes. I was wondering what typical behavior is. So, I mean, my memory says that most groups are two groups. I'm not sure what most transitive groups are, what they look like. And do they have EPR property? What's kind of typical behavior? Typical behavior. Oh, gosh, that's a really great question. I would have to say, I don't know. I think two transitive is pretty special. Special. We have tested small groups, right? Like using the computer, using GAP, we can do groups, whatever they have there, up to degree 30, 32. I would say having EKRs pretty standard, like having intersection density relatively small, like one is probably the most common, but we haven't done a thorough analysis. And people, being human, always seem to skew to action. Seem to skew to actions that make sense, like looking at the symmetric group acting on the points or on T sets or like actions you actually encounter. But sometimes when you pick weird subgroups and look at the actual cosets of that, that's where weird stuff happens and people haven't really looked at that that much. So I do have a summer student whose job is to take the groups, take all the subgroups, figure out what the intersection density is to the best of their ability, and so we should eventually have a catalog. And so we should eventually have a catalog. But again, it's small numbers. We're either stuck just doing small groups or groups that we know lots about. What does a typical planetary group look like? I mean, if you take a random group of order and most ten. Oh, I don't know. It's not known. It's not known by me. I don't understand this previous the order and not order? Oh, right. Here, two things are going to be intersecting if they both fix T points. So they fix T distinct points. Here, two things are intersecting if they fix a T set. So you would have like if you have one, two versus one. And what are the examples? Can you show us one of the examples that you get the n over 3? One of the examples where you get the type of your... The n over 3, what it is, it's a complete tripartite, complete multipartite graph with three parts. Yeah. And so what's the group that we're coming from? I forget right now what it is. Yeah, um it's degrees 18. You know what? I remember I used to remember what number it was in gap. Like it's not a group that's really natural. So but it's derangement graph, well, it's complete tripartite. And I think what happens is that the stabilizer of a point sits in one part and cosets of it sit in the other part. Part and the cosets of it sitting on one part. And the stabilizer and its cosets is what forms the big intersecting set. Okay. So time for another quick question.
