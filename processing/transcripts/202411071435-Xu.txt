This work is a collaboration with his lab, his biophysics lab. And most of the work is done by the two students, Hei Chen Wang and Hong Yu Luok, who are both here. And I want to thank their hard work and very happy collaboration with Hui Li. So my title is Dynamic Labbing Physics During the Execution of Cell Hypothesis. Of cell apoptosis. I changed the title a little bit to address that we are considering the dynamics of bleeding during the apoptosis. Okay, this is the brief outline. And I will introduce the background of apoptosis. And then I will explain the experiments done by Hui-Lich group. And then I show you the minimal cross-going model for this blabbing dynamics during this apoptosis. Finally, I will finish by a summary and update. Finally, I will finish by a summary and outlook. And first, I will introduce that during the biology, cell death is very important and it happens in many different ways. And we have programmed deaths and non-programmed deaths. And programmed deaths, particularly the apoptosis, is a major topic today. And there's also non-programmed cell deaths, like necrosis, which is very different from apoptosis. So I'll give an example to show. So, I'll give an example, to give you a picture to show you what is the major difference. So, on necrosis, during the necrosis, it's just the cell membrane breakup, and everything from the inside of the cell just leak out. And the portosis is a little bit more complex. It has several more processes. For example, at the beginning, it just shrinks and chromatin condensed. And after that, the blab forms and the membrane form blab and contract retract. Contract rechecked, and then they form some apotheosity bodies and they detach from the cell body and then they recycle later on. So there are several processes happening in apotosis. And apotosis is very important in biology, for example, they're very important for the removal of tissues during the development and also very useful for the organic scoppering. Organ sculpture, the sculpture, and also can also be used to treat cancer because cancer cells cannot have apoptosis, that is why they can always grow without control. So, they can use different therapy method to induce their apoptosis of cancer and so that we can treat cancer. Okay. Okay, this is a general uh introduction to the apotosis. And there's two major uh hallmarks. And there's two major hallmarks. And the one of the major hallmarks is during the portosis, they're blabbing. So that is the membrane will blab out. But after some time, they will be checked back. And a very dynamic process happened during the apoptosis. The second process is so-called dissembling of cytoskeleton organelles. And during this apoptosis, the cytoskeleton organelles should dissemble. And organelles should dissemble, and so that some of these will go to these optotic bodies and get recycled. So, these are two hallmarks. So, we asked the biological question usually like this. Why during the apoptosis they need to be to blab? Why bother to blab? Second is are there any correlations between these two hallmarks? So, that is there any relation between the blabbing dynamics and the structural dissembling? And the structural dissembly during the apodosis. And of course, we are physicists in order to solve this biological question. So, of course, we try, and we provide the physics perspective. So, our question is, what are the correlation between the dynamics of labyrinth, morphology, and structural dissembly? I think this is a physics question because the major target of physics is to try to find a correlation between structure and properties. And properties. So I think this is how physics questions should be asked. This is also in a spirit I liked a lot by the American architect Lewis Sullivan. He said, form all those followers functions. That is to give us a good viewpoint, God viewpoint that if you the go design human design biology systems, they always try to finish some of functions by designing the forms. By designing the forms. So, here we want to find out: okay, the structure disassembly is some forms inside the structure, and they try to have this blabbing dynamics to finish the optosis. Okay, then we found we actually, the biologist, the biophysics lab, they introduced a new way to activate the aptosis, induce the aptosis. Because in your way, there are two major stages of optosis. There's two major stages of optosis. One is in activation process that is done by many very complex pathways. But my collaborator just induced another way, which can happen in a very short time. So this activation phase really happens in many hours. But if we just using this new way, we just start from here by introduce some biomolecules, we can activate this sensory. These things directly, so we can reduce the time directly. So, biological details, I'm not very familiar, but I must the biologist this student here, if I are interested how they make it, you can talk to her. Okay, anyway, so we can induce this epitosis in a very short time so that we can do the later imaging processing in a very faster speed. Okay, and then we just put all. And then we just uh put all this uh we we can first uh see the morphology, okay, phenotype. And then we can follow in the whole uh execution of optosis. And then we found indeed there are several processes happened according to biological understanding. First it's a shrink and then it has two major blabbing phases, blabbing stages, one is earliest blab where they have a lot of blab forms and it grew up. Forms and it grew up, and then it retracted back and grew up, retracted back, and this all these cycles in this early blab. But after some time, they enter this last late blab. When the valve grows up, they cannot retract back. So our major focus is only on this early blab, but we also get some understanding on this why this later blab happened. Okay, in order to build out the connection between In order to build out the connection between the structural disassembly and the Labian dynamics, we need to find a way to characterize the structure changes. And the simplest way we found, we use is a thing so-called single particle tracking that we induce, introduce some quantum dots into the cell. And by imaging the cell quantum dots, we can get the diffusive behaviors of the quantum dots, which can be a very useful tool to characterize the Useful tool to characterize the changes of the structure during the hypothesis. So, and according to the old classical paper 20 years ago, they found that if you put the bees into the entangled actin networks, they found there's an enormous diffusion. And this is also what we see in quantum DOS diffusion ins inside the cell. So this shows the very strong dependence of the particle size and the mesh size on this MSD. On this MSD. And you see, the larger the mesh size is, and you found that the diffusion is more close to the normal diffusion, that is close to one. But if the mesh size getting smaller, so this becomes larger, so this becomes smaller and smaller. Okay, this is not difficult to imagine. And so then this is how we introduce this quantum dots into the cell. Quantum dots into the cell. And you see what happens, you see all the quantum dots is random migrated diffusion inside the cell. And from the trajectory, then we can get the diffusion map. Majorly, it's the map of the diffusion exponent alpha, which is to have a spatial and temporal information on the structure. So this is how we can get about the scrotonics and concentration polymers in the cytoplasma during the apoptosis. Okay, these are the techniques we use. Okay, these are the techniques we use, and this is how it looks like about the diffusion map for the quantum dot inside the cell. And you see the different stages, and we erase the alpha distribution of this power exponent alpha. At the beginning, it's only one peak, and after it's a shrink, it's getting shifted to the left, so that means a little bit decreased diffusion because it's a shrink. It's very natural that to see this shrink will induce. See this shrink will decrease the diffusion. But later on, with the black stars, interesting things happen. That is, as here, you only have one peak, but later on, you found the two peaks. That means that some heterogeneity happens, not only one alpha, but some two peak happens. It indicates that during the blabbing, when the blabbing starts, quantum dot diffusion becomes specially heterogeneous. That is why you have two peaks. Have two peaks. And this can also be seen directly from this diffusion map. This is control, this is shrink, and this is early blabbing. You can see heterogeneity already can be seen. In the middle, it's very low because it's very dense. And in the primary, it's very large because there's many blabs there. And in the latest step, you can also see the blab diffused very fast here away from the center, but in the center, very, very dense. In the center, very, very dense already. So, anyway, you found that during the apotheosis, the diffusion map shows a visual heterogeneity and the quantum DOS diffusion URL is slower in the cell body, but faster in the cell blast. So, these are the first characteristics of diffusion, which shows the structure general shows that the cell body is dense, but the blood usually dilute. Okay, this is the first experimental result on the quantum dots. Experimental results on the quantum dots. The second is result is: okay, you look at the early blab, and then you look at the quantum dots diffusing map. You found again that in a cell body, it's a little bit dense, so that quantum dots is very sub-diffusive. But if you look at the optotics black, and you see they're not so crowded, so the quantum dots is close to normal diffuse diffusive. This is consistent to the This is consistent to the previous direct imagery. So there's nothing special here, just the same result. And you look at the latest blab, you found, for example, here, the body become more dense, so the diffusion becomes much slower, but the blab is still very fast, the diffusion very fast. And which tells you that in the later blab, the same thing happens. Blab, the same thing happens, although maybe the structure already dissembled completely, but they are still very relatively dilute in the blab. Okay, then we can compare in the later blab, there are some different, because there are many, many different blasts happening, and we can compare the different blasts in the later blab stage. And we found some heterogeneous in the structure. For example, some blabs are very uniform, so all the quantum dots can. Uniform so all the quantum dots can go everywhere in the blab, but some are compartmentalized, so they can only go to somewhere. That means some organelles enter this blab. And this by this quantum dots evasion for the later stage blab, we show that in this compartmentalized blabs, and they are crowded because organelles there has lower quantum diffusion, so more heterogeneous diffusion because. Heterogeneous diffusion because they can only go somewhere outside of these organelles. And stronger correlation between the correlation between different displacements because they are more heterogeneous. Okay, this is a very quick experimental observations. So then next we want to understand why this happens and how this quantum dots diffusion map, which gives you the structure properties, how this. Properties, how this relates and correlates with the blabbing dynamics. Okay, in order to build up a model, we first do some literature survey to find the typical dynamic processes for the bladdering. And usually they have three processes. First, they initiate the blade by nucleation of the holes at the cortex, and that is a new block, the cortex break can form holes, and the tension will decrease so that. Will decrease so that the cytoplasma will be will leak out through the school, and we should introduce the blabber groups. And once the blabber growth, the actin and all the relative proteins go into the blab, so they recover the cortex and increase the cortex tension so that we can recover back. So we call the blab retraction. So then in brief, the blabbing happened in this way. The first by fluctuations, they form holes. Fluctuations from holes. When the holes are formed, and because the tension is getting smaller here, so then because labor pressure is not balanced, so the cytoplasm will leak out and the garrul introduces the blood garose. After the proteins go into this blab, the cortex formed again to the chat bag. So this is a typical process. So then we think how to build up the minimal cost-grain model. And we don't want to equal all the bars. We don't want to include all the biological details, but we want to know what is the minimal model. Actually, we found a paper by Francois Juni and Eva Paluka's group. They studied a static problem that they introduced a hole artificially by leader, and they can look at the maximum height of this blab. And they build up such a model, mechanical model, to show the relationship between. Show the relationship between the high maximum height of the black in the relation to the other mechanical properties of the cell. But we are doing the dynamics. Maybe it is too complex for us. So we have tried many different models. For example, we think the cell body is just a liquid body with a surface tension, or the other blab is just a liquid blab. And the second issue we make it more and more complex. We make it more and more complex. The body is gel and the blood is liquid. And then we can introduce the cell cortex and active cortex. Finally, we found the minimum model have to be this, which is exactly the same as their model. That is, we need to include the gel properties of the body, and also we can treat the liquid blab as a liquid droplet with surface tension, but we also have to introduce the active cortex. I will tell you why this is the minimal model. You why this is the minimal model. Okay, then it's something like this. According to this minimal model, we have some through variables, is the height of the blab during the group, and also cell body height. They are not independent because we assume the total volume is done to change during this blabbing. So these are not independent. And also, we assume during the dynamic process, the whole site doesn't change with time. So due to this assumption, So, due to this assumption, there's only one independent slow variable in this model, that is the height of the blade, which can change with time. And in this minimal model, then the total free energy includes the bulk elastic energy, which can related to the volume changes, and also the two surface energy. One is the surface energy of this cell body or cortex, the other is the blabber cortex, blabber membrane. Bleb memory, so only three energy terms. But you can see very easily that only if the blab tension is much smaller than the cortex tension of the cell body, and this can have a groove. And it's very easy also to imagine by mechanics, if there's no quotas and everything is balanced and with Laplace pressure, so it's stable. But if some part getting smaller tension, the force balance is broken, so then it's... Balance is broken, so then it has to grow to increase the curvature to increase the loss of pressure. Okay, so that is why it grows. But you have to, this is an important condition only if this is large enough, not because if this gamma B is smaller than gamma C, but still this condition is still not satisfied, and it cannot grow. So the second condition, as I said, we assume there's a volume regulation during the whole process, and there's total volume that changes with time. Change with time. And then the third thing is about dissipation. We need to consider what is the major dissipation during the blabbing dynamics. So there are two major dissipation mechanism. One is during this growth, there's a membrane flow that is attached to the membrane of the blab. And we can have this distributed by this. We can relate it to the change of the surface area of the hole. Of the hole of the blab. And this is the dissipation due to the water permeation out from the cell body because during this contraction, during this blab forming to the whole body, the cell body will contract, the volume decrease. That is, the water inside the cell body will permeate out. So this is another dissipating function, which related to the volume change of the blood volume, or or identically to this volume change of the black body. This volume change of the black body, the cell body. Okay, then we according to the Ansar variational principle, then we can write down the distribution function and the free energy rate of change. And by including the constant, the total volume mixed constant, then we can derive a simple ordinary differential equation about the height of this flap as a function of time. In this model, there are two major time scales. One is related to the membrane flow, and the other Membrane flow, and the other is related to the cytosol permeation inside the gel. And putting all the parameters from experiments, you can see this time scale much smaller than this time scale. And actually, there's another time scale because at the beginning it's a gross, but very quickly they will recover the cortex. So that this is how it looks like. We image the acting intensity and we say. Intensity, and we say the intensity increase time. This can be filled, can be fitted by the field function. It will look like this. And we can define some characteristic time. Not quite the typical time scale, which tells you how fast of this recovery dynamics happen. We don't have a theory for why this acting quartic recovery happened by following this Hill function, but it works very perfectly well. So we use this Hill function fitting. function fitting and to tell how fast and how the surface tension of the blab recover at a function of time. So now by using this we completed the whole equation system and then we can use this model to understand the blabbing dynamics and its correlation to the structure dissembly. So first we see that the early blab where the blab grows and retracts can be further Retract can be further divided into two subphases. The first phase we found the blab are very, very small, so they grew a little bit and retract very fast. And the second is grew to be a little bit relatively larger and retract back relatively slower. And the last phase is just the growing to a very large blab and then they cannot recover back. So this is how it looks like. So there's a beginning, the first few. So, there's a beginning, the first phase of the black is very small, and the phase two getting much larger, and the phase three just grows and then stay there, cannot retract back. Okay, then we can try to use our model to understand these dynamics. First, we do the simplest process. As I said, at the beginning, it grows and the cortex recovers due to the acting cortex rebuilt. And you can imagine the simplest. And you can imagine the simplest process during the whole process, growth and retract, is the rejection process. That is, when the whole core has recovered and they will recover back, this is only driven by the energy, right? And balanced by the dissipative force due to the water permeation through the gels. So, this is the simplest dynamics process in the whole blabbing process. So, in this process, then we can In this process, then we can write down the equation like this: the whole differential equation. And because in this process, the blabs already be large, much larger than the whole size, and this equation is simplified to be this. You can see in this case, HB is just exponentially decay with time. And exponentially decay with time with a time scale given by the TOV I showed related to the water permeation through the del. And this experiment. And this experiment shows that in a later stage, after 30 seconds, it shows a very perfect exponential decay. This is very natural. It's just because when the energy is driven very close to the equilibrium, then it's just exponential decay. This is just an energy relaxation process. So the late retraction process is just an exponential relaxation process. From here, we get a time scale tau v, which is about several times. Which is about several tens seconds. And then let's consider more complex, more complicated dynamics process. For example, this is a small, the phase one, which is small blab, it increases due to the growth and then recover back, reject back. This is the larger, the phase two, larger blab, grow and then reject back. Okay, then we can use our theory to fit this data. These data, these curves, and we found that we use the order of magnitude taken from experiments. We found we can fix these two very well. But if we use the same model to fit the phase three, of course, we get a problem because from direct observation, we see in phase three it doesn't reject. But in here, of course, in our model, it shows retraction. So then we need to understand why. So now, up to now, we have already answered the first. Up to now, we have already answered the first two phases very well, including the final retraction, relaxation process, and initial growth process. So, according to our model, we can understand it very well. So, now it's a problem why the phase three cannot retract. Okay, this is how it looks like in phase one, phase two. Okay, the phase one, phase two is another problem. Why phase one have very small blab, why phase two has a larger blab? This can be. Blab. This can be seen from here. Phase one is very small, blab, phase two is very large blab. The actually correlated to the hole size. At the beginning, the hole is very small because the cytoskeleton content is relatively very thick and very strong. So the fluctuation can only induce a very small hole. But as the cytoskeleton getting dissembled, they can form larger holes. So then they can grow to be much larger black. And this is already been done in a previous. This has already been done in a previous theory to show that the critical nucleation proportion to the tension, surface tension of the memory. So, this is explanation why there's phase one, phase two. Okay, then I'll come back to the phase three. Phase three is a little bit complex because it grows, but C there cannot be trapped. Then we can propose many possible mechanisms. For example, first, because during the epitopis, all the organelles will dissemble. All the organelles will dissemble and it becomes a very dense polymer solution. So, during the blabbing growth, some proteins will be flowing out to the blab, so it makes the blood very dense. So, this is the some intracellular component will flow into this blab, so make it denser. The second possibility is the, because the actin and the myosin, all there, all the reactant protein leak out to this blab, so they can. Leak out to this blab so they can rebuild up their cytoskeleton. The third is they can build up an effective secure cortex tension at the blab. And this possibilities, then we can do experiments to figure out which is the best mechanism. So first time we see that, I remind you that during the later blab, in the cell body, it's already very dense. This is very easy to understand because this later blabbing process. This little blabbing process, many organelles are already dissembled. So they are very dense, so you see very slow diffusion. But here, the cell body, the black body is still very fast in diffusion relative to the cell body. So that means this is not so dense. So that means it's not so dense in the black. So that's this. There's a still similar diffusion if you compare the. Still, similar diffusion. If you compare the diffusion here in this later blab and early blab, the diffusion component is almost the same. So that means this is not due to this, I mean, the crowdedness increase. Okay. Okay, quickly finish. Okay, then in the phase three, in the lab, we can try to understand, we put the larger beads. We put the larger bees and to see that, okay, although the quantum dot diffusion are the same for the lab in the early. The same for the blab in the early blab and the later blab, but if you increase the bead size, you can see a very large decrease in the diffusion. That means, although the blab in the later stage is not more crowded, but they just become more power elastic. This can be understood from the theory showed by Kumar-sen several days ago. And we are quickly, so now the barfit question is why if we break this or transition in the dynamics of Lab. In the dynamics of blabbing. So, what happened for biology? Okay, then we can do some further experiments. We put it in the hyper-osomoting environment, and we can see the acting concentration is larger in the blab. And although in the beginning, some 22 volume decreased, but they recover their volume very quickly. And during this later stage, they just don't change the volume. And you see, in the tension, the acting content intensity becomes larger, and then it will break up, or then they cannot return. Will break up, or then they cannot retract back, they will break up. And after breakup, the whole membrane will break up, and the dumps cannot optosis anymore. So, if they cannot finish the blabbing in a controlled way, then they cannot finish the optosis. Okay, I finished quickly skip. So, there are two mechanisms to understand this. We figure out that because on the cytoskeleton remodels in the blab, not because more. The blab, not because more molecules are built leak out into the blab. Okay, summarize what I told you. So, we want to build a correlation between the structural disassembly and the blabbing dynamics. And actually, there's the reason why there's many different phases and why it's interesting in biology, important in biology, because there's many time scales in competition. So, in biology, time scales, that it takes time to dissemble the cytoskeleton and oxygen organelles. Skeleton and oxygen organelles. And in physics, easy blabbing, they include two, three major time scales, and most importantly these two time scales. And they divide this blabbing dynamics into several stages. And so why the physics important for biology? Because there are many part time scales coming in. If you shut down one process, then the time scale cannot be healthy. Be healthy synergy. So they cannot work well. Okay, this is a very quick summary. And we can imagine what happens. And now we give a physical understanding. So this during the apotheosis, okay, the structure disassembly, at the beginning, there are many organelles, so the diffusion is relatively large. But during the structured assembly, they become very dense. And you can imagine like this, right? So the diffusion will be slowed down, and some structure will be. And some structure will, some proteins will go into the blab, and so we can change the blab dynamics. Okay, and now we want to, so Professor Mussel Doy suggests us to do a more complete model can include the dynamic changes of the horse during the growth and retraction. So, this is what we are working on now. Thank you.
