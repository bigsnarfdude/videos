First, I'd like to thank Christoph, Nathan, and Thomas for organizing this interesting event. I really enjoyed, well, almost all talks. I had to unfortunately miss a couple of talks because I had some teaching duties and one committee, but I was able to attend almost all. So this talk is So this talk is primarily about characters of vertex algebras and I'll also show some connections with Schurz indices coming from 4D 2D correspondences. So when it comes to vertex algebras, I mean it's safe to say that we live in very exciting times. So almost daily there are interesting Almost daily, there are interesting papers on the archive with new exciting connections between low-dimensional quantum field theories and vertex algebra. So many connections have already mentioned this conference, especially for D2D correspondence and Tomoyuki's talk. Then there was also two sessions on the Two sessions on this 3D N equals for gauge theories. And in Sergei's talk, he indicated new exciting connections between new invariants of three manifolds with quantum groups and log VOAs. So there are several talks on representation theory, especially like representation of admissible. Like representations admissible, affine was, like in David's talk and Tomoyuki's talk, and some more general vertex algebras and more sort of complicated representations. And so this is mostly an overview talk. I'll present some recent results, maybe the last two years, on characters and short indices. So there are three parts. Initially, I was planning to say. Initially, I was planning to say something about Z-hat invariance, but that was already in Sergei's talk. So, first part is about characters formula coming from geometry of associated schemes in arc spaces. Then in the second part, I'll discuss infrared type formulas for characters of VOAs. So, something maybe I know physicists know about this sort of powerful meta. This sort of powerful method for computing character of some VOAs, but maybe some mathematicians are unaware of this development. And the last part will be about short indices of S-class supercomponent, four-dimensional supercomponent field theories and related vertex algebras. Yeah, so I wanted to say, as I said mentioned, something about this higher rank Z-hat invariance, but Rank the hat invariants, but as I said, maybe probably will require more notation. But there are nice papers by, I think, Sergei's two former students, Park and Chung. So you should check their papers. All right, so let's now just to recall briefly the definition of the arc space. Definition of the arc space, and I don't want to give you a functorial definition, but simply just start from a finitely generated commutative ring. It's given, defined by this ideal, and then we construct the algebra of MJETs. It's equipped with a derivation, and then we consider the M-jet scheme spectrum of RN. M-jet scheme spectrum of Rm. And if you take the limit, you obtain what's called infinite jet space or the arc space. So we'll be interested in this ring of functions that I denoted by J infinity R. I'll show you some examples. And this was also implicitly, I think, mentioned in Tomoyuki's talk. All right, so let's see how this is related to. How is this related to vertex algebra? Of course, this relation goes through the associated scheme of V. So, again, in Tomoyuki's talk, he mentioned associated graded algebra GRV of a vertex algebra. And then there is a surjective map from this ring from the arc algebra. And it's interesting to well to consider. To consider and maybe to discover vertex algebras that are classically free. So, this is a relatively new notion, but the examples have been known for a while when this psi map is isomorphism. So, you have an isomorphism of vertex-Poisson algebras. So, one advantage of having this isomorphism that you can kind of give a geometric interpretation to the character. Geometric interpretation of the character of a vertex algebra because that's just the Hilbert series. All right, so let me give you some few simple examples just to introduce notation. So this will appear throughout the talk. Q factorials. So you can just take a rank one Heisenberg UA, then your Heisenberg generator is just represented by X. Represented by x. And then, if you look at the Gilbert series for the arc algebra, then this is just the generating function for the partitions. A more interesting example comes from Fat Point, right? So let's take the simplest one, order two. So this is the, as again, I think mentioned in Tomoyuki's talk, this is the C2 album. This is the C2 algebra of the 25 minimal model, Virasora vertex algebra, level minus 22 over 5. Now, on one hand, from the combinatorics of this jet scheme, so what you get, the Hilbert series can be computed in the following way. So it's given by this generating function. But then if you want to obtain bosonic formula, well, you can either impose Well, you can either impose Rogers-Ramanogen identities or use the Faging-Fuchs type character formula for the minimal model. So clearly there is sort of a fermionic formula that should because it captures this geometry and combinatorics of the arc space and bosonic formula would hopefully. The bosonic formula would hopefully come from different considerations, maybe some Q-series identity or a wildcats type character formula. All right, so now a nice source of classically free vertex algebra comes from principal subspaces. They're introduced in 1993 by Fagin and Stojanovsky in the setup of Affine Katzmodilli algebra. So basically, you just take. Algebra. So basically, you just take your Nilpoten radical, you loop it, take the universal enveloping algebra, and act on the vacuum space. So you get a sub-algebra inside the affine vertex algebra of level K. One can also make this construction from lattice vertex algebras, choose a basis of a lattice, and then they take these extremal vectors. Extremal vectors, their k, as many as the rank of your lattice, and then look at the smallest vertex algebra associated to this k extremal vectors. So as I said, many of these principal subspaces are classically free, and this gives us new character formulas. Formulas: There are some interesting connections to quantum dialogarithm type identities. So, it's something that I'll mention also later on in connection to this Argier-Douglas theories. So, just to get a rough idea how this works, I'll show you one example. It's from Um, it's from uh how Lis, my former student's paper, uh, and it's about type B2. All right, so this one is different because as far as I understand, it doesn't come simply from known quantum dialogarithm identity. Um, so here is the formula. So, let me try to explain what's in this formula and what's written here. So, there are basically Written here. So, so there are basically three character formulas for the same thing. Okay, the first formula is obtained using what we call, well, we take simple root, positive simple roots for b2. Now, there is a triple summation that might be confusing, but actually you should look at y one and y two so they control these two simple roots. So, they control these two simple roots. So, the type of character format that you get from the consideration, because this is, as I was saying, this is classically free. It's different and involves this five-fold summation. So, this type of formula captures precisely this combinatorics and this geometry of the arc space. Geometry of the arc space. Finally, the third formula, which you would have to specialize y1 and y2, you have to send them to one, is some sort of bosonic formula. And this bosonic formula, as far as I know, doesn't have some direct interpretation. Maybe one can get something similar, something from using ideas of Fagin and Stoyanovsky on semi-infinite geometry. Geometry. So that's how these formulas come from. That's how you get identities from this classical freeness. All right, so a larger source of classically free vertex algebra comes from what we call graph principle subspaces. And so basically, what you do is you start from an undirected simple. You do is you start from an undirect simple graph with our nodes, and then you cook up what we call graph series. It's given by this Q series, where for the quadratic form, you take the adjacency matrix of the graph. And I'll consider only standard grading when the A1 AR equals 1. So then it's not difficult to see that one can consider. One can construct the principal subspace inside the rank R lattice VOA, which is classical free and whose character agrees with this graph series. Okay. Now, here are a few simple examples. They're both computable in the more sort of explicit form. So you can have, you know, graphs with, like, say, cycle, like this one. Let's say cycle, like this one, or just a simple path. Now, just to compare this with something that is already in the literature and that some people might be already familiar with, is the so-called NUMSUMS. And NAMSAMs are slightly different than graph series. And you can kind of already see this in this formula that we have. This formula that we had for maybe not the one for B2, but there are some features already in the formula for B2. So what we do here, we are using adjacency matrix to cook up the quadratic form. Normally, once if you study AD type sums, then you would take a different quadratic form. So coming from actually precisely all its quadratic form where the matrix is. Its quadratic form where the matrix is different, so it's not the same thing, all right? So, here are some bosonic and fermionic formula. This is one example that it's, I think historically it's interesting because it appeared in the older work of Murtada in 2010 and also in the work of And also in the work of Tomoyuki Kawasetsu, I think Sebag in 2020 related to this question of Rit, which they solve using vertex algebras. So this is sort of typical situation that you have a fermionic formula and then bosonic formula comes from you can prove this bosonic formula simply by well simply by writing a combinatorial basis for this paper. Combinatorial basis for this space. All right, so there are numerous bosonic formulas that we know for various types of graphs, and some formulas are given in these papers. All right, so here is the first result. So, this will, I hope it will appear soon on the archive that gives an interesting. Gives an interesting family of graph series. And you'll see that this example will be related to what I'll discuss later, this Q multiple zeta functions. All right, so here is a result. So there exists a family of graphs. So that means you can get a family of these principal subspaces. And then And then they come from graph with three and plus two vertices. And they have a particular nice form, and they are indefinite matrices. You get indefinite lattices. What is striking in this formula is that this character is really given by something that is familiar. You have the sum of Familiar, you have the sum of powers of divisors. And something like this appeared in McMahon's papers. And it's really, if I hope you can observe that this is the precise logarithmic derivative of the k plus one dimensional McMahon generating series. All right, so these graphs are, they start, they're kind of, they're getting interesting. Interesting when n equals 2 already. So you get this graph with eight vertices that gives the logarithmic derivative of the three-dimensional McMahon generating series. So let me show you how these graphs look like. They're obtained basically by a method of going pentagons. And the graphs that, you know, first pentagon gives just the usual sum of The usual sum of divisors generating series. Then you have to combine more pentagons to get these more complicated graphs. This, all these graphs, they, as I said, they're quite interesting because they're embeddable in certain genus, computable genus surface on the graph. So they're not planar in general. The first one is planar, but this one is no longer planar. All right, so how is this related to multiple zeta values? Well, first, let's recall. Well, first, let's recall a well-known definition of a multiple zeta function. So it's given by this formula where, you know, normally for the multiple zeta function, we want to have this sort of strict summation of indices, but there is also a version with non-strict summation. So they have many remarkable properties, and these properties And these properties come from sort of algebra, there's this sort of motivic description that you get from kind of looking at the relations between when you multiply multiple zeta functions and then you observe that there is a relationship between the product and this triple sum and this. And this motivates a product called quasi-shuffle product. And there are numerous developments and there are numerous conjectures about these algebras that are constructed from relations for multiple zeta functions. So I just listed several people who work on this subject. This subject. And for us, it's more interesting to look at these Q analogs. And as I said, there are two: there is a strict and non-strict version. As far as I understand, they were introduced first in Schlesinger's paper, but then later, I think Caneko and Zao introduced the same object. Maybe with a little, there are some variations on this formula where you kind of change the numerator. So numerator can. So, numerator can be sort of modified slightly. You can also introduce more complicated like polynomial in numerator. So, not only that you allow S1 minus n, SL minus N, but maybe other powers of N1 and NL. Yeah, so as I said, there is, for instance, interesting work of Okunko on Hilbert scheme. Okunkov on Hilbert schemes and Qzeta values, but then again, he's using a slightly different version because the numerator is different. Okay, so now how does this connects with graph series and these principal subspaces? Well, it turns out that you can kind of construct, if you, you can also get an algebra out of this graph series for multiplication clearly of two graphs. Clearly, of two graph series gives you another graph series, and if you introduce some, it's useful, if you like, convenient to invert some elements in this algebra. Then basically, you can get any strict or non-strict multiple value. In particular, this example that I showed you that we engineered sort of Engineer sort of it's gives a um it's a multiple zeta value, but this is the multiple zeta value that has this nice representation. It's one of these sort of miracles, these coincidences where the multiple zeta functions actually can be represented using ordinary qzeta function. So that would be that's the formula. And this formula, yes, it has one, two up front and the It has one two up front, and then the rest is one. All right, so if some of the series that you that I presented here look familiar, that's again, it's not an accident probably because, well, yes, there is a recent interpretation of the homological whole algebra of a quiver using principal subspaces. That's a recent paper. That's a recent paper that Senko Mosgovov. And there are some earlier results also by Konsevich, Soyboman, and FIMO. I think the formula for this Euler characteristic, it gets early, at least for symmetric quivery given by FIMO, also. But Dotsenko Mosgoi found the connection. Connection with principal subspaces. All right, so now let's switch gears a little bit. So far, I was discussing graph series. They're defined, they're associated to graphs. And now I'll look at the closer-related object, but which behaves quite differently, as you'll see, so-called double graph series. Double graph series. So double graph series are again, you start from your favorite graph. You have your adjacency matrix. And the difference is that you just make unlike graph series where you had single poles. Now we have double poles in the denominator. As I was saying at the beginning, so this kind of So, this kind of appears prominently in some infrared computations of SURE indices. Now, as you know, SURE indices normally also have, they're equipped with flavor variables, but I'll omit this in the discussion, even though you can add additional variables, and this can be done also at the level of this graph series. I think an example. I think an example in B2 that I showed you actually had charge variables. So let's see how this works. So let's focus on the Shur indexes of certain Argiers-Douglas theories. All right, so already in the famous 2015 paper. In the famous 2015 paper by Bim Lemosli and the Pillars Rostelli Van Rees, there is a computation of the index for the A1, A2K Argiris-Douglas, and disagrees with the character of the vacuum Virasauro minimal model. For other AD theories, I think shuring this. Theories, I think, Schuring this was initially expressed using platistic exponentials. So for I think A1A2p minus 3 and A1D2p, Buchanan and Nishinaka gave an expression. And I think Thomas was then able in a series of papers, first in 2016, was able to identify these two indices. These two indices with two families of W algebras that we I think we call BP and WP nowadays. And then in a follow-up paper, Thomas also found the interpretation of the index. He was able to express index as a character of some high-rank W algebras. Okay, so now there is an approach to SURE index that, as I said, maybe I think maybe many mathematicians are maybe are not familiar. So let me try to explain what's going on here. So they use earlier work of Sikoti, Naitzki, and Waffa, and also Konsevich and Seubelman to compute the index using this Wolcross technology. And this construction resides on the column branch. So the way it works is you start, ingredients are relatively simple, and it's at least. At least to me, it was very surprising that this actually computes the index. So basically, you start from a lattice, and then there is an associated quantum torus algebra and a quantum dialogarium I already discussed. So then what one constructs is a certain walk-cross invariant generating function and denote. function and denote doll q so we'll call it conservative zeubelmann operator so in order to compute this shur's index okay so maybe let me just give you maybe an example of the basic wall crossing process this is just the pentagon identity now here is a conjecture of cordova and shao um Of Cordova and Shao. It says that basically you can compute the index. And then, if you remember this previous work that I discuss about correspondence between indices and characters, that index can be computed in a very sort of simple way. So you just compute a trace, and this trace is nothing very complicated. Well, the operator. Very complicated. Well, the operator is interesting, but the trace simply means that this is valued in this quantum torus, so trace of x gamma is zero for gamma non-zero, and it's one otherwise. So what you get is you just get a Q series out of this. So a new ingredient comes from this column branch. So the formula that we can is somewhat different. Well, actually, it's very different from the formula that you normally get from a word. Normally, you get from vertex algebras if you're, you know, like examining these fermionic formulas that look like Nam sums. This is slightly different. I mean, one important feature is that, you know, it has this sort of double pulse that I mentioned earlier. All right, so yeah, I have to say that I was really, when I saw this formula, I was, in a way, I was amazed because, you know, Way, I was amazed because you know, I mean, of course, I didn't know about this previous development. I mean, if you read a paper by maybe some earlier paper, Konsevich and Soybelman and Chikotis Naitsky Wafa, then of course, maybe it's less surprising, but I have to say I was amazed that it actually computes, it gives a correct formula. Computes, it gives a correct formula for the character. Okay, so what's going on for Argira's Douglas theory is well, there is a well, there is a OQ operator, Konsevich-Soviet operator can be explicitly written down, and that's the formula. And then you basically, let me show you how it works on a simplest, non-well, simplest example. So A1, A2 are Jira-Douglas. So this is. A1A2 Argiris Douglas. So this is two-foot minimal model. Okay. So we know what the character is, right? But just take a look at the computation and how long it takes to compute the index using this proposal. So all that you have to do is move this x minus gamma 2 over x gamma 1. So to cancel out this x gamma 1 gamma 2. So for this So, for this, you'll use a pentagonal identity, right? For quantum dialogue, and boom, you get a formula. Okay, so that's the formula, and you can check, and I think maybe they did check in the paper, that this really equals the character of the vertex algebra, right? And as far as I know, nobody realized this before that there is another type of, you know, you know. You know, Erogl-Ramarnojan identity has been around for a while, but this gives you a new sort of fermionic type expression. So, this is an example what I would call that where in a way, I mean, maybe to some people, this doesn't sound right, that how these ideas, right, from quantum field theory. So, you don't have to be expert in the area, but you can, in a way, you can revolutionize a field, maybe a field. Maybe a field of Q-series identities just by doing this, even though you know, maybe you know, this is still a conjecture, as far as I know, there is no rigorous proof of this formula. Okay, so yeah, when I became aware of this formula, this paper, I started working seriously on these identities that you can get out of this. So, what we call. Of this, so what we call double pulse series, graph series, and we're able to, if you like, verify proposal in that paper for various types of SURE indices. But we were also able to get other models that do not necessarily come from four-dimensional n equals to superconfirm. Dimensional n equals to superconformal field theory, which is interesting. That's what I'm saying. I think these double poles, pole identities, probably you can get them for character, some more general vertex algebras. All right, so one family of vertex algebra that doesn't appear, certainly doesn't appear because it's super, is this five? So if you look at the n equals one, super conformal, minimal. n equals one superconformal minimal models. So there are these two 4k they also have some sort of a consevicz-soilman type operator and there is a double pulse series. There is also formulas for which is interesting principally specialized even level A11 modules and also you can get formulas for us for what we call n equals one singlet vertex operator algebra. This is a superversion of a vertex algebra. I think, well, I think I know. Drajan and I, we wrote a paper about this, I think in 2009. And then there is a you can make some sort of construction that would be produce something like n equals one, bp type vertex super algebra, just combining bosons. Bosons. So, yeah, so it seems that there is a sort of coming from this, as I said, you know, some maybe more general theory, okay, of this for this double Paul series, directly influenced by a quantum field theory. Okay, so what's interesting is that all these vertex algebra, at least, are classically free, right? Except I know. Except, I don't think it's proven that L minus 2 plus 2p is classically free, but I think this is boundary admissible, it should be classically free. Those are classically free. I think my student showed this. These are known to be classically free, and the others are also all right. So Okay, so now what's going on for these non-vacuum modules? Well, as you know, for index, you're only dealing with the vacuum sector, right? So for the non-vacuum module, so we have formulas for the non-vacuum modules as well. So this is also. modules as well so this is also you get like modules minimal models so here you get two 2k plus 3 minimal models here you have also superconform minimal models and so on well it seems like that there is well it seems there is an interpretation of this formula i think coming from um work of cordova galloto and xiao um And Shao. So, what they did, they studied Schur's indices in the presence of line defects. And they supported, I think, their computations, at least in several examples that they considered. I think A2A4, A1A2A1A4, Argiris-Douglas, I think, and maybe one more. They're able to get because these are computable. These are computable quantities to the left, right? Yeah, I don't, yeah, I haven't written everything here, but I think what's going on is for Argiro-Douglas, I think there are five, A1, A2 has five line defects, if I remember correctly. So it really doesn't matter what these two here. So, but it's computing using this OPE for line defects. So out of this formula, you can get you have a two by two system. So you can get Have a two by two system, so you can get the character formula for the other minimal model, right? And this other minimal model has a correction here. It doesn't look like fermionic formula for the minimal model minus, this is minus 150, where you just change a little bit the exponent. It's more complicated, right? And that's reflected by this definition of this. Definition of this defect operator. So I think that this type of computation, if it's done for all this, for these Argier-Douglas theories, would recover character formulas for non-vacuum modules that are identical to ours. But as I said, that might be. Said that might be complicated to check because of, you know, even for A1, A2, you know, there's you have to write this operator and you have to compute. Okay, so now maybe the last 10 minutes, if I have, I'll talk to class S theories. So So, again, there is a remarkable family of VOAs recently introduced by Tomoyuki, VGS. They're associated only, well, they're associated with gene zero, right? So they're more general. But the one that VOA construction is, no, I think it's as far as I know, it's only VGS. Only VGS for geno zero. And what's interesting about this theory is that, I mean, characters of this vertex algebra is that give what I would say a correct definition of a multiple qzeta function associated with simple E algebra. So it has some very nice properties. And when Q goes to one, it really To one, it really recovers something that it's more or less known. I mean, known. We introduced a while ago in the work of Witten on the volume of moduli spaces of two-dimensional surfaces. So, this would be sort of a special case, really, of the zeta. This would be just a multiple zeta value where all powers, because we are taking here. All powers because we are taking here dimension of V lambda s. So it's always the same power. You can think of the while dimension formula. So for each positive root, you would have one power. And then when all powers are equal, then you have this dimension formula. So what's interesting about Wittenzetta function that on these even values, really, you get to just Even values, really, you get to just a multiple, so it's some kind of q multiple of pi to a power. So you're going to get, you know, unlike some of these multiple zeta values, you cannot express them in this one. All right, so then in Bimerastell's 2018 paper on modular linear differential equations, so essentially what you What you can extract from there is that, and it's explicitly mentioned in Arakawa's paper, who constructed this vertex algebra, that this should be a quasi-list vertex algebra and the characters should satisfy a module linear differential equation with holomorphic coefficients. And these coefficients are supposed to be in quasi-modular forms in a certain on SL2Z or something. On SL2Z or some certain congruence group. So, now what's interesting is that one can actually check using some of these QMZV properties. You can check this the easy part, if you like, of this conjecture, not to prove the quasi-leaseness. That's definitely difficult, but to check at least this modularity. And another reason why you expect. Another reason why you expect this to show is simply by looking at the q goes to one behavior, because you're not really getting, you're still getting just some multiples of pi, so something that should be associated to Eisenstein series, right? Okay, so let me finish with two more examples, and this comes from first example again, it's related to this multiple. Related to these multiple zeta values for sure index for the sure index of n equals four super young males. So Boudiere, Drucker and Felix in 2015, I think they gave a formula for the Schur index. And I think they were able to express this index in terms of derivatives of theta functions. So you get a quasi-modular form. Quasi-modular form. But what's interesting again, there is this zeta function representation for multiple zeta functions for the index. This time is this 2222 version, which also appeared in Mec Mahon's old paper. And maybe let me comment also as far, I mean, I don't know if maybe if there is an expert. Know if maybe if there is an expert in the audience who would know what would be a corresponding vertex algebra in this case, and if there is a proposal for a vertex algebra whose character is this Shur index, and maybe one more example, this one is maybe it's not so well known, so I would like to mention it. It comes from extensions of level minus one SLN vertex. One SLN vertex algebra and is bigger than or equal to three. So this is something that is considered Drajan and I, we studied. There is a paper on the archive. And we conjecture that this one will be a quasi-lease vertex algebra. It has certain central charge. So unlike maybe these class S theories, Theories where maybe modularity is not obvious. Over here, we have sort of very nice description of the characters using Jacobi forms. So because we were able to express character using Jacobi forms of then we were able actually to prove it was just a Actually, to prove it was just a coefficient, constant term of a Jacobi form, then we were able to get quasi-modularity. Again, I don't know if this model is related in any way to 4D theory, but I think it also, there is modular linear differential equations that we consider. I think some examples we gave in our paper, but again, I think also there should be some sort of QZ. QZ type representation. And maybe that's enough from me for today. So that's all. Yeah, thank you very much, Tantra. Yeah, please, everybody, ask a question. Zagi. Well, many questions, but I'll ask two about this graph sounds. So one question is whether you can apply technology from your paper about a month ago where you use error function to detect or study modularity to say something about modularity. To say something about modular properties of these graph sums, for example, could they be high depth? Well, yeah, there are okay, so a lot of these graph series are what's called quantum modular forms or mixed quantum modular forms, and those that I showed you coming from those where the graphs. Yes, from these guys, these are what Zagir calls, I think, holomorphic quantum module forms. I wonder if maybe it's already in your paper or some follow-up, or can one use this technology with error function to detect high-depth properties if sometimes it happens that it's high-depth? That it's high depth modular form. Yeah, I think we have some examples that we believe that they're higher depth. I think it's in my paper that you referred to. But yeah, so many. So like, for instance, when you start doing like d-type graphs, we're getting this mock modular forms. They can be expressed using indefinite theta functions. functions. So yeah, so just trying, yeah, many graphs that we try, it seemed that there is like it's a higher depth quantum module form. Oh yeah, okay, that's very exciting. If you don't mind, I have another quick question. So same graph sums, exactly the same in the sense that they generalize num sums associated to more general adjacency metrics. To more general adjacency matrices appear in this not Giver correspondence. Yeah, I think we cited this paper. No, no, but I wonder if there is a connection. I'm not myself an expert on it, but from what I understand, it sounds like okay, so I can answer your question. So I noticed your paper from two days ago, and I'm planning to read it, and maybe I can email you then. Well, the note correspondence is not I'm not responsible for that part. I'm just learning it myself. Oh, okay. All right. Yeah, but I'm aware of this development, but there is my understanding that you need to. Are there additional variables also? Yeah, I think even if we specialize variables, Even if we specialize variables, the set of graphs is probably the same. Those guys call it preverse. Basically, that's the graph for them. But I think it would be extremely helpful to identify connections to DOAs or something like that. I don't think this has been done. But of course, it should be fermionic form. Yeah, I totally agree. And this would be something like, you know, a super character. Yeah. Well, thank you so much. Well, thank you so much. That's super exciting. To be another question, so Anton, I found it curious that you also found these nice identities for n equals one. n equals one super virasso and in many respect respects uh i mean n equals one super viraso comes from osp12 which is a least super algebra but that it behaves behaves in many respects like a simply laced legeba actually and so so you have a for interpretation for this right that's what yeah this is what i i want to raise the question as uh i mean The question is: I mean, I think, I mean, maybe it's possible, see, because the Aguiros-Douglas theories are based on a pair of simply laced Dinkin, I mean, Dinkin diagrams of simply laced Lie algebras. And so maybe it's possible to also work out some theories based on OSP. I don't know. This is really this my comment to your question, Mark. Is it only for the vacuum sector, or there is also this? Sector, or there is also this to my knowledge, nothing is known there. But I think you really raised the question: can one also build some theories based out of orthosymplectic Dinkin diagrams? All right. Maybe we should ask the physicist. Davida would be a good one, for example. You should ask them. Do we have another question? Okay, let's all thank Anton for his very, very nice talk. And yeah, our final speaker will be Davida. Davida Gallotto. When will we restart? Let me look up the schedule. In 10 minutes at 12 o'clock.
