Next up, we'll talk about decisional dimension of semantic groups for high encourages. I changed the title. That's a related topic. So this is based on joint work with Oklahomis. I would like to thank the organizers for inviting both of us to this conference. So I'm going to start out by recalling that. out by recalling the definition of the essential dimension of a finite group over a base field K. So by finite group I just mean an abstract finite group. So we start with a faithful representation and then we compress it. So compression is like this. Like this, take the dominant and g equivariant. And the g action here should be faithful. So, obviously, I don't want to compress everything to a point. So, everything is defined over the base field level k and then. The base field level k and then the essential dimension of p over k is the minimal dimension of x and the minimal mistake and overall compressions. So, a couple of remarks. First of all, this number is independent of the choice of the representation. The choice of the representation. So, in particular, we can take this regular representation, and that will be defined over the integers. And because of this, so if we make the place field a little larger, then in essential dimension. And this is an integral mention always goes down. I mean, this becomes less than or equal to, and if k is algebraically closed, this is actually equality. And that's not just. That just follows from the definition. We can start with the regular orientation, not having any compression that we have over. So over L, we could conceivably have more, there's more room. So we take the minimum over those percent. And then H is a subgroup of G, then the essential dimension of H is less than or equal to the essential dimension of G. Also obvious because anything that's G equivariant will be H equivariant. So now let me stay two theorems. Not very difficult. So if is like this, elementary of helium T group, then intentional rematch from G is greater than or equal to R, and then equality for if J contains K contains the primitive of ethical T. And then this is a very, very basic special case of the Penkamer-Kuri theorem that describes the essential image of a finite peak number. So this is two is from a joint paper with Audrey Brosnan coming on to what is Philly. So the characteristic It's zero and the characteristic of L is P positive. It's not the same L is also statistic P? Well, the primitive P through unity doesn't exist in characteristic P. Doesn't exist in characteristic pieces with respect. For the first part. For the first hour? No, the essential dimension of this and characteristic P is one actually. For any other. So it's very different. And it's okay, then you have statements off. Okay. So so then The in characteristic zero is bigger in almost all cases, provided G has no non-trivial normal piece of it. Okay. Okay. So for the rest of the talk, I will specialize to the case where G is the symmetric deepest set. So in this case, So, in this case, this is from 1997. There will be a very nice shot that the essentials are. The essential dimension of Sn plus 2 is greater than or equal to the essential dimension of Sn plus 1. And so in particular, the essential dimension of Sn is greater than or equal to the integer part of n over 2. And then the second step is that the essential dimension of That the essential dimension of Sn is less than or equal to a minus n. So here I need to assume. So in A, the characteristic is different from 2, and in D, N should be greater than or equal to 1. What the characteristic interpretation? So this, so I'm not going to show you a proof of this, but this inequality, which is all I need for this talk. For this talk follows from this SN contains this group. So this is generated by two cycles: one, two, three, four. So then the essential dimension. Then the essential dimension of this is the integer part of n over 2, so for Sn has to be pleased that big. And this follows from, so this is the code V, we use the following compression. So and so this is a standard representation. And so this is a standard representation of Sn. So that's my V. And then it's birationally isomorphic to V1 to Vn. And here the L2R's here diagonally, same way on each P1. Way on each P1, and then we take the quotient. So this is my X. And because the SN action commutes with this PGL2 action, it descends here, and then one needs to do a little bit of technical work to figure out how to take the quotient here, and then to show. And then to show that the Sn action here is phase. And that that last step requires the assumption that n is at least 5. But this, because the dimension of PGL2 is 3, this has dimension n minus. So So this gives the central dimension of S5, S5, essential dimension of S6, it's sorry, not 5, it's 2, 3, so that follows from these two inequalities. But then for, so the characteristic here is not here. So the characteristic here is not here. And then for n bigger than 6, these two inequalities diverge. So one increase is like n over 2 and the other one n minus 3. So it is a, I mean the whole theory of essential dimensions are started. Of essential dimensions sort of started from this, but then there were lots of other developments for algebraic groups. But somehow this basic question of what this essential dimension is for the symmetric group remains open. And not that much progress has been made. So the big question is, is it closer to n over 2 or even minus 3? Or n minus 3. It has only been resolved in one case, and that's the case where n equals 7 equals n 4. Yeah. So So the essential dimension of S7 is 4 case of characteristic 0. So it looks like in this case at least that this n minus 3 and most people believe that it should be n minus 3. For all N starting from five, or maybe for most N starting from five. And people asked me maybe four months ago. I would have been certain that that's the case, but now I'm not anymore because of the following theorem. Okay, so assume that K is a field of positive. The K is a field of positive cactus, and moreover, all of cactus. So choose N such that, first of all, E divides N. And secondly, the binary presentation of M has at least four ones. So unfortunately, this is unfortunately this doesn't cover separate so then the essential dimension of Sn over K is less than or equal to n minus 4. There's one condition that I left out. It's minor. So if n actually has exactly four ones, then I want k to contain a field of order p squared. So then I play four lines assuming that we're going to be able to get a little bit of a message. So, a couple of remarks. So, first of all, for fixed P. So, the set of n to which the theorem applies satisfying these conditions as they answer to Density 1 over p. So this first condition is satisfied, obviously, by 1 and p integers, and the second one is basically 100% of the time, asymptotically. Secondly, the smallest than Theorem five applies is fifteen. So that's two plus two squared plus two terse power plus two power squared. So final. So fine, line, line, line. Okay. How much more time do I have? I'll destroy the whole group and then at least Baltimore.  So start with a n again. So this is the natural representation of Sn in two steps. So first we go from A n to what we call x1. Uh what do you call x one two so this is the so let me call it X such that S one. Um S1 of X equals S two of X equals zero. So these are elementary symmetric problems I here the ith elementary symmetric problem. So that's the first step. So here the dimension is n, and we go down to n minus 2. Not quite enough. We want n minus 4. So we compress it one more time. So um so this comes up. So the resistance of pi one put it on the tool always for any dial algebra. Oh, the dialogue is about E over F of degree and there exists an element, say alpha E such that phrase Trace of alpha equals trace of alpha squared equals here. So the trace here is in the settle algebra, and I assume that k is contained in that. So you mean non-zero. Yeah, non-zero. So this is essentially quadratic form theory. So what we do is we use, so we think of the trace zero elements as a quadratic space with respect to this quadratic form, and then we use Springer's theorem. And we use Springer's theorem. So we go to the node-degree extension of F and simplify the trace form. And so all these conditions that I imposed on n that it should have 4. So the binary presentation of n tells us how this form. This form, how this form will, how this etal algebra will decompose when I go to the special closure of F. So this is not difficult, actually. And so what's new here, the new step is this phi2. And phi 2 doesn't require anything. Phi 2. So to go from here to To go from here to compress it to something of dimension n minus 4, the only condition we need is that n should be at least 5. And so the idea here is that this, so remember that the group, so if I think of this an as p1 to the power n. To the power n, then we have the group PGL2 acting on that. But of course, PGL2 is not going to preserve this x12. But it turns out that in prime characteristic only, it's a characteristic, it's a characteristic p phenomenon, that the Borel subgroup of this actually preserves X1, too. So B. So B that's triangle or upper triangle on matrices so ox on x12 is called SG so by g x1 and x. X1 Xn goes to alpha X1 plus beta alpha Xn plus beta and so then this Y is just around X12 B and B is two-dimensional so we subtract B is two-dimensional, so we subtract two more than one dimension. We get ten minus one. Thank you. Questions? Yes, sir. So it reduces something at all degree extensions. So to your so let's say that n, let me write it in binary. Say 2 to the power m1 plus 2 to the power m2 plus 2 to the power mr 1 is greater than 2. So these are the positions of the digits in the binary expansion. Then after no degree extension So when my tensor was F prime, I will denote the tensor product by E prime. So then E prime is of the form as an F prime, a tau algebra, is of the form say E1 times. R where the community of set prime. I mean, these may be field extensions or they may be double-lt. Extensions, or they may be at all altruists, they may decompose more. But so the trace form is still mysterious here, but one thing I know is that I have this subspace here, Fpi, where it's completely transparent. So so if I put scalars here, it's e to each entry. And so there I can I look for my alpha in there. Look for my alpha in there. I should say that I didn't state it strongly telling me about this. So it shouldn't be in F. But if I put anything in there, so P divides N, so if I put, say, one here on. So, if I put, say, one here, I will get a nil like that. But I want something other than that. So, I need the dimension of this space. This is hard dimension. I need the dimension of this space to be big enough so I can find, I can show that the the the trace form becomes isotopic here. When good characteristic three is a Characteristic, three is a but in bed characteristic because I want to avoid F. Other questions? So in main results you have to, I mean you assume that the characteristic is not true. Do you know if those results are false in characteristic two or is it a problem? I don't know. So the lemma can be modified, I suppose, would have to be modified with the S2 here instead of the trace of alpha squared. But I don't even know what the essential dimension for S6 is vectoristic to. The other thing I wanted to mention is that the conditions on the end with the digits, that they may not be optimal for this theorem. But one thing I know for sure is that some kind of condition is required, because for five and six it fails. For five and six, it is actually n minus three. Even in finite characteristics, so I can never get to n minus four. Get to our minus four. Before this theorem, why were you so sure that it would be even minus three? I mean, there's been a heuristics pretty sure it was supposed to be at close to any close to the microphone. I guess Duncan's near was the only piece of evidence there was. Obviously to simplify it and make it simple. Yeah, the other thing I should mention is that that theorem that I stated that it goes to the case of the colour. Stated that it goes up by at least one every two steps. So as you increase n by two, the essential dimension increases by at least one. So that can be applied to Gronkin's theorem. That shows that at least for n odd, the integer part of n over 2 is not the right value. One bigger than 1. One bigger than one. So that, of course, there's a big gap between that and n minus three, but at least it shows that the integer part of n minus two is not the right answer characteristics. Right, um so let's chance the movie again.
