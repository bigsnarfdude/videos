Talked about the table and the chair, so thank you. Oh, spectral approximations beyond the actual. Thank you very much. Okay, thanks. Thanks a lot for the introduction. Especially I would like to thank the organizers for first of all the invitation and secondly the opportunity to talk here. So let me from the beginning say I'm trying to give mainly a talk but also simultaneously slides. So if you cannot see anything tell me I can always pull down Tell me, I can always pull down the string whenever I need it, but I would like to avoid it as much as possible. Okay, so as already mentioned, I'm going to talk about the table and the chair, tiding actually, I didn't write it, but I'm talking about furniture and spectral approximations beyond dimension one. And what I'm going to do is I'm like kind of discuss various works with on the one hand with Ban Ban, Jean-Berliza. One hand with Brand Ban, John Berizar, Giuseppe Denitas, Felix Popuchelski, and Alberto Trakasil and Leo Temenbaum. And personally, I would like to emphasize especially the last two persons, so this younger than me, the PhD students who, on what they were doing, I'm focusing especially at the end. Okay, so what I'm going to do is I actually What I'm going to do is, I actually, my aim of the talk is actually to lay the ground for some kind of discussion, because actually I have some questions that I try to answer. And there are some experts here that maybe have some ideas. And so let me try to start by just explaining the setting. And whenever you cannot read anything because it's too small or the camera is not showing on it, I don't know. Maybe the technical. People are doing a good job. Okay, because, well, if you can see it, I'm fine. So what do we have given? We have given a compact metric space and a denote space C. Yeah, to be honest, online it seems to be cut off. I think it's supposed to follow you around. So okay. Just move again. Just move around. Say again? Move around. Move around, okay. Like this? Hello? So let's try to see. When is the camera coming to this board? Camera coming to this board. So I'm gonna come back with zoom and check what there is some kind of light, I think, because that it changes, it follows you, but yeah, but it doesn't show the whole board here. Maybe check the check. No, it's not possible. It's not a cat, I'm not sure that knocking on the board is what I'm doing. It was told there are microphones in there, so that should work. That should work. I mean, I can also, you know, it might be it looks very weird. I was told that if the screen is not all the way up, the camera will look for the screen, so maybe that's why the line, maybe the camera thinks that's the screen. No, but I can see the person. Okay, cool. So let's see if it's now, hopefully that helps and show because it's actual. If not, then I'm erasing the stands. Yeah, I'm making sure. Because that's exactly what it kept us going about, right? Oh! Now it's about, now it's when they're yeah, but it shows only part of it, but half of it's okay. So let me try to write and then let's see if it Oh. Not really. Should I press wiki conference system and then just switch back to laptop whenever I need it? We can try it. But Video would possibly no Video would just video is the external zoo, but that will not help. Um this one will still be the right one. This one would still be the right one. Yeah, I'm not too sure why. I have zero idea. It should show the full board. It just does not have terminal monitron. No, no, that just controls this and then the projector is just a projector. The only other option laptop and then just put it on the back. The last one there, you cannot. I cannot see the last one. Yeah, but it also doesn't show this platform completely. No, it does. It does. Now? It does, but it's always Zoom's kind of half. It cuts. Yeah, right. Yeah, they get some trouble shooting and the colours. Possibly more problem, better the case. Just it doesn't use the same thing. The only thing I can catch as well is actually the path where you can use it. Okay, I can write there and Right there, and that was kind of annoying if I had to write some time. So, maybe let me try it right here and see if that works. Yeah. I'm actually probably going to zoom out after you. Okay, so let's see if we fit in with T. Okay, so let me start again. So, we have a compact metric space, C, and we have given some locally compact second count of the group. Don't worry too much about it. Don't worry too much about it. What you should think of all the time is think of G being either like Z D, for instance, if you like. If you like screwed case, if you like the continuous case, you think of R D. Switch to right. Okay, that doesn't work. Z D, think of R D. But if you want, you can also think of the Eisenberg group. Continuous one, discrete one, or if you want, you can even think of a free group with two generators. Just to give you some examples, a locally compact set example. So we have given such a group, and what I'm interested in is a dynamical system. So what we want is some map, alpha, from G cross Z to Z. And what do we demand of this map? Well, first of all, well, we have some topologies here, so we want to have something continuous. So the neutral element of the group is usually denoted by E. That's a common notation. So alpha of E is going to be shift by the neutral element. What should happen to X? Well, nothing. It just stays where it is. And on the other hand side, if we shift something by G and then shift it again by H, it should happen. Shifted again by h, that should be the same as shifting simultaneously by the drama of the h, and then by that sequence. Okay? So that's a topological dynamical system. And in order to simplify my life, I will write gx for alpha jx from now. Okay, so I just wanted to specify that we have this. Now let me go to a specific example. We're going to focus actually most of the time of I'm going to focus actually most of the time of my talk, Z. And what do we have there? Well, that's probably more familiar. Is that we take alpha one dot. This is a map from Z to Z and we have these two conditions and homeomorphism. So we have a homeomorphism given on the space C and I will give you a few examples in a second, if you can read them. If you can read that online. And if you iterate this homeomorphism, then this is nothing but the playing alpha. It then follows from this function. Okay, so these are the dynamic systems. And now I wanted to write you some examples, but I only have this board, meaning me. So I have to raise, unfortunately. Now try to move there. Maybe it will move. Okay. So let's see. So let me give you two examples. Example one. I take z to be the interval 0, 1 and either the torus or the sphere, whatever you prefer. And g to be the integer 2. And now I said I want to have a compact metric space. So this is compact. What's the metric I'm choosing? I just take the following. So if I have two elements here, so meaning beta is an element of 01, theta is something of a sphere, and the distance of those. Sphere and the distance of those two is first of all the Eugenian distance on R and maximum of the distance on the sphere of theta1 and theta2 on this function. Okay, that's my metric and then I have compact metric space. And what is the action? That's the action I think you know. It's just the rotation on a torus. The torques. So having a beta t to the n beta of theta. And what is this doing, it takes the theta and we shift it by minus beta plus theta and then looking inside the cube. Okay? That's my dynamics. I just rotate on the course. Okay? Okay? So that's one example for a dynamic system. And this example will, at the end, give us the almost matrix operator. Is that an integer part? Yes. These are these also called. They just erase the integer part. So I subtract one is better and then I view like the sphere as the integral part. The interval zero. Okay? So the second example that I write here, see what works. Hopefully not. Okay. Okay. So you're more convinced than I am. So the second example I'd like to look at is the following. So we have some finite set We have some finite set that we denote it by A. It doesn't work still, right? It did actually take B. You have to continue rewriting other. Okay, let me write here. Why do you always touch the door? Just fight here. Sorry. Okay, so let me write it again. Okay, so let me write it again. So the second example I want to look at is the case where I have this product of space A to the set D as I mean I give from Z D to A. A is a finite set. And this should be my compact metric space. So what is the metric I'm going to choose? There are plenty I can choose, but I'm going to choose the following one. Choose that I'm going to choose the following one that takes the intimum of 1 over r plus 1. r is some positive number such that omega decrease upon the ball at variance r around zero and broken. So what you should you should think about is. So the A is a sum finite set. You can think of different variant stretch of atoms for instance that I put on my letters. That I put on my lattice. And now I'm asking: if I have two such configurations, when they are close, I wanted to show you some slides. When they are closed, they are close when these configurations coincide in around the original on a certain ball. So these examples here, for instance, I think have distance 1 over 3 or 1 over 4. Okay, so the second thing I want to have is I want to add this connection. So, what is the shift? The shift is just, so my king is Z D, and if you take two elements in Z D, then the shift of n omega of the place E is omega of minus plus n. Okay, so if you do this carefully, for instance, in this example of dimension 2, what happens if you want to shift by minus 4, minus 3? Comma minus three. That means just you go four to the right and three to the up, and that's where your new origin is. That's this shift. So all what I'm doing is I'm shifting my original one. Okay, good. So these are two examples for dynamical systems. And the one I told you first about will give Told you first about will give us at the end the almost Mafia operator. The one I just showed you now will give us, for instance, the Fibonacci Hamiltonian. If we do additionally, be a bit more precise, so an example, an example, so say d is equal to 1, and again we take some beta 0, 1, and the alphabet is just has two. Just has two letters here. Either it's a zero or one. Either there's an atom or not, or whatever we want to have. Then we look, we want to have a sequence of zero and ones on z. So I define it as follows. I take the characteristic function of the following interval: 1 minus alpha left open, 1, right closed, and alpha naught of 1. Okay? So I. Okay, so I multiply alpha with n, take modulus 1, check if it's in this interval or not. If it's in this interval, I get a 1. If not, I get a 0. Get 0 some volts, a sequence of 0 and volts. And this omega alpha has no such z. And if you choose alpha to be the golden mean, you will get at the end the Figurinator control. Okay, so now Now let's see where I continue to write. Well, since you probably know the almost metric of words are best anyway, is this here? So now we have the dynamical systems and I would like to take a focus on the special setup. So suppose we are given some dynamical system Given some dynamic system, Z and a group B, I would like to focus on subsets of Z satisfying the following condition. So first of all, it should be not empty. Maybe I should close that. Not empty, closed, and environment. Okay, what does invariant mean? Invariant means that for all g and g, I want that if I shift my whole set by g, then I get back the original system. I take each element in y, shift it by g, and then I demand it's again in y. Then I call the set invariant. So what is this JC? It's kind of the set of all possible dynamical subsystems. Let me Let me do again some examples. Well, the most trivial one is C itself is inside X. It's closed, isn't it? Oh, yeah, I'm assuming that is a non-empty compact matrix space. And it's automatically invariant because I'm acting on Z. So alpha was mapping from G to Z to Z. So whenever I shift an element of Z, I end up in Z. So what are other models? So, what are other more interesting examples? So, take for instance an arbitrary element from here. Whatever you want. Forget this example or the other example that just erased. Then you can look at the orbit. What is the orbit? It's all translates of x by any element in G. If I have this set, this over, automatically it's non-empty because at least it contains x. It's not empty because at least it contains x. It's also invariant. In general, it will be not closed. But if you look at the orbital closure of x, because the action is continuous, it stays invariant. This is one of the typical examples in here. And for the rest of my talk, you can always think of such systems. Now, my plan was to go back to the two examples, assuming they are still on the board, which I don't have. So um I think you can mark the report. You think so? I don't know so. So so okay, we have we have two examples. One example wants Z to be 0, 1 plus S1. And what are the specific dynamical systems I want to focus at are those here. That's you take a single beta across Letter cross called as a one. So this is one possibility for a dynamical subsystem. Unfortunately, I erased it, but if you remember the action on the torus, it was the beta tells me on how much I rotate. Here I take the whole sphere, so I rotate the whole sphere, it stays inside, so it's in rare, it's closed, everything. And if Z And if z is this zero one to the z, so the one I just simplified here, then my omega beta could be just over closure of this given sequence. Ah, I on complaint I didn't want to use alpha because I used alpha for the action. To use alpha because I used alpha for the action. So I take this two-sided infinite sequence of serial ones, I shift it around, and then I take this closure in this metric. So whenever it converges locally. Good. And as I already told you here, this is always an element. Good. So these two examples I want you to remind. I want to do it to remind. Originally, I planned to keep them on the board, but since it doesn't work, I cannot do that. So, what I want to do next is I would like to introduce the operators that I want to consider. So now it's currently a bit confusing, so please ask me if you cannot follow something. I hope that I can keep more and more. So now what are the operators we're interested in? The operators we are interested in are defined by a nice function on our On our dynamical system. Okay, so what? So maybe let me wrap up again because it's a bit confusing with all these camera systems. So what did I do? I said I have a dynamical system, some metric space, some group. Then I gave you two examples. One, product space, and the other one, some rotation on the torus. Then by whatever reason that you will see in the next kind of subject, I introduced you these dynamical cell systems. Cell systems that are becoming crucial soon. They become crucial because I want to study the spectrum of such operators. So let me define the operators now. So I switch back, general system, and then we apply it afterwards together to these two specific examples. And we will see Bowman's Mafia operator will pop up and Fubernachi Manitone will pop up. Okay? Good. So what is this A? This A is a bit like what we have seen this morning already. What we have seen this morning already in your talk, it's like the integral kernel, or whatever you want, of the operator. So, I want for the time being that it's a continuous function on my dynamical system, and it should be bounded. We will require more, like you require exponential k, but don't let me go into the details yet. Okay? Now, what is the operator? The operator for a given x and z, so for one configuration, say for one alpha and one theta in the. For one alpha and one theta in the A MO case, is defined as follows AX. Well, first of all, it should be a bounded operator, this is L, and it should be a bounded operator on the L2 space of my group. I told you, think of R D if you want to take the continuous case, think of Z D if you want to talk about the separate case. And there are two spaces with respect to its hard. Spaces with respect to its hard measure of the group, which we have because we have nice topological assumptions on our group. That's delta space. And what is the operator? Well, as I said, it's integral kernel. We apply it to a function psi at a point g. You assume that it's symmetric or you don't assume anything? Not yet. So what I'm doing, I take the integral of a g, it's maybe a sum, if we are just three. It's maybe a sum, if we are discrete. And it's a of g inverse x, g inverse h psi h. I don't know, can you read that? Not I can write it again. Let's write some trees on the. You said we lost KRD, but then it's a bounded operator always, or it depends a bit on the decay in the off-diagonals or how it decays. In the off-diagonal, so how it decays in G. We need some assumption on G, like we see in this morning, she was assuming some exponential decay. So, if you think of Rd, what is A should be typically is like the heat kernel. But I want to give you an example. I will give you only an example in discrete case. For the continuous case, I will sit together with you with a lot of here on the board. Okay, but there is a way to do that. But now, okay, this is just some kind of formula if you haven't seen it before. Kind of formula if you haven't seen it before it sounds like it's kind of weird. So let me try to explain it in a bit of detail. In the sense I give you an example again and I stick to the example that we had before, just the integers for simplicity. So now what is A? Take for instance A to be the following function plus Plus V cross delta zero, where V is a continuous function on Z with real values. Now, first question: is this a continuous function on Z cross G? G. Well, g is just z, so it's discrete, so indeed if I take here these delta functions, which is very, it's continuous, and on v I demand it to be continuous. And now, really, just simple computation, if you take this a, plug it into this integral, where the integral is replaced by sum over the integers, what do you get? You get that get the normal free la flash on z plus the potential which somehow depends on or dynamic existence. So this minus n is just minus of the integer and then this means we act on x. We act on x. So you should think of this here like alpha minus x. Okay? Or if you prefer, in the language of these homeomorphisms, t to the minus n of x. Good. So these are operators we know. Okay, so you have seen before. And now, yeah, let me pay the paper. I'm sorry, maybe. What is it you assume about T? T here, this T. So first of all, this T was defined by alpha. This T was just and I don't assume any ergodicity, I don't assume anything. Just dynamicity. At the end, all the examples I'm actually unique. No, but you do assume that it's invertible. Yeah. Okay. So it's not. Yeah. Okay. So it's not. Yeah, I want to have a proof action. Okay, so now I wanted to go back to these two examples we had before. One's the case where we had 0, 1 cross 1 or torus. And I want to choose now. See here I defined it by a certain V and the V I choosing here is 2 times the real part of e to the 2 pi i tether. Okay? Clearly this is a nice Okay, clearly this is a nice continuous function. And if you now compute this potential term here, then you actually observe that you just plug in how I define the action, you get a 2 cosine 2 pi alpha input set of 1. So that's actually giving me back the usual form of my theoretical model. Now instead, if I go to this other model, then we still have functionally here. So what I'm now doing, I want to have a continuous function on z, but z will On z, but z was this a to the raise a to the z, where d was 1. So z configuration, and what is this function doing? It's just evaluating what I see at 0. Do I see a 0 or a 1? Again, if you compute minus omega alpha, you just get the value of omega alpha at the end of the position, 0 or 1. So if alpha is the golden mean, this The golden mean, this potential we get here is exactly the usual thing that people consider for people nothing more to. If you want, you can put the coupling constant on it. So now the question is how does the spectrum look like? So these are things actually you know, or you probably have seen already very often before. Left hand side is the picture from Hofstetter from 76, where for different alphas, the spectrum is plotted here on the horizontal line. Here on the horizontal line. And here on the right-hand side, that's essentially the same philosophy. So, different alphas, we plotted the different spectrums here. And this picture is actually produced by a student from Technon in 21, but there was some, like already in the 80s, 82, I think, or 83, some physicists, Oslan and Kim, produced similar pictures, but the resolution was not that nice. So I chose, I had to take this picture. It shows that the table signatures. Now, what is plotted here? Actually, everything that's plotted here is only from rational outcome. And the hope is that we can get some insight from the rational ones for the irrational ones. I think we have seen this several times. Take nice periodic approximations. And then we hope we can say something about irrational case. And that's kind of the point of view that I want to take, but I don't want to spend uh focus on one dimension case, I want to go to higher dimensions. Okay? To go to higher dimensions. And the question is: how can we tackle this? What kind of results are still valid in the higher dimension case that we don't have in the one-dimensional case? Because in the one-dimension case, we are using very heavily the transformatrix method, trace methods, and so on. And going higher dimension is very, very difficult. Good. So now, let's see. There are some known results indeed, as you know. I will show them in a second. But first of all, I want to connect it to everything I told you before, so that you get at least somehow a feeling why I was telling you this. So first of all, I introduced here these operators. So what is the spectrum? Now, the thing is a bit, like I have here a dynamic assistant, right? Like, I have here a dynamic assistant, right? I can look at the spectrum of a single operator, but the point of view, which is often in this case more useful, is to look at actually not one single operator, but a family of operators, a certain family, for instance, associated to a specific dynamical substance. And if you take, remember these are all closed non-empty invariant subsets, an arbitrary invariant here, and you find the spectrum. The spectrum of this operator, and that's also the value of the most as the union of the spectrum of the single one, and then I take the closure, just to be sure that I have a closed set. If you look at that, you may worry because maybe we take a huge union of spectra, but actually we are maybe interested just in the spectrum of a single one. So, how does this help us? Well, it helps us in the sense. Well, it helps us in a sense if we have that x is the orbital closure of a specific element, like we have in this omega alpha, what I showed you before, here, the setting. Then, very difficult to see, that uh the spectrum of this operator, I mean, just coincides with ah, the spectrum single operator. The spectrum is a single operator. So, if I have, for instance, properties like topological transitive, minimum, for example, then everything reduces to the spectrum of a single one. And that's why I told you, think of these type of systems, and don't think too much on that. Okay, so now I told you everything here is plotted in the rational case. We want to say something about the irrational. As you all know, there are a lot of results that we have continuity of the spectrum. Continuity of the spectrum. But okay, so let's come to that in a second. But let me present you first the formula here. And that's a joint work with John Belisan and Giselle Peters from 2018. Okay? So what did we prove? So you have such a topological You have such a topological dynamical system with an amenable action. So I think many or most of you probably hopefully know what is an amenable group. And all of you hopefully know that D and R D are amenable groups. If you're in a setting to everything is fine. But I told you also you can take. But I told you also you can take the free group at the beginning. If you take the free group acting on its boundary, there's still some notion of amenable action that still is okay here. And I will say something to this amenability in a second, but just into play. And now what is the result? The result is the following. So you take a sequence of dynamical subsystems and now it comes relevant that I introduce And now it becomes relevant that I introduced to the space. And I want to have convergence. And based on these technical issues, I totally forget to tell you what is the topology of the air. But it's relatively simple. So just to remind you, JZ was a set of compact non-empty and inverted subsets. But I would like to remind you that itself was a compact space, a compact metric space. So, on the set of comp, so if we have compact subsets, well, what's the natural metric we choose to house of metric, right? So, it's built with the house of metric. Time, okay, we're not writing down again now. Time so if we have So, if we have convergence of these dynamical systems, if and only if, just if and only if, for all kernels, so all possible functions here, but now I put a little C on the bottom. C means compact support. I will say something for that next moment. You have that the spectrum, as I said, converges again in the house. Again, in the House of Distance. So, what does this theorem tell you? So, if you have whatever operators that you can model, as I explained to you before, like the stain pole or Fibonacci image or whatever, if you want that the spectrum converges, what you need to guarantee, and that's an if and only if, that the dynamic systems converge. If you want to have it for all types of possible kernels, it could by accident happen. It could by accident happen that the spectrum controverges by these are not converging. Simplest examples, take this example I showed you before, this Nier-Snab interaction, take the potential equal to zero, spectrum is always minus two to two. Whatever dynamic system you take, it stays minus two to two, so it converges. But then in some sense, you're looking at a dynamic system which doesn't see at all, that it potentially doesn't see at all dynamic systems. Okay. So you can This theorem is actually working out in way larger generality, but due to time, I don't want to go really into that now. All what I wanted to say, my original motive, or my real motivation is to study higher-dimensional models, in particular specific tilings that are interesting in the quasi-crystal setting. In particular, there's this octagonal tiling. This picture is took by Franz Gehler. Another tiling that I think most of you know is the Pedros tiling. Know is the Penrose tiling. And people are interested, and if you have these tilings, and now it depends how you want to model it, but you can see back edges as like your operator acting on these discrete edges as a graph Schooting operator. And one is interested in the spectral properties of the systems. And these are very, very hard, difficult properties to study. And I'm not claiming I can do that, but what I can say is. But what I can say is if you want to follow the strategy like it is followed in these previous two examples a lot, that you use periodic approximation, well the natural way is to find approximation. But this theorem here is something that allows you to do that quite generally. And the good thing is it's a characterization. If you want to do that or if you are able to do that at all, you will do something like that. So that's the Can I ask a question? What's the theorem? No, no, no, it's it's integrated. Yeah, no. So I wonder if that theorem can get positive, because I guess for most of the time. Thanks. Yeah, this is exactly what I want to do now. That's the next theorem. And that's a joint work with Alberto Tarcase, that I mentioned at the beginning from Gervine. So the next theorem That's from me and Alberto saying the following. Okay, so we have this dynamical system. Okay, we take such a kernel and now returning to your question from before, if I demanded it to be symmetric, I don't. What is for me sufficient is that the corresponding option Is that the corresponding operator is normal? In a certain sense, the corresponding operator A x star AX commutes with this endroid for all X. That's enough for what I've done. Okay, so we look at such kernels that produce a normal operator. One can specify that, I will skip that for now. Or you think of symmetric ones. Thing of symmetric ones and you look at the following map. So, as we have seen just a minute before, if you want to study the spectrum, well, a good map to look at is you take the map that takes your dynamical system and maps it to the spectrum of this dynamical system. And what I showed you before is actually this map is continuous, right? I told you, convergence. I told you, converges if and only if it's expected inverts. So this map was continuous, and now I'm making it quantitative. So if G has polynomial growth, both are polygony, and g acts glitches continuously. So that just means that. So that just means that for each given G, the map alpha G dot is Lipschitz continuous. Then I also have hurdle if you want to mine. And the certain norm of the coronal is finite. And this is the decay assumptions that we're asking before, that you want to have some certain decay, and this encodes some decay. Then you have the final result that if A is listed. If a Slipschitz on Z, so I only need the Lipschitz continuity of the current in the coordinate Z. And P, what can I compute from that? Sigma P is, sorry, I'm not sure how many buttons you put in online one half continuous. Further continuous and B, if A is locally constant on Z, then sigma A is Lipschitz continuous. Let me just say it again in words. Look, the concept means just like Locally, constant means just like if you take any point in a small neighborhood, just the function is constant. You think back of the example I gave you here, because the alphabet was finite, these are actually locally constant functions. And what I'm claiming is that this map here is either one half hour continuous or literally continuous, depending on the irregularity of the corresponding kernel. A just for A just for probably better, just to make sure what I'm claiming here is that I have such results like paused distance of the spectrum. And now I borrowed the notation you used before with the tilde for the constant is bounded from about the host of distance of the corresponding dynamic. Of the corresponding dynamic systems, and then sometimes you have to answer the square root, depending which set the regularity you design. Okay, so and now I wanted to actually review. So some of these results and these specific examples were known, right? And that was very, very useful. I suppose all of you know that. For instance, in the case of the almost matthew operator, Case of the almost Matthew operator, we knew that's based on the proof by Elliott or Joe L. 90s that the spectrum here is continuous in the Euclidean metric. On the other hand, here, you also have continuity, but you have to be careful, you have to exclude rational points. And actually, if you look at this picture, if you want, I can later explain you why you can already from the numeric see why these things cannot be continuous at the rational points. And this result. And this result for the specific case of the Kibonacci Homatoni goes back to Shutu and was later proven for this whole system by Belisorio-Homotista. So this is kind of the first theorem I represented to you. Actually, if you apply to these examples I gave you before with the dynamical systems, you can just literally just apply them to the AV kernel. This was literally just continuous or locally constant to get a shooting operator. If you apply it to Get a shooting operator. If you play it, you recover the same results. Not the spectrum. That's the... Okay, also, may I comment? It is not precisely truth that the spectrum is continuous. What is continuous is the union of the spectrum over thetas. So when you talk about only irrational alpha, then it doesn't make any difference because the spectrum is in. Any difference because the spectrum is independent of theta. However, that's right. You're right. That's why I took here in the case where C was 0, 1 was 1. This is the example you're talking about. I told you I take this dynamic system where I take alpha cross, oh sorry, I should switch to both rotation now, the whole sphere. So that means if I when I And that means if I, if you look at this here, I take the union and then the union is there. You're completely right. It isn't there. Okay. So another result due to one Moose Simon, at least with this exponent one half, is that you have these Holocaust continuums. Okay? Cannot see it here. There's another proof by Berlis on 9400. Okay? And now Okay, and now you can get similar results here, but like just applying this result. So, this was proven in the specific setting for A to the C D before by myself, Elisa and Cornian, Joria Cornian in 2019. And with Alberto, what we did is we actually were motivated quite a lot by this work. Actually, the proof, what I like on the proof, there are two phases. What I like on the proof, there are two things. One thing is, actually, I think, like you said before, you can put it in a credit course because it really just needs to generalize the eigenfunction. It's nothing fancy technique that I need. And the other thing is that actually this square root behavior you observe here comes actually from this amenability. And this amenability is hidden a bit here in this polynomial growth. So if you have a polynomial growth, you are. So, if you have the point of view curve, you are amenable. And one can generalize the theorem a bit more. And the thing is, really, like if you take your Filmer sequence and amenability, you have some decay how fast they go to zero. For the Filmer sequence, the boundary condition, the boundary, how fast it goes to zero. And that has to beat with the regularity of A. And that's the reason why you get this curve. And in the locally constant case, we're lucky enough to We're lucky enough to avoid it. Okay? May I also ask, or maybe make a comment? So, Billy, sorry, 94, do you refer to the paper where pushed the lypic with one of our size of the cow? Say again. There is I I I I sure I mean maybe I'm wrong, but Billy Sartre in 94 he didn't Belisard in 94, he even proved the Holder continuum. He actually proved Lipschitz. Yeah, okay, that's true. Yeah, yeah, right. So it's a it's it's a different yeah yeah yeah yeah right you're you're totally right he proves the Lipschitz continuity of the gaps that's that's totally right no he proved the Lipschitz continuity of the spectrum but with a constant which depends on the size of the gap yeah exactly exactly and so now my original plan was I wouldn't have all these technical issues I wanted to explain you These technical issues, I wanted to explain you. Actually, that was actually my main point of view. I didn't want to tell too much about this abstract nonsense. I wanted to tell you: okay, the are these results that work in general? And then my plan was to actually tell you how one can explicitly apply this to very specific models, right? So, because the issue is sometimes if you look at general results, how can you use them, right? I wanted to explain you how to explicitly apply them. So, I don't know how much time do I have? Maybe just keep going. Have. Maybe just keep going. Okay. So I can get some profits. Yeah, but I also don't want to extend too much. So let me try to quickly explain it along the example of data visibility. At least give you like main steps. And then I wanted to raise actually a question. So, okay, so how to use zero? Well, so we are given this finite alphabet. And remember, we had this omega z. So we had z d and we colored it with some letters. So think of some. Letters. So think of some atoms. And now to this, I can associate a so-called dictionary, which is doing the following. I take here cubes of side length n in zb. I take my omega, I shift it somewhere, I restrict to this q, and I do this all g. All V and Z E and all N. Okay? So I'm looking at the local patterns I see in my configuration. And now what one can show is, and let me just write it quickly about that. In fact, what one can show is that I'm focusing now only on orbits for simplicity. If you have the orbit closure, Simplicity. If you have the open closure of something converging to the open closure of something else, by plugging in the Hausoff metric and working a bit out, you can show that converges if and only if to all integers n. So this f is essentially defining me how large is my cube. I find some number nm such that if n is greater or equal than nm, the The dictionary omega n at HPGF coincides with the dictionary of omega for omega. So you have a sequence of configurations. And what I demand is that for a given size, all the patterns of a certain size eventually have to agree. Whenever you find a subsequence where you always have Whenever you find a subsequence where you always have a pattern which is illegal, the limit object, then you will not get convergence of these things, and henceforward you will not get the conversions of the spectrum in general. And that's kind of one of the problems for the panelist timing. If you try to approximate it, that this is too difficult to achieve. You look like having a question. May I ask, with this result, when you apply it to a smartphone, what is What is that you're getting? At the distance. You should continue it. No, you're getting only a half problem. So you can recreate but not to reproduce it. That's one of the kind of questions I want to go. Okay. But let me read this. Yeah, me too. And let me give you just your easy improvement of that result by Jetor. Of that result by Jetomerska, I don't know. Yeah, that was my purpose, right? Or one of the purposes uh that I wanted to talk about. So now I actually come to the table and chair. Due to time I will not really go into detail. So what we have are four letters. Red, grey, green, blue. Yes? Gray. Four letters. And we have a so-called substitution rule. That's something very common to use in the Fibonacci Amazon. Used in the Fubernaci Hamilton, there's a substitution one. What this does, you take a letter and you somehow inflate it in a certain sense, like you get a cube and you color the cube in a certain way. And now, how does this give me such a configuration? Well, what you do is start with an arbitrary point, apply your substitution once. Now, you can apply this rule again letterwise. So, to the cream point, I replace it by this box, quick point by this, and so on, right? And so on, right? And now you keep going, and you can imagine it grows further and further. And then, by investigating a bit, and this I will just skip now for time reasons, you can construct a specific dynamical system. This will be like the orbit of omega. This will be nice, it will be uniquely ergodic, minimal, and so on. And what I want to do is, I take, for instance, nearest neighbor on Z2, I have four colours. I have four colours, so I take four different values, and I want to know what I can say about a spectrum. The only thing we actually can say is: okay, we don't have discrete eigenvalues of finite multiplicity, some abstract nonsense, but besides that, we don't know much. There's another tiling that's the chair. It's a different substitution. I don't want to focus you now on specific things. They come actually from geometric substitutions. If you're interested in that, I can explain you more. But all what I want to say. But for what I want to say in the last five minutes, we have these specific local rules, a local rule, these substitutions, what we also have in the Fibonacci case. And now what I want to do is I would like to understand can we first of all find periodic approximations? Now we have this result here. We know if we can approximate these dynamic systems by periodic dynamic assistance, then whatever operator I choose, respect I choose, the spectrum conversion can control how fast. But the rate is a question. And now, one of the nice things is theorem, and that's, I mean, in this setting is my thesis, and for For more general systems, that's the current work with Lamband, that the Xbox shares the idea of TechBall that I mentioned at the beginning. In the specific case of substitution, what you can show is that if you take some condition on your substitution, we'll have to skip it for reasons, no, it's not difficult, and it's holding. And it holds both examples, it's so-called primitive. And if you take an arbitrary omega in a data set such that you look at the dictionary of omega and you just look at the cubes of size 1. These are just such squares, the four colors. And all of them are legal, namely they appear somewhere here. Namely, they appear somewhere here eventually. Then, how do you define a periodic approximation? Take the orbit from S and forming up, close it, you don't need to close it if it's periodic, but okay, and we can show it converges to the dynamic the system we get by the substitution rule that I didn't define now. Okay, so you have a finite condition you have to check, and then you get convergence. Applying this result. Applying this result for the spectrum, and no matter what kind of operator you choose. Okay, so now my plan was to show you: look at this pattern, and look at this pattern you find here in the table training already after three iterations. Take the periodic argument condition of that, you can check, it satisfies this condition, I will skip that now. And then you keep substituting and you get your periodic operation. So it's a condition you really can check. And not only that, even here. And not only that, even here, there's a way to make it to an if and only if in some sense, but again, never skip. That's the work with the last four people like Carl Ban, Felix Pauschetzen, and Leo Tenbaugh. And now what I did is I plotted, or that's actually plotted by Leo Tenbaugh. This is the numerics for this nearest neighbor interaction on Z2. I have four colors and I choose these values. Why I choose these values? Well, what I want, I want the difference between I want the difference between two distinct colors to be greater than the norm of the Free Laplacian, and I wanted to have them irrational independent just to avoid to have some relations between them. And what you see here is, like, if you take this specific starting point here, here on each horizontal line, you see the spectrum plotted for these fairly approximations. And now, once I gave a similar talk. Once I gave a similar talk on Irvine, Lana was asking question, wait, there's nothing plotted here. It looks like there's nothing. Indeed, if you zoom in, you should look here in the numbers, it's very much zoomed in, they are spectral bands, but they are just getting very, very fast, very, very narrow. Kind of nice. Now, the other thing is by working a bit more just with these dynamic assistant substitutions and using Substitutions and using this kind of estimate here, very explicitly, we get an estimate on how fast the spectrum converges. It converges like 2 to the minus n. The 2 comes from the size of the substitution. Can I ask, so what's the period on this picture? So on 0, it's this period. So I take this block and compare it. And then I just apply the substitution. So here, it's a 4 times 4. Here, it's a 4 times 4 block, 8 times 8 block, 16 times 16, 32 times 32, 64 times 64. That's, as it appeared, that's the size of the block. So you roughly have 64 elements. Actually, I think you have less, but anyway, I think you only have half of them. Because if you the difference between volus of the potential is given normal plush, and then the length of the band should collapse very quickly as the period goes to this point. Okay. Let me just do one last remark and then I'm happy to discuss it with you. So, what is the so what I wanted to say at the end here is: okay, so we have some estimates on how fast the spectrum converges, and one thing that is used to prove the convergence, for instance, of the Lebesgue measure. So, kind of the idea I wanted to say here: okay, it looks like the Lebesgue measure gets a To say here, okay, it looks like the Lebesgue measure gets very fast to zero just from the numerators. It's no clue, okay? But the question is: can we conclude anything about the Lebesgue measure from these periodic approximations? So the question is, do we get that the Lebesgue measure behaves continuously? And in the almost Matthew operator case, like Aron Van Lou Simon did that, for instance, to compute the Lebesgue measure. And just to finish with that, if you take two computers. If you take two compact Z's and you sorry, I have to take five. Then A has Q connected components. Okay, so think of the different bands I have for my periodic system, Q. Then the default measure of B, the S connected by lambda of A. By lambda of A plus 2 times Q times the Hausdorff distance of these two sets. Okay? So this is a purely measure of theoretical argument. That's what Leo Tenbaum extracted from some papers, actually of Chow, not from the paper from Lyton Mask and Svetlana. And now if you look at that, if your Hausdorff distance estimate is Your Hausdorff distance estimate is good enough. If you do not have too many connected components, this term vanishes in the limit. So if you replace this by an, take a periodic approximation, so the hope is somehow that if you can beat that, like if you can beat the number of connected components in terms of the estimate of the Hausdorff distance, then you may be lucky that the Lebesgue measure converge. If you can do that, you maybe can conclude from these periodic appropriate estimations something about the Lebesgue measure. Approximate estimation, something about the back measure of the limit object. So that's kind of the idea. So the issue is to tell you the truth, like in general, Q is like the size of the period. So, and this here goes like one over the size of the period, so it not goes to zero, so it's not good enough. That was some point of comment you made before. And that was kind of the thing I actually wanted to discuss a bit in detail and try to open with this some discussion. This is some discussion. But I'm not going to restart because I'm over time. And thank you for your attention. And I apologize for this mess, but this was certainly not technical problems. But you have a question? So what what can you make any accounts or the structure? Maybe I missed this about the spectrum of the influence volume operator from this? So far, not. So that's actually an open question. So that's what I want to raise. So, what I can say is I can. So kind of the methodology I'm following is I look what people did in one dimension and try to see what is actually followed by a more general principle. All these questions about cost of conversion were very difficult at the beginning. In the Ibernational Human Tourism, for instance, Kastakli started to. Castagli started to prove something called pseudo-spectrum, but he couldn't relate it to the spectrum of the Fibonacci amatone, and that was Jutu, or one of the parts that should he proved in the limit you get the spectrum. So having conversions is something already very useful. The next thing is having quantitative estimates, because I saw, like, in Mo case, for instance, and that's also the philosophy that, for instance, this paper by Chao from 2020, the philosophy he says is if the house of the conversions is fast enough, Convergence is fast enough, then you get actually convergence of the lip-back motion. And currently, we are in the trouble that it is not fast enough what we have. On the other hand, you have some symmetries, so actually you can definitely say you have less than the number of period bands. Also, in higher dimensions, you usually have more overlaps. And at least numerically, it looks like they also. Like there's maybe a chance if they go to Super, but I don't know. There's a there's a lag and that's what I would be happy to talk about. Any estimates on Landorf Army? Currently not. Okay. Quick remark. When I said Jetomerstauer, I meant the recent paper by Jetomers Kokosovsky, where they proved upper bound. They prove upper bottle housing the result of the spectrum. And in particular, one of the things that they need there is actually a continuity statement. And then for the particular case of the critical homo slight operator, they improve this high-holder continuity greatly. So that's what I wanted to say. So you cannot, so the question is one of the posts, for example, cannot. For one of the person, for example, can you recreate their results? I don't know. Yeah. Be very interesting. I mean, I certainly don't believe it's possible in this general world. I mean, this is like really everything. But maybe for specific examples under a suitable additional assumption. I mean, what I can say another way, in the quasi-crystal setting, how you get actually a back measure convergence is kind of slightly different. Convergence is kind of slightly different. If you don't do this, I'm even not sure if it was really used ever. But what you get is like by using the substitution rule, you get some monotonicity. So the spectrum, if you take the union of two constitutive bonds in these Fibonacci homotonia, then actually it's a decreasing set. So you're automatically getting back national convergence. Then it's a different approach. Which one works? I don't know. So what is it that sort of enters in this? Because you get also this half-filter continuity. Here's the Simon argument or this argument here is just based on defining some approximate eigenfunction. So it's similar actually to the spirit. It's similar to the spirit of Avon von Moos Steigen. The work I had with John Horier and Horier and Horier Konia that I mentioned before, this one here, there we use some Here, there we use some resolvents, but it's a slightly different, but we couldn't treat the general case just as product codes. And this one half-folder continuity again, it comes into the play when you... I found it conceptually nice that you have this interplay between the Foner sequence of the group and the regularity of the function, and that creates you this one class. You do not think that this is optimal? I think actually this is optimal in this generality, but as you said. No, no. So in this generality, you think this is optimal? I believe it's optimal, yeah. And also the constants are not really much worse than the one in one sign. It's just like a computational thing. They explicitly compute the rate and we est estimate we lose a bit, but it's it's not very much even in the constants. Even in the concepts. Are there any examples of operators where one can always be able to do that? So, um, okay, so now I'm not the best expert in the almost method operator case, but as far as understood from Bernard Helper is that if you look at the Hofshutter butterfly here in the wings, they close like a square root. But then you approximate a rational number. Rational number. The rational ones you're not really interested. You are interested, but not the point of view I have currently, because I'm interested to use periodic ones to approximately rational or non-periodic systems. So that's actually where you have this periodic. That's why I said I don't believe that this is, I don't really think this is the optimal thing. Because like you get this one half like a one-hundredth signature. Are there any questions? Okay, then that's uh, the first time we're going to be able to make a cup of the colour.
