Okay, thank you for solving this technology trouble at the beginning. And I will try to keep my talk short to catch up the time. But still, I want to thank the organizers to putting together this great workshop. I really enjoyed it. Great views, great talks, great discussions. So thank you for inviting me. I actually have changed my talk content a little bit. So I Little bit. So, I want to talk about some distance measure we have developed that can be used to assess cell-cell relationship. But we did a study under the motivation of studying gene networks using single-cell data. So, therefore, I want to introduce that work under that context and also mentioning us and introducing some ongoing work in my group about the gene passive studies using Zoom. Studies using zoom cell data. Okay, so myself, I have been working on gene pathway or gene co-expression network using bug RNC data for a long time. So therefore, when the single-cell data became available, a very natural question to me is that how can we really just borrow a lot of techniques we have developed for the back RNC data, for the single-cell data. So whether we are able to get So whether we are able to get also some very efficient methods or tools to study a gene path space in single cell data. But there are a lot of fundamental difference between the single cell data and the bark RNC data. Like for example, for the BART RNAC data, usually we do not really worry about the condition of the defined by the samples. But I think for the single-cell data, when we have a bunch of cells, so we ask ourselves whether there are some populations of cells. There are sub-populations of cells, and the answer we know is yes. And how many sub-populations of cells there are? And whether it's meaningful to just use a sub-population to study gene network, because potentially the gene network may change in terms of membership and also the expression behavior across different sub-populations. So, therefore, the first question for us is that how can we really identify the conditions? Can really identify the conditions for us to be based on to study the gene networks. And of course, after we have some kind of rough idea regarding that, or we have the site of cells to work on, we also want to know that how we can effectively get the positive ideas. So we want to identify all potential groups of genes that are co-expressed in the cells of our consideration, how we can do it. Of course, the answer of this is only possible. Answer of this is impossible, right? So, when we are talking from all the time in the groups, but at least we know that there are a lot of known pathways available in the literature already. So, for those known pathways, so can we evaluate how many of them are really active in the cells they are considering? And we also know that for those active pathways, even though they are active, but the actual memberships may differ just because of the actual conditions of the cells we are using there. Of the cells we are using there. So, how we can also make some kind of suggestions regarding that. And also, like in the bark RNC analysis, we have a lot of co-expression measures we can use to evaluate the gene-gene relationship. But in the single-cell data, so such kind of co-expression measures, are they still applicable here? So, the answer usually is no, just because you know there are. No, just because there are very complicated relationships between cells. So, in the back RNC data, usually the coexistence is assuming that for the gene expression vector, so the actual elements in the vector, so they are relatively independent from each other. Even though they are not really independent, the dependence level shouldn't be that any series. But for the single-cell data, we know that some cells can be replicated, sometimes maybe they are about Sometimes maybe they are particularly different, but still what is really the dependence of the relations between the cells is not that clear. So that gives us trouble in trying to study GNG relationships. Okay, so these are all of the questions we have when we are trying to study the gene networks using single-cell data. And of course, we do not have answers to all of these questions yet. So I want to talk about some of the genetics. I want to talk about some of our attempts to try to answer some of the questions to some extent. For the first is about the cell-cell relationship study. So we developed some distance measures that can help us assess relationships between cells and that can provide some more robust way to do some kind of cell elasticity. So the early, the first effort, you know, that was like more than six or seven years ago, at that time, so that measure was working well when we have a collection of hundreds of cells. So it's not really that scalable. But now, you know, very naturally we have thousands of cells and sometimes even millions of cells. And that method, you know, is not that kind of computationally feasible for us to assess homogeneous. For us to assess a cell-cell relationship anymore. So, recently, we tried to scale up that measure. And the key ideas here, so I'm not talking about the details of the method, I just want to provide these kind of key ideas to provide some kind of thoughts we are having in terms of this analysis. So, basically, we are trying to evaluate the relationship between any two cells by incorporating information from all cells. Information from all cells. So, how we can do that? So, a simple example is like if we have 10 cells in total, and for each cell, we will compare it with each of the rest nine cells individually, and then we get some initial list of differential depressed genes for each kind of comparison. So, basically, for each cell now, it will be characterized by nine lists of differential expressed genes coming from the comparation between. Coming from the comparation between that cell and all the other individual cells. So that's kind of the idea. So, but you can see that immediately if we have thousands or millions of cells, so we cannot really do that, right? We cannot really just go each cell we compare to all the other individual cells. So in this effort here, so try to scale that up. So we are trying to get a much smaller set of cells that is to some great extent representative to the Representative to the original population of the cells. And then for itself, we just need to compare it with the reference cell. And based on that comparison, we can re-evaluate the relationships between any two cells. So by doing this, we are hoping to retain some kind of global structure between the relationships of the cells or even some smaller cell clusters. Clusters. So let me present a simple example here to illustrate how the results are. So we apply the method to this tabular numerous data set. And for this data set, we can annotate the cell types by using existing tools. And we are organizing the relationship. You know, the relationships between the cells at kind of two levels. So, one level is kind of the level people have been working on. So, like, you know, put them into some kind of groups for some cell types, that's naturally, you know, they are kind of belonging to the same group. So, we have that group. And also, we have another level, so kind of hierarchy for the relationship between the cell clusters. You know, we put the immune level in the immune level. Level cell clusters together and hoping that's forming another group. So basically, from this very small toy illustration here, you can imagine that this is a cell cluster. So it's a small cluster already. So that's derived by some other method. And for this cell cluster, we want to evaluate its relationship with all the other clusters we have identified. And for the black ones, And for the black ones, you can imagine that just by the annotation, we know that they are kind of close to each other already by some kind of phenotype annotation. And the blue ones are the outside ones. So we are defining the maximum kind of boundary here, the maximum Bayesian group distance. And if this is the maximum Bayesian group distance for this blue one, so in the ideal case, it shouldn't be there, right? Ideal case, it shouldn't be there, right? If it's not in that cluster. So we consider this as the maximum variation of this kind of local relationship. And this curve here is defining the minimum between group distance. And for this minimum between group distance, and then for this black one, it's a variation. Because it's kind of outside of this. So basically, we are trying to count how many existing clusters you would derive here already. Clusters you will derive here already are falling into this band. That gives us this kind of validation of percentage. So, in 2018, for these numbers, when they are smaller, the performance is better in terms of retaining the global structure. And we are comparing our measure to a bunch of other popular measures, and it's true that we are doing a better job in integrating these computers. So, this is about that, and I'm not talking. and I'm not talking the details of the distance itself, but I hope that the ideas of the thoughts have been clear to you. And then we go to the question about how to find pathways. And we had an effort a few years ago that was built on bark analysis data. So it's a semi-supervised method, but it's kind of making use of a lot of modern. A lot of modern statical analysis put together. So, like, as I will introduce just in a few minutes, you know, that seems to be very powerful by doing a thorough searching job of all the possible candidated genes related to a path. But when we are trying to consider how to apply that method to single-cell data, so we have difficulties. difficulties. And we have ongoing efforts by using a very deep neural network to mimic the performance of gene fishing, but without some kind of constraints. This gene fishing method is holding on the same. So now let me talk about the gene fishing a little bit and then I will go to our deep neural network study. So first I just want to talk about also the motivation of that study. You know, also the motivation of that study. So, our collaborator is an expert on this cholesterol or synthetic pathway, all the cholesterol genes. So, she told us that she is interested in this pathway, and she is interested in identifying any new possible genes that belong to this pathway. So, even though this pathway is very well studied already, but she believes that there are still a lot of kind of new knowledge needs to be discovered. And this LCR team. And this LCR gene tracking data set provided by her. And she mentioned this Go biological process term to us. And for this Go term, it's having more than 6Gs. But when we check how many of them are really expressing in this particular data set, it's only about 80. So that's kind of co-expression metrics we plotted based on this expression data set, you know, almost 80 genes. And it's confirmed that for the Confirmed that for this particular path-based identity scheme, it's really actively expressing. And the co-expression pattern is also very strong in that particular data set. So, and then we want to identify more things that are potentially to be in this pathway. And so, this figure is the A figure here is that was treating that how we are able to identify those 21 pathways. Identify those 21 passivities based on the 80 gold-term genes. And those 80 genes are highly expressed in the data set provided by our collaborator. But we are asking that we need to consider all the possibilities, right? So which means that if we put these 21 genes into a much bigger gene set, what's the results will be? So we are just repeating this spectral analysis. Spectral analysis here to all this data set. The difference is that we are always putting those 21 genes into the gene set of the study, but we are also incorporating different number of random genes. So this is like 100 random genes, this is 500 random genes, this is 2,000 random genes. So it seems that the signals are still there, but when you are increasing the increase, so the power for you. Increase. So the power for you to identify the signal becomes smaller and smaller. So that's not news to us, right? So we all know. But how we can make use of this to develop a procedure that becomes very efficient to do the work. So we divided all of the genes into the sub-random groups and add baked genes into it. So the baked genes are these kind of known pathway genes. So to increase the signal to monitor signals. To increase the signal to increase. And then we do the special clustering. And based on the special clustering results, you can see sometimes random genes will be included in this kind of the cluster, you know already. And those genes will be considered as fished out. And we are counting, by repeating this many, many times, we are counting how many times each gene will be captured. And that's our capture function rate. And we are able to rank all of the genes based on that. All of the genes based on that. And this is the histogram of the capture of frequency genes. And you can see that the separation is really nice. So I have only two minutes. So let me talk quickly regarding how we can really try to extend this work into the single cell framework. Because in the single cell, so in the gene fishing here, the first is required basically. But we do not want that to be a restriction for us. And we want to have the measure to be a. We want to have the method to be applicable while there is no base available. And also, as I mentioned, that I don't really trust the correlation matrix derived from the single cell data. So I don't want the methods relying on that. So we tried this DQ network, and the results on the single-cell data is still going on, but at least we can see that it's able to mimic the results of gene efficient on the back energy data. So if we have the Data. So, like, if we have the G-text in the liver tissue in the data here, so the input here in the gene fission is 21 displays plus 3 genes. But here, we are using all of these 600 genes in this same voter as input. So that's kind of our training data. And by the output, we are expecting the similar. And we are able to get the results that is really consistent with the Is really consistent with the gene fission result. So, at least in this kind of preliminary study analysis, we see that this deep neural network is able to mimic the gene fishing. And because the deep learning method naturally is involving a lot of resounding, kind of a random results aggregation, and we feel that that is the way to boost the true signals. True signals are. And that is make it very, very variable, even though the original training data is very variable. You can consider that for the original training data, the positive genes is more than 600, but the actual number of positive genes we are looking for is only like 20 or 30. So it's very noisy training data, but we are able to get good genes. Okay, so I will stop here and I'm happy to have any discussions regarding this topic with me. Thank you. Thank you. Interesting work. Does it require the good quality of the non-passive genes? In your case, it's like lucky these genes are probably positive gene plans. The gene phishing requires that, but the new method, based on the deep neural network, doesn't. Thank you. So, our next speaker will be Sheila. Hi, Luke.
