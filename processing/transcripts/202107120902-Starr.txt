Is Jason Starr from Stonybook? He'll be speaking on From Geometry to Arithmetic to Geometry. Well, thank you very much, Brian, and to all of the organizers, Brian, Sho, David, and Tim for inviting me to speak. I'm going to talk about work that I've been doing mostly joint with Geutian. Some of it is written up and the archive articles. And the archive articles are listed there on that page. But a lot of it isn't yet written up. So I'll tell you what we've done, but this is an ongoing project. But what I want to do in this lecture is tell you a little bit about what I've done, but mostly introduce you to a circle of ideas, a really beautiful circle of ideas that's coming out of arithmetic and ideas of the mineral model program that are revitalizing some of the questions. Vitalizing some of the questions about rational curves, rational points on varieties with new ideas. And so I want to talk about some ways of proving some of those results using geometry. These are results that were first proved often using analytic number theory, the circle method in particular. But I want to talk about some ideas using geometry to prove some of those results. Geometry to prove some of those results, usually with worse inequalities than the original results. So, that's the theme here: that one can often prove some of these results as well, geometrically, worse inequalities, but qualitatively the same type of inequalities. Okay, so let me get started. I hope that everybody can see my slides. Let me start with something very old: a conjecture of James Axe that is still quite old. James X, that is still quite open, but solved in characteristic zero. The conjecture has to do with finding rational points of Fano hypersurfaces. So again, everything in this talk will, the theme will be that we look at varieties where the degrees of the defining equations are fairly small. A more intrinsic way of thinking about that is that, at least when these things are smooth, the first Chern class of the tangent bundle was positive as opposed to negative. Is positive as opposed to negative. So they're not hyperbolic, they're more parabolic. Of course, what's interesting is that often these techniques work when the varieties are singular, at least if the singular locus isn't too large. We have some kind of bound on the dimension of the singular locus. One result that's conjectured is that no matter what kinds of singularities you have, there should be, if the complete intersection, the intersection. Complete intersection, the intersection of ample hypersurfaces and projective space, if that complete intersection should be FANO, meaning the sum of the degrees is less than or equal to n, then there should be variety defined over our ground field, no matter what the field is, such that when we base change to the algebraic closure of the ground field, that base change is still irreducible. So there should be a geometrically irreducible k variety. In particular, notice if we have a k. In particular, notice if we have a k-point, then the closure of that singleton and that singleton set is closed, and that gives us a geometrically irreducible k-variety. So, this should be, you know, like the first thing you test when you're trying to find a k-point is whether you have a geometrically irreducible k-variety sitting inside of that complete intersection. And again, James Axis conjectured that for Fano complete intersections, these things always exist. That conjecture is open, but let me tell you. That conjecture is open, but let me tell you a little bit about what's known. So, in characteristic zero, it's true. And Kohlar's proof uses the minnow model program. In particular, he uses resolution of singularities in characteristic zero, and he uses a lot of vanishing theorems starting from the Codira vanishing theorem. So these techniques, they do not apply in characteristic P. Some of the results, we don't know if the corresponding result is true in characteristic P, like resolution, but some of the results. Like resolution, but some of the results we know are false. Kodara vanishing fails in positive characteristics. So, if you want a result in positive characteristics, which is where I'm headed, then you need to think about this in a different way. As long as I'm talking about this, let me mention there was follow-up work after Kohlar's theorem by Amit Hogadi and Chin Yang She, who proved the corresponding result for all specializations of rationally connected varieties. Of rationally connected varieties. So that's a way of thinking about this conjecture of X. These varieties that Axe is talking about, they need not be smooth. They don't even need to have codimension C, where C is the number of defining equations. But of course, we can always think of this variety as a specialization of a smooth complete intersection. We can just take the defining equations of these hypersurfaces, look at their coefficients, and then deform the coefficients. And if you take it, Then deform the coefficients. And if you take a general deformation, say over a dvr, then the generic fiber will be a smooth, complete intersection. So, one way of thinking about this question is if I take a possibly singular specialization of a smooth funnel manifold, then does that have some geometrically irreducible k-variety? And Kohlar proved yes. But again, the way he does this is he says: first do a resolution of singularities to make the central fiber. To make the central fiber normal crossings. And then he's going to actually point you to an irreducible component of the central fiber using the mineral model program. And that section of that irreducible component is geometrically irreducible. That's what's usually called a colar component now. But when you look at more general specializations of rationally connected varieties, those are varieties where given any two geometric points, you can find P1 connecting them. Then this. Then this, you still get an irreducible sub-variety defined over k, which is geometrically irreducible, but there's no reason it should be an irreducible component of an arbitrary normal crossings blow-up modification. So you don't get a Kolar component when you look at these kinds of weakening of the Fano condition. It's not really, I just wanted to mention that. So again, the proof uses. That. So again, the proof uses many results that are only true in characteristic zero, like Kodira-Danishin. But nonetheless, in characteristic B, in fact, earlier than Kohlar's theorem, there were results. So first of all, the result does hold, axis conjecture does hold, if you assume that the ground field K contains the algebraic closure of the prime field, Fp. So it is true. Fp. So it is true in that case. It's also true if you don't assume that. I mean, do not assume that it contains the algebraic closure of the ground field, but instead assume a stronger condition on the degree, the degrees. Assume that the sum of the squares of the degrees is less than or equal to n. So in both of those cases, Michael Fried and Moisha Yardin, excuse me, Denabremovich once got very upset at me for mispronouncing his name. They proved this result. They proved this result. They proved this result, this conjecture of x. If you assume either that the ground field k contains the algebraic closure of the prime field or the sum of the squares of the degrees are less than or equal to n. And the proof uses the Chevatarov density theorem. It uses the Chevatarov density theorem through Hilbert's irreducibility theorem. But every proof I've seen of these results, of the proofs I've seen, use. The proofs I've seen use some analytic number theory to prove this result. So you can prove this using just geometry. So that's what I want to talk about next. I need to specify what kinds of specializations I'm allowing. So I'm going to work over a discrete valuation ring, but I want to assume something about the discrete valuation ring. I want to assume that the discrete valuation ring is a regular extension. Is a regular extension of a DDR that has a finite residue field. So that means that there's some other DDR that has a finite residue field, like the bit vectors of some finite field, and such that our DVR is unramified. So there's some, if I take a uniformizing element for the smaller DVR, that's still a uniformizing element for the bigger DVR. And also I want that the extension of fraction field is separable. So if it's a mixed character, So, if it's a mixed characteristic DVR, that's automatic. Also, if it's an equi-characteristic DVR, you can always find these prime regular DVRs. So, this is really some condition and mixed characteristic. It really has to do with the unramifiedness of the DVR extension. I need to make one other slight clarification: characteristic zero rationally. In characteristic zero, rationally connected means that any two geometric points are connected by a P1. But in positive characteristic, that's not enough. You need to assume some additional positivity, namely that you can find a morphism from P1 to X such that the pullback of the tangent bundle is an ample locally free sheet on P1. Every vector bundle on P1 is a direct sum of line bundles. So saying it's ample just means the degree of each of those line bundles is positive. line bundles is positive so it's it's a simple condition to check whether the pullback of a vector bundle is ample um and now well if you assume that you're in characteristic p and your ground field contains the algebraic closure of fp then every specialization over a prime regular ddr um of a separably rationally connected variety it does have um uh I'm sorry, if you base change to your field K, then that does have an irreducible, a geometrically irreducible K sub variety. So, this conjecture of X holds, well, certainly, you know, for complete intersections, this condition about being over a prime regular DDR, that's no problem at all. You can just use the bit vectors of your field K, capital K, and get your prime regular DVR and then deform. Regular DVR and then to form the coefficients in the way I was mentioning. But if you're talking about some more general, separably, rationally connected varieties, the issue is we don't know that the moduli spaces, we don't even know the moduli spaces of fanal manifolds are unobstructed, are smooth. We don't know we can lift, you know, in an unobstructed way. So you do need some kind of hypothesis. That's what this prime regular hypothesis is about. But it's again, it's a kind of a technical thing. But then, under that hypothesis, your specialization, which could be very singular, very reducible, it contains some sub-variety defined over that field, which is geometrically irreducible. So you do have the same result as in Fried and Yardin. And the proof uses these theorems by Tom Graeber, Joe Harris, and myself, and then in characteristic P by De Jong and myself, together with a fairly simple Together with a fairly simple Bertini connectedness theorem. So it's not anything about Bertini over finite fields. It's just usual old Bertini connectedness theorem. Well, that wasn't the only result that Fried and Jardin proved. They also proved a result where the sum of the squares of the degrees is less than or equal to n. And we also have an extension of that. So there's a notion of rationally simply connected. So this, so Fano means that the first true So, Fano means that the first Chern class is positive. That's the first graded piece of the Chern character of the Tanch bundle of X. You can look at the second graded piece of the Chern character, and you can ask whether that is positive as well. That roughly corresponds to rationally simply connected, that the parameter spaces of rational curves are themselves rationally connected. And if you have one of these specializations over a prime regular DDR where the geometric generic fiber is rationally Fiber is rationally simply connected, then you get the same conclusion without the hypothesis that your field contains the algebraic closure of the prime subfield. And this, the proof uses, oh, I'm sorry, it got cut off at the bottom. It uses work by De Yong and Shu Hahe and myself on rationally simply connected vibrations. It uses work of Eline Enoll about rational points of varieties to find a About rational points of varieties defined over finite fields in terms of conibo of the etal cohomology. Originally, she used rigid cohomology, but you can formulate it just as well with the tall cohomology. And that's certainly those kinds of Cony-Bow results are implied by geometric hypotheses and characteristics that are like rational connectedness. And then it also uses some joint work of Qing Yang, Shi, and myself. So, again, the So again, the case where the field contains the algebraic closure of Fp, it's used rationally connective vibrations. When the sum of the squares of the degrees is less than or equal to n, use rationally simply connective vibrations. But these geometric theorems, they do imply these two results of Freed and Yardin. And they apply to other, I mean, more general, separably rationally connected varieties, specializations of. Varieties, specializations of rationally simply connected varieties as well. So you could ask these questions in Grassmannians or other projected homogeneous spaces and don't see how the technique of reading yardin applies, but we do have proofs of their results. Of course, the full conjecture is still open. We don't know if you take some field that doesn't contain the algebraic closure of the prime field and is a specialization of a funnel manifold, whether that always contains it geometrically or you. Always contains a geometrically irreducible subvariety, so that's still an open problem. But these two results are Frieden-Jugged. We do have geometric proofs now. Okay, well, having said that, that's kind of old news. I want to move on to something more recent, and that's irreducibility and also topology of spaces of rational curves in Bono manifolds. There are various, the most obvious parameters. Most obvious parameter space of rational curves in a variety, the HOM scheme from P1 to that variety, that is not compact. And there are various ways to make a compact parameter space. The oldest one, which was certainly investigated by Drinfeld, but it's probably investigated by other people even earlier. But that's what is usually called the parameter space of quasi-maps. When people say, Of quasi-maps. When people say that, they usually mean parametrized quasi-maps. So we think of P1 with its standard coordinates on it. We don't mod out by the automorphism group of P1. But the Hom scheme, you can specify a morphism from P1 to a target projective space just by specifying an M plus one tuple of homogeneous polynomials on P1, all of the same degree, E. And so then you up to scaling, up to common scaling. So you can take. Scaling up to common scaling, so you can take the projective space of that vector space of n plus one tuples, and that's what's called the quasi-map space, the parametrized quasi-map space. Of course, if you want these things to not necessarily be parametrized, you can just form the GIT quotient by the automorphism group of P1. Since this quasi-map space is a projective space, there's no question what we mean by the GIT quotient. There aren't many different choices of polarization on that projective space. On that projective space. So there's one unparametrized quasi-map space. Again, that's probably in some sense the older of the two parameter spaces. But a very important parameter space is the one that was introduced by Konsevich. That's the space of stable maps. It's a stack and it parametrizes degree E maps from a genus zero connected at worst nodal curve such that the Such that the canonical bundle of that curve is F ample. It's ample relative to that map. So all of the components that get contracted by F, the canonical bundle restricted to that component has positive degree. And that really means that it contains at least three special points. Well, I'm not allowing marked points here, so that means nodes of the curve. And there's a relationship between these two different compact. Between these two different compact moduli spaces, there's a everywhere regular morphism from the Kantsevich space to this quasi-map space. Like that was first written down independently by three different groups of authors. One of them was Iset Joshkun, Joe Harris, and myself, when we analyzed the ample and effective cones of the Kantsevi spaces. Independently, Adam Parker, who was studying various ways of constructing the Kantsevi space via GIT, found this contraction. Found this contraction. And then also Anka and Andrei Mustatsa, who were studying the Chow groups of the Kant space, found this contraction. So it was kind of lots of different groups finding it at the same time. But that's very useful. So that's the point I want to emphasize. The way we're going to reprove some of the theorems coming from analytic number theory is by playing these two different parameter spaces off of one another. So the Kant space has a So, the Kant space has a beautiful inductive structure to its boundary, which is useful for doing Gromoff-Witten invariants where you get recursive formulas, but it's also extremely important for the proofs that we have having to do with the topology of these spaces. The quasi-map space, it's worse. It's much more singular, but it is simpler. I mean, it's related to just this projective space. So it's more likely things will be positive. It's more likely things will be positive, ample on that parameter space. Okay, well, what if your target isn't projective space, but something more general, like the zero locus of some collection of homogeneous polynomials H1 through HC? Well, then you just look at the sub-variety of your parameter space, whether that be the parametrized quasi-map space, the unparametrized quasi-map space, or the consavier space, where you pull back these sections H1 through HC to your genus zero curve and then demand that there. genus zero curve and then demand that they're identically zero. And so that gives you a closed sub locus inside of your parameter space in Pn. And that's one way to define these parameter spaces of rational curves in a general target X. Okay, so having said what the objects are, now I can tell you what the question is. And the first question is whether these parameter spaces are irreducible. Whether these parameter spaces are irreducible when we fix a curve class. Often that just means fixing a degree. And the first result that I know of is due independently to Kuznetsoft and to Kim and Ponderapanda. They show that if you take a projective homogeneous variety X, then the spaces of these rational curves are integral. And the Deline-Mumford stacks, excuse me, the Comfort stacks, excuse me, the space of stable maps are smooth. The space of quasi-maps are typically not smooth, but the space of stable maps are smooth. And they all have the expected dimension, which is, well, again, it depends on which of these parameter spaces you're working with. But for the space of stable maps, that's just the first Chern class of X paired against the curve class you're talking about, plus the dimension of X minus. plus the dimension of x minus three. The minus three is roughly the dimension of the automorphism group of P1. So the expected dimension is a numerical invariant that you can work out very easily. It doesn't have to do with the particular map. Well, what about a more general target, something that's not projective homogeneous, say hypersurfaces in PN? And the first result. And the first result here was proved by Joe Harris and Mike Roth and myself. If you take a sufficiently general hypersurface where the degree is less than roughly one half of n, then the spaces of stable maps of arbitrary specified positive degree are integral, they're local complete intersection, and they have the expected dimension. Of course, that implies that the spaces of unparametrized quadrature. Unparametrized quasi-maps are also integral of the expected dimension, and then that implies the spaces of parametrized quasi-maps are integral of the expected dimension. So, this result for stable maps, it implies the other results, the results for the other parameter spaces. Without saying too much about the proof, it uses the inductive structure I mentioned on the constituent space, but it also uses Maury's bend and break theorem. So the theorem that Maury used to prove Hartzorn's. Used to prove Hartzorn's conjecture that the only smooth projective variety with ample tangent bundle is projective space. I mean, of a fixed dimension in is projective space Pn. So the Binenbregg theorem he used to prove that has been enormously important in the mineral model program. And we use a version of that to prove this theorem. The theorem was subsequently improved. There's a paper of Roya Beheshti and Mohan Kumar. Beheshti and Mohan Kumar that proves the result when d is roughly two-thirds of n. And then there was further work by the Heshti that improved this even more. The ultimate result, the optimal result, the best one could ever prove with this conclusion that these spaces of stable maps are irreducible, local, complete intersection, reduced, and have the expected dimension. Was this result was proved by Eric Riedel and David Yang. They proved the result when the degree is less than or equal to n. Degree is less than or equal to n minus two. So the um the Fano index is at least three. Um, and again, they prove that if you take a sufficiently general x, then these parameter spaces are irreducible, reduced, won't go complete intersection and have the expected dimension. And again, when d is n minus one, this is false. I mean, every every variety, the parameter space is reducible. These parameter spaces are reducible. So this is the optimal result one could. So, this is the optimal result one could prove. Sorry, Jason, perhaps you said this already, but are these theorems about XD hypersurfaces or general hypersurfaces? Hypersurfaces. Yes, this is a hypersurface, yes. Yeah, I'll come back to what we know for some other kinds of varieties soon. But let me point out one corollary of this. Oh, again, it gets cut off. I don't know. Sorry. I don't know, sorry, is that the genus here of Gromoff-Witten invariants are enumerative? So, I mean, I don't know how many of you here are old enough to remember when Gromoff-Witten theory hit algebraic geometry, but people were super excited because, you know, there were all of these questions that Hilbert had raised in his centennial lectures about whether the numbers that had been predicted by Schubert, written down in some notebook, but never justified, were actually correct. What was Schubert doing? What was Schubert doing? And there were other numbers that had lots of other people who had studied these numbers: Schaal, Seyton, Segre. So then physicists told us, yes, here are the numbers. Also, here are a bunch of other numbers that you guys didn't know before. And algebraic geometers were super excited, you know, that the physicists were telling us how many rational curves were in some variety, satisfying some incidence conditions. Some incidence conditions and then perplexed when some of those numbers turned out to be negative fractions. So these Gromoff-Win invariants, they are fractions in general. They can be negative, and there are examples where they are negative fractions. And so the question is, what are they actually counting? You know, and there's a perfectly precise answer to that. I'm not pretending we don't know what these things are. We do. And it's not always the things that were studied by the classical algebraic geometers. So that Um, that raises a question: when are these gromoff-winding variants the things that were studied by Schubert and Zoiten and Schall? And you know, Hilbert asked this question. And in these cases where you prove that these moduli spaces, these stable map spaces, are irreducible, reduced, local, completely intersection, and have the expected dimension, they are. The Gromoff and invariants are enumerated. So that's one consequence of these kinds of. Of these kinds of results is that you know that the Gromoff-Win invariants, which you know, physicists tell us what those numbers are, they are enumerative. In particular, they're non-negative integers. So, I mean, a priori, these Gromoff-Win invariants might be negative, they might be fractions, but not in these cases. They're actually counting what we expected them to count. So, they're non-negative integers. So, that's one consequence of thinking about these things. Certainly not the only reason for thinking about them. Let me tell you about some newer irreducibility. Tell you about some newer irreducibility theorems. So, this starts with some theorems of Tim Browning and Poncaj Vichet, who I think are both here. And then there were improvements by Tim Browning and Will Sowin. So here you need to assume either the characteristic is zero or the characteristic is bigger than D. And that's an interesting hypothesis. The characteristic is bigger than D. For the geometric arguments, we'll also have to assume that. But I think it's not clear whether it's for the Whether it's for the same reason. I mean, well, let me tell you the result. The result is that if you take an arbitrary smooth hypersurface, not necessarily sufficiently general, just any smooth hypersurface of degree D and Pn, under the hypothesis that N is bigger than roughly 2 to the D, then these Hom spaces are irreducible and reduced. They're local, complete, intersection, and they have the dimension equal to the expected dimension. So that's. So that's, you know, I mean, the original techniques only apply when the moduli of the hypersurface is sufficiently general. And that's not a fault of the technique. That's necessary. So those techniques are proving these irreducibility results for the space of stable maps. But for instance, if you take a Fermat, the space of stable maps often are reducible, you know, even in these degree ranges. So you're not. So you're not going to prove that these spaces of stable maps are irreducible for an arbitrary smooth hypersurface. It's not true. But the space, the Hong spaces, what Browning and Biche and Sawin are proving is that they are irreusable of the expected dimension if n is bigger than 2 to the d. So let me, as long as I'm talking about their work, let me tell you about some other important work. Di Miano Testa proved irreducibility for Del Pezzo surfaces. So that's Bono. For Dal Petzer surfaces. So that's Bano of dimension two. And then using the geometric Manning conjecture, this is very exciting and recent work, Lehman and Tanamoto were able to prove a lot of irreducibility results for Fano threefolds. And then using a new version of bin and break, Beheshke and Lehman and Eric Riedel and Tenamoto proved more irreducibility results. Irreducibility results. Shimizu and Tenamoto have some results as well. So, I mean, there's been a new movement in this direction coming from ideas in the minnow model program, in particular, the geometric Manning conjecture and this movable bend and break. Let me tell you a little bit about what it is that Browning and Vichet and Sawen do. They follow a strategy that was proposed by Jordan Ellenberg and Akshay Venkatesh. This strategy was actually also used by a student of Johan Diang Thiboke. Used by a student of Johan Diang, Thibault Hugin, in his thesis. And it's the idea is you look at these Hom spaces and you reduce them modulo P. So now you're thinking about these Hom spaces over some finite field, and then you count points. And using point counts, you can compute the dimensions. You can compute Betty numbers. So then the question is, how do you count the points? And you do that using the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. So I apologize, that's a cartoon version of what. Apologize, that's a cartoon version of what they do. There's a lot of hard work that goes into this, but that's the from a distance view of how their theorem works. It uses analytic number theory, very seriously, uses the Hardy-Littlewood circle method. So Jiu-Tian and I can prove similar results in a geometric way. The inequality is worse. The inequality is worse. So let me tell you what we can prove. Take an arbitrary smooth hypersurface x and pn. We need to assume that n is bigger than roughly the Catalan number of P. And then we know that the parametrized and unparametrized quasi-map spaces are irreducible. Oh, let me say it this way. Yes. So I'm looking at X, D, and Pn, and we've defined the quasi-map. Pn, and we've defined the quasi-map space of X to be a locus in the quasi-map space of Pn. And what comes out of this is that that quasi-map space is itself irreducible, reduced, and it's a complete intersection of ample hypersurfaces in the quasi-map space for PN. That is a pretentious way of saying a projective space. The quasi-map space for PN is a projective space. It's the projective space of the vector space of ordered implications. Space of ordered n plus one tuples of homogeneous polynomials of pre E on P1. So there's functoriality for these quasi-map spaces. That's why I write it this way. But that's just a projective space. So the quasi-map space for X is just a complete intersection in a projective space. Okay, let me say something about what this inequality says. You can look at the asymptotics for the Catalan number, and the above inequality is roughly n is bigger than four. Is roughly n is bigger than 4 to the D, whereas the Browning-Bichet-Sauhn inequality was roughly n is bigger than 2 to the D. So it is a worse inequality, but it's qualitatively, I mean, they're both exponential. And there's definitely room for improvement in this inequality. As I'll explain, the inequality uses an older result by myself that has recently been improved by Patel and Riedel and Dennis Singh. So it's possible this inequality, you know, n is bigger than four to the d can be improved. Let me also mention: somebody asked earlier, this is for hypersurfaces. Yes, what I'm talking about is for hypersurfaces. But a student of mine, Prith Raj Chowdhury, he extended this technique of Jiyu and myself to complete intersections. So there definitely is a result here for complete intersections. Again, it's something like n is bigger than four to the sum of the degrees, the inequality. Inequality. Oh, absolutely. I do need to assume the characteristic P is bigger than D. So I'll say something about why I need to assume that. Oh, yeah, it's this, this. It's this thing right here. So one of the key ingredients in this proof is a fairly simple result. You look at some hypersurface in projective space, you intersect it with M-planes in that projective space, linear M-planes, where you Space linear in planes where you allow those in planes to vary over the points of the Grassmannian. And you ask whether the induced map from the Grassmannian to the moduli space of hypersurfaces inside of an in-plane is dominant. And you work out the inequality that's necessary. I just compare the dimensions of those two things. And it's roughly n is bigger than this Catalan number. I think it's actually Catalan number divided by M. Number divided by m so this is off by a linear factor of m, the dimension of that linear m plane. But you're getting, you know, up to this constant, this linear constant, the sharp result. And the proof is quite simple. I mean, and it, what it does use is that the parameter space of lines on this thing, this smooth hyper surface, it can be very singular. But if the characteristic is bigger than the degree d, then it has at least one irreducible component. Then it has at least one irreducible component that is generically reduced of the expected dimension, that's generically smooth of the expected dimension, and similarly for two planes, and similarly for three planes up to m planes. So that's where that hypothesis that the characteristic is bigger than d, that's where that's getting used here is this generic smoothness of one component of the parameter space of these m planes that's contained in x. Of course, the other Of course, the other technique that's extremely important here is this theorem of Riedel Yang that I mentioned earlier, which is the optimal result. And now I can just tell you the proof. It's a very simple proof. Set that integer m equal to d plus 2. So when I take these linear in plane sections, a general one by Riedel and Yang will be a general funnel where their theorem applies. So we know that that linear section, it's quasi-map space. Quasi-map space does have the right dimension because that's what Riedel and Yang prove. Even the stable map space has the right dimension. But wait a minute, inside of the quasi-map space for Pn, that's the intersection of the quasi-map space for Pm and the quasi-map space for X. So these things intersect in a variety of the expected dimension, and that means that the quasi-map space for X, all of its components also have the expected dimension. I mean, always those. I mean, always those components have dimension at least as large as the expected dimension. But if any of them was strictly larger, then that component, when you intersect it with this quasi-map space for PM, we would get an intersection that's too large. And it is too large for Riedel Yang. So, I mean, Riedel and Yang say, no, you don't see components of that dimension. So that's the argument. You know, it's again. It's again basically a two-sentence argument once you have Riedel and Yang. So that's the idea of the proof. It's a geometric proof. Let me move on. You know, I'm kind of running low on time. You could ask about more, not just what are the irreducible components and what are their dimensions. But once you know that, I mean, we know they're generically reduced as well. That follows from Rito-Yang. What's the dimension of the single locus? To locus, you know, in a different question, in a different direction. What are the Betty numbers? And there are conjectures about what you should see. So, the original question, do the Graham Segal followed his theorem about the parameter spaces of rational curves in Pn? And it was a question, but his question was given a positive answer for many, many choices of target variety. And eventually, And eventually, Cohen and Jones and Siegel formulated a conjecture that had some very good motivation, which I'll mention in a moment. And it says the following. Let X be a Fano manifold. Consider the Hom spaces where you send a specified point on P1, say 0, to a specified point on X, say X0. Then those Hom spaces have a semi-group operation, essentially, where you can glue together. Operation essentially, where you can glue together and then deform. And you can take the stable limit of those for that semi-group operation. Then you could take the group completion. But the question is, well, what if I vary that base point x0 in x? You know, I make this construction. It depends on this base point x0 in x. Is that a quasi-fibration? And if it is, then what they predict is that the stable limit is actually just the double loop space. It's essentially the space of. double loop space. It's essentially the space of continuous maps from CP1, the two-sphere, to X, sending a specified base point zero in CP1 to the specified base point in X. Again, this hypothesis that this is a quasi-vibration, I think this is automatic. I mean, they raise it as a, yes. What is a quasi-vibration? Well, the vibration is a quasi-vibration. So, I mean, this thing is a, you know, a homotopy limit. You know, a homotopy limit. So I, you know, but when you form this homotopy limit, it's formed under this operation of gluing things on. But if I take two different points, x0 and x1 of x, I can find a chain of lines connecting x0 to x1. So I see the parameter spaces for x0 kind of filtering into the parameter space for x1 and vice versa. So again, I mean, So again, I mean, I believe this hypothesis that they wrote down, it's automatic. I'm not sure they understood when they wrote this conjecture that these Fonomanifolds are always rationally connected. The ones they were looking at, I mean, they proved their conjecture in many cases. So let me just move on. Instead of wondering what should be the correct hypothesis for this conjecture, we can just say, when can we prove that these parameter spaces converge in homotopy to the space of continuous maps? The space of continuous maps. And again, there were many cases of this proved even before Cohen, Jones, and Siegel proved their formulated their conjecture. Siegel proved it when X was Pn, but there were many other cases proved. But Cohen and Jones and Siegel, they reproved many of those known theorems when X is any projective homogeneous space. So their conjecture was formulated following analysis of Fleur. Analysis of FLUR theory that's holomorphic Morse theory. They give a very good reason for believing this. Of course, it depends on some map being Morse, and the map is not Morse. They know it's not Morse. But if it fails to be Morse in a controlled way, then their analysis still works. And they use that to prove the result when X is a projective homogeneous space. Again, it was proved in many other cases when X is quasi-homogeneous. There's an action of a linear algebraic group such that there's Free group such that there's an open subset of X, which is an orbit under that action. Anyway, there's something that you can ask given this conjecture. Well, the double loop space, you know, that's the, it's homotopy type is just the twice shifted homotopy type of X, assuming X is path connected and simply connected, which bono manifolds are. And that satisfies the Left School-Tuperplane theorem. So if I have some. Left School-Tiberplane theorem. So if I have some ambient, oh, I'm sorry, it's the same letter P. If I have some ambient Y that satisfies this Cohen-Jones-Siegel conjecture, and I take some Fano complete intersection X in Y, well, then the double loop space for X equals, I mean, its low degree homotopy groups equal the low degree homotopy groups of the double loop space for Y by the Lefschetz-Hyperplane theorem. And now this Cohen-Jones-Siegel conjecture is saying that's also what you should be seeing for the spaces of holomorphic mass. Be seen for the space of holomorphic maps. So, this raises the question: do we have a left-shift hyperplane theorem for the space of holomorphic maps? So, again, even if you don't know, like if we don't know the Cohen-Jones-Siegel conjecture, we could still ask that, do we have a Lepsid-Tiger plane theorem for the space of maps? And well, I said that these quasi-map spaces are often ample, complete intersections in the quasi-map space for Pn. Space for Pn. So since Siegel proved the Cohen-Jones-Siegel conjecture for Pn, surely then we get the result for X. And that's essentially correct. But the thing that's very bad is that when you look at the Hom scheme sitting inside the quasi-map space, its complement, it's all in the singular locus. So this quasi-map space is highly singular along that closed complement. So the purity theorems that we're used to that would allow us. That would allow us to just say, oh, these things have the same low-degree homotopy groups. They don't apply. And you need to use a better version of the purity theorems. These were conjectured by Grothendieck and SGA2. They were originally proved by Ham and Lay, and then this was sharpened in their work on stratified Morse theory by Beresti McPherson. But they essentially show that yes, you do have these purity theorems in degree less than C minus one. Or C minus one, if the singular locus has codimension bigger than or equal to C. So now the question becomes: what can you say about the singular locus? And Browning and Sawin, again, have the best result using analytic number theory. If n is bigger than, again, roughly 2 to the d, then the singular locus has codimension and it's this expression. I'm not going to try to read it off, but notice that's for the HOM space. So for the quasi-map space, this is definitely. So, for the quasi-map space, this is definitely not true. I just said that this entire complement is in the single locus. You can work out the dimension of that complement as roughly n minus d. So you're not going to prove that the single locus has co-dimension bigger than n minus d, because it's not true. I mean, not in the quasi-map space. But if you fix some integer c less than n minus d, then for sufficiently general x of that. Sufficiently general x of that degree, the singular locus has codimension bigger than or equal to c. If n satisfies an inequality that's roughly d plus square root of d. You know, I mean, you can see for yourself what the inequality says, but that dependence on d is d plus square root of d. So it's a little bit worse than n is bigger than or equal to d. But it's a purely geometric proof. It uses deformation of the normal cone of the space of multiple covers. Space of multiple covers of lines, and then maybe this is on the next slide. No, it's not. And it also uses the inductive structure of the constituted space. But you get this result for these compactified spaces. And then using that, you can prove. Oh, I'm already over time. I'm sorry. So then using that, you can prove these results about the low degree homotopy groups. Since I'm over time, let me just say this really fast. I think this starting point for many of these results. Starting point for many of these results using the analytic, using the Hardy-Littlewood circle method was Chris Skinner's proof of weak approximation for hypersurfaces of 3d when n is bigger than roughly 2 to the d um GUTian and I do have results about weak approximation, but they require like n is bigger than 2 to the 2 to the d or something like that. Two to the D, or something like that. It's a really qualitatively worse inequality, but they're purely geometric. It uses unirationality, but a new version of unirationality, where you ask that the fibers of the unirational parametrization are themselves Fano or two Fano or something like that, so that you can lift jets up to that rational variety. And then you just apply weak approximation for rational varieties. Sorry, I'm over time. Sorry, I'm over time. Let me stop there. Thank you very much. And maybe we can all thank Jason. Shall I stop the share? Maybe you can keep it on in case there's any questions. So, do we have any questions for the speaker? Yes, I have a question.
