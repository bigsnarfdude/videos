Visual distance, but before I start my talk, I should turn off my camera in order to write on the screen. Sorry for that. Sorry. Today I will talk about simplicial distance. These are the contents. First of all, I will start with homotopic distance, then I will tell why homotopic distance is important. Distance important. Later, I will talk about some basic properties of homotopic distance and I will introduce a simplicial analog of homotopic distance, which is called simplicial distance. Later, I will talk about the relation between simplicial distance and the simplicial complexity. And I will introduce some properties of simplicial distance. And at the very end, I will talk about another simplicial approach. Another simplish approach. This is called continued distance. So, I want to start with the definition of homotropic distance. This is defined by Macias Virgos and Mosqueiro Louis. We start with two functions, two continuous functions, f and g, and the homotopic distance between f and g is the least integer k if there is an open. There is an open covering of X by Ui's such that the restriction of F and G on UI is homotopic for each I. And why is homotopic distance important? Before I start about talking, before I start I start or before I mention the importance of homotropic distance, I want to recall some basic definitions. One of them is the topological complexity. This is defined by Michael Farber. So we start with a path vibration, pi, from the path space of x to x cross x, and a path in x, gamma, is mapped. Is mapped into its initial and the final point. And the topological complexity of the space X is the least integer K if we can find an open coing of X cross X by Ui's such that we can find a section of pi on each UI. And I also want to introduce the definition of the Sternig-Schnellman category. Of Lusternich-Schnellman category. Lusternich-Schnellmann category is a least integer k if there is an open covering of X by open subsets Ui's such that each inclusion iota is non-homotopic. And homotopic distance is a generalization of topological complexity and category. And category. So we can immediately observe that if we take the identity map and the constant map from x to x, then the distance between these two maps is the Luster Nicholma category of the space. And moreover, if we take the inclusion, the inclusions ij's as defined in here, then In here, then the distance between these two inclusions will give us the category of x. And if we consider the projections to the j factor, then the distance between these projections will give us the topological complexity. And moreover, there is a relation between homotopic distance and the sectional. Distance and the sectional category. So let me recall the definition of the sectional category. Let's say, let's consider the definition of topological complexity and let's replace the path vibration in that definition. In that definition, with any vibration, and this will give us the sectional category of a fibrillation. Well, there is a relation between homotopic distance and sectional category. So, if we are given two maps f and g from x to y, and if we are given We are given the path vibration from the path space of y to y cross y. And if we consider the pullback of pet vibration by Q and moreover, if we consider this commutative diagram, then the distance between F and G Distance between F and G will give us the sectional category of the pullback. And moreover, also we can talk about the category of a map. Well, let me recall the definition of this concept as well. If we are given a map, let's say f from x to y, then To y, then cat f is the least is the least integer k if there exist open subsets u0 to u k covering the domain of the function such that the restriction of The restriction of F on Ui is non-homotopic for each I. So up to now, we mentioned that there is a relation between homotopic distance, topological complexity, Lusternic shinema category of a space and of a map. Category of a space and of a map and the section category. So in their paper, Marcias, Virgo, and Mosquere-Louis showed that some known theorems of TC and CAT can be easily proved by using homotopic distance. For instance, I mentioned six of them. The category of X is less than the topological complex of X. Than the topological complex of x, and the topological complex is less than the category of x cross x. And category and t's are homotopy invariants. And the product rule, the product or the theorem of the product spaces. And if we consider a map from x to y, then the category of f is less than the category of. Less than the category of domain and codomain. Actually, these theorems have one line long proofs and even some of them follow as a corollary immediately if we use homotopic distance. And the main bricks in these proofs are the three propositions. Are the three propositions, and these propositions tell us how homotropic distance behaves under the compositions. And I want to give an example of an alternative proof. So I want to consider the following proposition. It is as follows. Let's suppose we are given two maps, F and G, from X to Y, and we are given. To y, and we are given another map H from Z to X, then if we compose F and G from right hand side by H, then this homotopic distance is less than the homotopic distance between F and G. Now we can prove category of X is less than topological. Topological context of X. Let's start with the category of X. We know that it is the homotopic distance between the identity and the constant map. And let me go back a few slides. If we consider this projection and these inclusions, then it is Then it is easy to see that the identity can be written by using these compositions, and the constant map can be written by using this composition. And we can use this proposition to see that this homotopic distance is less than the homotopic distance between the projections. And we also know that. And we also know that this is equal to the topological complexity of the space. And I also want to mention the higher analog of homotopic distance. This is first defined by Marcias Virgo and Mosque-De Louis, and this is studied detailed by my collaborator, Tanya Marguel. Tanya Margele and me. Well, there are relations between higher homotropic distance, Lustering-Schunema category, of a space and of a map, and higher topological complexity. Well, the definition of a higher homotopic distance is as follows. We start with an We start with n continuous maps from x to y, and n homotopic distance is the least integer k if there is an open covering of x by u i's such that these maps are all homotopic for each eye. And one open problem that I like to mention: well, there is no formula for topological complexity, nor higher topological complexity. That is, if we want to compute the topological complexity of a space, then we cannot use some formulas, but instead we can Instead, we can approach topological complexity of space by using lower and upper bounds. And it is not yet studied the lower bounds of anthropological complexity by using weight of cohomology classes. So defining higher homotopy weights may give some new lower bounds for anthopological complexity. By the way, homotopy. Day. By the way, homotopy weight is the homotopy distance analog of these weight of cohomology classes. And it is defined as follows. We start with a cohomology class U. U has homotopy weight with respect to F and G, and this is K. If If k is the least integer such that given any continuous map from a to x with this property, then we say that the cohomology class of u should vanish under the map induced by h. Now, I want to introduce some basic properties of homotopic distance. Well, there are more properties, more theorems than these five theorems, but I will mention these theorems later on my talk. So I want to focus on them. The first one is the obvious one. The distance between f and g is the same as the distance between g and f. The second one is the same as the g g g g g g The second one is F and G are homotopic if and only if the distance is zero. And the third one is we have two homotopic maps F and G and another two homotopic maps F dash and G dash. Then we say that the distance of the distance between F and G is the same as the distance between F dash and G dash. And the fourth one. And the fourth one is: we are given two maps, f and g, and we have a finite open covering of x, then we have the following inequality. This is also called the sub-additivity property. And the last property, the homotopic distance is homotopy invariant in the following sense. Now, I want to talk about the simplicial distance. This is a simplicial analog of homotopic distance. But before I start defining or constructing simplicial distance, I want to give two definitions. One is is the definition of being contiguous and the second one is the definition of being C contiguous. The first one is as follows. We start with two simplicial maps phi and p psi from k to l and we say that they are contiguous if a simplex in k, let's say sigma, if we have a simplex in k then the In K, then such a product will constitute a simplex in L. And the definition of being C contiguous is as follows. Again, we have two simplicial maps, and we say that they are C contiguous if there exists a sequence of maps, Hi's, such that H0 is phi and Hc is psi and Psi and this pair is contiguous for each i. And this is this is how it is denoted. Now, I can start constructing simplicial distance, but before the definition, I want But before the definition, I want to mention that we will define simplicial distance in three steps. In the first step, I will define the B C simplicial distance. Then, by using this, I will define the B simplicial distance and at the very end I will I will define the simplicial distance. So the first one, we start with two simplicial maps, pi and psi, and we have non-zero integers. We say that PC simplicial distance is the least integer k if there are sub complexes ji. Sub complexes Ji's covering the bit percenteric subdivision of K such that these two maps are C contiguous. And if we cannot find such a covering, we simply say that this is equal to infinite. And let's give the definition of this one. Well, we can have. Well, we can have a homotopic sequence as follows. And it is obvious because we know that if let's say if any map is C contiguous, then they are also C plus 1 contiguous, but being C contiguous does not guarantee that. Guarantee that they are also C minus one contiguous. And the fact behind this proposition is this. And by using this idea, we can immediately see that there is a monitoring sequence. And we define the V simplicial distance as a stabilized value of this sequence. And let's okay, we did the second one. Now, the third step. We will define the simplicial distance. Now we can find a homotopic distance, this one. In this one, as B are increasing, the value of B. The value of V simplicial distance getting smaller, and we call the stabilized value of these seconds simplicial distance of phi and psi. By the way, it's not these seconds, it's not quite easy to observe and it requires some work. Now, I want to talk about Now, I want to talk about the relation between simplicial distance and the simplicial complexity. Well, the thing is, sorry. Well, the thing is, let's recall that if we have homotopic distance. Distance, we know that there is a relation between topological complexity and homotopic distance. So now we have the simplicial version of homotopic distance and we are asking, is there a relation between the simplicial version of the distance and the simplicial version of the topological complexity? And the answer is yes, there is a relation. So, first of all, we need to define the simplicial complexity. This is introduced by Jesus Gonzalez. And again, we need three steps in order to define simplicial complexity. In the first step, as we did before, we will introduce the BEC simplicial complexity. In the second step, Complexity. In the second step, we will introduce B simplicial complexity. And in the third step, we will introduce simplicial complexity. And in the first step, BC simplicial complexity is the least integer k if there are subcomplexes ji's covering the bit percentric subdivision of k cross k such that these two maps Such that these two maps are sequentigious. And similarly, we can define the second and the third step. In other words, we can find homotopic seconds as follows, and we can name the stabilized value of these seconds by B simplicial complexity. And again, we can have a monotonic sequence as follows, and we can name the stabilized value of this sequence as simplicial complexity. By the way, I want to mention something else. So, I want to mention. So, I want to mention why simplicial complexity and moreover simplicial distance is defined in this way. Simplicial distance, let me take BC simplicial distance. It is motivated from BC simplicial complexity and BC. And BC simplicity complexity is motivated from a theorem by Gonzalez. And this theorem is what weighted from, which is what weighted from another term or a similar term. Similar theorem by Michael Farber and the theorem is as follows We start with a pet vibration and on a On a subset U, we say that we can find a section, there exists a section of phi and equivalently we can say the following if and only if These two maps are homotopic. So, the main idea or main motivation behind simplicity should complex. Behind simplicial complexity is this. And let me recall that if we are in the topological spaces, we are considering homotopy or being homotopic. And if we are in the simplicial world, then it corresponds to being in the same continuity class, or in other words, we can find In other words, we can find a number C such that these two maps are C contiguous. And the theorem which tells the relation between simplicial complexity and simplicial distance is as follows. If we are considering PRJs to be projections, then the simplicial distance The simplicial distance between these projections is the simplicial complexity of the complex. Now let me introduce more properties of the simplicial distance. One of them is as follows. We start with two, let's say K and L be finite complexes and let's take the projections on K and L. Projections on K and the projections on L. Then we say that K and if K and L have the same or have homotopy equivalent geometric realizations, then the simplicial distance between the projections on K and the simplicial distance between the projections on L are the same. And the topological And the topological complexity of the geometric realization of a complex is the same as the simplicial distance between the projections. And the third one is the geometric realization of a complex is contractible if and only if the simplestial distance between the projections is zero. And more properties. Well, let me recall, let me remind you the theorems, the basic theorems that I introduced at the beginning of my talk. Well, if we go back, yes. Yes, these are the basic properties of homotopic distance, and we have five properties. Now I will mention them and okay, here what I did, I have some results. Well, this is an obvious one. I was able to prove one side of the Of one side of the second property, I haven't done this part and I managed to prove the third one. And I haven't proved the fourth one yet, and I could only prove the half of it half of Half of being homotopy equivalent. I mean, the simplicial version of homotopy equivalent. Sorry, invariant. This is what I have done so far. And I also want to introduce another simplicial approach. This is called contributor distance. Is called contributor distance. This is first defined by Macias Virgo and Masquero Louis in their archive paper as a feature study. So the definition is as follows. We start with two simplicial maps, phi and p psi, from k to l, and we say that the conjugate distance is the least integer k if there exists If there exists subcomplexes Ji's covering K, such that the restriction of phi and Pψ on Ji's have the same contiguity class are in the same continuity class for each I. Or in other words, they are C contiguous for some C. And the following theorem is also mentioned in their paper. Mentioned in their paper. The topological complexity of a complex is the same as the contributed distance between the projections. By the way, this is not a space. So the definition of topological complexity of a complex is different from the definition of Michael Farber's. definition of a topological of the topological complex of a space k is a complex let me write it so this is this new definition and new complexity of a complex is called the discrete topological complexity and this is defined by Fernandez Defined by Fernandez Tarnero, Macias Virgo, Minos, and Will Shess. And well, it is also a simplicial approach to topological complexity, but even though we are working on the complexities of simplicity complex. simplicial complex um the simplicial complex t and of a complex and the scriptopological complexity of a complex are totally different they are um they are defined in it from different viewpoints Different viewpoints. And one open question is: give the relation between simplicial complexity and discrete topological complexity. And we have a more general open problem: what is the relation between simplicial distance and conjugate distance? And if we Together distance, and if we could, if we are able to find a relation between these two, then automatically we will end up with a relation between these two. And I want to turn back to contributor distance. My collaborators, Mehmed Jipuk, Tanya Vaile, and me, we are working on contributor distance. Recently, and I want to mention some results we have. One of them is we noticed that the simplicial distance is a generalization of simplicial category. Well, this is very briefly a simplicial version, a simplicial analog of Lusanik Schnellman category. And secondly, if you recall these five theorems that I mentioned at the beginning of my talk, we noticed that the conjugate distance satisfies these five properties, these five theorems. And nowadays we are working on simplicial version of homotopy. Version of homotopy weight. And thank you very much for listening. Thank you. Thank you. Any questions for the speaker? Well, I can't see anything from Zoom. I can see you. I'm trying to find out. Can other participants see everybody else? I think we will be able to see each other as soon as Asia starts sharing the screen. Okay. It's okay now. Did people that raised their hands have questions? I have a little question. Question from Michael. Go. Okay. I mean, very kind of simple question, but I don't know how you can answer this. I mean, is there a version of this? You said usual TC you can express as difference between this distance between maps between projections. Right? What about this parametrized TC? Is there a way of expressing it at certain distance? Can you please ask again? Okay. So you said, I mean, you showed us that, sorry, I just put, you showed us that the usual TC can be understood as distance between first and second projection. And so now I'm asking, is there a way of understanding the sporometristic at certain distance? A certain distance. There is also, I mean, if I look at this, I think Jesus asked me a question when I, after my talk, I mean, this space, if I look at the space E cross E over B, so this consists of pairs which points which line the same fiber. So this space has two projections onto the left and onto the right. So if you will make a kind of fiber-wise version of your distance. Fiberwise version of your distance, then it will be exactly this parametrized TC. Okay. What do you think on this one? Well, the thing is, I don't know much about the parametrized topological complexities, so I don't think that I will answer it very quickly, but But it seems an interesting question. Was there someone else who raised their hand? I guess silence means no. Are there any other questions? David, you want to go ahead and say that out loud, please? Okay, can you hear me? Yes. Okay. Is there a relation between the simplicial distance and the homotopic distance of the realizations, of course? Simplicial distance and homotopic distance. Oh yes. Yes, something well, only this one. I mean, sorry, okay, you are asking, okay, simplicial distance and probably my guess is if you have that, maybe you have the relation for the distance as well in general. For the distance as well, in general, maybe something like this. Yeah, I think so. When you write in the left portion, you are allowing yourself to subdivide. To subdivide, say again, please. My question, related question, is in the simplicial distance, the thing that you had on the left, you are allowing yourself to take subdivisions, right? So the two things are the same. Right. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Any further questions? I have a question. I raise my hand. Yes. Hi. So I have a question more related to the definition where it goes towards the Towards the stable sequence. Could you show me the slides again? Yes, right there. Right. So could I get a little bit intuition? And also, since we're in the simplicial world, is there sort of idea how long this sequence might go on when it actually stabilizes? Ashes stabilizes, or maybe to rephrase my question, is there an intuition of whether there's a bound over when does this sequence stabilize, or what I have in mind is whether there's any sort of practical algorithms to actually compute this. For simplicial distance, Show distance, I don't have an asverage, but I think in simplicity complexity, Hesus would know better than me. I think he gave an example on simplicial complexity. Simplicial complexity. But I can't remember the details. Yes. I can give some comments if you want. Please. Well, about the bounding, you have to keep in mind that all these numbers are non-negative. mind that all these numbers are non-negative. So a way of they have to stabilize because they are a non-increasing sequence of non-negative numbers. So somehow this stabilizes and at most in as many steps as the first number. But for practical applications, it's not a very good idea to start subdividing because the complexity of the problem starts. Complexity of the problem starts increasing like craziness. So, the best thing to do is actually avoid any kind of subdivision. Since this is the thing that you had in mind, Asia, namely that, for instance, in a very concrete case, in the case of the circle, very simple case, you can compute actually the topology, the simplicial complexity of a circle or the boundary of a triangle without actually. Without actually, do you get the optimal answer without actually subdividing? And actually, there is a program. With some collaborators, we describe this algorithm and make this implementation that I think in half an hour essentially computes by probabilistic methods, random methods. This motion planning to be optimal without actually being, you don't really need to take subdivisions. So, the answer is: in the case of the circle, the sequence stabilizes right from the beginning. Okay, thank you very much. Thank you both. Any more questions? Okay, I have a brief comment before we thank the speaker again. Please use the chat instead of the hand-raising feature. There are like 100 participants and it's very difficult to see who raised their hand. All right, we now have a half hour's worth of coffee break. There are two breakout rooms.
