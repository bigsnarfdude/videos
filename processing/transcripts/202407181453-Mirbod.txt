Thank you, Collin, for the short action. And also, we'd like to thank the organizing committee for this invitation and giving me the opportunity to present our work. I want to start with introducing my students that I acknowledge their work. Of course, without them, we couldn't publish and get those grants and specific. Those grants specifically today, I want to talk about a new topic that we are working on. It's the elastic flow stability, and it's actually a new NSF grant we just received, and we want to work on that more. I'm going to talk about that a little. The work that I want to talk today is by Elmira, one of my students, and she did a really good job. Okay, so because I wasn't here on Sunday, On Sunday, something happened to my family, and I had to change with me all the plan. Let me talk a little bit about what we are doing in my lab. I thought that would be good. I have time, so that would be good also. So, as you know, flow and transport over and within post maybe are an ubiquitous problem and have a lot of application in nature and industrial engineering. Nature and industrial engineering researchers investigated natural stream over canopies, even flow of granular beds, flow of superhydrophobic, over superhydrophobic and hydrophobic surfaces that you are all aware of, even peristerial, the long airways. And also, during my PhD, we were working on the red blood cell motion. The red blood cell motion, Shelley White online. I don't know if you know, and they published that actually working JFM to use a specific lubrication TA for forest media and understand how red blood cell moves over forest material and we come up with a specific and certain speed for the red blood cell that helps a lot to the motion of red blood cell and will be always. Be always airborne over the mute. Maybe a little bit more. As you know, our capillaries and vest cells, mostly capillaries, are filled with a so-called fiber in the table of the coccalis. And what is interesting here, there could be always a gap between the red blood cells and that indeutenary. That in the tailor black that was our interest specifically, and we found that a speed of 20 microns per more than 20 microns per second, red blood cells are actually always will be airborne on top of the tailbone types. But this little one is actually the white blood cell that is crushing always, is a rigid one and always crushing the endotelli of black hocalys. Of Belarus Calik. On the other hand, when I was doing my postdoc at Bellich Institute with Jeff, Morris, I figured out there are a lot of velocity and concentration profiles that are considered suspension flows, particle ladies, and even shear-induced migration of particles in different geometry. What we did, and I actually started was the combination of these two. So we actually So, we actually are doing suspension flows, particle laden flows, both Stoxian using Stoxian dynamics and also in different regimes, laminar, all to transition and work on the regime. We use PIV, TCV, and also MRI. As you know, because we have particles, index matching will be a big. Index matching will be a big issue. So we use PIVPTV with for like very dilute suspensions, but for 10%, 40%, we moved on and using MRI. Actually, there is a work that we just published in JVO, and we found that when you add any structure to the system, shearing the use migration of the particle will change because the particle will interact with those structures. With those structures, and there will be a kind of layering to the system, and you can actually see some of those layerings in this black line due to the particles. We are also collaborating with Marco Rossi and also Duca Grant and doing some of those 3D simulations. We actually moved on to suspensions of droplets in different. In different anomalical structures like Taylor, Couette, Flows, and Ray Benard. Here are some of those research talks. So away from that, now I want to move on to the topic that I want to talk to you today. Why instability is important. I want to start with this statement by Landa and Lifshitz, 1959, that not every solution of equation Not every solution of the equation of motion, even it is exact, exactly occur in nature. The flows that occur in nature must not only obey the equation of fluid dynamics, but also be the same. So we are all now that the flow and the critical Reynolds number, understanding the fluid mechanics point of view of instability sorted from a post-war Reynolds. Started from Osborne Reynolds back in 1883. And then, after that, there were a lot of works onto that. I actually found an interesting video that they wanted to also share with you. This is the retesting of Reynolds experiment. This guy is apparently using a pipe, it should be a very long pipe, and then there is a laminar flow, then they change the flow rate and they want to see what's going to happen to them in. Happened to the instability to the flow. But it should be important to note that the onset of turbulence in the flow of Newtonian fluid is actually now well known. And we all know that this is a non-linear process, meaning that actually with the actual transition that is being posited by the 3D effect of Navier-Stokes equation, and which is And which is the so-called exact coherent state. What is also important to note is that experimentally, we know that Avila Group actually found that the political Reynolds number for pipe occurs at 2000, while experimentally again it was found that for channel it's around 1100. But in 2001, Schmidt using And Schmidt, using linear stability analysis, they found that this is 5772, which is pretty high. And it implies that linear stability analysis is good, but still cannot be like DNS and experiment to characterize supercriticality and sub-criticality of the flow, and as well as exact value for the critical output. Well, so how about this to elastic? Which is now the topic. Why we know that drug reduction is fully for voluntary regime has been considered by different groups. Of course, Rao is here and they have done a lot of analysis on the drug reduction in different scenarios. But to our knowledge, the instability is not well analyst. We figured that. We figured out that it was started by Serge Pomeran and Berry's in the journal Non-Newtonian Fluid Mechanics back in 1995 that they started to actually understand if you have impermeable or a smooth wall, then what's going to happen? And I'm sure that Miguel has talked to you about all of those instabilities for smooth or impermeable surfaces, but then bar. But then Barak recently, and also Chaduri, a Danish Sovromanian, and Shampar in different PRM and JSM paper, they actually analyzed using a parallel complex Maxwell model. And also always be that flow will be unstable, which is different from Newtonian fluid. One important situation and observation. Important situation and observation that actually they found was that the flow will be more destabilized when you have polymers into the system, meaning that the critical remote sound will be much less. And then what other important result they found was that the instability occurs from the central. I'm going to talk about that more the next time. So here is the question. So here is the question. What if we have false media in the channel? And how will be the flow and instability if we actually are changing the flow or the structure kind of way applying force in the system? I wanted to quickly go through some of those applications and I know that we heard a lot these days about all of those applications of viscoelastic. Application of visible elastic ink forest may be most important in enhanced oil recovery when the instability actually helps enhance mixing and improve oil displacement in forest reservoirs. Also in soil mechanics, geotechnical engineering, as well as groundwater and environmental mitigation, where instability helps to enhance mixing and transport. Enhance mixing and transport of remitigation agents and kind of increase the efficiency of any contaminants that might be inside the soils. As well as hydraulic fracturing or fracking that creating more complex and extensive fracture networks by improving the extraction of oil and gas oil type formation, and obviously biomedical applications. What you may call application of microfluidic. What I believe in this specific case that we are considering, because we are considering channel, is really mostly important for biomedical applications. Because in some scenarios, in biomedical applications, you need to control the flow such a way that in which flow rate you can actually control the flow rate and get some of those analysis. Those analyses that will be hard to control in experiments, and what would be the principal outcome. So, let's move on to the problem. Here is what we considered is a 2D channel, and then we at the bottom and the top of the channel, we actually have rigid isotropic homogeneous pulsar that has permeability of k and velocity. And porosity epsilon in between, there is a viscoelastic fluid that moving, and obviously the viscoelastic is moving through the pores media. The gap in between is 2L and the thickness of the pores is H. We are all like to work with the scales, and here are some of those scales that you will see a lot in the next slide. Gregor's number, Weisenberg number, we called alpha, which Alpha, which is L over square root of K as permeability parameter. Depth ratio is delta H over L and a ratio of solvent to total is positive, which is beta. So you can see there are a lot of scenarios that are changing compared to impermeable surface, right? Most importantly, delta is there and alpha. And of course, epsilon is another thing that will be changing there. Will be changing here. Our objective in this specific talk that I'm going to tell you about is to analyze using linear stability of viscoelastic fluid in Paul's method. Okay, so what we did, we had to couple viscoelastic fluid inside the free flow region plus a viscoel. A viscoelastic fluid that we can get inside the ball. So it's a coupling of all of those equations. We know that for viscoelastic fluid, there are different models, finit P, of course, or void B, upper Maxwell, and all of those. But we, on the other hand, we wanted to have a model that can be used for viscoelastic as a continuum model. We found that there are Found that there was only one work by Tana and Mazuka, Physics of Luit 2005, that they actually developed a model based on all-droid B. It's very simple, it's just a flat surface, unbounded pulse media, and they considered a stop seri. All of those equations that you will see here, they don't have it, so we just proposed. We just proposed adding those terms according to what they started with. They actually started with volume average method, combined it with all droid B, and then developed it for only unbounded forest case and a substantial. But then we added some of those terms that you could see here by considering the porosity and also of course the divergence of the shear. The divergence of the shear in general and the shear stress inside the post MIB. M here goes to post MIP. And then of the arsonate boundary conditions, boundary condition at the top and bottom are the mostly boundary conditions. At the interface, we use general form of equivalent between the velocity profile, the slip velocity at the interface plus. interface plus shear and normal expressions that are all applied at the interface. So everything is general. Okay, so before we move on to linear stability, it is important to understand the laminar or base state analysis. The velocity profile has the character for this specific fluid, has the characteristics of Newtonia. Of Newtonian fluid, and therefore, the velocity providing in the free flow region will be parabolic as a 1 minus y squared. That you would see the parabolic shape. In there, while inside the porous material, it depends on the permeability k, you will have different scenarios. For example, if you look at the zoom shape, which is shortened here, then you have. Here, when you have all 450, that apparently permeability is there, and you have the porous with definitely some permeability. There will be flow inside the porous media going to alpha around 500 or any order of 100 that makes it an impermeable surface, then the flow reaches to as well to outflow another characteristics of the flow inside the course. Proposal. We then use a temporal linear stability analysis by adding a small perturbation to all of those parameters, velocity, pressure, shear, both inside the free flow region and inside the pores. We then linearize the equations and solve them with Chebyshev spectral collutation method. K is the big number. K is the date number here, Cr is the date speed, and Ci is the growth rate. So before we begin, and I'm going to show you the result next, we wanted to first analyze the computation. To do that, we actually had to do some tests and make sure the collotation points that were coming through the Chevyshev. The Chebyshev collocation method is not changing. What we did, we actually used the case of impermeable post-medium. We changed L, but not that in our model we have 2L and LN. So these should be both changing. It is really critical when you add more polymer to the system or you increase Weissenberg number, actually, these are changing. So every time we have to make sure. Every time we have to make sure this convergence is there, but anyway, we found that around L400, we're going to get a really good result. And even for the case of Horos Media, L400, LM450 was good in our case. Then we also validated with two cases when we have Newtonian fluid and coarse layer that was. Course layer that was worked by Tilton and Portalesi in JSN 2008, and we also worked on other scenarios later in advanced water resources paper, as well as the case of impermeable surface, and we found a really good agreement. Okay, so now let's move on to the instability that we get. I'd like to quickly show you this graph of the also called it Y shape. That is, you are all, I'm sure you are available this white shape in Neotonian case when alpha is 500 impermeable wall. But then when we have just Neotonia and Paul's, what's going to happen? So when we have only Newtonian Only Newtonian fluid, there is no pulse, which is alpha 500. It's already been known in Eschmidt and Henrikson that there will be a Y-shaped characteristic of instability and eigen spectrum. The right branch, when Cr goes to zero, is called the wall mode or A branch. P branch is called center mode. Is they called center mode, and when CR is actually moving to one, and S branch is a vertical branch that's showing instability in CICR when the instability occurs at almost two-thirds of the maximum base state velocity profile. It should be noted that for a case of neotonia, there is no porous, always. Tolmion felting or TS mode is the characteristic of the instability, and instability occurs after pretty boring order number 5772. When you have pores inside the system, always the flow will be from TS mode unstable already, but there would be an additional new damped mode which is called the wall mode or pulse mode inside the field. The police inside the theme. So, Bell, let me now talk about the results and what we could get in both scenarios. I wanted to talk and show you specifically what GARD and PRL have done that we validated with both, and then we have the course in the system, what would happen. So, Weissenberg zero is the case. Weisenberg zero is the case of Newtonian. When you add a little bit of polymer to the system, this is showing the identical spectral. There is still Y-shape is showing in there, but there are two continuous spectrum that are so-called CS1 and CS2 mode appearing in there, plus a ring that is encircled between those CS modes. CS modes. And then you add more polymers to the system. Still, these are all impermeable cases. Flow is stable. Those CS modes will be stretched a little bit. They move up. The white shape comes down a little. And then this ring will be actually collapsed inside the CS mode with a little bit of circle around C level. Around C level. But remember, flow is still stable and there is no stability that is alternative. Then, by adding more polymers to the system, you can see that again those CS move will be stretched more. Obviously, we don't see any of those ring shape here. They are all collapsed in there. Y shape also is moving down. CS mode is going up. Mode is going up. There are some characteristics of Newtonian, center mode, TS mode, and wall mode that are appearing in this case. And then by adding more polymers to the system, at 7.5, what actually those guys in PRL showed was that there is a new mode that they call it elastic inertial center mode. Center mode starts to appear at Weisenberg 7.2, but still the flow is the same. Well, they increase more and is pretty high. They even mentioned that the late Y Z employer is pretty high. And finally, at Y Zember 80, they found flow is definitely unstable. And there will be a new mode, Lastoiner Center mode. Center mode, that it was their discovery and a report published in PRL that this is the reason, and but the Eisenberg should be pretty high, which is around this. Okay, so now we have corals in the system. Let me show you what's going to happen. When we add corals, actually, those values are the same as the previous one. I just wanted to compare with those. There is this rate. There is this ring inside is actually the ring that I showed you in previous slide, plus additional ring shape that we believe is kind of like a P shape is producing due to the impact of porous media and India. The flow is definitely unstable because porous media has an instability effect and all of those analyses are unstable and the instability is. Unstable and the instability source from T is more definite in all of those scenarios. Then we add more polymer and still we have cores. This V structure is moved a little towards to the left and by adding more polymers to the system wise and very poor, we could see that this ring also collapses very similar to the previous case inside the CS mode. This CS mode. The CS mode, this CS mode also moves up, the white shape is still there, and then they are starting the amount of pause that is appearing in them. Then I asked my student to continue and see what happened. Interestingly, we found stability. The flow is going to be a stable at y is negative 10. We didn't see any instability effects. So the flow was unstable. Ts mode was. Unstable. TS mode was the reason for that. We end up increasing and adding more polymers. At Weissenberg 10, the TS mode disappeared and it just, everything stable. We continued to 20 and then 25, we found a new mode here. And this is not the center mode, it's actually the elastic, we call it the elastodimential ball mode because it's. Your ball mode because it's actually starting from the wall mode of the system. So it is interesting that this value of Weisenberg is actually modest, it's around 25, not quite 80 for the impermeable wall. And we could see that the instability occurs. When you add poles, then the instability will be occurr definitely. And there will be also a new mode that is happening. So let me go ahead. So let me go ahead and show you some of those results and neutral curves. For those of you who maybe are not familiar, this Reynolds K is actually showing where the flow will be stable, all of those areas, and unstable. The minimum value here is always showing the critical Ramos. So using linear stability analysis, you can actually Stability analysis, you can actually plot these and you will get the value of the critical remote of all of those samples. So for the case of Weisenberg zero, when you have only Newtonian fluid in the system, there is actually two modes that are occurring: the so-called porous mode, which is here, and then the fluid mode. We also showed in another paper that. Also, showed in another paper that pause mode do not have any effect on the instability. All those instabilities start from the fluid mode. Even for the viscoelastic case, we tried it and the flow is always stable in the pulse mode. But we have these two modes that are occurring in there. By adding more polymers and increasing Weisenberg, we still have that pulse mode in there, but the flow will be either stabilized. Either stabilize or destabilize that they I wanted to show you the effect of Weisenberg. There is a critical Weisenberg for this specific value of beta that we are considering 0.8 is around 3 that critical Reynolds number decreases and then increases, which means it will be destabilized and again stabilized. We also are trying to find out a scaling parameter Scaling parameter. Interestingly, we found that these are all match if we add some parameters. You are still working on that. There should be some characteristics of alpha and epsilon involved in those equations that actually we can come up with a scaling with a cylindrical curve. And in case you wanted to know also what would be the effect of permeability, still Still, this destabilizer stabilizing effect of the coarse material will be always there. Then you have a permeable surface. Of course, there will be this effect, but then you add the effect of porosity and poros to the surface, this will destabilize. In case you are curious to You are curious to now what would be in fact at one specific Weisenberg number. Um, I here just show you the result for Weisenberg for the varied permeability parameter, meaning that we actually change the K and the fluid mode is the case that we always have then by adding porous material with load. Material that will be decided. And you can see also the critical Reynolds number that is also occurring in there. Let me just quickly move on to the next slide. We wanted also to show the impact of beta, which is also important. I know there are a lot of values in here. Epsilon is fixed, delta is fixed, but the most important one, why isn't very? Important one, Lieusen, very alpha and beta, needs to be analyzed. Beta zero is the case for upper convective maximum model, beta one is Miltonian, and here are some of those analysis that obviously shows there will be impact of pulse compared to alpha five number, which is impermeable surface. And then the critical Reynolds number, obviously there is a critical beta value. Is a critical beta value that leads to the instability or instability of the layer. So, anyway, I'm gonna conclude here by showing that actually when you add force to the system, the flow will be destabilized until around three, and after that will be stabilized. We found a new unstable mode, we call it the lasto inertial ball mode. Elasto inertial ball mode that is the reason for all of those instability and also be characterized better comparing to the case of impermeable surface and also permeable surface. I would like to also thank you and acknowledge NSF e-gear that we got in 2022 and also the new one that we just received and we plan to add part We plan to add particles now and analyze what's going to happen to the system. It's not linear stability analysis. We're going to analyze the PIB MRI and also some proposed theoretical model and further understand the hysteresis and also sub-criticality and supercriticality that will be by addition of polymers, this elastic and also particles to the system. Our SQL SQL system would be kind of similar to the work that we published in PRF and JFMPC. With that, I would like to thank you for the attention, and I'm happy to answer your questions. Thank you very much for your nice presentation. Questions first. I assume that the size is scalable. I assume that the size is K dot in Porus should be much smaller than K dot in chat. Higher energy. In here we just consider L. Yeah, L compared to the scalar view. Okay, so you mean this L and H, right? No, no, I mean you have L and this is 2L and this is H, right? But I mean, you have porosity, right? Because the scales between the solid fracture and solid parts, meaning you have some sort of a scalar, right? These are all, we assume, isotropic homogeneous. Yeah, but very small, but I'm not sure if we can call it very small because these are all based on volume average. It's not porous thing. So we cannot is now here is to. Now you're a Stokes equation, continuity, and all of this. So there is no forest gate microstructure. And then the next question is that what happens instead of just modeling a forest, just consider a simple acidic velocity and just do then stabilize just a profile in the So you maybe don't consider any equation? Yeah instead of just yeah instead of just Instead of just solving the equations in the total portion, just consider a slip velocity in the boundary between the porcelain and the channel. I want to know what would, do you expect that you should see the same result at this quality? But what kind of sleep wall or the sleeping interface? Because in the velocity or sleeping interface that we are considering now, the equations are all cocked out, right? Are all coupled. So the velocity and a slip velocity has all phi epsilon and all of those dimensionless parameters. Yeah, I understand, but when you show the velocity profile. So you can just explain. I mean, just so if you just, you know, for example the blue line in the right hand, you see the skin, you know. So it's just consider that value of a slip and just having one over the button. That's a good point. I know there is a lot of debate on considering what boundary condition that the interface can be used. And experimentally, we did some for V D sum for just Newtonian field over course Newton. There is a value of tau, which is called momentum coefficient, need to be involved with that, and that could be then considered. But in this case, that's a good point. I don't know, maybe we have to think about that now. It's very common in coffee. Because I thought it was really interesting. Well, we write a really light. I was really interested, but I would really like to see what the model looks like because I don't think you sh showed it. You didn't show the profile of instability. Do you have a video showing that? What kind of feature? Well, I mean, because you solve your eigenvalue problem, right? Does that give you an eigenvalue and an eigenfunction? Yes. What does the eigenfunction look like? That we need to make because I for the TS waves, I wouldn't suspect to be a TS wave, right? But they'll be like this? Okay. I didn't present, yes. But we have yes, I can function on it. You can see for this specific one, Weisenberg zero Newtonian of the host, while we add polymers, 10, there will be some changes in while you lost the streamlines. So that's a TS wave, isn't it? Yes. So that's a TS wave, isn't it? Yes. And the other one that you talked about, would you talk about two different models? No, this is only for one specific case. I think this is for K, oh, this is for the instable point, right at that point. I know what you mean. You have to analyze and figure out that a specific new mode that is on the right. Yes, yes. Yeah, that's clear. I don't have it. Yes. I don't have it here. But yeah, that's a good one. Here, K is 1.41, Grey North is 861, and also Weisenberg is 10, which is the exact scenario when you have communication. But we need to have the critical. Thank you. Last question. Yeah, I'm a bit confused by this. I thought when you have discovered fluid flow in your channel, it's linearly stable, but is this for small variance numbers? Actually, the work they have done before, they found that there will be, when you add polymers to the system, the flow will be unstable. As I showed you, maybe go back. Alexander Morozov would subject to this. Object to this. No, there's a paper about four and five years ago, this Gorgon paper, that showed you get that linear. These papers, Gorg. Gorg is actually. Yes, GORG, and also this colleague recently, PRL. They found actually the float will be unstable, but the Weisenberg number is pretty high, around 80. But it's not in the red-zero link. You need some inertia roaming it. So it's not inertia. Again, so fix it. So it's not inertia. Well, this node also exists without inertia, but you have to go to like, I don't know, Weissman 300 or something to get it. Yes, exactly. It does exist without also in the inertial test limit. That scales with the concentration. So if you go to like beta 499 Heissener 300, you get that it's unstable at the rainbows. Well, not really much at the rainbows, but it's very different from a TS wave. Depends on the signal of the. Depends on data and all of those. But what they have shown is there is instability out there in those cases, which is different from the instrument. Thank you. I don't regret anybody much for coming off.
