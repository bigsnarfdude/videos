Thank you. Hello, everyone. My name is Masai Kuchimojo from Tokyo Metropolitan University. Before I start my talk, I'd like to express my thanks to organizers, Professor Hiroshimatano, Professor Ita Porachik, and Professor Girardi, and Hirokazu Ninomiya and Ruka Rossi. They observe propagation and stability in evolution. And the stability in evolution equation for providing me the opportunity to speak today. In the first part, I'd like to talk about what logarithmic diffusion equation is. This part is a joint work with Eiji Yanagida of Tokyo University and Peter Tyakachev, Lostok University. And logarithmic diffusion equations. Charismic diffusion equation is the form of the evolution equation of the function W X T satisfies this equation, W sub t equals W plus log of W. This equations appears in many fields of mathematics or physics. First example is from differential geometry. From differential geometry. In the 2D plane, if we introduce some conformal metric, the rich flow reduced 2D plane rich flow is reduced to logarithmic diffusion equation. And this is related to the talk in the last talk of CESAM. And the second one appeared in the context of present. Appeared in the context of plasma physics. This is a three-dimensional logarithmic diffusion equation combining continuous equation and the Ohm's law and Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution and we obtain the logarithmic three-dimensional logarithmic diffusion equation. And for the from the statistical physics, Physics like this OI model of Boltzmann equation, and by taking a singular limit of one Boltzmann equation, what is called the 1D Karliman model, we obtain a one-dimensional logarithmic diffusion equation. And there are many works related to this effort. Related to this. From the context of differential geometry, Hamiruto and Chao, and recently Kabarashi and Suzuki considered it and they discuss asymptotic behavior. And Shu and Daskaruporos Delubinond say some many works about them. And all the behavior on the asymptotic Good synthetics is already proved, classified, and proved obtained. And for n-dimensional larger symmetric case, these researchers consider logarithmic diffusion equation. And for one-dimensional case, Takachi and Zhang and Basque is also considered veripositiveness of this problem, or er positiveness of this problem. Repositiveness of this problem. Today, I'd like to talk about one-dimensional logarithmic diffusion equation. In order to, since this diffusion is very singular, in order to get the positiveness, we need to suppose some asymptotic behavior at space infinity. That is, log of w x derivative is minus beta and converged plus alpha at minus. Combust to plus alpha to minus infinity. This flux condition is needed to get the uniqueness of the solution. And by a simple calculation, we can prove that all positive, a double is positive, or positive solution extinct in a finite time. And that extinction time can be obtained by adding this equation on space. By using flux boundary condition, we obtain that the mass of the function w decreases. Of the function w decreases by the same speed minus alpha plus beta. So there exists capital T such that the mass of WxT is represented by this formula. And in the previous work, we considered the detailed asymptotic behavior of this problem. And in order to describe the asymptotic extinction behavior, we introduce several similar We introduce several similar variables. This localism liquid diffusion equation has a lot of symmetry structure. So in order to preserve the flux density, the only scaling that preserves this property is of this type. Can you see this? Of this type of scaling. Then related to this. Related to this scaling, we can introduce backwards similar variable and let us define the function v of x tau by this transformation. First, we normalize the mass and introduce a new time variable tau by this formula. Tau is equal to log 1 over capital T minus T. Then, by a simple calculation, we satisfy the logarithmic diffusion equation with linear. Equation with linear source term, and we have the same flux boundary condition. And from this scaling, it is easy to check that we preserve the mass, total mass for all time tau. And in order to describe the extinction behavior, we need to know the behavior of the function v as tau goes to plus infinity. And this And this is the result for the asymptotic behavior. If we disscaled by the cell stimuli variable, this V expal converge to some pulse function, pulse-like function. Here, phi small phi sub, little phi sub p is the solution of the profile equation of this equation corresponding to this equation. And there exists one profile and one profile. Profile and one propagation speed Cp that relate that is depend on alpha and beta such that this equation has a solution unique up to translation and a V X tag converges to small phi P X minus C p tag and maybe add some shift as tag goes to plus infinity. This is extinction behind And this is the extinction behavior of the logarithmic diffusion equation for 1D with this flux boundary condition. Now, let's move to our topics. And today, we'd like to consider logarithmic equidistation equation is a monostable nonlinearity. Non-linearity. And this is a joint work with Eiji Yanagida and Haru Nori Monobe of Osaka Metropolitan University and Hiroshi Matsuzawau Kanagawa University. In order to explain what the spreading is, let us remember the semilinar heat diffusion equation with logistic reaction type. logistic reaction term and here u times 1 minus u is monostable since the corresponding ode solution or positive for all positive initial data the solution converges to one so the equilibrium one is stable and zero is unstable and this type of nonlinearity is in general called fp type or fisher type nonlinearity and And the problem of spreading, typical setting of the problem of spreading is the following. For example, if a user is compactory support is non-negative and not equal to zero, as time passes, how the solution evolves. Since the solution wants to become one everywhere, you become want to become one in bounded domain. In bounded domain and bounded area, and at space infinity, u keeps zero. And there exists a front here, and this front expand, expand by the speed two. And this is a well-known result of Aronson and Weinberger, classical result. And this speed 2 also appears in the existence of traveling. In the existence of traveling flow for the same model equation. Kolomogura and Petrovsky Skunov considered this problem for more general unstable non-linearity, and they showed that if S, this is the speed of front-to-wave solution. If S is bigger than G star, which is equal to 2, if S is If S is bigger than two, there exists positive traveling flow. And if S is less than two, there exists oscillation here and no traveling, positive traveling wave. And they also prove that if the initial data is a heavy side-like function, the solution converges to the the shape of the solution converged to the that of mini the traveling wave with minimum speed. Traveling wave with minimum speed with some shift function. And this type of problem is also considered in the context of slow diffusion by Yvonne Du and Pyros and Zhou, and fast diffusion with King and McCabe. And there are plenty of works. And in this talk, I'd like to consider the problem replacing La Prussia to the logarithmic. To the logarithmic diffusion. That's the logarithmic logo volume. And for the equist, and this number is related the same with the spreading speed of the flow. So, in order to know the spreading behavior first, it is natural to consider the Natural to consider the problem. First, let me explain it. We consider the logarithmic diffusion equation with logistic reaction term with satisfying this fractional boundary condition at plus infinity. Here, gamma is some positive constant. And existence of traveling wave is very clear. Very clear since the probability wave can be little explicitly. There exists a unique profile function phi sub f and that propagation speed sf gamma is related to gamma by this formula and thus traveling like this traveling flow unique up to shift and we also And we also prove the convergence of traveling from if u0 and the traveling wave is very close at space infinity, then you converge to one of the traveling wave as t goes to infinity. This is the result for traveling front. And the speed of the front is given by this s function sf gamma. This is related on gamma. This is related on gamma. And our problem is the following. u sub t equal to log u x plus u times 1 minus u. And we suppose the flux boundary condition at space infinity. That means u decays to zero at flux infinity with the rate e to the minus beta x and decays. beta x and decays to zero at minus infinity with the rate e to the alpha x. This is our problem and our question is we'd like what we'd like to classify the asymptotic behavior and we find that the existence of the traveling pulse is related to the is a key load which plays a separator of the behavior. The behavior. And roughly speaking, our theorem is the following. If alpha beta is bigger than one, in this case, all the positive solutions extinct in a finite time. On the other hand, if alpha beta is directly less than one, Directly less than one, then there is this traveling traveling pulse, traveling pulse solution. And if initial data is larger, the solution spread, solution wants to become one everywhere. And if initial data is small, solution wants to extinct in a finite time. And this is these three possibilities are all behavior. The all behavior of the solution. And this condition is by simple calculation, we can prove that this condition is the front solution of the back wave is slower than the speed of the front wave. So, since the front wave is faster, the back wave The back with full and traveling pulse appears. On the other hand, if this condition is reversed, back speed is faster, back wave speed is faster, so pronoun wave is chase over and the solution extinct. This is the image of this condition. And since the analysis of this case is completely included, second case, so we only I only explain this second case. I only explain this second case in the detail. Our theorem is the following. More clearly, we consider this case, and there are only three possibility, spreading, extinction, and threshold case. And the behavior of the spreading is like this: the solution wants to expand and the left to front. And the left front moves by the speed SF alpha. That means the back wave speed. The front wave before front is moving to the right with the speed Sf alpha. Maybe negative value. And for the threshold case, the solution converged in the traveling pulse. And for the extinction case, the async. For the extinction case, the asymptotic behavior is described by self-shimmer variable, which I explained in the first part. Since U becomes very small, this term becomes very large, and this term is very small. So the solution must be approximated by the solution of this equation. And we have already known the asymptotic behavior of the extinction behavior. Extinction behavior of this equation. So after the same scaling in the first part, the solution U after scaling converges to little phi p as tau goes to infinity. And we can construct unstable manifold of the traveling pulse and but I only explain these data. Explain these later. And the proof of splitting, the case A is the same as that of the paper Weinberger. The method is super and sub-solution argument. We construct a sub-solution and super solution by modifying the traveling front. And the second case for the threshold case is convergent traveling pulse is the key idea is establishing some type of uv type several. Some type of UBL type theory and using a Strumian zero number theory. And the third case is I have already explained roughly. The asymptotic behavior is since after scaling the equation becomes non-autonomous and by making tau infinity, the symptomic behavior is reduced to the classification of the entire solution. The classification of the entire solution of this equation, and we prove the Lubirus theorem again. And doing the similar argument, like case B, we can get a symptomic behavior. And here, since the classification theorem is a little technical, I just explained asymptotic behavior in this talk. And since this case is the the most interesting must be most interesting i will i only consider the idea of the proof of the case b and the key idea which i explained dual type theorem is the state the statement of the rubber type theorem is the following let u sub e is a be a positive bounded entire solution of the of our problem here entire solution means the solution of this problem means the solution of this problem defined for all real number real number type t then this function u sub e must be equivalent to some problem of the original variable. We can find some sheeta star that the entire solution is equivalent to this one. And this type of Ligretty theory Type of Lugre type theorem is used by proofologic for semi-linear problem and many, many works. I just refer this work. And that proof is related to the Ihondo Martano's paper and what is called the robustness of zero number. But here I skipped the proof of u-built type theorem in this talk. Theorem here in this talk, and I just we assume this result and prove the symptotic behavior. And what is Trumian theory is the following. Let me explain that Z V is the number of sign changing of function of V. So this case is one, two, three, four, four time sign changing. And it is known that for a linear heat equation, this number is. Heat equation: this number is monotone non-increasing in t and it drops only the time when multiple zero appeared somewhere. And it decreases at least by two. This is proved by very old paper of Surum and Sa Angenent a long time ago. And Samatan is also a Is also we discovered this fact. And how to prove the convergence traveling pulse is the following. For simplist, to make it visually, I take the logo of U and logo phi and phi pt. And by making the sheet a sufficiently large, the position of three graph is something like this. Something like this. And if the if this traveling, if this solution chase over traveling wave, there exists some point which have a tangential intersection point. There, by the dropping of the intersection number occurs, and at the first time intersection number is one, but if it drops, it becomes minus one. So that is impossible. Minus one. So that is impossible. So the traveling wave is sandwiched by traveling to traveling front horizontally. So if we look at the solution on the moving frame, moving frame, moving coordinates, the solution is found. And let us define the omega limiting, generalized omega limiting function like this, u of z. This is z is x minus st. that is x minus st z plus sp t dash t j p das t j then by choosing some sub sequence we obtain an omega limiting function and this t moves for all real number and by the real time theorem as i explained in two slides before this omega limiting function is equal to one traveling pulse and uh next we'd like to exclude the Next, we'd like to exclude the possibility that the solution transits to traveling front. If such things occur, the solution after its shape becomes traveling front, that oscillate between the traveling front. But that is impossible because of the zero number argument that I explained in the previous slide, since there is a tangential intersection point that must be below or Must be below or above the traveling room. And thank you for the attention. Perfect.
