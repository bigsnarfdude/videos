I wanted to talk about two new results. As I think everyone knows, there are two important theorems in Noer's original paper. And the first part of the talk will be devoted to the second theorem, and the second part of the talk to the first theorem, just to make things more interesting. Oops. Okay. So the first part is going to So, the first part is going to talk about higher-order symmetries of underdetermined systems. And let me go very quickly through the basics. If anyone wants my slides, please let me know. So, the problem of understanding the symmetry groups of differential equations dates back to Sophos Lee, who was interested in integrating differential equations. He wanted to do what Galois had done for algebraic equations, and he introduced Lie groups. And he introduced Lie groups to do this. So we have a system of differential equations, just to get the notation. G is a Lie group, or maybe an infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group acting on the space of independent and dependent variables. And G acts on the functions by transforming their graphs. So for instance, you might think of rotating the graph or translating the graph or scaling the graph or more complicated things. So that's what the group does. And the basic definition going back to Lee is that. Basic definition going back to Li is that G is a symmetry group. If, whenever you start with a solution and you apply a group element to it, you get another solution. So that's the basics. And as we all know, the right way to think about this is to go to the infinitesimal picture. So instead of working with the group transformations themselves, we work with the infinitesimal generator. So I'm not going to go into long detail about this. It's just to get the notation. To get the notation set. So, in general, we have a vector field and we identify it with a first-order differential operator. That turns out to be very convenient for many purposes. So, the psi i and the phi alpha are the components of the infinitesimal generator, and you recover the group transformation by integrating a system of ordinary differential equations. Okay? Now, because you act on functions, you also act on their. act on functions, you also act on their derivatives. As we know, this is the prolonged group action, and the formulas for the prolonged action itself are provided by implicit differentiation, which gets very messy. Instead, we work with the prolonged infinitesimal generator. That's the prolongation of the original vector field. And there's a well-known formula, which I think was first appeared in a paper of mine, this version of the formula. There's a recursive version that goes back to Lee. Recursive version that goes back to Li. But anyway, in this version, we have what's called the characteristic of the vector field. So this is just this particular combination of the phi's and the cases. Remember, they were the components of the vector field times first order derivatives. And then you take total derivatives of it using the standard total differentiation operator. And this is your formula for the prolonged vector field. And if you have a connected group of transformations and this Group of transformations and the system is suitably non-degenerate, which most systems are, then we have this famous infinitesimal criterion that you apply the prolonged infinitesimal generator to each of the equations. And if that vanishes whenever the equations are satisfied, then you get a symmetry group of the system. So, this is all standard, goes back to Lee. There's nothing new here. Okay, now it became starting in the 1960s, it became very In the 1960s, it became very popular to start talking about higher-order symmetries. What are some people called generalized symmetries, or I call generalized symmetries? They are actually originally due to Nerder in her famous paper. And she introduced them because she wanted to prove a theorem that every conservation law corresponds to a variational symmetry group and vice versa. And if you don't allow higher order symmetries, that statement doesn't work. And as we know, integral. And as we know, integrable equations like Kdv have higher-order conservation laws and higher-order symmetries to get them. Some people call them Lee-Becklund transformations. I did a careful study of Lee and Beckland's papers, and they do not appear anywhere in Lee and Beckland's papers. They did introduce contract transformations, but that's not quite at the level of what Noer introduced. And although she introduced them in 1918, they were basically completely ignored. They were basically completely ignored. There was a little bit of activity just before the advent of solitons, of integrable systems of PDE starting in the mid-60s with Kruskal, Zabuski, Muran, et cetera, et cetera, Gardner-Green and so on. And that's when they started to come into their own. So the idea is quite simple. You take the infinitesimal generator and you just allow them to depend on derivatives, as well as the X's and the U's, you allow derivatives in the picture. Allow derivatives in the picture. And all the formulas are exactly the same as before. The characteristic is the same. But it's useful now that you've done that, instead of working with the infinitesimal generator, the vector field on top, you work with its evolutionary equivalent, which is you basically only transform the u's. You don't transform the independent variables. And the prolongation formula splits up in this way in terms of the evolutionary vector field. Evolutionary vector field. And this implies that if you have a generalized symmetry, including a class geometrical symmetry, that's true, a symmetry if and only if its evolutionary form is. So you can work with those directly, which simplifies matters sometimes. And here's a standard example probably everyone has seen before. Berger's equation is an example with an infinite hierarchy of generalized higher order symmetries, starting with space and time translations, and then you get these higher. And then you get these higher and higher order ones. There's long lists of these in the papers of Mikhailov Shabat Sokolov, also in Jinping Wang's thesis, and there's probably more. I don't know of a complete classification of them or complete listing, but there's lots and lots of them out there. Okay, so the question comes up: which systems of partial differential equations have these higher-order generalized symmetries? Noda had no example. Symmetries. Noda had no examples, and so the first real examples were the soliton equations. So there are three main classes. Well, there are two well-known classes, and I want to introduce a third class. That's the point of the first part of this talk. So the first class is linear systems of partial differential equations with a non-trivial geometric or point symmetry group. This is because first order symmetries of linear, sorry, that should say geometric. Sorry, that should say geometric symmetries of linear systems give recursion operators. This is well known, and recursion operators is one of the methods for generating higher-order symmetries. Or if you can linearize the equation, so Berger's equation could be linearized by Hopf-Cole transformation, in the right circumstances, you can also prove that they have infinite hierarchies. So, the so-called C integrable equations are the ones that can be linearized by a The ones that can be linearized by a transformation, some sort of reciprocal transformation, all kinds of transformations. The second class, which includes Kdv and the other equations being studied in this workshop, are those solvable by inverse scattering, what are sometimes referred to as S-integrable systems. And again, they have either recursion operators and or master symmetries, formal symmetries, and so on. And that's what Mikhailoff and company did to classify it. So I want to add the following third class. So, I want to add the following third class, which was unknown to me up until recently. And as far as I know, with a couple of exceptions that I'll show you in specific cases, did not appear in the literature before. These are underdetermined systems that admit a symmetry generator depending on an arbitrary function of the independent variables. So, I want to try to explain that in the first half of the talk. Okay, and please. Okay, and please interrupt me if there are any significant questions. Okay, one other remark before I get to the underdetermined systems. Almost all the equations with one higher order symmetry have infinitely many, but there's this famous example of Bakirov, a so-called triangular system, because the V equation does not involve U. It was known to have one sixth order generalized symmetry, but for a long time people Symmetry, but for a long time people conjectured that it had no higher-order ones, and this was finally proved using number-theoretic results by Boyker, Saunders, and Wong. And there's a bunch of these known, but I don't know if there are any really non-triangular examples of this. Okay, so let me focus on underdetermined systems. So, to keep the exposition a little simple, I'm going to assume, and this is also the case that comes up in the very The case that comes up in the variational calculus, anyway, I'm going to assume that the equation has the same number of equations as unknowns. So there are Q equations in Q unknowns. And with this assumption, you can define what you mean by underdetermined. If there exist differential operators D1 up through DQ that do not simultaneously vanish on the solution, such that this linear combination D1 times delta 1 plus dotted. d1 times delta one plus dot dot dot dq delta q is identically zero. So that's the definition of underdetermined I'm going to work with. For the general case, it's quite subtle, and a really complete exposition can be found in Werner Seiler's book on involution. Examples that arise in basic physics include Maxwell's equations and Einstein's equations for general relativity. So these do occur in These do occur in the physical literature. Okay, and so this is the main theorem that I want to give you at least an idea of the proof. Suppose you have a system of differential equations which emits a symmetry and the characteristic of that symmetry, in other words, the Q, depends on an arbitrary function and finitely many of its derivatives. So this is an arbitrary function of the independent. An arbitrary function of the independent variables. Then, if f is any arbitrary differential function, in other words, any function of the x's, the u's, and the derivatives of u, completely arbitrary, then if I replace the derivatives of h by the derivatives of f, these are now total derivatives, then this is also the characteristic of an infinitesimal symmetry. So, this is this result says if you have this type of symmetry group, could be even a Symmetry group, could be even a regular geometrical symmetry group, then you automatically have an infinite hierarchy of higher-order symmetries. Okay? So any underdetermined system, so it's not hard to see that the condition of having such a symmetry requires that the system be underdetermined. I won't try to prove that here, but that's not so difficult. So these only work for underdetermined systems. Systems. Although not every underdetermined system will emit such a symmetry generator. In the paper I referenced, there's an example where it doesn't. I don't have that in the talk. Okay, so in other words, we get infinite hierarchies for these type of systems. So here's the proof in an outline. So first of all, notice that the partial derivatives of H are basically the same as their total derivatives because H only depends on X. Because h only depends on x. That's the arbitrary function. Okay, if you have any expression that vanishes where you have h and an arbitrary function, because the partial derivatives can assume any values, okay, so I'm not, I'm not, h could be analytic, but it doesn't have to be. It could be C infinity. So these partial derivatives can be assume any values. We can replace them by any quantities we like. In particular, we could replace them by total derivatives. Could replace them by total derivatives of an arbitrary differential function, and this is still satisfied basically because these are arbitrary. So you can put anything in there and you still get zero. Okay, this is a substitution principle that you can find in a preprint due to Kisilev in about, oh, in 2012. Anyway, so that's, I became aware of that after writing to him with the proof. So here's now, what do you do when you compute? Now, what do you do when you compute the symmetry group of a system of differential equations? You apply the Prolong vector field and the coefficients, because I'm working with the vector field in evolutionary form, these are just total derivatives. So the total derivatives respect the derivatives. Remember, the partial derivatives of H are the same as total derivatives. And because we're just differentiating to get the higher order coefficients, we can replace the derivatives of H by the total derivatives. Of h by the total derivatives of f, and we still get the same result. So every partial derivative of h that appears in the determining equations, which are satisfied, can be replaced by the corresponding total derivative of f without affecting their validity. And hence the vector field with the q hat is also a symmetry. And that's that's basically all there is to the proof. So it's something that, to me, in hindsight, looks like it's something I should have known. Hindsight looks like it's something I should have known many, many years ago. Now, let me connect this with the variational calculus with Lagrangians, because that's the main theme of the workshop. So let me remind you about variational symmetries. So that's just a transformation that leaves the variational problem invariant. That's what's called a strict variational symmetry. And you get the following infinitesimal invariance criterion because the independent variable. And because the independent variables can be transformed, you pick up this divergence term. So the C's are the coefficients of the infinitesimal generator, the X terms in the infinitesimal generator. So you have this well-known infinitesimal invariance criterion that goes back to Lee, and Noether was well aware of this. A little bit later, Noether's protégé Besselhagen said, Well, we can take instead of zero, we can put a divergence term here. So let's keep that in mind because that's. Here, so let's keep that in mind because that's what's going to come up in the second half of the talk. But for now, let me put that off. That the divergence symmetry has an equivalent strict variational symmetry. That's also a result that's not hard to prove. Every symmetry of a variational problem is a symmetry of the Euler-Lagrange equations. This is well known, but the converse is not true. And almost all the examples of non-variational symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equations are scaling symmetries. Lagrange equations are scaling symmetries which scale the Lagrangian but don't leave it invariant. I do know one exception, and maybe there are more out there, but there's this interesting exception that appears in 3D isotropic linear elasticity. Okay, so what is Nerda's second theorem? So this was the theorem she proved to answer a question that arose in relativity, as I'll discuss in a little bit. A system of Euler-Lagrange equations is underdetermined. Is underdetermined in the sense that I had earlier, if and only if it admits an infinite-dimensional variational symmetry group depending on an arbitrary function of the independent variables. The associated conservation laws, if you apply the first theorem, which tells you every symmetry gives you a conservation law, these ones are trivial. So the first theorem, which we'll discuss in a second, gives a connection between non-trivial symmetries and non-trivial conservation laws. That was not an Conservation laws. That was not in NOTA. That was much later in a paper of Martinez-Alonzo, and then a little bit after that, I also proved a version of this. And as far as I know, there is still an open question. Are there over-determined systems of Euler-Lagrange equations for which trivial symmetries give non-trivial conservation laws? And that seems to be very difficult. I tried very hard to find such a system without success. Okay, so now if we go back to the theorem way back here. Back to the theorem way back here, this result. We basically have all the hypothesis of this theorem. We have an infinitesimal symmetry. If it satisfies Nerdler's second theorem, it has an arbitrary function in it, and the system is underdetermined. And so we immediately get a sort of generalized version of November's second theorem. If you have any underdetermined system of Euler-Lagrange equation by the usual version, Equation, by the usual version, it omits a generalized symmetry, but it admits generalized symmetries of arbitrarily high order, depending on one or more arbitrary differential functions. And so the proof is just this. Now, this result resolved what should have been a mystery concerning Noza's second theorem, especially if you were paying attention to Frank's first talk of the meeting. He said there has to be a democracy of independent and dependent variables. But Nova's. Variables. But Nove's second theorem in the standard statement says an arbitrary function of the independent variables. What about arbitrary functions of the dependent variables and so on? And what this new version says is that if it omits a symmetry group with an arbitrary function of the independent variables, then it omits symmetries depending on arbitrary functions of the independent, dependent variables and their derivatives. So this So, this mystery of the original version didn't keep up under hodograph and other types of transformations is now a resolve because now you get arbitrary functions of all the variables, all the jet variables. Okay, so in relativity, Nova's second theorem effectively resolved Hilbert's dilemma concerning this law of conservation of energy. Einstein was also worried about this, namely the time translational symmetry that ordinarily leads to conservation energy. Ordinary leads to conservation of energy belongs to an infinite-dimensional symmetry group, and hence, by Node's second theorem, is conservation laws trivial. And in fact, now we know that there are in fact symmetries depending on arbitrary derivatives. Now, these were actually found in a paper of Anderson and Torrey, and they called them trivial symmetries of Einstein's equations. And maybe all the symmetries I've written down here are trivial, but nevertheless, it's interesting. The construction to me is interesting. The construction to me is interesting. Okay, here's a very simple example. Let's see, do I have time for this? Just barely. So there's the variational symmetry group. You add in, so this is the divergence of u squared. The Euler-Lagrange equations have a differential relation. They're underdetermined. And the main theorem that we said before was this system of Euler-Lagrange equations admits symmetries where f is any function of the independent and dependent variable. Independent dependent variables and their derivatives. Another place where this comes up, here's another example, but I'll skip that. Another place, and we saw this in Bianca's talk yesterday, is the variational problems that are invariant under reparametrization, a diffeomorphism pseudo-group. In this case, not only do they emit the diffeomorphism pseudo-group, they actually emit infinite variational symmetries depending on arbitrary functions of the, again, independent. Of the again, independent, dependent variables and their derivatives in this form. So there were these sort of unnoticed symmetries floating around, even for these very simple problems with the diffeomorphism invariance. Okay? Let me move on to the second part, and then I'll answer questions at the end. So the second part involves Nürdler's first theorem. Okay? And let me briefly say something about modern physics. Briefly, say something about modern physics. This is a quote from a philosopher of physics, Harvey Brown. It said: One of the most remarkable methodological trends in modern physics has been the a priori use of symmetry principles to constrain the action principles of the non-gravitational interactions in da-da-da-da, QED and particle physics. In other words, the modern manual for physics is as follows, but I claim this was also already envisioned by Noer in her paper in 1980. Paper in 1918. And this is a direct quote from the paper, of course, translated from the original German. As Hilbert expresses his assertion, the lack of a proper law of conservation of energy constitutes a characteristic of the general theory of relativity. So here she's saying exactly the problem I noted in the previous half of the talk. For that assertion to be literally valid, it is necessary to understand the term general relativity in a wider sense than is usual and extend. Sense than is usual and extended to the aforementioned groups that depend on n arbitrary functions. And then she has a little footnote. This confirms once more the accuracy of Klein's remark that the term relativity, as it is used in physics, so we always think of Klein as the Erlanger program in mathematics, but another says this should be the Erlanger program in physics. Relativity, as it's used in physics, should be replaced by invariance with respect to a group. And that's basically the model. With respect to a group. And that's basically the modern way of constructing many, many physical theories. So, how do you construct a physical theory? Step one: determine what do you allow for symmetry. So, there's a large bunch of symmetries, translations, maybe rotations, Galilean boosts, Poincaré transformations, supersymmetry, all kinds of exotic symmetry, string theory, M-theory, etc., etc. Second, construct a variational principle that admits the given symmetry group. That admits the given symmetry group. Okay. Of course, then the question is: how do you do that? But physicists are very good at this, as I'll show you soon. And then nature says that we have to minimize or at least find stationary points of the resulting variational principle. And those are the field equations. The Euler-Lagrange equations are the field equations. So we start with the symmetry, we use that to construct the variational principle. We use that to construct the variational principle. We then take the Euler-Lagrange equations as the field equations. And then, of course, well, you can use November's first and second theorems to write down conservation laws and differential identities because you have variational symmetries by construction. The symmetries are variational symmetries. Or if they're infinite-dimensional groups, like gauge groups or things like that, you have differential identities. Diffeomorphism groups, as in Bianca's talk. And then you try to solve the field equations, which of course is very difficult, but even special solutions are of immense interest, e.g. black holes. Okay, so that's how you construct a physical theory in brief outline. But there's an issue there, and the issue is in step two. So let me explain what the issue is, constructing the variational principle. Now, Li already knew how to construct invariation. Knew how to construct invariant variational principles. He said any strictly invariant variational problem can be written in terms of the differential invariance. Okay, so in other words, we have a bunch of fundamental differential invariants, we have invariant differential operators, and there's always finitely many of these, even if the group is infinite dimensional, there's always finitely many of these. And you differentiate these to get the higher order invariance, and then you multiply an arbitrary. And then you multiply an arbitrary function of the differential invariance times an invariant volume form, and that gives you the most general invariant variational principle. Okay? Since the variational principle is G invariant, its Euler-Lagrange equations also omit G as a symmetry group, and hence they can also be expressed in terms of the differential invariance. And then there was the problem: how do you go directly from the invariant form of the variational problem to the invariant form? Problem to the invariant form of the Euler-Lagrange equation. This was solved in a paper that I wrote with Irina Kogan back in 2001. Some special cases were known, but we gave a general procedure that based on the theory of moving frames. That's not the point of this talk. Okay, so here's the physics problem. Remember, we started with a symmetry group and we construct a variational principle that's invariant under it. But Lee says there's actually infinitely many of these. Many of these. Any function of the differential invariant gives you that. Now, I will say that physicists are extraordinarily talented at finding the simplest such invariant variational principle, even for very complicated physical symmetry groups. And such a principle then forms the basis of the fundamental physics. But whatever their principle is, you can take it and multiply by any other function of the differential invariance, and you get another invariant variational principle. And by and large, physics. Principle, and by and large, physicists seem to be mostly unaware of the theory of differential invariance and this freedom that's there. So there are infinitely many alternative invariation variational principles. And the question is, does the underlying physics depend on which of these invariant variational principles is used? And if so, how does one select the correct one? So I'm going to end this part of the talk with some provocative remarks about this. But to do that, I have to set the stage and go back to note. Page and go back to Nerther. So, Nerther, this is a repeat of the preview of a slide in the first half of the talk. So, we have a variational symmetry. Of course, this is now we know we could write this in terms of differential invariance, but that doesn't matter for this part. This is the infinitesimal invariance condition. So often you do the opposite. You start with the Lagrangian and compute the symmetries. The route the physicists take is start with the symmetries and construct the Lagrangians. And of course, Bessel Hagen says we can go to. Course, Bessel Hagen says we can go to divergence symmetries. And as I stated earlier, every divergence symmetry has an equivalent strict variational symmetry. So let me give you an example. Oh, let me first state, know this first theorem. If V generates a one-parameter group of variational symmetries, then its characteristic Q, constructed as in the first part of the talk, is the characteristic of a conservation law of the Euler-Lagrange equation. And what this means is if you And what this means is if you multiply the Euler-Lagrange equations times Q, well, this is actually a sum of Qi, Q alpha times the alpha Euler-Lagrange equation, that that's automatically a divergence. And that's Nerda's first theorem, that this gives you a, so Q gives you a conservation law because divergence of P vanishes on solutions. Proof is basically integration by parts. So the proof goes back to Emmy. So, the proof goes back to Emmy Noer, and it's just an inspired integration by parts. One would say many proofs in PDE are basically integration by parts. All right, so now let me give you an example. So this is an example from Nerda's paper. And it's very interesting, as I realized recently, not the first time I read the paper. I think I skipped over the example. Let's take the one-dimensional free. Let's take the one-dimensional free particle, the simplest possible Lagrangian. So, u is a function of t, u is displacement of a mass in one dimension. I'm going to take the mass to be unit mass, so there's no m's running around, at least not at the beginning. Okay, the Eul-Lagrange equation is, of course, utt is zero. I think we can all solve that. I'm not going to solve it for you. There is a one-parameter group of Galilean symmetries by going to a moving coordinate frame. So, Novella noted this. Coordinate frame. So noted this. Of course, there's other symmetries. This equation has a lot of symmetries, but let's focus on this one. Okay, what's the prolonged action? So that's easy to compute. In fact, I don't even, I can go to the infinitesimal generator, but I can compute it directly. So the velocity gets translated by epsilon, and the acceleration and higher order derivatives all remain fixed. So they're differential invariants. Okay, the Lagrangian is not strictly. The Lagrangian is not strictly invariant under this group. It's only divergence invariant because if you replace ut by ut plus epsilon and square it, you get some extra terms, but it's the same a half ut squared plus a divergence. Okay, and there's the conservation law that basically says the center of the mass moves in a linearly. Okay, so this is a divergence invariant Lagrangian. Convergence invariant Lagrangian. How do you get a strictly invariance? It turns out the nurse showed there's a trick. Okay, well, we're going to put the trick in a more general context before the end of the talk, but let's just do the trick now. So the differential invariants for this, I mentioned utt and its higher derivatives were all differential invariants. T is, of course, an invariant, and the one other invariant is ut minus u over t. So I'm going to what I call invariantize the variant. Of what I call invariantize the variational principle. No, the didn't call it that, but she did introduce this and use this as an alternative variational principle for the free particle, a half quantity ut minus u over t squared. We'll ignore the fact that there's a singularity at zero. The invariantized Lagrangian is now strictly Galilean invariant. Okay? And that's a direct calculation. Well, it's because it basically depends on the differential. Because it basically depends on the differential invariance, as in up here. The other thing to notice is the standard physical Lagrangian for the free particle and this one differ by a divergence. So they have exactly the same Euler-Lagrange equations. So whenever two Lagrangians differ by a divergence, the Euler-Lagrange equations are the same. Okay, according to Lee's theorem, here is the most general strictly Galilean invariant variational problem. Lay an invariant variational problem. It involves t and v, which I'm using to denote u t minus u over t, this differential invariant, and all the higher order differential invariants. Suppose f only depended on v as an example, then the Euler-Lagrange equation is much more complicated than just ut equals zero, except in the special case when f is a quadratic function of v. Okay, if it's a quadratic function of v, the b ends up. Of v, the b ends up being zero, and you just get utt is zero. But in general, you get this non-linear ODE for u as a function of t, but you can actually integrate it. And here's the solution. It gives you v implicitly in terms of t, and it's a non-linear motion. So you can da da da da da, you can go through and do it. In particular, if f is a half v squared, then you're back to the standard linear motion. But this motion for the general Galilean invariant. For the general Galilean invariant first-order Lagrangian is non-linear. Okay. Okay. So here's an argument that it matters which invariant variational problem principle you choose for your physics. The physics of the nonlinear one and the quadratic one, or the non-quadratic and the quadratic ones, are very different. Even though they still have the same conservation law. Same conservation law, this single conservation law. Okay, let's extend. Let's see. I think I still have, oh, I mean, I go till 9:15, correct? Is that right? Well, if I don't hear anything, I'll just keep going till 9.15. Okay, for the full Galilean group. So now I'm going to add in translations as well as this Galilean boost in T. Now things get much more interesting. Now, things get much more interesting here. The free particle Lagrangian is strictly invariant under the translations, but divergence invariant under the Galilean boost. On the other hand, Nerda's Lagrangian, that invariantized one, is strictly invariant under the Galilean boost, but only divergence invariant under translations. Okay, so you can't have both. Well, that's not so clear. Maybe you can massage it even further to get something that is. Conservation laws, there are three conservation laws. There are three conservation laws from the translational symmetries. These are momentum and energy. The third one was the one I already showed you. Okay, now what are the differential invariants of this problem are only the acceleration and the higher order derivatives. So every strictly, so now I'm talking not about just the one parameter Galilean group, I'm talking about the full Galilean group, including translations. Group, including translations. This is the most general invariant variational problem, strictly invariant variational problem. So that comes from Lee. So there are no non-constant, strictly Galilean invariant first-order Lagrangians. Okay, so it's not that we weren't smart to try to get one that admitted the entire group. There are none. That comes from Lee. However, there are divergence invariants. There are divergence invariant Lagrangians. There's a two-parameter family of them. M, you can think of as the mass, so there's the free particle one, but F, you could also have a uniform external force. So these constitute the most general divergence invariant Lagrangians. And I'll explain the general theory of this in a second. And again, the physics is going to depend very much on how awful f is. But if f is zero, in other words, we only Zero, in other words, we only have the divergence invariant terms, then we have very simple physics. So, of course, these ones give you this. It's slightly, it's a free particle subject to a constant force. The solution is quadratic in T rather than linear as it was before. And you get the three conservation laws. Okay. So now I want to switch. Now I want to take that example as my inspiration for doing things in general. And I think I still have 10 minutes, so this is good. I have still 10 minutes, so this is good. Okay, so let's start with a generalized vector field and VQ its evolutionary representative. So now I'm thinking much more generally. The divergence invariant under V means that if I apply the prolongation of VQ to L, I get a total divergence. That's Besselhagen. So the Euler-Lagrange equations of that have to be zero. And there's a handy formula for this. Handy formula for this, you can find this in my book, or but it's it predates me. I don't know who was the first to write down this formula for how this, and in fact, whoops, this is how you prove that the symmetries of Lagrangian are the symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equation, because this term, which is the adjoint of the Frechet derivative of Q, whatever that is, it's some total differential operator. So this term vanishes on solutions, and hence you get a symmetry. So I'm going to call So, I'm going to call V a distinguished symmetry of the Euler-Lagrange equations. Remember, there may be symmetries of the Euler-Lagrange equation that do not come from variational symmetries, and they would not be distinguished. So this is the condition that you have a distinguished symmetry, that this equation here is satisfied. And you have a lemma that the Lagrange and L is divergence invariant, which is basically proved up there if and only if V is a distinguished symmetry of the Euler-Lagrange equation. Symmetry of the Euler-Lagrange equation. So you can actually find variational symmetries without knowing the variational principle because you can just work with the Euler-Lagrange equations. Okay, where are we? Okay, so now we heard in Frank's talk the first day about the variational bicomplex. This is the edge of the variational bicomplex. This is what I call the Euler-Lagrange complex. So I need to introduce this, and you'll see why. This and you'll see why in a second. So you start out with total gradient. So these are total d's. So in 3D, this will be gradient curl divergence. And the one thing is the p forms are no, p is the number of independent variables. The p forms are no longer all trivial, all in the image of the divergence. Otherwise, the calculus of variations would be completely trivial. There's the Euler-Lagrange operator, and local exactness of this says that E. Exactness of this says that E of the Lagrangian is zero if and only if the Lagrangian is a divergence. And then, if you want to go on, you can. If you're interested in the question of when is a system of differential equations Euler-Lagrange, there's something called the Helmholtz condition that's also in this complex. Okay, so you start with the total Duram complex, and then you go up the edge, up the vertical edge of the bicomplex to get this. And it's locally exact. I should have put locally there, but anyway, it's exact. Locally, there, but anyway, it's exact if you're on a whole. Okay, so if you so these are all differential forms now, and we'll call a differential form invariant under a Lie group or Lie pseudo group if and only if the Lie derivatives vanish for all V. So this is really the prolonged thing because everything's depending on derivatives as well as the X's and U's. The G-invariant Euler-Lagrange complex, in other words, you reduce, you restrict to invariant. You restrict to invariant forms for this is no longer exact. There can be non-trivial cohomology. And in fact, you can classify this if G is a finite dimensional Lie group, then the cohomology of the G invariant Euler Lagrange complex is isomorphic to the Lie algebra cohomology of G. So I'm not going to explain what that is, but it's something that's well known in the Lie algebra literature, and it's eminently computable. If you have an image, If you have an infinite-dimensional symmetry group, then these papers give you ways of computing the cohomology that are quite powerful, give you a good handle on whether you can compute it. Okay, so a Lagrangian form is G-invariant if and only if the variational problem is strictly invariant. So this is connecting with the previous part of the talk. The Euler-Lagrange source form is G-invariant if and only if G is a distinguished symmetry. Distinguished symmetry, or it's algebra of distinguished symmetry. And hence the Lagrangian form is divergence-invariant. So the distinction between divergence-invariant Lagrangians and strictly invariant Lagrangians is entirely encapsulated in the cohomology class, if you go back and look at it carefully. And in fact, if we take this theorem of the this is isomorphic to the Lie algebra cohomology of G, it's contained in exactly the p plus first. Exactly, the p plus first Lie algebra cohomology of the finite dimensional symmetry group. Again, if we're dealing with infinite dimensional groups, you've got to compute that directly. It would be very nice to have a sort of Lie algebra cohomology there, but I don't know if that exists. Okay, in particular, if hp plus one of g is zero, then every divergence invariant Lagrangian is strictly invariant. And that was what Nerder used in the original version of her theorem. Okay, so winding up, we're almost done, but I still have five. Finding out, we're almost done, but I still have five minutes. Okay, so if dimension of g is less than or equal to p, p, remember, is the number of independent variables, then hp plus one of g is always zero automatically. So it's only when you have large symmetry groups, meaning the dimension is higher than the number of independent variables, that you can have these examples of divergence invariant Lagrangians that are not strictly invariant. In Nerda's example, original example, In Nerda's example, original example, there was only one independent variable, so p is one. So if the dimension of g is one, then there's no cohomology, and you can always get it as strictly invariant Lagrangian. Her trick works in general, no matter what the symmetry group is. Of course, that's kind of a very easy case, but it's nice to know that this comes out of the general. All right, so let me do an example or two before closing with my provocative remarks. Suppose we just Remarks. Suppose we just do the group of translations, one can compute the Lie algebra cohomology. In fact, Ian Anderson's Maple software is very good for doing this. You just get R. Here's the most general divergence invariant Lagrangian. This guy is strictly invariant, and this is just F times U. Okay, here's a more challenging one. Let's do Galilean plus scaling of time and space, time and space. Space, time and space. So T is scaled, space is scaled, and we have translation and Galilean. So this is this takes a bit more work. Here are the differential invariants. They start out at order four. Here is the most strictly invariant, the most general strictly invariant variational problem. This is the invariant volume form or the invariant one form. Okay, if you go in the computation, you can compute the Lie algebra cohomology. This is not so hard, or you can use soft. This is not so hard, or you can use software. You get there's a one-dimensional cohomology, so there's that means there's a one-parameter family of divergence invariant, but not strictly invariant variational problems. And following the prescriptions in the papers that I cited, this is what it is. You can actually compute it. And the Euler-Lagrange equation is horrible. It's a four to six, but anyway, it's what it is. Probably not physical. Okay, so here's my final provocative remarks based on what. Of remarks based on what I've studied so far. This is a wild speculation and so on, that it may provide an answer to the original question. The original question was which invariant variational principles are physically relevant? Is it just simplicity or is it something else? And I think now it has something to do with cohomology. It's the ones that are divergence invariant, but not strictly invariant. So the strictly invariant ones can be of any high order and have all kinds of Order and have all kinds of bizarre physical phenomena. But the divergence invariant ones, if you look at a few of these examples, not this one so much, that's a bit too much. But if you look at, say, the original Nerd one, where are, yeah, these ones, the divergence invariant part is the physical part. So these provocative remarks are no doubt not true, but it'd be interesting to investigate to what extent they are true. Investigate to what extent they are true. In particular, if the relevant cohomology space is one-dimensional, then there's a unique variational principle that satisfies this property. And so it would be great interest to determine the cohomology for some of these interesting physical groups, gauge groups, et cetera, et cetera. Although I suspect this may be a very challenging computation. And with that, I will finish. There's a bunch of references. And as I said, I'm happy to share these slides with anyone who wants. With anyone who wants.
