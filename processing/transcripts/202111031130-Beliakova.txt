You'll tell us about four manifold invariants from unimodular rhythm categories. Anna, thank you for agreeing to speak. Thank you very much. So I'm trying to adjust here slide a little bit so that it's less a blending. So my topic today are actually quantum invariance of four-dimensional. Of four-dimensional manifolds. And so this topic has a huge history, and I will start just by recording you a result from two-dimensional quantum field theory, which is Okay, sorry, sorry. Okay, so which actually identify two-dimensional TQFT with symmetric Rubenius algebras. So this almost polychlore fact tells us that there is a one-to-one correspondence between two-dimensional TQFTs and this Rubenius algebra, where Frobenius algebra is just so for. Algebra is just for simplicity, say it's just a vector space together with multiplication, unit, co-unit, sorry, commodiplication, co-unit. And this object, so for example, multiplication is a morphism from 8, 8 and so A to A. And I will denote this just by this picture. This is a unit, this is a co-unit, and this is a co-multiplication. And then this morphism. And then this morphism satisfy some relations. So, in my notation, for example, this is just associativity relation. This is a unit relation. If you just flip them down, then you don't get the co-associativity for the co-product and the co-unit relation. And there is one just additional relation, which is a proven relation, which I will not consider anymore. And so, my point of view on the quantum invariant is that, like, it would be nice. like it would be nice also to be able to describe them completely and completely through some algebraic objects and the first steps towards such a algebraization of the quantum invariance was done by Lubashenka Kerla and Hypero where they were considering this category of three-dimensional cobordism embedded into R3 and this category has And this category has as object just natural numbers. And morphism, for example, here from two to one is interpreted as follows. So to an object two, we associate just an one punctured surface of genus two. To an object one, we associate the same surface just with opposite orientation. And this picture here should be interpreted in the following way. It in the following way that so I just remove the cubular neighborhood of this green curve of this green curve out of this cube. And this gives me a morphism from two to one. Composition in this category is given in the following way. So I'm looking, for example, the composition of these two morphisms, and I see that in the second morphism through the handle, there are exactly two. The handle, there are exactly two lines going through. And what I'm doing, I'm inserting these handles, this handle inside of this tube. And then the result looks as it's drawn on the left-hand side. So this is a composition monoidal structure is given just by sticking aside these cubes. And so I will. And so I will, in the following, I will just denote these cubes just schematically by such pictures. And what is nice about this category 3 cup, that it can be described completely in algebraic terms using the notion of so-called pre-modular, oh sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry, forget about this, using the notion of the braided Hoof algebra. hope algebra and who is a braided hope algebra so it's again uh algebra and co-algebra so this means it has exactly the same morphism so you have also relation corresponding to the algebra and co-algebra the only additional morphism is the antipode and this antipode satisfies this relation and my algebra and co-algebra morphism are related in such a way that so So, if I would put here just a flip, so not this crossing, but just permutation, then I'll obtain just the usual notion of Hof algebra. However, I would like to define a braided Hof algebra, and so the difference, the only difference is that in this relation, this relation satisfies this precise braiding here. Braiding here and will not satisfy if we have, for example, changes crossing for the negative. So, this is a notion of the braided hope algebra. And after we have introduced this notion, what one can show is that actually this category of this embedded three-dimensional combotism is actually freely generated by a braided Hof-Algebra object. And this is just object one in my category. And this object one has all structure morphism we need. structure morphism we need to describe this covortism so for example so this uh this picture corresponds to the multiplication uh this is a co-multiplication antiput inverse antiput uh co-unit unit braiding is given by this morphism twists are given by this morphism and one can prove that given this any ribbon hope algebra there is a braided Algebra, there is a graded monomatal functor from this category of 3-COP to H-mod. And actually, what this function does, it sends the object one actually to the adjoint representation. So it's a vector space, it's just the algebra itself. And the action is given by the adjoint action, which is defined. Okay, so my screen is frozen. Let me let me share again. So, you're welcome all to ask questions and to interrupt me. Otherwise, I think I will be very quick through the whole thing. Okay, so this is what I wanted to say. So, for this three-core, you have a braided monomeral functor, which sends the generating object of this category, which is braided Hopf algebra, to the braided Hopf algebra here, which is. Algebra here, which is actually determined by this adjoint representation. So this can be generalized also for all Libert categories immediately by replacing this adjoint representation just by end or co-and, whatever you prefer. And then since 90s, it was a hope actually that if now we assume also that our algebra is finite dimensional, then you have an integral. An integral inside. This integral satisfies something which looks very similar to the QP moves. And then you can add actually closed components. So then you can pass from embedded cobortism to actually all cobortism with connected boundary by adding this additional morphism here, which is actually so. So you will add such so-called sageric component in this video co-bortism, and this will Cobortism, and this will allow you to have not only embedded cobortism but actually any cobortism. So, the problem with this was that nobody was able to show that this category is actually freely generated by something. So basically, the problem was that people didn't know the whole set of relations in this category. So, if you say that it's okay, it's generated as a braided hop file, as a braided model. Hopefully, as a braided monoidal category, say by the object one, then what is the complete list of relations? And so, I think Kerala and Lubashinka even wrote a book on this topic, but still theorem like this, not stated exactly by the lack of the knowledge on the completeness of the set of the relations they could write down. And so, the main result which we And so the main result which we were able to prove with Markom is that so actually if you have unimodular even Hof algebra, then there always exists a braided monodal functor from even a four-dimensional coborottism category, which is which is a category of four-dimensional two-handle bodies, which I'll describe in a sec, to the category of H-model, which Of each model, which where this category is generated, even freely generated by something which is called pre-modular HOF algebra. So I'll also define. And actually, so the generated object is just this one, which is the solitaurus. And the solitaurus is sent again to the adjoint representation. And a nice side effect is that if actually you're Actually, your algebra is factorizable, then this functor factorizes through C-Cop. So, these are our main results, and this is what I will be talking about today. So, let us start with describing four-dimensional two-handle bodies. So, these are connected four-dimensional manifold, which are obtained from the so-called zero-handle. From the so-called zero handle, which is just a cobalt, by adding finitely many one and two handles. So one handles are just D1 times D3, and two handles are D2 times D2. And so the attaching spheres are respectively as 0 times D3 and Solitaurus as 1 times D2. And now usually you consider this manifold up to diffeomorphisms. And diffeomorphism here using this Here in this using this handle decomposition, they are generated just by a zotopy of the attaching maps, handle slides, and creation removal of cancelling pair of K and K plus 1 handles. However, so I would like to consider this for manifolds model with different set of relation. So my set of relations will be called So, my set of relations will be called two deformations, and these are a set of handle moves which restricts to four-dimensional two handle modes. So, this means I will never add or remove handles. So, remove anyway, I cannot, but I will not add handles of index bigger than two. So, this means I forbid canceling pair of index two, three, and three, four. So, this specific So this specific set of diffeomorphisms are called two deformation and the induced equivalence relation called two equivalence. And it's still an open problem if every diffeomorphism can be realized as a two-deformation. So whether this set of two-deformation is a proper subset of the deformorphism. So this question is open. Is open since long time and the answer believed to be negative. And this answer is also closely related to the so-called Andrew Cartes conjecture. So let me recall you. So this is just an abstract conjecture from the combinatorial group theory, which can be formulated as follows. So let us consider so-called balance representation of a representation of a group. So balance means that I have as many generators as I That I have as many generators as I have relations. And let us assume this is the presentation of a trivial group. So this means if I will have all set of tits a move, I can reduce this just a trivial representation, which would be some set of relations, say, so generators, and then every generator is just also, so the relation are equal to the generators. And now, so this. And now, so this conjecture states that actually it's enough to consider a subset of all the transformations, so-called Nielsen transformation. This means only such transformation doesn't change the number of relations. So I can pass from this presentation to the trivial one by only these three moves, which no of those change the number. No of those change the number of relations. So I cannot add the trivial relation. So, because on topological levels, this corresponds to the stabilization. And again, this conjecture is open over 50 years and it's believed to be false, but actually no counterexample is known. And so what we can access is our invariance is not. Can access this our invariance is not exactly this conjecture because, so I mean, topological level, clearly, you can see that this is group as pi one of some two dimensional CW complex. And this would be your one cells, and this relation gives you the attaching maps for the two cells. So, in my context of this four-dimensional two-handle body, what we consider is not two-dimensional complexes, but thickening, four-dimensional thickness. By thickening, four-dimensional thickenings of these two-dimensional CW complexes. And in this four-dimensional setting, so the weaker version of this Andreas Kurtis conjecture could be formulated as follows. So does every four-dimensional two-handle body that is diffeomorphic just to a four-ball actually is two equivalent to this four-ball? So if we have a So, if we have a diffeomorphism, is it possible to reduce this diffeomorphism just to two deformations? So, never, never, never introduce an additional three-handle or canceling pair of two and three handles. So, for example, so this set of Agbolut four balls, so they were first proposed by Agbolut in Hirbin as an example of exotic four spheres. Four spheres and they were realized that they are actually diffeomorphic. Sorry, to four balls, they are diffeomorphic to four balls. But this diffeomorphism includes a creation, a non-trivial creation and removal of these two, three Hanover cancellation pairs. And it's unclear whether it's possible or not to reduce this guy to the To reduce this guy to the four wall by using only two deformations. And just to show you how important for topologies these kinds of equations are, so the pi one of this four ball is exactly this group. And this is a balanced presentation of a trivial group because they are four ball, so even diffeomorphic to the four ball. And now, if for one of these ends, so if there exists One of these answers, if there exists answers that we can show that this group is actually in sense of Andrea-Cartis trivial, then this would imply that every slice not deserable and it will also result this so-called generalized property R conjecture into the negative. And let me recall you that the property R conjecture was Conjecture was proven first by Gabay, and so the conjecture says that if you have a zero-frame node and by Sarger and the node, you obtain S2 times S1, then the node is un-known. And the generalization to links looks as follows: that if you have a zero-frame n-component link and the surgery on this link produces a connected sum of assignments to Swanton. Sum of assigns to Swan MS2, then this link is obtained from zero-frame unlink just by using some handle slides. So all the theorem can be proven. This is actually the result of GOMF that this AC non-triviality is equivalent to implies implies the Riemann slice and generalize properties in conjectures negative. Why is it related to Riemann's lice conjecture? Can you give a couple of comments? It's non-trivial proof. So I can give you a reference. So just remind me, I sent you a link. But it's really gone in two thousand five or something. So here it used it's it's it's so it's it's not like one sentence argument. So you don't see the ribbon here. So, you don't see the ribbon here. No, no, no, I don't see the ribbon. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay, uh, so now let me. So, I think my screen is, I don't know what happened. So, before it was a little bit of a little bit of a drink, Okay, so now let me describe our so this is this is my name for this category of four-dimensional two-handed bodies, and this is a brave monologue category. And this is a braided monoidal category with objects are connected three-dimensional one-handle bodies. Morphism are two equivalence classes of connected four-dimensional two-handle bodies. Again, the tensor product is boundary-connected sum and braiding is given by this one-handle premium similar. So, I will show the pictures in a sec. And so, given this category, so this is again a formulation of our main result that. Our main result is that you have this upgraded monoidal functor which just sends a generating object which is solid towards to that joint representation. And in case H is factorizable, it's actually factorized. So if you just take a boundary of this four-dimensional two-handed body, you obtain a three-dimensional comboism, and you have the invariant G3, which you just the induced invariant. And basically, in this case, Basically, in this case, our invariant, which lives in H mode, doesn't see any four-dimensional topology. And clearly, this result can be immediately generalized to any only module for even category. Wait a sec. Exactly. Exactly. In this case, just the solid draws will be sent to the end of this category. Okay. And so why all this should be interesting in any way? I don't know why my screen always. Okay, okay, so this question: how to generalize quantum invariance to manifold what you mentioned before has the longest history. Has a long history, as I already mentioned. So, for example, to write shadows. So, this is a huge part of his book is devoted to this construction of this four-dimensional invariance. So, the topological construction here based on this matte wave spines, which are two-dimensional polyater, and shadows are like color with polyater with some numbers associated to faces. Two phases and Turayev constructed kind of invariant which is defined for a four-dimensional manifold but actually was shown to depend only on three-dimensional boundary. So the same happens to all these people, to Bruda, to Crane, Yeta, to Roberts, they were using different topological presentations of a four-dimensional manifolds, but all invariant were depending just on the three-dimensional boundary and we have some minor Some minor homological information, like, for example, Euler characteristic or signature of manifold. So then, the hope was that, okay, these all people, they were playing with semi-simple categories or invariants. So, what happens if we go to the non-semi-simple? And this was actually done by October and Missier, 2002. And these people generalizes Hennings Radford invariant to the invariant to the four-dimensional handle bodies and again the invariant was just depending on the boundary. And I think so one of the advantage of our approach is that we have conceptual explanation why it happens and it happens each time if your category is factorizable. And because the people in three-dimensional topology like factorizable category, you actually need them to define the variants, so they should be factorizable. So the main thing which I'm trying to tell you that I'm trying to sell you that forget about factorizing. So, if you would like to care about something for dimensional topology, then factorizable even categories is not what you should look at. And another question which you can ask about our construction is, for example, so exactly, can our invariants see the difference between diffeomorphism and two deformations? And so, assume that they are not the same. That they are not the same, so we don't know, yeah. But in case, if there's two deformations and diffeomorphism are different sets, so two deformations are real proper subset of diffeomorphism, then one can call two manifolds which are diffeomorphic but not two equivalent. This pair of manifolds one could call two exotic pair. Call to exotic pair. And clearly, if we have such a pair, but we stabilize one of this manifold by adding connecting, by taking connected samples as two times d2, which correspond to the adding of three handles. Then clearly after stabilizing long enough, the result will be diffeomorphic. So this is a very typical behavior for Behavior of four-dimensional manifolds that after stabilization, they will give you more. And our invariants are multiplicative with respect to the connected sum. So this means that if our invariant for S2 times D2 is non-zero, then this operation, taking connected sums, this will be multiplied by some constant. And if this constant is non-zero, this means that our invariant has no chance to distinguish these two exotic pairs. To exotic pairs. And actually, what we find out is that this invariant is non-zero if and only if the algebra is cosmi-simple. So this means that already for quantum SL2, you may have examples where this invariant vanishes. And on the other hand, if your R is zero mode. R is zero mod form, so the order of the root of unity for SL2, then in this case, the algebra is also not factorizable. So these are exactly the two interesting cases which we are looking more explicitly at them. And what we find out is an example of two two-dimensional manifolds. So clearly we didn't have a lot of computation, so we hope Sergei will provide at some point. But what we have is that already for this simple four-dimensional manifold. Simple four-dimensional manifold, the invariants, so they have the same boundary, but there's a different four-dimensional manifold with the same three-dimensional boundary, and the invariant is one minus one for one and zero for the others. So this means that already for SL2 at the root of unity, which is zero mod eight, you can distinguish so you so the invariance. So, the invariant sees the four-dimensional topology. Okay, and now I would like to explain some details about construction of this invariance. So, four-dimensional manifold you usually represent by so-called Kirby diagrams. So, this Kirby diagram, they include the usual link component and the dotted component. And the dotted component means so they just represent one handle and the undotted component represent Undotted component represents two handles. And you should consider these diagrams modulus called Kirby moves. So the first Kirby move is just sliding. So I'm taking this component and I'm sliding along the other one. And so by the way, so this annually or solitauri, they can be embedded in whatever way in your four-dimensional manifold. And the other relation which I impose, it's this can. It's this cancellation of the two and one handles. So this is this mode. So this is exactly correspond to the two deformations. Okay, then out of these Kirby tangles, I would like to construct a category. Again, my object will be natural numbers, morphism will be Kirby tangles up to Kirby moves. And then the product is again Yux reposition. Again, Hux reposition, and let me explain, for example, how the identity. So, this is the cubic angle representing the identity morphism. In my previous settings, this was looking like this. So now it's just everything is reversed. So, this is a morphism from one to one. And in the setting I had before, this morphism would look like this. So, on the boundary, so this would look like this. So, this would look like this. And clearly, you can check that if you multiply this guy, so compose this qubit angle with itself, use the cancellation of one, two handles, then you obtain this multiplication, it's actually the identity back. Then this is a braiding in the category of cubic angles. Again, so there is a direct translation to that, to the case we had before. And now I'll And now I'll explain how these kilobitangles are related to this four-dimensional two-handle bodies. So, so it always is so this is a morphism in my case, morphism from two to one. And so this means I'm starting with thickening of just of this picture. So the pictures are all one dimension less. Pictures are all one dimension less clearly. Yeah, so this is just a thickening of the two-dimensional handlebody. So which is three-dimensional handlebody. And so the first step really, you take these pictures and you second this picture, and the number of these one handles here, it corresponds exactly to the number of these dotted handles. Exactly to the number of this dotted component in the QB diagram. And then what you're doing, the next step is that you add a tool handle to this four-dimensional object. And basically, this component here tells you exactly what is the attaching sphere of this two-dimensional handle. And this attaching sphere. Handle and this attaching sphere is drawn here. And I'm just putting the two-dimensional handle along this attaching sphere, and this defined me a four-dimensional two-handle body. So and a theorem, so this is actually the main theorem, so why we were able to prove our results. So it's based on this theorem by Bokshawa Berkeleini, which actually my master's student found. So I was completely unaware of. I was completely unaware of this result. And it's already more than 10 years old. And it was published in a special issue of Journal of Notes Series. So it's a volume like this. So, I don't know, largely over 100 pages. And what they're proving there is that this category of four-dimensional two-handle bodies, which are introduced, and the category of kirbit angles, which are also introduced, that they are actually. I also introduced that they are actually piecesomorphic and they are both freely generated by the braided monoidal, so it's braided monoidal category by one object, which is in this object, it's exactly solitaurus, but this solitaurus has the whole structure of so-called pre-modula of algebra. So again, so don't so this pre-module has nothing to do with pre-module in the right sense. It's a completely new notion. It's a completely new notion. So, we introduced the notion something like BP rebound, BP unimodular, because they were all a little bit different as standard notions in the representation theory of Algerian process. So, and this pre-modula, it's composed out of those of Bobier-Pergalini. Bokshurgalini ribbon and Bokur Gallinio Nimodica. But let me explain you what is the structure in this case. So again, you have a notion of a product which corresponds to this tangle. You have a co-product corresponding to this tangle. You have antipode. You have unit, co-unit. You add the integral and co-integrals and you need a notion of a ribbon element. So these are these are. Of a given element, so these are these are elements, so these are the generating morphisms, and these generating morphisms satisfy relations. And the relations are, so first of all, these are the relation of operated Hof algebra. So all this product, co-product, unit, co-unit satisfy all the relation of operated Kof algebra. And then, so these are relation-related product and co-product with twists, also unit and co-unit with these. Also, unit and co-unit with this and anti-put with twists. So, the most interesting set of relations which really these people found out is a relation with respect to so-called co-pairing. So, Hoff co-pairing is really just double braiding, as we know. And this double braiding can be defined using the Riemann elements and commodiplication. So, this is my notation for this HOF co-pairing. And so, the first And so, first of all, it should be comparing this exactly correspond to this identity. And then, secondly, these two relations, so I would say I have never seen them before. So, these are the two new relations which should be satisfied. And then the okay, couple, couple of other one which I'll comment in sec, but what this relation is. But what this relation says you is that you can express the positive crossing through a negative crossing and a bunch of and four co-pairings of different signs. And so this is also a relation which you may enjoy. And outside of this new relation, so there are requirements that your integral, for example, should be two. Your integral, for example, should be two-sided, so left and right, then it should be an antipode invariant. Also, the same clearly because it's a topological category, so you cannot really distinguish between left and right co-integral and left and right, and also it should be everything's antipode invariant, and it should be normalized in this way. So, this, so, roughly speaking, this is a whole set of relations which Of relation which the generating morphism in this pre-modulo Hof algebra should be satisfied. And actually, there is no, so if you remember the theory, for example, of quantum group, what you usually have is that your integral, for example, is then the left integral, but not the right integral. And you should, and it's also not S invariant. And also. So, what I'm trying to say is that in an example, what we really have is so-called unimodular Even-Hof algebra. And this unimodular Even-Hof algebra is not necessarily satisfy all this relation, which so it's also an algebra which has coproduct, co-unit, and antipode, R matrix that's braided. It's a pivotal element, it's also a Riven element which can be defined using aromatics and the pivotal. Using kromatics and the beetle element. And the unimodal and the unimodularity, it's for us always means that it's finite-dimensional, first of all. And secondly, you have a two-sided co-integral and a left integral. But as I said already, this left integral is usually not equal to the right integral. And in order to still be able to construct the functor, which I mentioned, what you What you need to deform the structures. So, in some sense, you should deform the coproduct, S-matrix, and integral. So, basically the coproduct and the antipode and define a so-called transmutation on this unimodal Hof algebra in order to construct our invariant G4. And let me at least. Let me at least convince you that there are a lot of examples that have all the structure which I just listed before. And so clearly, there are a big set of examples provided by quantum group. And let me just illustrate all these by quantum SL2. So this is a set of generators, E, F, and K. Then you are sitting at the rth root of unity. root of unity and if this r is even then you divide by two and this r prime will give you restriction so you just put e f to this power r prime equal to zero and k to one so this is what you what you get is so-called small quantum SO2 and the small quantum SO2 has an R matrix it has a pivotal element it has a co-integral it has an It has an integral which kills also almost everybody except for the highest powers of e and f. And now, as I mentioned before, in order to construct our functor, what you actually should consider is not h so with a left action, say, but with the adjoint action. And in order to get out of this Of this adjoint representation, braided Hoff algebra, you need to replace antipod by this antipod truncated with the armatics and the coproduct with this picture. And this is exactly, so if you remember how the universal invariant is defined, this is exactly what is correspond to the universal invariant, which, for example, for the S matrix, so sorry, for the matrix. So sorry, which corresponds to this picture. And so this adjoint representation together with this structure of the Bradley-Hoff algebra actually give you the invariant G4, where you just really say the whole structure on the left-hand side to the corresponding structure on the right-hand side. So that's basically everything I wanted to tell you. Perhaps I just remind you how the functor is constructed. So before I was just drawing picture all the time. And actually, so each time if you see such a picture in order to define the invariant, what you're doing, you're putting the, so your R matrix splits as up. R matrix splits as R prime and the R2 prime, and you're putting left and right as R prime and R2 prime. If you have the opposite crossings and you exchange this and put the antipode here, then this is probably the most illustrating example. So, if you have one handle and you have some strands which are coming into this one handle, by the way, the dotted component, they're always unknown. The dotted components are always unknown. So, they are so. So, this is a typical situation. This is the only thing which might happen with one handle. And our construction replace this appearance by just this replace just by the ends co-product of the co-integral. Okay, and here you can, you can, so you see actually immediately why if your algebra is factorizable. If your algebra is factorizable, why the invariant doesn't see in four-dimensional topology? This is because, so what happens if you take the boundary functor? So in this case, you trade your one handles for two handles. So basically, what happens, you remove this dot here and you evaluate this close component just with the integral. And actually, if the algebra is factorizable, then the result. Algebra is factorizable, then the result would be exactly what you see here on the right-hand side. So, this is the reason because you cannot see a difference between one and two handles as long as you are working in the factorizable case. However, if you are not factorizable, then this evaluation with the integral may be even zero sometimes, but this guy is not zero and you can compute with it. Okay, and then basically. Okay, and then basically you have so for maxima minima, you insert some again some antipodes and at the end you connect all components everywhere, you move along components, multiply them and evaluate if you have a zero-zero morphism, you evaluate just with integral. And this is a pivotal element which count how many times you have maxima and minima in your diagram. In your diagram. So I think I will stop here, and I'm looking forward to questions. Thank you very much for your nice talk. Please, everybody, ask questions. And Sage, go ahead. Thank you, Anna. This is fantastic. I really enjoyed it. So, this category of two handlebodies is perfectly suited for constructing three manifolds. Namely, these are exactly the Kirby diagrams which give you most general three manifold. And therefore, what you have is four manifolds bounded by three manifolds. So, this leads to a very natural question. What is the simplest example of two different two handle bodies, namely four manifolds, which are different but have the same? Which are different but have the same three-manifold on the boundary, such that the invariant of this pair is actually different for this. So, this is the exact example I started with. So, this is the easiest example I... Sorry, I probably missed it. Somebody knocked on my door right in the middle of it. Here, so, so, here, so, these are just two handles. So, this is a hop pairing here. Yeah, and here it just. And here it's just plus one and minus one frame unknown. Oh, fantastic. That's exactly where I was. Yeah. So they have the same boundary. It's just S3 without, so it's just S3, yeah. And four-dimensionals, these are different, so you can distinguish them by signature, for example. So these are different four-dimensional manifolds. And our invariant is really zero here. Our invariant is really zero here and minus one here. Oh, perfect. Yeah, I'm sorry I missed this. Yeah, thank you so much. So, so this is really what we were looking for. And exactly. So, if you see, this happens if r is zero mod eight. So, this is exactly the case which was kind of mode out and was overlooked by the most people trying to do single construction. Yeah, this is cool stuff. Thank you so much, Dr. Speaker. Yes, thank you for this very good talk, Anna. So you mentioned this very hard question of detecting a diffeomorphism, which cannot be realized by two handle-body moves. What could be a strategy from this concept? Could be a strategy from this construction for this? So, what we are currently doing is trying to compute such things. And so, already to draw a diagram in terms of generating morphism for such a picture, it's challenging. But so, we have now Idrina Bokchimo on board. So, she's fantastic. So, if you would like to produce a diagram. Would like to produce like a diagram and generatic morphism starting from such pictures. So I'm learning a lot from here. And so we have a program. So it's just a brutal computation. So in the case R equal form zero, we could not, so clearly we also just try and difference n and so we had actually easy examples. So I think this one is even So I think this one is even programmed yet, but we had some different examples and we could not find. So the invariants were kind of the same. And so we are looking forward for the higher powers. So like, for example, already the zero mod 8. So these are also, which correspond to this example, which I just explained to Sergei. So I'm really thinking that it's a very genuine. Think that it's a very general construction. There are many, many examples. And one, so actually, these are probably the only known example of potential count examples where the diagrams are known. So there are sometimes some descriptions of some four manifolds which may be considered as a potential count example, but usually people do not provide any diagrams. Do not provide any diagrams. So, therefore, so we have some set of examples. So, mostly from Akbul Woodkir, we got pictures. And so, we now will just try our program on them and try to extend program and try to look for, I mean, what would you do else? Okay. Okay. Yeah, Bertrand has a question, but maybe Sagi, you go ahead with yours. And then afterwards, Bertran. I feel bad since I mustn't already the second one. Did you try to play with knots? And for instance, do you see sliceness on concordance fights through this? Of course, that's a whole big territory to explore, but maybe you see some. I see some first of all it should be always uh it should be always a balanced presentation so so you you cannot take just a note yeah you you should have as many one handles as two handles yeah yeah so yeah and and then it's it should be trivial like pi one should be trivial already the restrictions if you if you if you would like to go for this conjecture or So, does it feel any interesting questions about slice-ness and importance, or not? There is still some room. I mean, this constraints. So, you see, I didn't really look very carefully at this GOMF proof, how it is related to sliceness, but so I just was looking at this. So, I was just trying to attack. So, basically, I mean, I mean, where he also could not go farther, it's to prove that this group is AC non-trivial. So this is the main problem. So you need to provide an example of something like this, of some Kirby balance, Kirby diagram, where our invariant would be. Where our invariant would be different from D4. Yeah, and this would, for example, already prove this weak conjecture. And this will be perhaps, so it will not immediately apply this one, the strong conjecture, but it will still give perhaps evidence. Perhaps then you can think about how you can retract your thickening of this too complex. To down to see complex and top 10 and actual counterexamples. So, so this is what we are trying. So, like, look for the slice not. You see, it's not a categorification. We don't have S invariant or something like this. Right, but this is good, actually. That's why I like it. It has no homological algebra basically. It doesn't have what? It doesn't have complexity of homological algebra that we need for the S and so it's much easier. Need for the essence, but also it's much easier in some sense. Some complexity, yeah, because this example, so you just put it on the computer, yeah. But but exactly, but it's doesn't have it's definitely much easier than everything. Yeah, what what comes from classification, exactly, definitely. So, it's basically in spirit of just uh normal Richmond-Drive invariants, yeah, or Hennings. So, this is actual generalization of Henning invariance, yeah. Yeah, that's my life, yeah. Anyway, it's it's It's just for free generalization for four-dimensional manifold, which may be non-trivial. Yeah, so therefore, I think one should definitely look at it. So this moves, really, we checked them. So they are just satisfied, yeah. So it's a huge computation, but it's satisfied. So this one. So it's means and. So it means that you have in mind. Tang, do you want to ask this question? Can you hear me? Yeah? Yeah, it's echo, but otherwise it's good, yeah. Okay, so it's a val question in the special case of UQRSL2 when R is a multiple of eight. Yes. So when the root of unity is a multiple of eight, we know that we can use these algebraic data to construct an invariant of three manifolds with pin structure. So I was wondering if your example, the difference that you have between the CP2 core between the CP2 cos CP2 and bar and s2 cos s2 it was not cannot be explained as a different spin structure on the boundary of the three of their boundary in fact so do you think it's possible that you encountered three manifold equipped with a spin structure exactly but uh the three manifold both of them they're just a three so they don't have any spin structure okay yes thank you Okay, yeah, so thank you. Okay, but this is exactly our next goal. It's exactly to follow all your papers here and like to put gradings in play to refine this invariance with respect to spin C structures on the four manifolds. So this is all what we are trying to do clearly. And clearly, you can also play. So here we were considering this. So, so here we were considering the small quantum group. Clearly, you can ask what happens for the restricted. And actually, for the restricted, you can also define this invariance, even if it's not braided, but this transmutation structure is well defined, so everything is fine. And you can consider the smallest degree zero part of this restricted. And this grading on the restricted will give you spin, just usual spin structure invariance on the level of three manifold. On the level of three-manifold, and some refine which corresponds to the relative two-dimensional cohomology classes on the four-dimensional level. So, this is exactly what we are trying. Clearly, this is the next step. Yeah, so it's the next step. So, if you see that your invariance doesn't distinguish, then you look for the refinement. Thank you very much. Anybody else with a question? Christian, do you have another one? I have another question. Some two-handle bodies, in fact, are present in closed four-manifolds when the boundary is the connected sum of S1 times S2. So, do you think we are not considered closed? We are not considered. Consider closed, we are not considered. So, we always so for us, this picture represents four dimensions, two handle points. Sometimes you have a unique way to add three handles and four handles so that it will be so that it will be closed. But we are not adding this. Yeah, but you may have two different under bodies which you can close with three and four unders. Those are represent. So they represent four manifolds exactly when the boundary is a connected sum of S1 times S2. And then you could ask if two different underbodies representing the same four manifold could have different invariants in the construction. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. It would be interesting to find those. It's not the same problem to factorize to the boundary. The question is, what would be for this specific class of two handle bodies, the factorization by the diffeomorphism of the closed four-manifold that you can obtain here. Can obtain here. Yeah, yeah, I agree. So, so do you have something concrete in mind? It's easy to build examples, then the problem is to compute your invariance. May depend on examples, yeah, whether you can compute. Yeah, you can. I do not have immediately, but it's easy to build the pictures. You played with a presentation. With a presentation of connected sum of s1 times s2 and just do some certain. Yeah, you should play with two equivalents. No, it's not easy. It's not easy to find. It's easy to test a priori. You can test if you have connected sum of S1 times S2, but. No, but what should be what should be four-dimensional? So, I mean, as one times two is just three-dimensional boundaries, so what? Yeah, I don't know. Uh, yeah, okay, no, no, but sure, so there are you could distinguish, yeah. So, we were playing with this uh Mazo manifold and this is quirks, so and so so far we are, yeah. So, I'm really spending time reading Argbolut, and this is not very And this is not a very easy question. Okay. Any further questions? If there are no more questions, then let's thank Anna again for a very nice talk. So we will have a one-hour break now, and then Jörg will take over, Jörg Teschner, and he will lead a discussion on what kind of predictions physics gives us. So nice conjectures coming from physics. This should be quite interesting. So please join again in one hour if you have the time.
