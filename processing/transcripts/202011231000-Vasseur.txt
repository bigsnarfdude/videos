In the stability of finite and low-absolutions for the incompressible Euler. Please, thank you. Thank you, Edward, for the introduction. Thank you to Anieska and Miroslav for putting this conference together during an unusual time, let's say, right? And maybe I could also thank the technician from The technician from BS, because I mean, when we don't see them, when we don't hear them, and everything goes well, I mean, the job is really great. And I think some conferences when it was not that smooth, right? It's not that easy to put these things together. So that's really great. I would like also, before beginning, to acknowledge my co-workers, I mean, my co-laborators here. So this is the first part of the talk. Of the talk is work in collaboration with Misha Bishik from UT, and the second part is Laurent LaFleche, also French Texan from UT who joined the effort there. So I would begin with the beginning, which is introducing. Which is introducing the equation. So I feel a bit bad there because it's hard for me to claim that there is a complex fluid here. I mean, the simplest equation I think that you can think of in terms of fluid mechanics. I'm talking about this incompressible Euler equation. Everybody knows it, right? That means the divergence u is equal to zero. That's the incompressible one. No viscosity is not Davier-Stokes. And I will consider only a situation when you have a smooth initial value. I will talk a bit about that. At this time, I think we need maybe C3 to be C2 alpha maybe, but more than C1 alpha. I will explain why C1 alpha interest in, why I have some interest there. The domain is not important too. If you want to work. Important tool, if you want to work in the whole domain, is fine. I mean, I'm talking about R3, this is for sure, but it can be a torus or even a smooth bounded domain. I'm fine too. But if you have a bounded domain, I would ask for the to put the impermeability condition, right? Nothing get in, nothing get out. So that's basically the situation. And of course, in this setting, I mean, it's still one of the Setting, I mean, this is still one of the fundamental open questions in free mechanics: whether such a solution can blow up in finite time. And it is pretty well documented that numerical prediction for such blows up are very hard to obtain. I will give you some examples. And this was really when we began to work with this with Misha. It was really this kind of question that motivated us. And let me give Motivated us. And let me give you a quick example of this kind of work, of numerical work. Especially the work of Kerr in 1993, which has been refined later in 2005, when he considered the situation of two anti-parallel vortex tubes and showed for this situation do some very refined computation. And basically, he predicted. And basically, he predicted the blow-up for a time which is in the time of his experiment, was something like 18.7. I show you here a picture from their paper. So there are several things that they have measured here. Maybe you can consider the solid line, for instance, which is one of the soup of the vorticity, right? So which is which from Bilkatomaida. From Bitcatomaida, for instance, is known to control the regularity of the solution. And you can see that basically plotting one over the vorticity give you almost a line. So by interpolating this line up to zero, that's how they made this prediction. And this computation was refined by the group of Thomas Ku from Caltech. School from Caltech in 2006. And actually, I'm showing you here some pictures from Thomas School. So, I mean, obviously, this is not the refined computation they did, but they give on top of it this kind of visualization, which I think is pretty nice. So, basically, what you see here, the blue part, is a region when more than 80% of the vorticity is located, right? The vorticities located, right? And you have basically two tube or vorticities like this: one in one direction, the other in the other. And basically, so what you expect is, I mean, what was expecting was that you may have a blow-up because then those two tubes attract themselves. But you can see that even in the time which are not that big, you can see that there's all the simple sharpening, especially the flattening here. Especially the flattening here, which in some way makes some compensation into the blowing-up effect. And actually, what they showed is that the blow-up does not appear at the time that was predicted before. And they were able to put their computation well past that time and still being pretty Precise in terms of knowing that they have the right computation up to this time. And but you can see, I mean, that's that still grow a lot, right? And because actually here is the plot in log-log of the vorticity. So the vorticity increase a lot, but still it's not to blow up, right? And that was it. So basically, we begin to look in at this, and one of the main questions that we had is One of the main questions that we had is: Can we hope to prove something in general that explains the high level of difficulties to obtain those numerical evidence of the hope? And basically the philosophy of a result, of course, I will have to explain exactly what I mean by all that. But so first, the situation that one considers is you assume that you have a solution, initial value. A solution, initial value, you know that it's smooth for a while, and you assume that it is smooth up to a certain time t star when the things blows up. So, and then what we want to show is that actually this solution becomes linearly unstable when t approaches this time. And basically, the idea is to say, well, if you have something which becomes less and less and less and less stable, it means that the closest you are from the line of time, the The more sensitive your computation will be with respect to the initial value because little perturbation due to your numerical scheme will end up having more and more and more and more effects when you converge to the point of time. So, what kind of instability do we consider? Of course, here we have to be precise. So, here is a setting. Size. So here's a setting. So we consider any time before the blowing up time. So that way, up to on this fixed time 0t, you are completely smooth, right? And then there is no problem to consider the summing group generated by the linearization of your Euler equation above the solution V, the solution U. So it means that you're looking at a solution of the following equation, which is just a linearization around the Around the solution U, which is smooth up to on this lapse of time when you're considering it. And what you're interested in is the growth in the L P norm of the semi-growth. So what you this gamma P of T is a function of time now, of course, because for any time we're looking at the growth of these things, for any time t will be bounded, obviously, but we are interesting to the growth. But we are interesting to the growth in time. And this is for each time t, this is the maximum growth in the LP norm for the linear, I mean, for linear equation, linearized Euler equation, and growth with respect to the initial value. So, of course, from the regularity of u, you can show that this thing is bounded. I mean, any smooth Smooth solution is stable. I mean, this basically is an argument of Dipper Moose. I mean, you can see it as an argument a la relative entropy, for instance, right? I mean, something very simple. But what we are interested here is the other causality, is whether you can control the stability, no, whether you can control the regularity by the stability, right? By the stability, right? And here is our theorem. So, basically, what we show is that the regularity that we can measure by the growth in the vorticity in infinity, because again, by Bilket to Maida, if your solution blows up, then this quantity has to blow up at equal to t star, right? This quantity is controlled. This quantity is controlled by this coefficient, which measures the stability of your thing. So this means that if you blow up, then this gamma p of t has to blow up too. And this means that when the time goes to t infinity, to t star, the time of blow up, then you become less and less and less linearly stable in L P. So that's basically that was basically the main result. And then we were interested by more recent results, especially this new prediction of blow-up, this time by the team of Thomas Hu in the case, in the axisymmetric case. So you put the axisymmetric symmetry on the solution, right? And what they showed, actually it was on the boundary for the numerical experiment. For the numerical experiment, and they made some very precise numerical experiments and predicted a blow-up at a certain time. And what is really interesting is that actually these blow-up results are backed up by mathematics studies. So it was put in this context also by Thomas Wu and Chen. Also, by Thomas Wu and Chen in, well, last year, basically, right? And what they've used is a very nice technology that had been developed by Tarek El Gindi. So it's also very recent, when he showed in the axisymmetric case, blow-off for the Euler equation on the initial value, which are C1 alpha. So you see, it does not completely coincide with what I'm talking to because the Into because the value are not, the initial values are not more regular than the C1 alpha, but still it's really striking. I mean, the blow-up is at the vorticity, right? So basically, what they show is that a default of regularity basically on the second derivative, right? On the second derivative, in some way cascades and to up to a certain time t when this This ends up to a blow-up on the vorticity itself, right? So on one directive, right? So that's really, really an amazing, I think, really an amazing work. And so we wanted to do, so I mean, we have from this, there was a very basic question. I mean, we wanted to know if what happens here? Is it because the axisymmetric geometry in some way stabilized the formation of the blow-up? Which could have been the case. I mean, if you think about In the case, I mean, if you think about things, I mean, when you have low-ops, the way you have low-ops or not depends a lot on the geometry. Think, for instance, of a shock in compressible. There is a lot of people working on compressible fluids here in this conference. I mean, if you consider a shock in 1D, this is objects which are very stable. I mean, in the framework that I've put here, you can show that for people one, they are stable. The blow-up is stable. While if you are in 2D, then you have all those convex integration solutions, so that they're not even unique, right? So this means that this is the worst scenario of instability, right? I mean, they are super instable. So symmetry usually can stabilize things. So that was one possibility. Or another possibility is that they really find a way to numerically same thing. To numerically tame the instability, which also, I mean, really, really, really interesting. I would say certainly the third possibility, and I guess with my conclusion, I'm not sure that we have time to conclude. So let's say it right away. Actually, we're not talking exactly about the same thing, right? Because this is the thing that we are actually studying right now, and is to see if we can consider the situation when initial values are just C1, alpha, right? In the situation, it's maybe. Alpha, right, in this situation. It's maybe just that because we're considering more regular initial value, actually, we don't see those things because the answer, I should have said, the answer is that there is the same instability there. And so this is the result here. You see that I put it in a slightly more general setting because actually we consider here weighted norm, right? But if sigma equals to zero and But if sigma equals zero and it's included there, this would be exactly the same result than before. But now, of course, the linearized equation, the linearized equation, we look at it only in the space of axisymmetric function. So basically now we consider, we want to see if there is also instability, but only in this class of the solution. And actually the fact to consider weighted quantities came very naturally, I won't have time to say it, but I won't have time to say it, but it was needed actually in the axisymmetric case. But on top of it, it allows us to give more information and to show that it's not only the solution which is instable, but also the blow-up profile. So what I mean by this is usually in all the studies, I mean, of blow-up in this area, especially in the work of Thomas Hu and El Gindi, mathematical or numerical, usually it involves the control of a local blow-up. It involves the control of a local block profile, right? So this means that they rescale the solution to the variable and they look after blowing up the solution at a certain scaling, they look actually at the big U here. And what they want to know is that, of course, the solution blows up. But if you're with scale thing, what you can control? Can you control your blow-up profile? And if you control it, then you can prove actually the blow-up, right? That's basically it. That's basically it. And you can see that we are even in a we are really in the very general setting when even the blow-up can you know follow a curve. The xt here, zero, is basically following the curve. And the alpha and beta are the coefficients of the scaling of the local block profile. And in order to study this, what we did is that we scaled did is that we scaled the same way our solution to the linearized problem, right? And so they are solution of the very same linearized Euler equation, but now we are looking at the blow-up, at the growth of those Vs exactly in the same scaling as the blow-up, right? And the question is what we can say about that, and what we can say is that as long as you're That, as long as your profile is not trivial, as long as your U carries some vorticity, then you have also formation of instabilities at the level of the blow-up. And these scales that we consider here correspond exactly to a blow-up at the axis r equal to zero, which is actually the original point of view of LGBT. Elgin Dich, the what she was studying there. Um, I guess I have very little time, uh, but I think it's fine. So, um, for me, yeah. Um, two minutes, okay. That's that's fine. So, basically, uh, the idea, the idea is a WKB approach, right? It's to see what's happening at the level of the linear Euler for very Linear Euler for very high frequency. And the nice thing is when you look at this, I mean, this is the WKB expansion. I mean, always what you do is that everything becomes local. Of course, because of the divergence 3, this is an equation which is non-local. But at high frequency, if you look at it, then you just have to solve this big right, testing amplitude.de, and you have a lot of information there. Basically, you keep all the nice stuff: the volume preservation, the LIS. Volume preservation, the helicity, all the, which is a link with the vorticity, but you get it in a local way, right? And you can see that what you want to control is the growth of B of T, which is some way control V, but now it's just a number, it's a no DE, right? And basically what you can show is that you can link this, of course, to the gamma P is basically saying that what you're looking is, you can construct spatial solution very, very, very, very. construct spatial solution very, very high with very, very high frequency, which looks like this growth of beta of t. And you can compare the growth of vorticity with this growth of beta of t. So the growth of the velocity, if you want, when you look at the very high frequency. So that's basically the proof. I should say that looking at this beta of t, so why we can do this? Well again, because we have all the physics which becomes Which becomes completely local along trajectories, and that's what makes things work. And what I should say in the few seconds that I've left is this beta of t really, because it's high frequency, can really be seen as the essential spectrum radius of your linear program. So the instability are not due to eigenvalues, right? It's really due to the essential spectrum. Essential spectrum. That's basically the main things. Nope, anyway. I talked about that before, so no time. I guess I would just say thank you. Okay, thank you very much.
