Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for the introduction. First of all, I would like to thank the organizers for the organization and the kind invitation. And I'm glad to give a presentation in this workshop. My talk is about the delay reaction diffusion equation with the free boundary, and this is based on a joint work. Is based on a joint work with Professor Y Hong Du and Lin Kui Sun. I think Professor Yi Hong Du is in the audience. I will mainly focus on the motivation and the model. The question to ask is how to incorporate the time delay and step Delay and the Stefan type of free boundary into the classical KPP equation. And if we can incorporate these two factors into the KPP equation together, and then whether the spreading speed still exists and what is the joint effect of these two factors on the spreading speed. This is the question to ask. First, let me quickly Let me quickly recall some motivations. The first one is the classical KBP equation as shown in the slide. The nonlinearity is nothing but just u times 1 minus u. So it is known from the classical work, Arnstein and Wernberg in 1978, that there's a huge trigger, hyotrig effect. The asymptotic speed of the spread is 2 square root of f prime 0, and this number is denoted by C K P P. So we know that any zero compactness support initial data starting from this initial data, and finally we will have the expansion, and the expansion is. And the expansion is approximate to two square root of p prime zero times t. And this actually is this limit actually is uniformly for the label in this interval, open interval, 0, 1. And also, this number, 2 square root of 0, is the minimum speed of traveling waves. So this is the very classical, I quickly move to. Classify quickly move to the next one is the KPP equation with the Stefan type free boundary, which was proposed by Yihong Du and Liji Guiling in 2010. And then later, this equation with more general non-linearity was investigated by Du and Lao in 2015. So, in this equation, So, in this equation, we modified the classical KPP equation by assuming population living population lives in domain which is moving. And in the boundary, there is a population loss, always is zero, and the expansion of the domain obeys to this Stefan type. This Steppen type boundary condition. And this here mu plays a rule we will see later. Okay. Be different from different from the Hail trick effect. They found that in this new setting, they found that the solution I sprays successfully or vanishing vanishes, depending on the initial data, this is called the spreading vanishing dichotomy. Spreading vanishing dichotomy in their work. And when the spreading happens, the speed of the speed of the boundary is the moving boundary is non-linearly determined by the following semi-line problem. This is the first equation here is actually also the traveling weight problem, okay, but this is in the half. Okay, but this is in the half line, so there's the boundary condition at zero. This is from the free boundary condition. Okay, and for this problem, there's a unique solution pair. So this is different from the previous one. There's a minimum speed of travel, but for this problem, there's a unique solution pair consisting of C, the speed, and the profile Q. So, the free boundary has the influence on this speed. So, we'll see that the speed is increasing in the coefficient mu in the free boundary. And with the limit, when mu goes to zero, and this has a limit CKPP. So, you will see that when mu goes to infinity, then it's close to the classical problem. While mu goes to zero, we will see that, I mean. Goes to zero, we will see that. I mean, formally see that when mu goes to zero, and it becomes a fixed domain problem with direct boundary condition. Okay, this is the second motivation. And the third one is about the delay equation, delayed reaction diffusion equation. And also, I use the example from the population biology. So we use U to denote the population. A population density, and this population we mean it is the matured population. And how is the maturation age of these species? So the right hand side is diffusion minus the linear death, and the term nonlinear term G is actually the recruitment of the mature population. Of the mature population. And it means that so in time t minus tau, there is a birth after tau time units, and this new bones become matured at time t. So this is the new recruited matured population. And here we assume also there's a KPP structure. Assume also there's a KPP structure that use this function f tel. Ignoring the time delay, we have a nonlinearity minus s plus gs. This is the death. This is the recruitment is of KPP type. And also we have another condition, and this is the so-called the positive feedback. So the delight term we call this the feedback in general. In general, and this is the positive feedback. We will see that this is a very important assumption. Okay, so for this problem, there's also the spreading speed. I use C delay to denote this speed. And this speed also coincides with the minimum speed of traveling waves. And you will see the traveling wave now satisfy this equation. It's a little bit different from the classical KPP equation here. Classical KPP equation here, we have the non-local term here due to the time delay. Okay, so fortunately, we still have the characterization of this speed, unlike the free boundary problem, that is non-linear determinant. This is still linearly determined. And here, the lambda is a solution of this transcendental. Transcendental coefficient, and here due to time delay, we have this additional term here. So how delay influence the speed? We will see that this delay decreases the speed with the limit that when toggle goes to zero, it goes back to the KPB speed. And when togg goes to infinity, you see. When taught goes to infinity, your speed goes to zero. Okay, so this is very natural because if recall that tau is the maturation, if tau goes to infinity, that means no individual will become, no juvenile will become mature because of the toll is infinity. Okay, this for more. For more studies on this type of equation, I refer to some references here. Let's go back, also go back to the question. So the natural question is how to incorporate time delay in a step in type of rebound into the KPP equation. So the background is like, so we know that the population usually Population usually has age. And also, so this kind of age structure will give us the delayed feedback. So this is the reason why we consider this problem. And also during the expansion of the population, there is possibly loss in the boundary front. Okay. So we So we start this study by this growth law for age structure population. So if you were in the, you attended the talk by Professor Jim Michel Rokshov, you will see this kind of equation, transport equation. So we use P to denote the density of the population at time t. Population at time t, location x with age a. And then this Gross law said the change of time is nothing but diffusion and death, linear death. And this diffusion coefficient and the death coefficient, death rate coefficient may depend on the age. Okay. So the next is the biological assumption. This is a biological assumption. This biological assumption is very strict. And we just this very idea. So the species, we assume the species can be classified into two stages by age, mature and immature. And individual time t belongs to the mature class if and only if its age exceeds the maturation time tau. Okay, this tau is a fixed number, we give it. Give it. And within each stage, mature stage or immature stage, all individuals share the same behavior. So we will not distinguish other ages, only mature and immature. And we also assume that the mature population is responsible for the habitat expansion, while immature population, they can move but not contribute to the habitat expansion. The habitat expansion. Okay. With this ideal assumption, then we allocate the total density of the mature population, U, which is the integral from tau to infinity for P. So we assume U lives in the habitat that is moving. So let's say this habitat is. So let's say this habitat is GTHT, and the mature population vanishes in the boundary and extended the habitat by being the stiffen type free boundary. This is the same as the do and links work there. Okay, so this here we already use the assumption that only mature population contributes to the habitat expansion. Hepatitis expansion. So, a scenario that is like roughly we see that the kids will stay with their parents and they do not move to the domain that their parents leave. So, they will stay in this area, but they can move around. Area and but they can move around so moreover we also assume that the coefficient is a piecewise constant because we assume that in each stage all individuals share the same behavior. Then we can see that the derivative of the total mature population respected to time. Population respected to time t is nothing but this. And then by the Gaussian law, this derivative of p respect to t is nothing but these three terms. And then we integrate it, we have the following four terms. So it is diffusion, and this is the death. And sorry, this should be alpha. So the death. Alpha. So the deaths, and then this one is so it means the density of the population at time t location x with age tau. That means this is the newly added adult at time t and location x. And this one is the limit. So biologically, this limit is, we assume it is a zero because no individual leaves for Because no individual leaves forever. So this limit is zero. Then if we can figure out the P T X tau, then we will have a model. So what is this guy? This is actually, as I said, this newly matured population time t. Where is it from? Is it from that? So at T minus total, total time units before. Taurus, four time units before, actually, this part will have age zero. So these two quantities will have a relation. And this relation, I use this evolution operator to denote this relation. That means, so at time t minus tau, we have new bounds, and after time tau unit evolution, then we have Evolution, then we have outcome at time t. So, what is this relation? What is this evolution operator? This is the evolution from t minus to t okay. So, we first assume that the newborns at time t minus to is given by the material population at that time. So, this is use f to denote the birth function. Birth function. So this is the new bounce. Okay. And then we have figure out this evolution. Then we see that during the process of the population growth, actually for the juveniles, it's nothing but diffusion and death. So we have this equation, the We have this equation. The main equation is diffusion and death. And during this process, we have a changing domain that is given by their parents. So the changing domain, so it is minus tau and plus the evolution time because it is changing in the evolution. And in the boundary, it is always. And then in the boundary, it is always zero. So the initial value is given by this new birth at time t minus tau. Then what is the this evolution? This evolution is actually given by this line here. So the whole term, this who term, this whole term is W tor X and T. So this means that after tau time unit evolution, we will have the outcome. And this evolution operator is nothing but this solution operator of this linear equation taking the value at a time value at Paul. Okay, so this is the Okay, so this is the evolution of these juveniles. And then we will see that we already have the expression of this newly adult at time t, then we reach a whole model. So the change of the time, the change of the population in time is not Change of the population in time is nothing but diffusion and death, and the newly adult part. In the boundary, it is always zero and obeying the Stefan type free boundary, and this is the initial data. And for delay equations, we always have the initial data on an interval of time, not a single time zero. So sita is the So sita is the initial time, it should be in the interval minus toll zero, and x is in the also the changing domain there. So where this newly added newly added add-out is the solution of w evaluated s equals tau of the following linear initial boundary value problem. So clearly, this newly added term depends on U in the delayed part, also depend on the to be determined boundary, the domain G and H over a time period T minus tau to T. So therefore, this part is not only Ganglical in space, but also. Only Gangloko in space, but also Gangloko in time. Okay. So for more details, I refer to the work with Professor Yihong Du and the Ling Kui Sun in 2023. Okay, so now let me derive some limiting problems from our model to see the links. The links with some existing work. So, first, if we assume tau goes to zero, that means we do not distinguish the population age. So then we will see that this newly added term goes to F. Then you will become the model by do and link. If taught goes to infinity, If taught goes to infinity, then this part goes to zero. No newly added population. So the population actually goes to zero, and the model actually becomes a linear problem with different free boundary condition. If the diffusion of the immature juveniles goes to zero, that means they do not move, then Then this term will become a local term in space, and it can be explicitly given by this form. And this factor here is actually the survival rate. And the model now is become a local free boundary problem with time delay. And this problem actually we derived before in 2019 with Lingui Sun. And for this type of model, we there we give a compatibility condition for the wear postness. So this has become because of time delay, we need to assume that the initial domain is governed by the domain at zero because this is because our bound our our Of our setting say that the habitat is always growing. So we cannot consider more general domains. Otherwise, we will have issues in the well-posedness. Okay. Another type of limiting problem is Limiting problem is if we let the parameter μ in which is in the free boundary condition. If mu goes to zero, then we will have a Cush problem in the whole line. And this problem is like this. This is a non-local type problem, and G is the Gaussian. Okay, the G is the Gaussian. That is the whole integral part is the newly added population. Is the newly added population of the mature type. So, for this equation, actually, it was derived in 2001 as a population model by Seoul Wu and Zhou. And actually, for this type of equation, it can be transformed into an integral equation. And it was actually, it was studied by Professor. By Professor Odu Dieckerman and the host team in 1979 independently. Okay. Another limit is if it goes to, if we let mu goes to zero, we let mu go to zero, then we will have a fixed domain problem with zero directional boundary condition. And also this term is also the integral part of non-local term is also the new Local term is also the newly added population. And here, this kernel also we have give a can have the expression of that. So, for more studies for this type of equation, I refer to the survey article in 2006 by Stephen Gordy and Zhang Huang Wu. So, this is some limiting system, and also we have Also, we have another one. This limiting system is like this. If we assume heuristically that the boundary moves linearly in time, it's like a c times t for some positive c. And if we introduce the moving frame, and then we also assume that in the moving frame, the solution will go to the steady state. Where goes to the steady state, some steady state. And then this steady state will satisfy the following equation formally. And the first three terms here for the first in the first equation is very familiar for us. So the last term here, so involving some technical Some technical part. And this k is like this. Fortunately, we still have the explicit expression, but it's kind of like complicated here. So I will not go to details about this. Okay. Then with this, okay. Could you wrap up quickly? Okay, one minute? Sure. Okay. Sure. Okay. With this limiting problems, then we will have the dynamics of this model. And this is the verposeness. And also, we need this quadrimon condition here. And then we have the spreading vanishing dichotomy and also the spreading speed of this domain. Domain when the spreading happens, and this speed is closely related to this problem that we mentioned before. Okay, so I move to the last slide. We see that time delay brings a kind of down-local model, and we study it under the condition. Especially the quadratimo monotonicity condition, and it remains unknown if the quadrimon condition does not hold. Okay, thank you. Thank you. See if we can take one quick question, either here or from the audience of Ron. I have a naive question. I have a naive question. I'm not very familiar with delay equations. Does this delay enable the possibility of time-periodic solutions? Yes, it will. That is, if the query monotony condition does not hold. Okay. Okay, that makes sense. Yeah, I can see how that would be more complicated. Yeah. Thank you for the question. Well, let's thank our final speaker. Well, let's thank our final speaker again. Thank you.
