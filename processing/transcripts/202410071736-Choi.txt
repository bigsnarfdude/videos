Um I moved to Canada and I just graduated uh a PhD in Korea in August. So I'm quite a new researcher here. So there's nothing much progress as a postdoc in the University of Alberta. I think that I just brought the different I brought the work during my PhD. Yeah, I tried to put the logo of university developer. So yeah. And which is about the chemotherapy style aggregation model viewed as instability and phase separation. And phase separation. I'd like to talk about some different interpretations about the chemotaxis model with heterogeneous diffusion. So what is heterogeneous diffusion? My PhD advisor, Professor Yong Jong-kim, proposed this kind of heterogeneous diffusion equation. And to verify this equation with experimental data, he collaborated with the experimental lab and Lab, and the experiment is about diffusion of diamond on different patches for different density of acrylamide. So this is not a biological experiment, just a physical, I'll say. So and from the experimental data and the numerical simulation with the same initial data of the experimental data, so they quite match, and this is. Match, and this is quite general progression work which is accepted by the journal American Chemical Society, so it's not a biological field, biological work. But in the frame of this heterogeneous diffusion, I'd like to incorporate this heterogeneous diffusion and I'd like to interpret the chemotexis model with this in this framework of heterogeneous diffusion. Framework of heterogeneous diffusion. So, as you know, some of you are already familiar with the chemotexis model. And the chemotexis model was proposed by Kelly and Siegel in 1970. And they said cells are incapable of precisely sensing the gradient of the signal. But its average behavior can nevertheless reflect the gradient. Reflected gradient with arbitrary accuracy. But here, I'd like to talk about some heterogeneity or volatility of cells. So if cells are at the scarce region of signal, they have an ability to choose to move fast. But when it comes to the abundant region of signal density, they have an ability to choose. They have an ability to choose to move slow. So, this is kind of a heterogeneity driven by the signal distribution, because a signal distribution is a heterogeneous environment. So, just the motility, just choosing the motility at the, depending on the signal density, can naturally induce the directed movement. So, this is basically an idea for kinetic. An idea for chemotexis model. And its mathematical performation can be done with a random model on catches. So, gamma i here, gamma is a kind of a departing probability on your catch i and depending on the signal density. So, if you want to model like repelling chemotaxes or attractive chemotaxes, you can choose the monotonicity of the function, motility function, gamma. Literature function gamma. So here we can think of this equation and we can approximate this equation with this kind of a Fokker-Plantatic diffusion equation. So we can extend it to the continuous space model. So we can think of this kind of a diffusion equation. But as you can see, if you expand this term to first derive, so it naturally increases. It naturally includes the detection phenomena, even though it is derived by a heterogeneous diffusion. So I considered a cell aggregation model with a density suppressed motility. What is the density suppressed motility? It is a, I took a decrease in function gamma. So if there is more signal density, then the diffusion. Then the diffuse diffusivity, gamma v acts like diffusivity. So if you take a decreasing function gamma, if there is more signal, I don't want to leave from the abundant region. If there is less signal, I don't want to move fast. So that's basically the idea I mentioned before in the previous slide. So with this decrease in With this decreasing function, we can expect pattern formation from the chemotexis model with the constant steady states, as the Keld and Sigil did in the seminar paper. So if you have constant solution U bar and V bar, so thanks to the reaction term on Venusian, U bar and B bar should be same. And if initial data, that The density of initial data are the same, their masses are conserved when you integrate this equation, thanks to the Neumann bonder condition. So we can ask two questions. When do patterns emerge from the constant state states from this chemotexis model? And how do the patterns look like? So, this model has been extended. So, this model has been extensively studied with various researchers, and then they, previous studies are done toward a broader parameter regime. But here in 2020, Dr. Michael Winkler proposed the parameter n, which is less than one, which is greater than one. And he did the global existence in time. And I'd like to study about the pattern formation about which. The pattern formation about with this motility function gamma. But I didn't expect any interesting difference between taking of different motility functions because if it's decreasing, just date of the date. So I would expect that those kind of pattern formations is more like a spike type pattern. But when the patterns emerge, When the patterns emerge. So, if you expand this chemotexis model, you can reorganize this equation with this type. And chi is kind of a chemosensitivity depending on the cell signal density. So, I want to define some excitable density set to be for pattern formation to be assured. So, if Sure. So if u bar is the cell density, mean cell density, so we call the mean density u bar, or if we write that because if we have a constant solution, there is. So u bar excitable if the chemosensitivity is greater than one. So we denote the collection of the excitable density set, which is denoted to be an E set. And if, so for pattern formation, So for pattern formation, the initial mean density should be in this excitable density for us to expect a pattern formation. And this is what I was able to obtain. The theorem says that if we have a small enough epsilon and excitement density set, you can expect a pattern formation because it is a constant solution. It is a constant solution, steady solution, is linearly unstable. Other than that, we cannot expect any pattern formation. It goes to zero. So I did the simulation with this instability criterion. So I would expect, yeah, I expect some just the same pattern formation from this chemotexis model because monotonicity doesn't give. Monotonicity doesn't give you any information about the patterns because they just aggregate, and we choose the monotonicity, the present function gamma. But here, depending on the different motility, I was able to obtain two different type of pattern formation. As you can see, if infimum of the motility function is zero, then yeah, it's really typical kind of fun And yeah, it's really typical pattern formation from the chemotaxis model. As time goes by, they form aggregate because the number of the spots is decreasing and the height is increasing over time. But here, I took just the A to be 0.02. 0.02, so the motility function gamma has a positive incimum. But I was able to obtain this kind of a really interesting pattern. They don't grow vertically, they grow horizontally over time. So if you take some excitable density set on initial data, we can observe this kind of aggregation. This kind of aggregation. As you can see, the height of the aggregates doesn't change over time. The interesting thing is, along for a different initial data, the height looks unchanged, even though we have different initial data. So my PH2 advisor named this pattern like hot spot and strike pattern and cold spot. So if we have a kind of So if we have a kind of relatively less excitable density set, we can add hotspot. And in between some bounded excitable density set, we can have a strike pattern. And we can have more and more density. And then we can have a cold spot. This kind of pattern also you can see in the pattern formation about from the Kahn-Hillard equation, which is about phase. Which is about phase separation theory. So I'd like to verify why we have this kind of parents instead of the spike parents. So what I did is, just by considering the steady study problem with this chemotexis model, thanks to the Neumann boundary condition from this heterogeneous diffusion equation, we can have We can have u as a function of v, so we can decouple these two equations to obtain this single equation. As I mentioned before, the mean density, the average population, should be conserved because we started the same initial data. So here we can modify this reaction term by using the gamma. So g of v looks like this kind of function. So it depends on whether a is 0 or not. So if you have a 0, then it's going to be a polynomial function. But if we have a non-zero a, then this looks like the hyper polytangent function. looks like a hyperbolic tangent function. So it is a bounded function. In the case of a is equal to zero, this LET equation shows the kind of spike patterns and this pattern study has been extensively studied by the several researchers including Professor Weming Ni and Duville and Xian Wong. And Duville and Xianglong. But for the case of Postebay, I had to apply some different theory to prove the type information that we got. So I borrowed a separation theory. So separation theory is a minimization problem of this kind of energy functional. So W is kind of a chemical. W is kind of a chemical potential function. So it is sometimes called the Van de Bars potential, and they have a mass constraint. So this kind of a minimization problem is called the phase transition or phase separation theory. And they obtained a there is a global minimizer, unique global minimizer of reversal. Odu reversal. So, and it is a monotone. And if you have a small epsilon, it features like a sharp interface between two phases. And this alpha and beta can be obtained from the chemical potential W. So I borrowed this theory to verify our part patterns, and that is quite new to me. And so, these are some preparations. So these are some preparation for application of phase separation theory to our model. So I'd like you to focus just on this graph of this function. So this function is from the reaction term with the single equation here, there. So if there is a equation, it's equation So, if there is some, there is a unique constant k0, so that if you integrate this function from alpha to beta, it becomes to zero. So with this k0, this single equation has a global minimizer by the previous theorem, the base separation theory. So, I was able to find out the motility function determines the. function determines the alpha and beta because it relates to the chemical potential W and then with this alpha and beta we have a bounded function over time and this is independent of time so as epsilon goes to zero we can find kind of sharp interface phenomena and it goes to a step function To a state function with those alpha and beta values. So, is there any relation between the excitable density set and the untotable from alpha to beta? Of course, yes. If you cannot find any excitable density from the voltage function, there is no such alpha and beta. There is no such alpha beta satisfying the phase separation theory conditions. Conditions. And if we have an excitable density set and it is bounded, then it is included in the interval from alpha to beta. So outside of the excitable density set, you can expect a pattern formation. So there is a, if we take a constant steady state from here, outside E and inside the interval f of theta, we can We can simply think about the constant state state as a stable solution. But here, there is a minimal energy solution about the minimization problem. So it is non-constant, monotone, and stable. So yeah, we just verified the cap information that we got from the weird case with positive A. And then we can summarize. We can summarize this maximum interval for pattern formation from the chemotexis model. And so there is a, if we have a constant steady state within the excitable density set, which goes to some non-uniform distribution, which is exactly this pattern formation. And if you have a constant steady state here outside the cycle density set, then it goes to constant, but there is a stable non-constant. Stable non-constant and monotone solution, state-state solution by using the phase separation theory. So I'd like to explain about this kind of pattern information can be obtained by this different dispersal strategy. Motility function can be explained by different dispersal strategy. So the signal distribution makes The signal distribution makes environments heterogeneous, and so the signal-dependent motility gamma determines the excitable sensitive set for the pattern formation. So, I'll say different signal-dependent dispersal strategies, organisms or animals produce various pattern formations, like we have seen, such as a spike pattern or like plateau-type patterns. So, that's it. Can you discuss the rule of M, Z squared, is in terms of state instability? Yeah. The problem M? Yes. Is it like with large M or small M that will? I don't know if that's about that. I mean, what is the size of this set? Yeah, there is a condition for the constant stress to be unstable. M should be less than this C value. M does just move. Yeah, just M just whether you discuss the case. M just uh whether it is small or not, it should be less than C. Oh, yeah. Did you look, or somebody look for traveling weights for this model? With this exactly same model? Yeah. I haven't. Okay, maybe you should do that. Well, I think because it's the cell aggregation model without population dynamics, so you're right. Yeah, yeah, you need to do the dynamics. But with parameter m, when m is equal to 1, I've seen some paper about the traveling ring solution. When your A value is greater than zero, and you had these kind of plateau patterns. Yeah, plateau patterns. Is the spatial scale of the interface still just like order square root epsilon or something? Or does the A factor in the kind of epsilon from the instability condition this epsilon threshold for epsilon depends on the principal eigenvalue for minus flat fashion. So I think it depends on the It depends on the domain size. That's your threshold for epsilon itself. But when you look at an actual pattern, what determines the spatial scale of the interface? Is it order epsilon as well? All I know is the scale of the interface between two phases is about the square root of the epsilon of the Okay, now it's time for our dinner.
