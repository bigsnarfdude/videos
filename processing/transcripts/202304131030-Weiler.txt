11:30, and then we go for lunch. All right, so it's my pleasure to introduce the second speaker for the day. It's Morgan Vyler, and she'll tell us about PCI Spectrum invariants for DORIC on that forms. Thank you. Thank you so much for inviting me to speak here and to be here. It's been a wonderful conference. Okay, so I'm going to talk about ECH spectral invariants and sort of some ways people have used them, and then in the end, some ways I've used them. And then, in the end, some ways I've used them. Specifically for Toric contact forms, mainly context Toric, which I'll define later. And so, this is a really nice setting in which you can see sort of all the sort of complexities that go into computing these kinds of invariants. So, first, we'll start by seeing how you can see geometric and topological features, such as action and linking in ECH, and sort of explain some of the background. Some of the background, then I'll explain Tauric, the Tauric chain complex, and then I'll talk about some applications myself. Beginning applications due to many other people. Okay, so ECH is sort of a field theory. So what you can do is you can take a closed-oriented three-manifold and you can construct this group. It's a graded group. Or sorry, graded Z module. Or, sorry, created a Z module. And usually we'll use Z mod Q coefficients, so I think for the rest of the talk, we'll probably be doing that. And some homology. And then if I have a cobordism, so X is a cobordism with the boundary. Okay, so cobordism maps and ECH go the opposite direction. And ECH goes the opposite direction that they do in a lot of other theories. So, four manifolds, this is a three-manifold, this is a four-manifold, this one has boundary, and you can get from this a comportism map that is called phi of x, and that goes from the CH of y plus to the CH of y minus. And these are constructed using These are constructed using an auxiliary contact form and almost complex structure on R cross Y. And the fact that that is auxiliary is due to tops. So where does this come from? Well, it's related to two other three-dimensional homology theories that come with Kabordson maps. So BCH of a three-manifold Y is equal to Manifold y is equal to, oh, and I suppose, yeah, so maybe you do the notation, you can see it's a diffeomorphism invariant. Maybe you wouldn't know if it's a diffeomorphism or homeomorphism invariant, but right now you will see that. So this is equal to, so HM is, this is a version of the cyber-Witten model pharmology. And then it's also the same thing as HF. HF plus the opposite-oriented version of Y. This fact is due to Taubes. This fact is due to Holan, Zhuvini, and Honda. And there is a bit of complexity to these isomorphisms. You have to be a bit careful about grading. So, for example, there's absolute gradings, and you can show that they're equal. This is due to the Pinicius Ramos. That they're equal, this is due to Phinicius Ramos on Hengar to RMECH. I think here we need to tols. And there is some complexity about sort of the splitting along spin C structures and splitting along first homology classes that appears here that will be clear in a moment. So, but anyway, this is sort of the moral of the story. And so, if I have these isomorphisms, I mean, one. I mean, one nice feature of ECH is that it was the tool that allowed Kuplihan, Lee, and Tobbs to prove that these two theories are isomorphic, which makes lots of people very happy. But in addition to that, so these three theories all have different strengths, and so it's very nice to be able to see sort of the same information from different perspectives. So Hagar Fleur is easy to compute, and Sefer-Witten is sort of easier to prove. Sort of easier to prove sort of foundational axiomatic properties of. So things like infinite generation or constructing these comortism maps, this actually comes from this isomorphism with cyber written. So there's a lot of strengths that the other theories have that then have versions in ECH, but what can ECH bring to the party? So, for example, you can have your topology influence your rave dynamics. Influence your rate dynamics. Maybe I'll have a sidebar here. So a contact form has a ring vector field. So this induces a ring vector field R, which is completely determined. Which is completely determined by these two conditions. d lambda of r paired with anything is zero and the normalization position lambda of r is one so um this ray vector field is always transverse to the contact structure and okay so there are a lot of um so once you have a vector field you can also always ask questions about its dynamics and it turns out that raid vector fields are sort of I mean Sort of, I mean, in a lot of ways that have been proven and conjectured, sort of really fundamental to topology, the dynamics of the ray vector field. So sort of the main example of this is the Weinstein conjecture, which says that ray vector fields on S3, or sorry, on contact manifolds always have periodic orbits. And this is not true for a lot of, for sort of many other natural and similar clusters. Sort of many other natural and similar classes of vector fields. So, the reason why I brought up S3 is that there's a lot of work maybe 30-ish to earlier years ago about finding vector fields on S3 that don't have periodic orbits. So, things like volume-preserving vector fields, for example, don't always have to. So, the sort of example of a result here is that if you know something about the topology of y, if you get it from computing or some From computing or some sort of axiomatic property of cyber Gwitten, then you can that implies something about the RAM dynamics because this is, so as I'll say, ECH is generated by ray orbits. And I'm going to make this a lot more precise later. So, anyway, if the ECH is non-zero, you have to have ray orbits. You have to have ray orbits. So, some example of this is Thomas's proof of the Weistein conjecture, which says that all ray vector fields have periodic orbits in 3D. So, this is all, everything is in 3D. This is still open. This is still open in higher dimensions, so go for it. The other thing I wanted to highlight is that we can go the other way. So, rate dynamics can tell you things about contact topology and also just topology in general. So, one example. So, one example is that the contact class, so in Hagar floor homology, this is defined using sort of specific types of Hagar diagrams, but here a, you know, very simple definition. And then, sort of, the other thing I wanted to bring up is a result due to Christopher Gardner and Hutchings. Gardner and Hutchings, which I'm going to abbreviate CG. Maybe I should write it at some point. I'll write it next time. That if you have two rape orbits, then you're in a lot of space. Exactly too. Um And so, sort of in this way, this sort of uses this homological feature of ECH called a UMAP, which they can then use to rule out manifolds with two ray orbits that aren't a lens base. So, can you find many orbits more than two? You'd have to ask Michael, who's more of an expert on this, but I think. Michael, who's more of an expert on this, but I think there's some weird restrictions on the contact structure, degeneracy, non-degeneracy, in ruling out three, four numbers, but maybe this is a bold. I don't know. So what's the question? Can you have finitely many that's more than two? It's an open question. Okay, yeah. So the non-degenerate case, you can't. Yeah, non-degenerate, you can't. And then I think sort of the arguments to rule out sort of some small numbers. But yeah. Okay. So we. Okay, so we are happy that we should think about this theory. At least I am. Okay, so what kind of things does it tell us? So there's sort of the field theory object going to give us a little table of sort of three different, or sort of a field theory object, a contact object. And then, sort of, what information we can get. And this will give sort of a very vague sketch of the definition of ECH, and I'm going to go into a little more detail later. So this is a homology theory, so it needs generators. And these are just sets of ray orbits periodic. And sets of rig orbits are, so they have a length, which is the same as their symphlectic action. So I'm going to write that in blue. And then they also have, you can also think about their linking with each other or with other themselves, which is sort of known as the rotation. Number, which I'll define later. This is not, this is right, we earlier in the week talked about rotation number of Legendre knots, and this is sort of a transverse rotation number. Okay, so this is sort of geometric or topological info I can get out of the generators. So homology theory needs a differential, and the differential is given by Is given by, so it's similar in spirit to the Morse differential, which is the differential coefficient between two sets of critical points is a count of negative gradient flow lines between them. So this is some kind of count of i equals one. Maybe I'll write and equals one. So this is the Fredholm index. J homomorphic curves. In R cross Y. So I have a little bit of space next to my pictures that I drew in advance because don't look at these yet, because I didn't want to take too much time. But so these curves, the way they look, so maybe I have some set of ray of orbits. Maybe this wants a double cover or something. And I have some other set of ray of orbits, and I want to know. Set of ray borbits, and I want to know the differential coefficient between them. And so, what I do is I look in, so this is the r direction, plus infinity and minus infinity, sort of this direction is the y direction. And I want to look at j homomorphic curves in r cross y for a nice, almost complex structure j that are asymptotic in some sense that I'll talk about a little more precisely later to these sets of orbits. Sets of orbits. So, I don't know. Maybe you have a cylinder, and then maybe you have some kind of thing that sort of double covers up here. And the ind equals, Fredholm index equals one, this is a number that tells you about the dimension of the moduli space that these pseudo-holomorphic curves live in. So it tells you that you have the right amount to count them. Amount to count them. The J that you pick will be R translation invariant, so that's why you want a one-dimensional family, because then a one-dimensional family up to R translation are sort of the rigid ones in the meanwhile by R translation. So these also have geometric information. They have areas and I think I use this color, they have intersection numbers. Intersection numbers. And one beautiful fact about four dimensions is that the intersections between any of these things are always not negative. So this is four-dimensional intersection positivity of J Molecular curves. This is very helpful. Areas are also going to be non-negative because we picked the right type of J. And then the final The final feature are these covortism maps, and the cobortism maps are also being given by a count of curves, but now I am in a cobordism, so I want them to live in truly rigid families. And this is sort of Um and this is sort of some like completion. Uh so it's not it doesn't truly matter what exactly I'm writing here, but so you have your quarters of x in the middle, and then you want to symplectically complete the top and the bottom boundaries and count index zero j homomorphic curves in there. And these have the same sort of The same sort of geometric or topological properties I can think about as the different terms. Oh, these curves all also have genus. So I'm not going to focus on that in this talk, but especially in the Toric case, there's some interesting papers by Hutchings and Christensen-Nelson, and then another RU paper that Joe and I, her PhD student, Leo did you. PhD student, Leo de Giosia, and some undergrads wrote Kao Ming Ning and Yurong Yang wrote about the sort of genus bounds, but I'm not going to focus on them today. So you can use, you can also think about the genus of these to get information. Okay, so I'll say one more thing sort of about these quantities that I can get out of ECH and then That I can get out of ECH, and then actually, if anyone has any questions now, please let me know. Okay, what type of symplectic coordinates are you considering? Fact weekly. I'm not sure, but I could look it up for you. It'll just be very big right now. Yeah, I mean, it is important, but I didn't think about it questioning. Think about it questioning. Okay, so a couple of facts that I sort of said out loud, but I want to write on the board. So J is lambda compatible. So in particular, J sends the contact planes. Sends the contact planes to themselves positively with respect to d lambda. So J restricted to the contact planes is the contact planes. D lambda, the vector in the contact planes, and its rotation with respect to j is positive. And also j sets in the ring direction points in In the R direction. So, all of these properties together tell us, using Stokes' theorem and intersection positivity, that action, which I'm going to use script A, filters the ECH chain complex and so does linking as long as you As long as you modify it a little bit, but I'll just write also filters the chain complex. So this allows us to define these spectral invariants. So the first thing, these can be defined much more generally, but we're just going to think about S3 today. So a fact, I think the best reference for this is the ECH. I think the best reference for this is the ECH lecture mess. Is that the ECH of S3, when you normalize so that the empty set has greater than 0, is Z mod 2Z star, and 0, 2, 4, et cetera, and 0 otherwise. So knowing this, which is something that That sort of foundational to the rest of the talk. I can define two sequences of numbers. The notation for one of them is something I've just made up for this talk, so it doesn't appear anywhere else, I'm sorry. But it's very natural. So I'm going to define the ECH spectrum. Of lambda is the set of numbers CK. They're an increasing set of numbers, and this is the infimum over L such that ECH2KY can be represented by all generators. Of total action less than L. So, right, so this is a homology class that needs to be represented. So, what this is saying is that in the cycle that represents this, in any cycle that represents this homology class, you always need at least one generator to have, or sorry, you need all your generators to have action less than L. None of them can have action greater than L. What am I saying? You need to have L be large enough so that you can represent the entire sort of The entire sort of some cycle that represents that homology plus. Similarly, there is a not filtration. So this is denoted by f sub gamma. And if I have a finite set of right orbits, so sometimes we use multiplicative notation to denote this. Multiplicative notation to denote this. So there is a raborbit gamma and then some other set of riborbits alpha. So the notation for a set of raborbits is alpha. Then I can filter the ECH chain complex by the number of times I see my sort of special orbit that I've chosen, and then the linking number between gamma and alpha. So remember, alpha is a set. Between gamma and alpha. So remember, alpha is a set, so this is sort of the sum of all the linking numbers of all the components of alpha with gamma. The rotation number, which I said I would define later, this is the soft construction gamma, some shows all those ordinances. Sorry, I first of all didn't finish this definition, and then I think you had a question. Definition, and then I think you have a question. So, you want me to repeat? I don't understand where the pot is. Oh, the knot is so this is going to depend on y, the contact structure, the knot, and its rotation occur. But the knot is real as this is ring orbit. Gamma is a knot that's also a ring orbit. Thank you. So, gamma is a knot that's a ring orbit, and modulo knowing what this rotation number is, this is a function. This is a function on the CH chain complex, and the claim is that using intersection positivity in 2016 Hutchins proved that this filters the chain complex. So I'm going to just use this LK to be sort of the same thing, the smallest F gamma value such that Value such that ECH2K is represented by generators of F value less than this given one. And I wanted to tell you about this rotation number. So the rotation number is the amount by which, well, it's morally the amount by which the By which the derivative of the rate flow restricted to the contact structure rotates as you go around gamma. So what you have is you have a map from the contact structure at, say, gamma of zero back to itself by flowing once around. And this This map is given by the derivative of the rate flow. And if lambda is non-degenerate, sorry, if lambda is non-degenerate, then this is an elliptic or hyperbolic matrix in SL2R. So if this is conjugate to an elliptic, To an elliptic, then the rotation number of gamma is that elliptic matrix. Matrix's rotation amount. So, you know, cosine, sorry, this is very small. Cosine theta, sine theta. So that brings up another hypothesis. Hypothesis, so on this gamma, so this is some elliptic orbit. Any questions about this definition? It was introduced in a 2016 paper of Hutchings, proved to filter the chain complex and be invariant up to these four things. Okay, so the sort of immediate or sort of the things to say, there's several properties that these satisfy that can be used to prove a lot of things. Maybe the most fundamental use is that ECH capacities obstruct symplectic embeddings, or more generally, symplectic combortisms. And the not filtration abstracts some sort of transverse symplectic concordance based on what I erased. So the reason why, so the same arguments that tell you that the action and this not filtration filter, actually filter the chain complex are based on sort of using these differential curves. And you can use the same argument, similar arguments for the cabordism maps, which also use J-Holmor curves to prove that. Curves to prove that combordisms have to decrease both of these things. So if X is a combined subkind of combortism, then the CKs of the CKs of the source have to be less than the CKs of the target. Same with the LKs. As long, so for this fact, right, I need to have a cobordism plus, you know, this really, truly needs to be a cocordus. So there has to be some symphlectic surface that's taking my Taking my knots that I'm filtering by. Okay, let me see how much time. Okay, so I'll say some sort of helpful applications of these invariants. So this ECH spectrum, this depends highly on the contact form, but it was proved in 2015 by Christopher, Gardner, Ramos, and Hutchings, or Hutchings and Ramos, that these recover, you can recover the contact volume. You can recover the contact volume using these. And then K. Erie in 2016 or 2015 used that to prove that generic contact forms have dense ray borbits. So there's no open set that doesn't have ray orbits going through it. And subsequent people have used that to prove a lot of interesting things about dynamics of generic surface symplectomorphism, so like Hutchings and Edmeyer, for example, were here. So So I'll get to some of the other things later. So the point, I guess, is that one point of this introductory part, which is half the talk, is that to know the ECH spectrum and to obstruct cabordisms like this, you have to know the whole chain complex. Whereas for the non-filtration, you maybe don't need to know the whole chain complex because you can weaken the contact form to its contact structure. form to its contact structure, but you do still need to know quite a bit about the chain complex if you wanted to actually compute this thing. And why would you want to compute it? Well that gives you actual bounds on the actions and linkings of your rave orbits. And so one thing you can study is this gadget called the systolic pairing, which compares actions and linkings of rave orbits. So we'll get to that at the end of the talk if we get there. So section two. Okay, so the best studied ECH chain complexes are those of toric contact forms. So these are on manifolds of the form interval across T2, modulo sum equivalence relation. So this can be a, oh, and lambda is. lambda is f of t, so t is this coordinate here, and then g theta 1 plus g of t d theta 2. So depending on what this equivalence relation is, maybe you're gluing the ends of the interval together, then you're going to get a T3 or a T2 bundle on the circle, which were studied by Hutching, Sullivan, and Eli LeBeau. Or you might Or you might get a lens space if this is an equivalence modding out some sort of circles on the ends. So you can get any lens space you want. And the sort of most general version of the ECH chain complexes of these types of contact forms was studied by Khan Choi. And we're going to restrict to a very specific setting. So in our case, you can, if you If you set up the equivalence relation correctly, you can get S3. And the way that you can model these using two-dimensional pictures is you can use the contact moment map of this contact form and represent such a y and lambda as the pre-image of a curve in the plane. So some curve like this. The contact can. Curve like this. The contact condition sort of means it has to be turning in a nice way. And sort of the best thing about this, or I don't know, a lot of good things, is that if I'm at a point, say here, the torus above this point is foliated by rave orbits, and I can actually know the exact direction of that foliation. It's the perpendicular to the tangent to this curve. The tangent to this curve. So I've got my torus, and there's a way to just translate this right over onto the torus above this point and say, okay, I actually have a rate vector field that goes like this, at exactly that slope. So this gives me a really great way to get my hands on the chain complex. You can read off the action and the linking from these pictures as well, linking with the other orbits of the rate vector field. bits of the rate vector field. So what is the equivalence relation? Oh, so okay, if I wanted to get S3, so this equivalence relation is something like 0 X Y is equivalent to 0 X prime Y and 1 X Y. And 1xy is equivalent to 1xy frame. Yeah, you're collapsing some circle on either end, and that can be represented by drawing the contact moment map image. Okay, so the reason why this is so helpful is that once I've computed that there Once I've computed that the rabe vector field, so I'll write this down: rabe vector field is perpendicular to F prime, G prime. That's sort of the upshot of all this. Then I can represent my ECH generators, which are sets of rave orbits, right, using these slopes. And in fact, a very nice way to do this combinatorially is to rotate them all back. is to rotate them all back to the original f prime g prime and lay them all end to end and swoosh them up against the axes, which is what I did here. So this represents some set of rave orbits on this picture that I drew for the okay, so this is like the d theta1 coordinate, and this is the d theta2 coordinate. So this is f, g is this parameterized curve. And maybe I'll pick something And maybe I'll pick something slightly nicer. Like this. And then I can represent a set of orbits as picking just some tori in this picture, above points in this picture, and saying, you know, writing the corresponding ray of orbits, putting them end-to-end, swishing them against the axis. So that picture, for example, I have one of those orbits, I have one that's about. I have one that's about over here at slope negative 1/2. I have one that's maybe here at slope negative 1. And then one at the end at slope 1. So sort of this information is the same as that information. And the ECH index and differential are also very easy to compute from this picture. So here's the activity for the talk if you want to do that now instead of listening to me. You can compute the ECH differential of this and prove that DCH. The ECH differential of this and prove that d squared is zero. So, the way you do it is you take, so okay, so the ECH index is essentially twice the number of lattice points inside these pictures, plus or minus the number of H's. H's are for hyperbolic orbits. These show up in the perturbation of this contact form to be non-degenerate. But anyway, you can still do the combinatorial differential without really thinking about the contact geometry because what you do is whatever you see, if you You do is whenever you see, if you have one of these paths, whenever you see an H, the differential of this path is all the ways to pick a corner with an H on one side or the other, remove it, and then take the convex whole of what remains. So here's an example. If you don't change an edge, you leave the H's. If you do change an edge, you always have one fewer H on the inside than the outside. So this is part of the differential of the original orange orbit. Of the original orange orbit. And then you can run this corner and this corner. And then you can do it all again, and you'll get d squared is zero. So this differential that I've described only works when this picture is convex, but it's an extremely nice differential because whenever I have a, basically whenever I have an orbit that has no, that is fully elliptic, it's closed. Elliptic, it's closed. So I won't explain all the details, but the upshot is that CK is the minimum, so if the moment map image is convex, so if this parameterized curve, f of t, g of t, bounds A convex region in the first quadrant, then CK is actually the minimum of the symplectic action of the orbits represented by paths containing k. K minus points. Approximately K. And LK is the minimum. So this depends on what orbit you're picking, but it's going to be some minimum. So if I decided to have my gamma be one of the endpoint orbits, it will be the height or the width of this path. And if I decided it... Path, and if I decided that my gamma is going to be one of these middle orbits, then it's some combination of the height and the widths of these paths, parts of the paths on either side of that orbit. So I'll just say this is a minimum of a sort of specified linear combination. It's very easy to write down, and I can explain it after the talk. Of widths and heights. Nice. Oh, nice. Okay. So the really nice thing, sort of the very helpful thing about your region being convex is that sort of this minimum, being able to compute C. This, this, being able to compute CK and LK as a minimum sort of goes along with the definition of the spectrum and the not filtration using an infimum. So all the bounds sort of go in the same direction. There are other contact forms I can write down where I'm going to replace this with a max. And in that situation, it's a little bit more confusing, sort of what computing these really means. Because what that tells you is that once I, so Once I, so the, for example, the ECH spectrum says, you know, I need this minimum action to realize the homology class, but when this is a max, that means I've sort of, I need all of the generators to realize my homology class. So things are just much simpler when the form is convex. Okay, so in the last 10-ish minutes, I want to talk about some applications. Does anyone have any questions about this extremely questions about it is extremely quick run through to our chain combo access can it be um I really don't look I really didn't look this up sorry um certainly you want one that has a contact or a symplectic form and then you want d lambda plus to be omega d lambda minus to be omega and To be Unimeda, and I don't remember if you need these to be connected by contact form. I can look this up later. So, okay, so I have worked on two main sort of ways of applying this to our picture. So, the first has to do with this embedding function that Kyler talked about on Tuesday or Monday. On Tuesday or Monday. So I will find it. But that's the exact same picture that he drew on Monday, but with some additional colors. And sorry, the concordance, is it symplectic or is it inelective? Is it symplectic concordance or is symptomatic concordance? Oh, symplectic. Yeah, it has to be symplectic. If I want these inequalities. I mean the the gammas, the gamma coordinates. The the gamma, the gamma portals. Oh yeah, yeah, symplectic. Yeah, because you need to use intersection positivity to get the the um this inequality. Okay, so um, so we're going to have to do it. Okay, so Kyler defined this function. He defined a stabilized version, and I will just remind us of the unstabilized definition. So this is the ellipsoid capacity function, or ellipsoid embedding function. So basically this is telling, you know, if z is 1, this is just the Romov width. And then I can just compute sort of the ellipsoid width of any symplectic manifold as follows. As follows, this is the smallest or the intimum of the values of C, so that E wants Z with the standard contact form symplectically form with the symplectic form on X scaled by C. And when X omega is the standard ball, you get this nice Fibonacci staircase picture due to McDoff Schling. And it's a fact due maybe seven years later to Christopher Gardner. If the boundary of x is one of these convex convex toric gadgets, so I can represent it with a picture like this where the curve is convex. picture like this where the curve is convex, or the curve is the region the curve bounds is convex, then actually c of x omega at z is equal to the supremum over k of the ratios and capacities of the ellipsoid and my x. So this is a really, this can be very helpful when you're trying to estimate these functions. When you're trying to estimate these functions, it's very hard to compute closed formulas for these capacities, just because, or sorry, spectral numbers, because, and I didn't define this actually, CK. So CK of a symplectic manifold or one of these domains, which in this case are global domains with a contact boundary, are just exactly the same as the spectral numbers of the. Spectral numbers of the battery. So it's probably not possible, almost ever, to get a closed formula for these. But what you can do is compute a lot of them. So I wrote down here sort of the parts of this function that are being contributed to by the different ECH capacities. So these different ratios. If you take the rate for Z between 1 and 4, Between 1 and 4, if you take the ratio of the second capacities, you actually get the value of this function. Between 4 and 25 fourths, you take k equals 5. Between 25 fourths and some number bigger than 13 halves, you take k equals 20 and you can keep going. And so this fact was used by Christopher Gardner, Holmendini. Here is to find a bunch more infinite staircases. There's been other work by other people on infinite staircases since then, but they sort of provided a blueprint for which manifolds should have, which of these functions should have infinite staircases like this and which ones shouldn't. So most of them don't, and they, in fact, conjecture, you have a conjectural set of ones which do and ones which don't. And there's also, so there's some work by Usher. So there's some work by Usher a little bit later. So this is, I'm going to put, these are the archive dates, but this had been out, or this had been, you know, he knew about their work first. So he found a lot more of these infinite staircase functions for irrational. So he computed a lot of these on S2 with size 1, or S2 with size 1 times S2 with size B. 1 times s2 is s. And so I'm sort of indicating the symplectic form by putting the areas of the spheres. And he found that there's a lot of values of b that have infinite staircases that hadn't been discovered by these previous four authors because they were only looking at sort of a restricted set of shapes, ones that look sort of like moment maps of symplectic terms. Moment maps of symplectic toric manifolds. And he was allowing moment maps but with irrational side lengths. So together, there's sort of lots of infinite staircases. But still we sort of you know have a bunch of results that say you know there are here are a bunch of infinite staircases here are some here are a bunch of mamples that don't have infinite staircases and recently hopefully this will you'll be able to see this on the archive in a few months or weeks okay. Um so So there is a bi-infinite family of cantor sets of irrational numbers. So cantor sets of a subset of the interval between 0 and 1 minus the rationals. Between 0, 1 minus the rationals. I'm going to call this stare. So that CP2, where the first factor is size 1, blown up. So the second factor has size B. So this thing is the symplectic torque manifold. The symphlectic torque manifold with moment polytope that looks like this. So, this is one, and then I cut off a B triangle at the top. Has, and so the embedding function of this thing has an infinite staircase if it only has V is in stair or V is one-third. I mean, I think technically one-third is in stair, but just One-third is in the stair, just the way I wrote it. And so the point is, all infinite staircases are in these manifolds, which are sort of very simple convex manifolds, convex torque manifolds, with, and you can, sorry, they all have to be irrational. And the way that you can approach a question like this is by computing a whole ton of ECH capacities. A whole ton of ECH capacities. So, because these staircases are infinite, if you want to actually get a hint at the behavior of these staircases, you need a lot of capacities. And the examples that have been studied in the past, sort of maybe you needed, I don't know, 200 to see all the stairs or sort of know what their numerics are. But in order to prove this theorem, we really had to know the numerics of every single, really every single number between 0 and 1. And to do that, you sort of need And to do that, you sort of need maybe at least 10,000 ECH capacities. So you have to compute all those. And the fact that this manifold can be represented with its Delson polytope that has a convex boundary like this means you can compute the ECH capacities of the three-manifold that has moment mapped just the boundary. It's a degenerate situation, but you can approximate it and get, you know. And get, you know, many, many capacities. So I heard the bell, so I'll just say one more application, but I won't go into it too much, and maybe you can ask me after if you're interested. This is also a bit um this is also a bit uh weird because I'm not Bit weird because I'm not, this isn't a situation that uses the E stage capacities of Tauric S3s, it uses Tauric L and N minus 1s. And there's a sort of bunch of other things to say before you can even think about those. But anyway, you can, so maybe the theorem, this was published in 2021, but there's also for again them or Iran on my list. On my website. So if you have a contact form on a lens space and with rotation numbers for the Hopling. So the images of the Hopling under the quotient from S3 equal to Y plus. 3 equal to y plus and some number that's I'm going to call minus y minus plus n. Then you can, just to be quick, there's a, you can always find a ramp orbit with oh, and uh Oh, and this is the standard contact structure, so it induces the standard contact structure. With action over the intersection number of gamma and the page, the annulus page of a standard open book. Actually, yeah, so you can reinterpret this in terms of the linking number with the Hoplink, but less than or equal to. Less than or equal to the contact volume. So, this is a result that's related to finding bounds on one endpoint or the other of this interval called the systolic interval, which sort of measures action and linking ratios. And the hypothesis I forgot to mention, so there's two odd numbers here. So the volume has to be less than the max of these two rotation numbers. And y minus has to be greater than or equal to y plus. So this second hypothesis seems a little bit weird. And you can look at the erratum for more explanation about it. But essentially, this corresponds to being able to Draw a contact form on the lens space as one of these torrent contact forms. So there's a slope here, slope minus 1 over n. You can draw a convex toric contact form on a lens space, sort of extending all the stuff we've talked about about S3, and compute all. And compute all these filtrations, which correspond to this bound, or to the components of this bound. And this is doable in sort of the most general situation. Right, so I said there's this rotation number restriction on the boundary, and this sort of has to do with y minus and y plus. So if I didn't have this hypothesis, I would, by y minus less than y plus, the picture that I would have. The picture that I would have, and I'm not explaining this completely, so if you don't understand it, that's because I haven't explained it. I would have some rotation numbers on the end here, and there's no way I can connect those with a convex curve, right? I have to use a concave curve. And so all of the machinery that we talked about earlier is going to be a lot harder to deal with. And then I guess the final thing to say is this has a relationship to the dynamics of annulus symphony. Of annulus symplectomorphisms via an open book construction. So that's sort of where the motivation for this comes from, but you can also think about it as trying to understand this systolic pairing between right moments. Okay, so that's it. Thank you very much. So I guess this. So I guess this section is going to calculate some of these LKs. Yeah, you calculate the LKs and if you want the intersection number of the page, you sort of have to add the width and the height of these generators. And you can put some estimates on that and the volume will show up. The volume shows up from estimates on the action. And then there's some other terms in the estimates on the action that you sort of cancel out with this. But computing the LKs in Computing the LKs in a sort of red setting is going to be not as not as nice. Do you know any results about obstructions for concordance from us in the ball from the unboxing? Not using the not portrayed on ECH. I think there's only two papers that talk about it, which are. That talk about it, which are Michael's papers introducing it and mine. Joe and I have work in progress computing it for more general torus knots, but yeah, I haven't thought about that. I think that would be, I think there are sort of probably a lot of interesting concordance questions you can think about using this, and no one has yet. So yeah, I would be interested. All right, so next. So let's unwork everyone.
