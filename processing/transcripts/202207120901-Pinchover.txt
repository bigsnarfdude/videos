Second linear operator in divergence form. See here we assume that the coefficients are real, but it's not, of course, not in general. In general, it's not a self-adjoint operator, so I'm entitled to be here. Okay, so it was not a mistake of being here. And so I we assume that uh locally uh Locally, uh it's a nice operator, but you know, when you go to the uh boundary, it might go to infinity, the coefficients, or the domain might be rough. Okay, so this is only local assumptions. Now, our boundary of omega is complete. Boundary of omega is composed of two parts. One is the obeying part. For this we need to assume that uh C one this part is C one portion and relatively open and the Robin boundary condition is given by B U which is given, no, this is a oblique derivative. Oblique derivative of Robin type boundary condition. The other part, the complement of Del Omega, of the Robin part in Del Omega, we shall call it Dirichlet boundary condition, but it's kind of a generalized Dirichlet boundary condition. I will explain it later. I will explain it later. In the symmetric case, P tilde is just equal to P. And we shall call it P P in this case symmetric. And the situation in symmetric is easier. Okay, so what is the notion of solutions of this boundary value problem? Problem. So we look at this problem. On omega we have homogeneous equation PU equals 0. On del Roben we have BU equals 0. No boundary conditions as I said on the Dirichlet part. But the notion of weak solution means that we look on functions which are local in edge one locally in edge one in omega bar minus the derivative part. So the dir the derivative part, you can think of it as a bit part, non-molecular part, and it can be very rough and we don't impose anything near the boundary. So it's in H1, omega minus the omega de reflect. And this is a quite standard definition of weak solutions. And we shall write PBU equals 0 if this is satisfied. And we have super solution if for non-negative phi, this is a test function which has compact support in omega bar minus radius la part. And therefore, so it is zero on the Dirichlet part, yes, or near the Diracle part, and also at infinity. These are the test functions. And if this holds for any such phi, we say that it is a solution, PBU equals 0, or super solution is its more negative. Okay. You don't have to say anything about the Richlet condition? No. It comes naturally, the way you write it? There is no solution, you don't need a positive solution, you don't need any binary condition on the direction part. For example, take the Laplacian in Rn, one is a solution, weak solution. Okay? This is the finished part. In this case, of course, the open part part is empty. Okay. So we say that the operator Pb is non-negative in omega if it admits positive supersolution or positive supersolution. And we denote it by P B greater or equal. Denote it by Pb greater or equal than zero. And now the notion of Hardyweight, what is Hardyweight? Well, Hardyweight is a non-negative, non-zero function such that we improve the inequality Pb greater or equal than zero by subtracting this weight function W. So P means W B is a non-negative, so it admits positive solution. Meets positive solution. And we are interested to know something about the possible hardy waves. The operator Pb will be called subcritical if Pb admits hardy weight. That means that we can improve the inequality Pb greater or equal to 0 by P minus WB greater or equal to 0. So the exist RD rate for Pb. Exist hardy weight for PB. This is a subcritical critical that we don't have such a hardy weight. So just have a for the case of so n omega algorithm C, so this is an example and unusual cushion in other n. Other n. So if n is greater or equal than 3, then you have Hardy weight and basically you have minus Aplacian minus n minus 2 divided by squared, 1 over x squared. This is how to work. And this is not working for the worker. For n equals 2, and this is capsule. So the Laplacian in R3 or more is subcritical, where, so this is subcritical. And n equals 1 or 2, it's technical. We don't have a hardware. Okay. Okay, and now, and this was study a lot, the case of Dirichlet case, the mixed boundary condition is zero. Okay, so let us speak a bit about the symmetric case. So, in the symmetric case, there is a equivalent between Equivalent between the non-negativity of the operator in the sense of admitting positive supersolution or solution and the quadratic form. So this is called Admon Alegretto-Pierpinbling theorem. This was done in the Dirichlet case and in the mixed part. We proved it. Park improved it, that P B i suppose that P B is symmetric, then P B is non-negative in the sense of positive solution if and only if the corresponding quadratic form is non-negative in on the set of test functions. Okay, that means that you have positive solutions, so the subcritical case. So the subcritical case means that we have Hardy weight and to have Hardy weight is equivalent to have this functional direction functional inequality. Correspond to this well-known fact. So in the symmetric case uh uh it's uh standard to call this how the Standard to call this Hadi type inequality. Yes? So the case of mixed boundary condition, Hadi type inequality for the mixed boundary condition is not well studied. There is two papers by Kovacik and Laptev, and Kovacik and And Laptev and Kovacic and Byonolo, where they gave a hardy inequality for the Laplacian on some domains with Robin part non-empty. Okay, so let me discuss what is equivalent to B. Is equivalent to B critical or subcritical. So a P B is subcritical if and only if the operator admits minimal positive relationship. Okay, so in this classical situation, we know that for n greater or equal to zero, less than three, we have positive Reynolds function, but we don't have positive Reynolds function. Tibriel's function in Ln for n equals 1 over 2. On the other hand, Pb is critical if and only if the operator Pbu admits a unique positive supersolution. You have a strong positive Liu field theorem that you have a unique positive supersolution. This can be checked in in this uh situation, n equals one or two, you don't have positive supersolution. positive supersolution except the quantity. This positive, this unique positive supersolution is in fact solution and it is called Agmon ground state. So in the case of n equals 1 or 2, no Robin part, then it's critical and the ground state is 1. Okay? It's not in 2 of course, it doesn't decay, but it has decay, but it has some decay properties non non-growth uh property. Now since we are talking about a non-self adjoint case, uh it's interesting to know that the operator P P is critical or subcritical in omega if and only if the formal adjoint problem Adjoint problem is critical or subcritical. And our aim in this talk is to find, so we are in a subcritical case, yes, we have hardy weights and we would like to find as large as possible hardy weight for the subcritical operator P V. This question originally appears in Originally appears in the celebrated book of Arbon on the decay of Dirichlet eigenfunction. And he didn't give an answer how to do it. And I think that we gave... First, we gave an answer in the Dinsley case. This was done with Martin Fras and this. And this is there to previous positoc of mine. And now we are talking about the mixed boundary value. Okay. So we would like to find as large as possible Hardy weight, so we shall call it optimal Hardy weight. So what are the properties of optimal Hardy weights? First of all, First of all, the weight, if we subtract P minus W, we cannot improve it by subtracting something else. So we are in the critical case. So we assume that W is optimal. It's called optimal if P minus W B is critical in omega. And therefore, we have a ground state for the operator and the adjoint one. And to say that And to say that it is big, this W is big, meaning that this integral is infinity. So in the self-adjoint case, phi equals to phi star, and it means that in the L2 weighted space, the ground state is not an eigenvalue. Yeah, it's not an eigenfunction. Okay, and this is called in the probability language an alternative case. Language and non-critical case. The positive critical meaning that this integral is finite. The non-critical is that you have explosion and you have this null infinity. Okay, there is another notion which shows that W is big at infinity. So we take away compact. So we take away compact set in omega including the might include also then omega and we look at the best constant such with p minus lambda w be greater or equal than zero. Then clearly it is greater or equal than one because we took away a compact set. We say that We say that it's optimal at infinity if for any compact such compact set, still the best constant is 1. We cannot improve by taking lambda greater than 1 the inequality p minus w greater or equal to 0. In the symmetric case, it means that the bottom of the essential spectrum equals to the bottom of the spectrum, the relative spectrum. The spectrum, the electron spectrum, with respect to W, so you don't have spectral F. Okay? This is the optimality at infinity. For example, take this classical thing, W, say W is 1. Take W is 1. Then 1 is also the bottom of the central spectrum, as we know. Here also. As we know. Here also, in this inequality, this is an optimal Hardy rate because this is the best constant, but it's not only the best constant, it's critical. You cannot improve it by subtracting even weight with compact support. And the corresponding ground state in for the hardy for the Hardy operator is x to the 2 minus n divided by 2. And if you take this integral 1 over x squared, this is infinity. Okay? So this is an optimal Hardy way for the Telescope. Okay. Okay. So of course there is there is no uh claim of uh unique optimum weight. Oh, this is my next that I started to say that there is no claim of uniqueness and and we shall see that we have a family of optimal arguments usually. But we we don't But we we don't have a categorization of such uh a family of optimal artworks. So this is standard definition of green potential. If we have a non-negative function C say with compact support, we take the integer. So we are in subcritical case. We have Green's function for the operation. We have Green's function for the operator Pb, a minimal positive Green's function, and we take the integral, we get positive supersolution. And now the notion of zero at infinity, function that's vanishing at infinity, what does it mean? That it vanishes outside a compact set Which might touch the Robin part, but not the Dirichlet part. So it uh so this we we denote by x tends to infinity Dirichlet, on the Dirichlet part and the infinity, but not necessarily on the urban part where the function might be positive. And we have exhaustion, and what is And what is exhaustion? It's a set of domains, subdomains, which are lip sheets. We ask them to be lip sheets and we exhaust the the omega. So we have two sheets omega. Suppose that this is a Bobenka. the roben part and maybe here also the band part and this this is the tennis left part and we would like to say what is the an exhaustion so we have something this and then we make it better a bigger one Okay? And this is close to infinity, and this is one part of the exhaustion, yes? So we cover the Roman part, but not the radiation part. Okay. And finally, Finally, as you see, we have re exhaust omega bar, but not Librachlip bar. Okay, and the existence of such exhaustion, Lipschitz exhaustion, is not trivial and this is part of the uh our results that does exist. Okay, and now sorry. And now, sorry, now one of the theorems that we have is suppose the following. We are in subcritical case, we have hardy weights, we would like to have optimal hardy weight. So, suppose that we have positive solution, global solution in omega, that's that PBU equals zero in omega, and we assume that u satisfies the following condition, which The following condition, which we I call ancona condition. Let's know why it's an Kona condition. So we have a grain's potential G phi. We divide it by the positive solution. The positive solution is greater in the sense that at infinity it goes to zero. Okay? So for example, take just in this simple example. In this simple example, take g is 1 over x to the 2 minus n, n greater or equal than 3, and u is 1, then g divided by 1 tends to 0 at g phi, yes? So this satisfies the unique function. So now you take the square root of g, g phi. Times u. So you take, so you look at the square root of x to the minus n times 1, and you get this function. Yes? And this, under the Ncona condition, this is the ground state for this W. And W can For this w. And w can be written explicitly outside the support of phi. It's the square, the gradient g phi divided by u squared divided by 4 g phi over u squared. And in this case, it's just this this function, this weight. And and now And now it turns out that first of all it's this hardy wave. It is critical. So this is positive supersolution. The square root of G phi times U is critical and under some further condition it is an optimal hardyweight. So you need some regularity or to assume that it's symmetric, then we can prove that it's symmetrical. Metric, then we can prove that it's an optimal Hardy weight. In the Girlsweg case, it's always optimal Hardyweight. There's no further assumption. Maybe one or two minutes more. Now we can get a family of Hardy rates if we take an optimal Hardy weight for the Laplacian in R plus, call it Class, call it the ground state, say W. W is optimal hardy weight for the Laplacian outlook. And you take this composition and you get W and this is for any Hardy weight on the one-dimensional case you get optimal Hardy weight for the general case. The general case. And therefore, it's not unique. And we can characterize all Harding weights for this special case, of the one-dimensional case, we have a characterization. Okay, I'll stop here. I'm sorry, we run out of time, but is there any question commenting? Curious, probably related to an earlier question. When you posed this in the week forum and you were saying there really weren't any boundary conditions that you were imposing explicitly on the rest of the demo part, just the fact that it's solving this variational problem with certain kinds of Variational problem with certain kinds of test functions, is this not imposing a boundary condition weaken? You see, if okay, so here is the formulation, okay, the weak formulation. The constant here for this classical uh example, simple example, is a is a solution. Is it a solution? Sure. Okay. Okay, I'm just looking at the test functions and no, therefore it's called the DISLA because the test functions are it's just a confusing name, that's it. I'm not sure it's confusing. I'm not sure what's going on. The green function. The positive minimum greens function on nice Pirichle part are zero. Yes? Okay? And therefore it's Dirichlet. So this is one answer. Any other questions or comments? I don't know if there is any one I don't know if there is anyone online that wishes to ask their questions. Is there any questions from the online audience? Thank you. Thank you.
