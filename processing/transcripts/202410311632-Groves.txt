Um this is a kind of Frankenstein talk because it's made of pieces of other talks which I've given, which some of you have heard, but the main result is new. Okay, so some of the things I'm going to say have been said in other talks, so I'll say them quite quickly. So let's start by looking at the setup of Beltrami waterways, which we mentioned a few times at the beginning of the week. So here we have then, how does the dot work? Like this, right? So here we have the So here we have the 3D fluid in a moving frame of reference, and everything's already been non-dimensionalized. So we're in a frame of reference moving with the wave, and you see the depth is here just one, and here you've got the non-dimensionalized surface tension meter. So this C is the dimensionless wave speed. Then you can see the equations here. X and Z are always horizontal in my notation, Y is always vertical. This causes great. Y is always vertical. This causes great fun in the notation later. Okay. You've got incompressibility here. You've got the two dynamic conditions. Nothing gets to the bottom. I think it's to the top. The condition of the Benoue condition at the surface written down here. And the difference, of course, is that the curl of U is not zero, it's proportional to the velocity. This is curl of U is alpha U. And then here, if you define the pressure by this formula, you find that U and P satisfy the Setty-Euler equation. So one of the questions. The SETI Euler equation. So, one of the questions I get a lot is: you know, what about this choice? It's very special. Eric talked about this in his talk. Just for this point of view, I just want to note that you need this condition in order that new and P will satisfy the steady order equation, so you really get a water wave. Okay, so that's the equation we're going to talk about. When I say Beltrami water waves, I mean a solution of that with alpha not zero. Alpha equal to zero is included as a special case, and the result is maybe there as well. And I refer to that as water waves. So I say water waves or Beltrami water waves. Waterways or belt traveling waterways. Okay, so the first thing you do is you look for a trivial solution, a laminar flow, and we've seen that already this week. So the free surface will be flat. When you look for a solution with the free surface flat, then you find this as a trivial solution. So you can see what's happening here with Y being the vertical direction. Basically, you have a flow which looks like this. This at each slice across the fluid is moving in a slightly different direction. So it's got this kind of rotation going on within it. So C1 and C3 are the two components of the velocity potential. They're C1 and 3 C3 because the horizontal directions are X and Z. Yes, great notation, right? So in fact, um I said this before, but the post tax I've been working with have led a peasants' revolt and now I'm in the in the new papers I'm having X and Y horizontal because I'm having x and y horizontal because otherwise the notation gets a bit silly. Okay, so when you write u as a perturbation of the trivial solution star, then the equations just change slightly. Obviously, you get the u star in the equation. So these are new equations. So what you need to remember is v is the perturbed velocity field. Okay, so let's get right to the point. So if you just wanted to do a bit of modeling here, this is what I've Do a bit of modeling here. This is what I've summarized together. So let's have a look what the dispersion relation looks like. I'm going to show it to you explicitly a bit later. But if you look for solutions of this type, you know, you get the IKX. I see here X is X and Z and K is K1, K3 for the same reason that C was C1 and C3. Then they satisfy a dispersion relation, which I will show you later. Just humor me for now. And then what we're looking for is that. And then, what we're looking for is that the wave number zero should be a solution of the dispersion equation. And that is guaranteed if the components of the velocity of the wave look like this. So C1 and C3 are these multiples of C0, C0 squared is given like this. What I want is that 0 is the only wave number satisfying the dispersion relation, and that will be true if beta is sufficiently large. And again, I'll tell you later what sufficiently large means. I'm saying it quickly enough because I want to get to the point. I'm saying it quickly enough because I want to get to the point. Later, I'll give you the details. Okay, and then again, another standard joke in the water wave community: that if you put this expansion into the equations, expand everything in powers of epsilon, equate coefficients, get it wrong 10 times, and on the 11th time you get it right, and you find that this zeta in the Anzatz will satisfy the Kp1 equation. So the scaling is the amplitude. So the scaling is the amplitude is epsilon squared. Everything is long wave in X and very long wave in Z. Epsilon squared is a perturbation of the square of the kind of critical wave number. Is there a typo in a closed one and slide? No. C3. C3? There is no typo, isn't it? C1 and C3 are the same. The line above mark. Oh, okay. This line is correct, that line is wrong. Yeah, I thought I'd done really well getting rid of all the typos. Done really well getting rid of all the typos. It's really obvious here, isn't it? That's the problem. It was too easy for me, you see. Okay. All right, so this is an exercise which you can do. It's actually not that hard. I'm making it so hard. It really is. Okay, KP1 equation. All right. So here are some facts about the KP1 equation, which make my day, because I've been waiting for these results to become available for at least 20 years. So three papers recently by these three guys, young, stars, the KP equation. Stars, the K-P equation. What they showed is that the K-P equation has an infinite family of symmetric lump solutions. Symmetric means symmetric in X and Z, and they take this form. Now, let me say this result more precisely. The only lump solutions have this form. Tau k is a polynomial of degree kk plus 1. It's not just a theorem, it's a polynomial. There's a formula for it. In fact, there are a family of them. And each family contains And each family contains a solution which is symmetric in X and Z. Moreover, the first two, zeta 1 and zeta two, are non-degenerate in the following sense. It means if you take the solution, put it into the KPE1 equation, linearize around it. So this is the linearization around zeta k. Again, I want everything to be symmetric. If you want a solution which is evanescent, Want a solution which is evanescent, goes to zero as x engines, that goes to infinity, the only possibility is zero. This is what non-degenerate means. Now they prove that zeta 1 and zeta 2, the first two members of the family, are non-degenerate in this sense, and they claim that zeta k is always non-degenerate. And I believe this because the construction is done by integral systems theories and Beckland transformations, and you can kind of see how the proof's going to go. And they say that in a false paper, they're going to complete their theory by doing this. However, I'm a card camera. However, I'm a card-carrying mathematician, so we're just going to talk about zeta 1 and zeta 2. Alright? But it's true for the others. Here is a picture of zeta 1 and zeta 2. This is not an artist's impression, this is a plot of the explicit formula. So zeta 1 I've shown you before in my talks. Now zeta 2 looks like two copies of this pasted together. And that's not surprising because that's basically the way the construction works. I'm not an expert on integrable systems, but basically you paste together copies of this. So Zeta 3 will look. Copies of this. So zeta 3 will look like three of these together, zeta 4 like four of them, and so on and so forth. So you have a whole plethora of such waves. Okay, I'll focus on zeta 1 and zeta 2. Here's my theorem. So for statistically large values of beta, and the wave, the velocity chosen in the correct way, you have this correct here. You have a family of fully A family of fully localized sulfurate solutions which are symmetric in x and z, and they are perturbations of the Kp waves. So you see, it's a really good result. You get exactly the scaling of the Kp wave plus a term which is order, uniformly over the whole wave plane. So I don't think you can do much better than this result. Okay, now again, it's true for zeta 1 and zeta 2, and I believe it for all the other zetas. The theorem does not have to be reproved for each of the zetas. It's sufficient to prove it once. I need to say one thing which I forgot. I need to say one thing which I forgot in my excitement over this result. Here, of course, look, I've put all the coefficients equal to something nice. Obviously, the coefficients are going to depend upon the alpha in the problem. So you're actually going to get nasty coefficients here. But the point is, the signs are always the same signs here. So I mean, I've made it wrong to make it easier to understand. Okay? All right. So, what I want to do in this talk is to give you a sketch about how this proof works. is to give you a sketch about how this proof works. Okay, so let's start with the formulation of the Bertomy problem. So here's something which we've seen several times and we all know. So this is water waves. This is the Sakharov-Craig-Sulaim formulation of water waves. So this is when alpha is equal to zero. So what you would do is you would write the velocity field as the gradient of phi and you want phi to be harmonic and satisfied. Harmonic and satisfy Neumann data at the bottom. And this will give you then the first three of the conditions for the velocity field immediately. Complete the system, of course, by saying, okay, let's complete this boundary value problem by saying what the trace of phi should be. And the Sakarov-Craig sort of trick is to say that we can actually formulate the whole problem in terms of eta and that trace by using the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. And the Dirichlet-Neumann operator says, okay, I solve the boundary value problem. Okay, solve the boundary value problem, you feed it with zeta, with chi, and it spits out then the Neumann derivative of the free surface. So the capital N here is the non-normalized normal vector. So it's, in my notation, it's minus eta x1 minus eta z. All right, and then you can write the free surface boundary conditions like this, and the whole of the problem then comes down to solving these. If you can solve, comes down to solving these. If you can solve these, you recover the velocity potential like that. So everybody knows that. We've seen that many times this week already. So the question is, how to do something similar for Beltrami flows? Alright? So I'll just give you an idea how to do that. So this is what you need to know. So first of all, if I give you a vector field, there's this thing called F parallel, which is defined like this. You take the horizontal part, so F1F3. Horizontal part, so F1F3, and then you add the gradient of eta to the vertical part. This gives you a vector with two coordinates. Right, now this is, let me get it right, it is the horizontal part of the tangential component of f at the free surface. It's easier just to use the formula. So this is F parallel. All right, and now, if I give you, this is just a fact now, if I give you a G with two. A fact now: if I give you a g with two components, a vector with two components, you can always write it as a gradient part plus an anti-gradient part. If you want the explicit formulae for those, they're written down here. All right? So, this is what I did with my student Jens Horn. We looked at the Beltrami problem, and we showed you can formulate it in terms of eta. And the variable that you need instead of the traces of the velocity potential is given like this. You take the velocity field and write its parallel. Field and right it's parallel, and then you look at the gradient part, the potential which gives you the gradient part. That's the psychic. Yes, you might think this is a complicated thing, you know, how did I think of it? Well, the answer was I was motivated by these two. Brooke Benjamin, he was my PhD supervisor, he actually got this in an alternative formulation for waterways in one of his papers. It's just difficult to recognize. And then after I'd finally come up with it, I realized it was actually a castro and loung, so I could have saved myself a bit of time there. So, I could have saved myself a bit of time there. Okay, so again, what you do is you take the vector field for the velocity, you look at the parallel, and then you look at the potential, which gives you the gradient part. That's the second coordinate. Okay, they're not going to go through all the details, but this is how the generalized Sakarov-Kraixulin formulation looks in that setting. So, what you do now is you set your velocity field to be the curl of a To be the curl of a vector gradient, and the vector gradient you want to satisfy this equation and this equation, so the first and the third, they will guarantee that you get irritationality, you get the vertronomy, and you get the condition at the bottom. These two conditions, the second and the fourth, are simply to set the gauge, and it's a vector potential, you have to set the gauge. And this last one, yeah, this last one is like setting phi is equal to its trace. Like setting phi is equal to its trace at the surface. So you see what I've got? V is the curve of A, so I'm saying that the curve of A at the free surface, that's V at the free surface parallel, psi is the gradient part, like I said it would be, and the anti-gradient part is given by this. And you say, well, how did you come up with that? And the answer is, it's just the compatibility condition. If you want a solution to this, then the anti-gradient part has to be given by that. This is just a rise to entities. So this is the complete analog. So, this is the complete analog to the boundary value problem which you get in the Craig in the Sakaro-Craig-Sullivan formulation. Now, you might say, well, how do you know there's a solution? Well, you have to work on that, right? It's not obvious this boundary value problem can be solved. But it can be. And the generalized Dirichlet-Neumann operator which you want is called H. This is because it's the first letter after G. And it maps psi to this thing. But this is exactly the same as it was before. It's the velocity at the Yeah, it's the it's the velocity at the free surface dot with n. It's exactly what it was in the in the s in the so-called quick formula, uh Sullim formulation. And the free surface boundary conditions can again be written as two equations posed on the free surface. Again, you don't need to remember the details here, it's just to give you an idea of what's going on here. Okay. So I just want to, this is just to persuade you I'm doing analysis. This is, I'm not going to give you any technical details, this is just to persuade you to. Technical details. This is just to persuade you to talk co-chair. Right? So here's the definition of the Dirichlet Norman operator, the generalized Dirichlet Norman operator we just had, and here are some sort of things you can prove about it. It's an analytic function of eta in these function spaces. It's actually invertible, and its inverse is also an analytic function of eta. And I've written down the function spaces here precisely. And I almost had a heart attack this morning during David Land's talk because he had the dot spaces. You know, he had the dot and the hom spaces. Had the dot in the hom spaces. I don't know, I've got the spaces wrong here, but I've actually got them right. More by luck than by judgment, that kind of thing, but I have got them right. Okay, but the point here is simply, I just want to persuade you that I'm doing proper analysis, I can put everything in a proper functional analytic framework. It's just that, you know, you're not really so interested in that. Okay? In fact, this result of analyticity isn't quite good enough for what I want to do. About the proof, David Nichols explained how to proof. David Nichols explained how to prove it for DNO on Monday. It's the same here. You flatten the domain, and then at the crudest level, you expand everything in a power series and show the power series converges. This is just to persuade you, it really is a generalization. If you put alpha is equal to zero in the boundary value problem, this is what you get. But now, you could put the curl of A is equal to the gradient of phi, which satisfies the boundary condition you had before, and you will find that the generalized Irish linear Neumann operator collapses. Generalized Dirichlet-Neumann operator collapses to the Dirichlet-Neumann operator. So it really is a generalization. Okay, so I'm trying to sell you my formulation here as a proper generalization. Okay? All right. Another thing you can do, so here's the formulation we had before, two equations on the surface, just like in Sakar of Craig Sudem. One thing you can do is you can use the first equation to solve for psi as a function of eta, and then solution Of eta, and then substitute to the second equation, this just gives you a single equation involving eta. So now we've just got a single equation involving eta to solve. Make it sound really easy, right? Oh, yeah, it's just a single equation of eta. It's a super complicated equation. And I'm going to make your nice easy. I'm just going to call this equation J of eta. So all you need to remember is that the water wave equation for Beltrami is J of eta zero. That's all you need to remember to be able to understand the rest of the talk. Okay? The rest of the talk. Okay? So we're oversimplifying it here. And we're going to solve that in a very simple function space, just in some other space H3. Okay. So let's come back to the dispersion relation. I promised I'd show it to you. Here it is. If you look for solutions of that kind, you find that g of k has to be zero, and there is the formula for gk. Alright, so c0 is the kind of unperturbed wave speed. I called it c before, but now I'm Wave speed. I called it C before, but now I'm calling it C0. This is maybe, you know, maybe I could say this is actually the second type. I should maybe have called it C again. Alright? The F which is appearing here is just something like this. So it's just the explicit formula. Now, here's the key thing to understand about this G. Near the origin, so what I want is that k is equal to 0 satisfies this. Near the origin, the thing is not. Origin, the thing is not, it's not even continuous. However, as a function of k1 and k3 over k1, it is analytic at the origin. This is the key observation. I mean, I realized this a long time ago, but if you go back to the KP paper itself, they knew that. I mean, one of those papers cited a lot but never read. Okay, so as a function of k3 over k1, you find that the origin. You find that the origin is a solution of the dispersion equation if you make those choices, which we had before with sine. Really upset me, actually. Okay. And you find that the origin is actually a strict local minimum if beta is bigger than a certain value, which I've called beta zero here. And I've shown it to you explicitly. Again, just to prove I'm really doing something explicitly. Zero is the only solution. Now, this isn't a specific. The only solution, now this isn't a necessary condition, it's a sufficient condition. If beta is bigger again, then zero is the only solution of the equation. So I'm not claiming, this is what I mean by sufficiently large. Beta bigger than B star, beta star means that zero is the only solution. This beta star is bigger than beta zero. So there will be circumstances in which you've got a strict local minimum, and maybe it's not the only thing. The only is not the only. Okay, but we're going to work for beta bigger than beta star, which is the, you've just got zero and nothing else. Okay? All right. Now we're going to be motivated by the KP Anzatz, which we had at the beginning. It's correct here. Minister. I could say this is an exercise to see how you're watching it at the end of the week, whether I got it right or not in each line. But here it's correct. Okay. So we're motivated by this answer. By this ansat, and we know that the wave numbers which we should be looking at are not k1, k3, they're k1 and k3 over k1. This is key to the whole thing. So, and this ansat is telling us that the action in Fourier space is near the origin, but near the origin in k1, k3 over k1 space. So a ball in the origin in k1, k3 over k1 space is a bow tie in k1, k3 space. 3 space. So, this is bow tie, which you've seen before in many of my talks. So, what we're going to do is we're going to do a kind of Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction. We're going to take the equation which we want to solve. Remember, it's just J of eta is equal to zero. We're going to split eta into two parts by taking his Fourier transform, multiplying by the cutoff function of the bolt height, near the Isfourier transform. That gives you eta one. Eta two is the rest. The action is only eta one. So, project the equation. So project the equation j of e to is equal to 0 into two parts in the same way. Split eta into these two parts. Split the equation into two parts. Run the actions in e to 1. Solve the second equation for eta 2 as a function of e to 1 and plug it into the first equation. It gives you a reduced equation for e to 1. I make this sound really simple. That's not so easy to do. Okay, but the idea is simple. The idea is extremely simple. Okay, having got to this equation, then... Then do the Kp scaling on eta 1 exactly and plug it into the equation, and this is what you get out. This is the final loose equation for zeta. So written here in its full majestic glory. So the variable we're talking about lives in a ball around the origin in a space y, which I've written down explicitly here. So again, I want to put a bit of analysis in. You know, I mean, I am a function analyst, so I have to do a bit of it. So I have to do a bit of it. So this is just a space in which Zeta, in which Zeta lives. You do get this awkward scaling here because of the scaling which we did at the top. That's obvious. But you can see the reduced equation has this certain form. And there's a remainder term here. The O underline means I can control derivatives as well. So the point is, it's just this equation plus some perturbation. One thing, if you're One thing, if you're an analyst, you really hate the fact that the space depends upon epsilon, you really should do. But what you can do instead is just replace zeta with zeta on the full space, multiply by a cutoff function, it's completely equivalent, and then you've shifted the epsilon dependence to the variable, and the space is fixed. Anybody who's sane would do that. Okay, but again, just technicalities here, for the analyst. The point here is this is the equation you get when you do the steps which I showed you. When you do the steps which I showed you. Again, here the C of alpha is a constant which depends upon alpha. In the limit epsilon goes to zero, that is the Kp1 equation which we saw at the beginning with the constants here doctored to make them reasonable. They're not these constants, obviously. They depend upon alpha. But you can see the idea here. The reduced equation is a perturbation of the Kp1 equation. That's the point. Okay, I can already come to the climax. We know from what I told you. We know from what I told you at the beginning, the symmetric solutions of Kp1 are non-degenerate in the class of symmetric solutions. The reduced equation also has this symmetry. Get it from the original problem if you track all the steps properly. So now you just apply a suitable version of the implicit function theorem to your perturbed equation, and you will find that the perturbed reduced equation has solutions which are perturbations of. Which are perturbations of the plots I showed you at the beginning, and trace it back to the motorway problem, you get the theorem which I showed you at the beginning. The point here is: I would claim that every step in this method is very simple. Of course, the devil is in the details. The analytical details are quite difficult, it's true, but the steps here are very, very simple. It's a very, very natural method. And it's self-improving. Once these guys actually prove that the higher-order equations in this plethora. Order equations in this plethora are really non-degenerate. The equation will give you those for Beltrano as well. These results are new for water waves as well, for alpha is equal to zero. Okay, let me conclude then with two things. First, a comment. This method works pretty much on any system where any dispersive system which is quadratic and where you get the same dispersion relation as the one I talked about here. Dispersion relation as the one I talked about here. In particular, you can use this to prove the existence of these types of solutions for dispersion KP equation, which Matz talked about in his talk. So you get that by the same method, but technically it isn't so severe there, of course. And the final thing is an appeal to the numerical people. I've given this appeal twice before, so this is the third time. Really? You know, you guys could compute these for. Could compute these for beltrotomy flows. I'd love to see that. And there's a whole family of them now. Last time, my last appeal didn't have this one. So now I've got, you know, my appeal is maybe more attractive now. And they're higher order ones as well to be computed. It'd be great to have some numerical computations of these, also to see how they, you know, these are small amplitude things, also to see how they evolve in time. Maybe just that comment about this. These are still the plots of KP. The ones for waterways, of course, are scalings of these. And once for water waves, of course, the scalings of these small amplitude and long waves in both directions. Okay, amazingly, I've kept the time. Thanks very much.
