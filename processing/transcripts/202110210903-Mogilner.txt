Familiar with images like that, so it all starts at the interface where the genetic material is just this spaghetti ball of DNA in the nucleus, and there's one centrosome. Then, centrosome divides, there are two centrosomes, DNA condenses into chromosomes, so each chromosome is So each chromosome is two sister chromatids, right? And at the center, there's the so-called centromeric region, and those sisters are joining together. Then in metaphase, we have this spindle that I showed in one of the previous slides with two poles and chromosomes all alight. And there's, of course, very clear analogy with Earth. Clear analogy with Earth. There's North Pole, South Pole, and equator, and chromosomes are aligned at the equator. Then in NFA, the cohesion between sisters is broken and sister chromatids are pulled to the opposite poles. And then there's telephase and cytokinesis, and we have eventually two daughter cells in interphase. Interface. So, very tellingly, what this specific diagram is missing is pro-metaphase, the whole stage of mitosis between prophase and metaphase. And in many of the diagrams, it is there, but sometimes it is missing. And why it is missing? It's because this, in a way, is probably the greatest mystery of the mitosis. Of the mitosis, how the poles are eventually connected to the chromosomes. Moreover, how are they connected properly? So from this diagram of metaphase, it's pretty clear that one of the sisters has to connect to one of the poles and another sister to the opposite pole. But of course, errors are possible. So the first, well, maybe not the first. Well, maybe not the first, but the dominant qualitative model of the past few decades was the so-called search and capture hypothesis, which was proposed by Michelson and Kirchner after their seminal work on dynamic instability of microtubles. Instability of microtubules. As soon as they discovered that microtubules in the cell are doing this periodic growth and shortening, separated by catastrophe events and rescue events. The question arised: What is this for? How does the cell harness dynamic instability? And the beautiful idea is that cells. idea is that cell can use dynamic instability to search for chromosomes and capture them. In fact, Paul Breslov mentioned this for another kind of biological process. And so in this case, how this work is this. So I mentioned that there's this centromeric region. On the centromeric region, there are two kinetic cores, each belonging to a similar. Each belonging to a sister chromatid. So, kineto-chore is macro-protein assembly, a large bunch of proteins. It has a microscopic size, just a few hundred nanometers, but there's a lot going on there. For the purposes of today's talk, it's just elastic parts. Just elastic particle. So the idea of the searching capture is that if microtubule grows in the right direction and bumps into the kinetic core, then connection is established. And so then the idea is that what happens, first there's monotelic capture, right? There's one of the kinetic course is connected to one of the poles, another is steel-free. And then there's Free. And then the second kinetic or captured, and we have proper so-called amphiotelic attachments. But you can easily imagine that also errors can be made. So two types of errors. One is syntelic attachment when both kinetic cores are captured from the same pole, right? Or the so-called merotic attachment when one of the kinetic. Attachment when one of the kinetic cores is captured from two opposite poles. And of course, another complication is that multiple microtupils can connect to the kinetic core. So all of this is getting very complicated. And the consequences from this errors, especially meritelic, are pretty dire. The cells can miss genetic material or can get too much. Material or can get too much genetic material, the consequence is unemployed, cancer, death, developmental defects, and so on. So besides huge fundamental scientific significance of understanding this process, there's of course very interesting biomedical applications. So I wanted to first to show you the following. What are the two What are the two principal quantitative questions about the spindle assembly? Is how fast the spindle can be assembled and how accurately it can be assembled. And modeling of this process has a very rich history in the past about three decades, starting from seminal work of Holly and Whitewar in 1994, and a lot of computational work since then. Work since then. So, very recently, we mimicked the search and capture process in just pretty much all known biological details, involving chromosome arms, which are elastic, kinetochores, which are proper size and shapes, and they're deformable, specific molecular links between kinetochores and microtubules. And microtubules, kinases like aurora B and aurora A, and the respective phosphatases, hundreds of microtubules doing dynamic instability. And the question is simply to see what the search and capture in 3D in absolutely proper geometry and with all proper error correction mechanisms built in, can predict. Built in can predict and so the simulations look like that. It's very cool to watch them how these hundreds of microtubules growing around, they actually elastic. They look almost straight in the simulations, but those are elastic rods that can bend. And we simply do this process counting the numbers of corrects and incorrects attachments in the process. So there are two interesting things that surgeon capture predicts. One is that the times at which amphotelic attachments appear are distributed exponentially. So there's this certain time interval during which majority of the, well, not the majority, but Of the, well, not the majority, about half of the chromosomes are being captured correctly. And then you have to wait for a long time for last unfortunate chromosomes to get captured. And this is the very clear and very well-known signature of the stochastic process, right? If basically you have n independent events happening, each of them is Each of them is happening with time distributed exponentially, then you have to wait a very long time for all of the processes to successfully finish. Second interesting point is that even with all the correction mechanisms, which I don't have time to get into, but I'll just allude to one of them. For example, synthetic attachment is unstable. Attachment is unstable because in syntax attachment, the sister kinetochords are not pulled to the opposite poles, and the distance between them is keeping small. And then aurora kinase, which is abundant in the centromeric region, destabilizes the microtubule attachments and destabilizes those connections to keep this chromosome in place, so to say. This chromosome in place, so to say. And there are quite a number of other error correction mechanisms, but even with all of them, at best, what we can do is get two-thirds of the chromosomes properly captured amphithelically. There's still a lot of merotelic attachments, there's some synthetic attachments, and some of the chromosomes are incompletely captured in monotelic attachments. Now, what does actually data say about it? So, what we were missing all these years is where are the spindle poles and kinetochores and chromosomes during this process. And in the last few years, due to heroic efforts of experimentalists, it's now possible to It's now possible to track in three-dimensional space and with very high spatial and temporal resolutions the trajectories of centrosomes and kinetochores in the course of prometaphase. So what you saw is a movie of the spindle where at the ends of this stick there are Stick there are two centrosomes, two spindle poles, right? And each of those other segments is the kineticore, kineticore domain, right? The ends of those sticks are kineticores. So you see it from three different perpendicular points of view. So what you see is that centrosomes kind of start at the south and north pole pretty close to each other. Pretty close to each other. And then they segregate, right? Spindle is elongating, they end up almost at the equator of the cell. And chromosomes that were initially distributed in a certain pancake-like volume around the spindle axis, they start rotating with the With the spindle axis getting closer to the spindle, getting at a certain distance from it. And then, see, all the kinetic or kinetic or axis turn more or less in parallel with the spindle axis, meaning that the chromosomes are getting captured amphitheaterically. And you also see the elongation of those segments means that the That the sister kinetic course are pulled away from each other, also a signature of the bi-orientation. So of course, it's pretty hard to quantify this data, but what I'll show you is just three important quantitative characteristics of the spindle. So one is the spindle length or pole-pole distance. Length or pole-pole distance. Very easy. Second is also easy, the distance between sister kinetic cores. And the third is also pretty easy. It's what we call the C-tilt angle. It's the angle between pole axis and kinetic core kineticore axis. So here's the time series for one of the chromosomes. This is the kinetic or distance. Kinetic or kinetic or distance, which starts small, the centromere is relaxed, and then the centromere is getting stretched at some point. And this is CTL triangle, which starts relatively large, fluctuates, and then aligns with pole-pole axis. And this is happening more or less at the same time. If you pull the data from If you pull the data from 17 different cells and sketch the KTKT distance and angle, again the picture is very clear. And so we define the event of bi-orientation as follows. Kinetic core, kinetic core distance stretches above certain threshold and C-tilt angle falls below certain threshold and they should stay there. If they keep fluctuating, Keep fluctuating, then it's not called by orientation. So now let's look now cell by cell, what's happening. So cell one, right? So if we take all the chromosomes of cell one, this is the KTKT distance, this is the angle, and you see that chromosomes here. Chromosomes here are not spread, their bientation time is not spread too much. If you look at all the chromosomes, you kind of see that they all bi-oriented around 200 seconds. So all the time is measured after nuclear endolo breaks down. This is the histogram of the times of variantation in this one cell. So see, it's already defined. See, it's already defies the predictions of the search and capture model because it doesn't look like a big exponential tail here. It's kind of roughly the Gaussian, right? Saying that this is more or less a deterministic event. If you take another cell, everything is very similar. However, all the Very similar. However, all the chromosomes achieve orientation much later around like 450 seconds. This is the histogram again, Gaussian looking. And one other big surprise is that all chromosomes are captured properly. All of them in those two cells achieve by orientation, which again defies search and capture theory. It just And capture theory, it's just inconceivable that with random search and capture process, we don't get at least a few errors. In fact, in those 17 cells, we could count something like five or six errors for the whole 17 cells or close to a thousand of chromosomes. So, this begs the question: What's the event corresponding to the maximal number of variantations? So, what Orientations. So, why is it that chromosomes in each cell are synchronized but to different times? So, it becomes clear if you look, for example, in those two cells for the time series for spindle axis elongation for spindle length. So, in cell one, where variantation happens quickly, the spindle elongated fast and they stayed steady. Steady, steady. And in cell two, it was later. So, if we start measuring the time in the so-called spindle elongation time, when zero is nuclear level breakdown and one is the time when spindle stops elongating. Then all the data scales into pretty much one Gauss. Pretty much one Gauss. So it means that there's an almost deterministic event which happens at about three quarter of a time of spindle elongation. At that time, all the majority of the chromosomes are achieving by orientation. And again, it's definitely something like Gaussian, not exponentially distributed event. And accuracy is. And accuracy is very high. So, what is this special time? When we took some random cell and plotted the trajectories of the chromosomes in 3D space. Here, the cold covers are earlier time and hot covers are later time. What happens is that pretty much all the chromosomes move. Pretty much all the chromosomes move centripetally inward and then start moving along these arcs of some barrel-like surface. And the question is, at which time here does the barientation take place? So that's another way to look at it. There's this barrel-like surface from the side. From the side of the spindle, than if you look from one pole to another. So, hot colors show where variantation takes place. So, the hint is that, of course, this surface is the surface of the spindle that you saw on the first slide. So, the hypothesis is that somehow chromosomes get to the spindle. Get to the spindle and then achieve variantation. Before I proceed, I just wanted to draw your attention that there are some struggling chromosomes, right? Most of them fall into this Gaussian, but some are struggling. I'll mention those in the very end. So we started to build a computational model, which is based on the following observations. Based on the following observation. Similar observations were made by people over decades, but we are using the data from about three years ago. The point of this data is that there are short microtubules near the kinetic cores in addition to those long microtubules growing from the spindle poles. And there's certain data that these microtubules interact with. Interact with kinetochores through molecular motors, which are on the surface of the kinetic cores. And also, those of the short microtubules that have minus ends projecting outwards, they have dynein motor on the minus ends, which is sticking to this minus end of the short microtubule. And then this dynein motor walks to the minus end of the long microtubule, effectively pulling this short microtubule. Short microtubule and cannot occur with it to the minuscent of the pole. So the idea is something like that: that long microtubules interact with these bundles. Of course, those bundles are very disorganized of the short microtubules, and something happens during this orientation. So we decided to figure out computationally what does happen. And our model is very simple. model is very similar in spirit to the so-called tug-of-war class of models when you have multiple motors pulling cargo and fighting with each other. The interesting twist here that the motors are actually not fighting with each other. What happens is each dynan motor on the end of the short microtubule goes to the minus center of any long microtubal that it can grab. And that's happening with two different Happening with two different kinetic cores. So, the only non-trivial approximation, well, assumption of the model is that if the pulling is in the direction which is pretty far from the core axis, this motor connection detaches from one microtable faster than Faster than in the good direction when pulling is along the kinetic or kinetic or axis. This is kind of similar to the assumption that if the force of the pulling is strong, then that attachment is strong. This is kind of this mechanosensitive feature which is very ubiquitous in molecular and cell biology. So this just this one feature. This, just this one feature creates very interesting polarity sorting. So imagine that you have center mirror oriented like this in a direction skewed relative to anti-parallel bundle of bundles of microtupils. Then those motors will fall off completely, and only motors that are moving in one direction to one of the poles. One direction to one of the poles survive. For the sister kinetic core, motors moving to the opposite poles survive. So it's a kind of tag of war between themselves, create this interesting instability, which makes one of the kinetic horses adhering to just one set of long microtubules going to one of the poles and another. Going to one of the poles and another to another. So it's very easy, of course, to translate this rule into the system of mathematical equations. We solve the stochastic equations for a finite number of these short microtubles with motors at the end using force velocity curves for the motors using this off-on rates, which are force and angle dependent that I described. And angle dependent that I described, and basically just using force and torque balance for the whole thing. And so we test the following. First, how does this model perform in different geometry of the microtubule system? So let's say chromosome interacts with microtubules intersecting almost a Almost at right angles away from the spindle here. What happens is there's no variantation. The kinetic core axis is not stretching and the chromosome is not aligning. But if the chromosome reached the spindle, the spindle is characterized by anti-parallel biological. Characterized by an anti-parallel bundle of microtubules. Then you see something that looks something like by orientation, but you see that the CTL tangle between microtubule direction and central mirror axis is not quite right. Okay, so then we thought, like, what if the surface of the spin? What if the surface of the spindle is not created by this uniform anti-parallel bundle of microtubules, but actually bundles like this. And then, of course, what you get is perfect variantation. The angle is nice and the stretch, and there's some stretch. So, those are individual couple of simulations, and this is statistics. See, what is very interesting is that. what is very interesting is that in the uniform on the uniform surface microtubules the stretch is better but who cares on the bundles the stretch is still okay and the angle is much better so the formal criterion for the bundled arrangement of microtubles gives almost a hundred percent Almost 100% of variantation, while for uniform, this is not so good. So another simple prediction is that it takes tens of seconds to achieve variantation upon hitting the spindle surface. I didn't mention that in the model, the parameters are taken from multiple papers on molecular motors and micro. On molecular motors and microtubles. So we don't know the exact numbers, but we know orders of magnitude. And so we predict that order of magnitude to achieve variantation at these tens of seconds after a chromosome gets on the spindle. Another interesting prediction is it is important to get to the center of the spindle, because if you get too close to one of the poles, you're encountering mostly a parallel arrangement of microtubules. Arrangement of microtubules rather than anti-parallel bundles. And it's kind of easy to imagine that the more parallel they are, the worse it's going to be. And final prediction number five is that it is important to have more of the short microtupals. If there are fewer of them, the time of variantation is getting longer. Is getting longer and longer. And we know from previous work that what creates short microtubles arranged properly with minus and sticking out is Daniel on the surface of the kinetic cords. This is different sets of Danian motors from those that are pulling on the short microtubles. So if we inhibit Daniel, there will be fewer. There will be fewer of these microtubules and the time of barin. Sorry, if we, right, if we inhibit dynane, sorry, another motor, CENPE, arranges short microtubules properly. And if we inhibit Dynein, it makes it easier for this other motor. And the number of microtubules is increasing here. And the time of variantation is going. The time of variantation is going to shorten, which is non-trivial prediction. Normally, most of the perturbation makes things worse. Now, perturbation of Denin only cannot occur, makes things better. So, the model is actually incredibly predictive. All these five predictions turned out to be true. First, one to remind you was that variantation is achieved on the surface of the spindle. Surface of the spindle. So here, this red curves are the surface of the spindle taken from live microscopy data. And dots are coordinates of the chromosomes achieving variantation. They are achieving variantation on the surface of the spindle. Moreover, they hit the spindle closer to the equator of the spindle, not too close. Spindle, not too close to the pole where it would be dangerous. Second, that it would be much better for variantation if the spindle was made of discrete bundles of microtubules rather than individual microtubules distributed uniformly. So, this is the image of the so-called PRC1, the specific microtubu cross-linker, which glues together. Which glues together anti-parallel interpolar microtigles coming together at the equator of the spindle. And we do see that there are discrete ribs rather than continuous surface of microtubles. Each of these bundles have of order 10 to 20 microtubles here. And you also kind of can see those discrete ribs in these trajectories of the chromosomes. Trajectories of the chromosomes moving on the spindle. After hitting the spindle, it takes tens of seconds to achieve orientation. So, this is the spectacular sequence of images at which you can see two sister kineto cores interacting with one of those bundles. And this is more or less when interaction starts. And you see, it takes about a minute. In fact, after half a minute, In fact, after half a minute, the chromosome is already virulent. Let me skip the slide and just sophisticated data analysis way to show that it's important to hit the spindle on the equator. And the last prediction that if we inhibit dynine on the kinetic course, the time of barientation is getting shorter, and indeed, the time of barientation is getting shorter. Of variantation is getting shorter, actually, twice shorter than it is in control. So that's where we are at the present. Now, the conclusion from this work is that the previous search and capture picture, when we have two esters and individual chromosomes, and then microtubles just connect to the randomly to the kinetic course, and you have to. Randomly to the kinetic course, and you have the spindle is not quite what's going on. What we are proposing is that what this pleasingly simple picture is missing is actual spindle, the bundles of interpolar microtubles between the poles. What in fact is happening? So, the search and capture is not dead quite yet because it is needed for a long micro. For long microtubules to make lateral attachments to the chromosome, basically, long microtubules to start interacting with short microtubules and bring chromosomes to the spindle. And then whenever a chromosome hits the spindle, then there's this polarity sorting event, which makes those disheveled short microtubules erase into these bundles. Into these bundles. And what we're working on now is that there's certain data showing that those bundles are starting to elongate along the long centrosomal microtubles, finally reaching the poles, making the connections. So the beauty of this pathway is that it's a very little chance to make an error. You basically getting buried. Getting by orientation in a majority of cases right away without going through the sequence of monothelic, syntelic, break syntax, start again. No, it's going this way. Okay. This is the explanation why their assembly is so accurate. But of course, a lot of interesting questions remain. One of the questions is one of Is just so you know, you have very few minutes left, even with the questions. Yeah, sure. So, one of the puzzles remained why it seems that chromosomes are getting to the spindle more or less in sync, which means that chromosomes that were far away initially, they move inward faster. And we have no idea yet how does it happen. This totally contradicts the assertion capture. Model. And one more time, another, the biggest puzzle is there are some chromosomes that are struggling. So even with this seemingly foolproof way, there's of course some errors. And those chromosomes, we are now working on them, trying to see what. So, what we already see that those chromosomes. Already see that those chromosomes did manage to connect erroneously. And there's the second layer of correction processes that is in play to correct those attachments. And we are working on what's up there. So that's all that I wanted to tell you. Again, those are people who did this work. Thank you very much for listening. For listening. Thank you so much for the very interesting talk. All right, so we have two hands raised on the Zoom. I think Orion may have been first, if you want to go ahead. Yeah, so two really quick questions. So one was also struck by how the chromosomes get to the spindle in the first place. I know for actually much larger cells, it's not microtubules at all that actually initially bring them towards the spindle. It's an actin cage that assembles and sort of shoves them in. It assembles and sort of shoves them in. Do you actually have any idea whether that could be accounting for the more coordinated behavior of the chromosomes converging? And then the second quick question. Yeah. Let me answer this one. So yeah, this is a great question. And this is one of four hypotheses that we have. And we just ruled it out. So you need like actin myosin contraction to bring chromosomes inward when we inhibit. Inward, when we inhibit myosin, everything goes fine. So it's probably not that. And on the other hand, if we inhibit some of the molecular motors microtubule-based, then something goes wrong. And then the other really quick question is I'd heard one variant of the search and capture was that the microtubules themselves can steer once they get close to the kinetic cores, like the RAM gradient itself could steer them. Do you include that in your model? Do you think you need that? Or do you think that could be a separate? Model, you think you need that, or do you think that could be a secondary consequence of the short microtubules emanating from the chromosomes themselves? No, we do include them, and that seems to be important. So, we allow the long microtubules to tremble due to thermal fluctuation, but also due to molecular motor action. And this seems to be important. Without that, it's even slower and less effective. So, pingleating is totally there and it's working. Great, thanks. Great, thanks. Pete? Sorry, Pete. Yeah, I just had a technical question, but since we're short on time, maybe you can let AJ ask this question first. Oh, okay. So yeah, great talk, Alex. Just a really quick kind of question. You mentioned at the end that dynein inhibition actually makes the orientation faster. So I was just curious whether, you know, why the cell just Whether you know why the cell just doesn't do that, is there some trade-off, a loss of robustness or something? Right, also, great question, and it has a very simple answer. So, when chromosomes get on the spindle, they biorient faster, but to get to the spindle, it takes longer time and they're way more strugglers. So, some chromosomes that are far away, they don't manage to get to the spindle at all. So, it's always this. So it's always the fight between a few different things. Okay, great. Thanks. Pete, were you going to ask your question live or in chat? Okay. Either way, if we have time. Yeah, I mean, just a modeling question with regard to the detachment model. I'm familiar with Kineson 1 that you can have an angle-dependent detachment rate because longitudinal is different than transverse forces. Transverse forces. And I wasn't quite, is the mechanism the similar idea? It looked more like your angle dependence had to do with the orientation of the sort of whole body of the cross-linker. So I just wanted to clarify where the sort of orientation dependence comes from physically. This is a great question. And this assumption, I totally admitting it, this angle dependence is a complete assumption. There's very little data on it. So some of it, as you mentioned, On it. So, some of it, as you mentioned, is like data from Kinesian. So, we're saying, yeah, this is one of the possibilities that it's actual like K on or K off dependence of attachment of individual motor. Another possibility is force dependent of attachment, which indirectly depends on angle. And there are some more complicated possibilities if you consider the whole thing: like short microtubule, one motor here, one motor there. Here, one motor there, so we were not really specifying it. And as I said, this is the thinnest part of the model, but that's the only flimsy assumption. And with just one assumption like that, the model is incredibly predictive. Just a sort of a phenomenology of that idea. Cool. Maybe one or two questions from the room. From the room? I think we can take one. Okay, one. Oh, any questions? Mary? Yeah. Alex, I'm just wondering, you know, the kinetochore bundles, the microtubules, the ones that are coming off the kinetic core, they're seen in these RPE cells, but then like other cells, and Orion was saying, like in other spindles, even other mechanisms could play a role. So what's the, how general is that going to be, do you think? That's going to be, do you think, given that it's a really great data set for a specific cell type? That's a great question. I kind of hesitate to give definitive answer. Alexi, who is one of my heroes, he knows the literature like nobody else I know on mitochondria. He tells me that it's kind of generic for animals, for normal animals. Animals, for normal animals. But yeah, when we go to Prazova, something else, who knows? Maybe this is not the general mechanism. Maybe this is one of the mechanisms. All I was going to say that, so we submitted this paper to Cell first and it got kicked out without reviews. Then we submitted it to current bio. Reviews. Then we submitted it to Current Biology and had three very positive reviews. So we are finalizing the revisions. And two of the three reviewers said that this is going to be in the textbook. So this is not the mechanism, but this seems to be one of the generic mechanisms. All right. I think we should all throw it for the council. Thank you again, Alex. Thank you again, Alex. All right.
