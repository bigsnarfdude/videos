Andre for his birthday, and I wish you all the best. Now, as it seemed from the title, so I'm going to speak about some applications to number theory. Some applications to number theory homogeneous spaces, but these homogeneous spaces, which as I will explain, are of arithmetic types. So we use essentially some basic theory of isolated groups. So we have two settings, one a very classical one, particular setting. Particular setting, which is also important because here we have still long-dated open problems. This is the first setting is when we take SL and R, we take S L and Z as a lattice and we have a subgroup of G, okay, different subgroups, which act uh naturally on uh G mode gamma. On G mod gamma. So G mod gamma is my homogeneous space. And afterwards, we have more general S arithmetic setting. And this is also something very, very classical. So we start from some simple algebraic group defined of a number field K. We fix a finite set of places of K which can place as usual the Achemannian ones. Place as usual the Archimedean ones. O is the link of S integers. Okay, and afterwards we denote by K S the product of all completions, K B when V belongs to S. And our group G in this case is simply the group of K S points. And so this actually is a product of direct product of product of G V. So and gamma is a lattice in G and we consider the homogeneous spaces. So this of course generalization of the previous very uh uh particular case. But I would like to say that uh the results of this is uh is more general ways arithmetic set uh setting is not Setting is not simply to buy the test to generalize things, but we see that there are some phenomena which appears in the general case and which is specific for the general case, but do not appear when you have only one S is a single term, for example, that I here. And not also, this is a topic which is very close, but I want to study. was one to study this type of dynamical system. So we have H which is which X on G1 gamma and there are some two types of results. There are some general results since we have some measure, hard measure, actually probability measure of the quotient, so we can ask the question about if something is fulfilled. is uh uh is fulfilled uh occur almost uh uh every almost the whole time with respect to her nature. So this is a very classical result. It's a theorem of Moore which says that okay in this setting actually theorem of Moore is somewhat more general. Uh if H is a is a non-compact sub uh subgroup of G and uh if L d G V is non compact also. A d G V is non-compact also, or the complement. So this for almost all with respect to the car measure points PG, the orbit is dense. But actually for the applications, particularly for the applications I'm interested in, it's important the individual behavior, the individual structure of the Of the orbit. And so we have now I start with some well-known results. And the case which is the most important for me is just the case when when the closure of the orbit is itself an an orbit of a larger group which contains this H. Which contains this H. And this time we said that the closure is homogeneous. And so here we have two, okay, as we see, not the most general, but the first very important results which open the roads to this direction to to many To many investigations and very deep results. So, first we have this theorem, which is okay, actually if Q is irrational quadratic form, when I say irrational quadratic form, I mean, so this quadratic form which is not proportional to a quadratic form with rational coefficients. Okay? And it's important. It's important also to say that n should be greater than or equal to 3. And in this case, the set of values at the integer points is density, R. And afterwards, we have another theorem, so both theorems are in the main pair, which says that if we have a bounded orbit here, so actually this is the compact orbit, where the bounded orbit is quoted. Public is quoted. And away both theorem, actually the first theorem is a consequence of the second theorem. And the first theorem confirms the conjecture of Open Penn formulated about 1952. The observation that, in order to tackle this conjecture, because many people try to do this, but okay, unsuccessfully, this observation is due to reguna. Observation is due to Ragunatman, and finally Marguni succeeds to prove this. And now we have a natural SF generalization of these results, which is due to Boreal-Prussat and to Boreal and Prussat. And here we have a quadratic form with coefficients of K S. When when I say quadratic form, this is always degenerate, okay? degenerate okay so this means that uh qx is actually a collection of uh quadratic forms every quadratic forms is with coefficients in kv okay so this is naturally non-degenerate so we have the same okay the same condition set here and the result is analogous so this theorem which Theorem, the generalization said that if n is greater than or equal to 3, the set of form at the integer points is 10 CKS. Here I did not do, but the same result is similar result, not the same result, is also true for homogeneous forms, for emission forms. I have proved this in I have proved this in a paper which I mentioned a little bit later, 2000. And so, this good positive results. So, this is like an introduction, so perhaps just show you, to convince you that this approach is important for you. What does irrational mean in this context? Irrational. You have a a bunch of forms, right? Irrational form, yeah. So you have uh so you have uh So so you have T S X so X is the variables, okay? And so you have here here you can TX which is embedded naturally here, okay. And irrational means simply that this fork here, so this fork Q, is not equal to some A multiplied by Q zero, where Q zero is an element here, okay with rational coefficients and Okay, with rational coefficients, and A is an element in KSR. So this we have an absolute element, so nice question. I will use this for them. And now, for the moment, so we are finishing with theorem and we are starting with the conjectures. Now we have so we have okay, so because I mean the So we have a product of linearly independent over all linear force, real linear force. And we suppose again that n is greater than or equal to 3. And we suppose that f does not represent 0 over q, in the usual sense. And we suppose also that 0 is an isolated point here in the state of so what does mean isolated point? So, what does mean isolated points? So, we have R, okay, we have here zero, and we have this means that we have some neighborhood of zero, such that the intersection of this neighborhood with the set of values contains only one point, only zero. So it had discretion at zero. And uh okay and this can okay s a casino since we're this conjecture okay. Okay, from 55. Okay, this means that f f is a is a rational form. Rational means again, rational means multiple, okay, proportional to form with rational coefficients. And why this conjecture is important, although this was not quite clearly mentioned in their paper, but it was there was later some There was later survey paper from Google noted that actually this conjecture too implies a very famous conjecture of Lipperwood, which says the following. So if we denote for every x like this, the distance from x to to z, to the integer integers. And then we have we have this And then we have these relations. And now, so since this result of conjectures from the Fontainebleau mentions of numbers, but later we'll see also applications for algebraic numbers. And this conjecture actually can be reformulated in the following way. Way. Okay, so let n be equal greater than or equal to 3, d be the group of all diagonal matrices. Then if the orbit is bounded, then the orbit is compact. And we'll see that this is easy to show that this is a very essential restriction. For any code to 2, this is completely false. Now, Now, actually, I very recently, a couple of months ago, I so in the previous conjecture we have some, we have the following. So we have okay, in this conjecture, we have product of real linear force. Product of real linear force. Actually we can consider, so in in the algebraic number theory, In in the algebraic number theory we can see that product of uh uh really complex l uh linear forms so that the products of the products, okay, which are linearly independent over C, and the product also gives you a number, also gives you a polynomial, a value of polynomial, okay. And actually it's possible to generalize this conjecture very nicely. This conjecture in a very natural way. Actually, my job was not to generalize the conjecture, but simply I have 10 results about the characterization of the so-called non-faults. And afterwards, I see that it's possible such a generalization. So let me see. Well, so now I recall very simple things. So we can see the number field, okay, of degree. Okay, of degree equal to S. I is the number of real embeddings, S is the number of complex embeddings. So we take alpha 1, alpha N, which generalize linearly K. So N is greater than equal to N, of course. So L Y is this, where sigma i is the embeddings, don't have any embeddings. Okay, so these are all. Okay, so these are already either real or complex linear forms. And afterwards, we take the product. When we take the product, what do we get? So we get the algebraic norm of number x. So we, such, if we multiply by any non-zero coefficient, so we get a form which is called normal form. For example, in the book. For example, in the book of Shakorevich, Number Field, in the first chapter, so we discussed this. Very classical objects. And of course we have some trivial, absolutely trivial properties of this form. For f the first the form is decomposible okay, decom of decomposible o over q okay. The over cube. Okay, composio over q the form does not represent zero over q and the set of values is fitting r. Okay, so this input like this is natural way. And now we can prove that actually the inverse is true, even a little bit more. Now take F A. More. Now take f, okay, a form which is the which is a product of a C of homogeneous form, complex homogeneous forms. Let Z be a non-zero or complex linear form. Exactly right, yeah. Complex linear forms, complex linear forms. But the product is a real polynomial, okay? So it's decomposable over. So it's decomposable over C. And also they should be linearly dependent over C also. And suppose exactly as in the Garso-Sweeney-to-Blank conjecture that f does not represent 0 over Q and this though this is not the and Fz is discretely R. So this Z is discrete is R. Particular okay, we take okay so if any sequence Okay, so f if n is equal to 2, the form must split over over r. So that means that fx, so n is equal to 2, is product of L1 by L2 when L1 and L2 are real forms. So then Fx is a non-form. So of course this restriction here cannot be avoided. There is a trivial example. And so we And so we have that this result which concerns product of real complex form and so this is we have very natural to I should notice in order to prove it I use this homogeneous dynamics okay and so Okay, and so I have used also this proposition, which is very general. Take some polynomials, n polynomials, n variables, and let H be the stabilizer of Px for the natural action of the group here. So the actually is standard one, so you have you have some LMG, some polynomial. LM G is some polynomial P. Okay, so this is simply equal to P G angles. So this is the natural action. Okay. Okay, and let Z be some orbit, or if you please, Z n be Z n. Okay, and we suppose that the values at this point is... The values at this point is in discrete subset of R. Then HPE, okay, so is closed set in this homogeneous space. Okay, this is the plenty general result. The proof is not long. And now we have the following generalization of the previous. What is E? What is E? B? What is E? What is E? P times pi of E. Pi of E. Oh, yes, P is the neutral element in our group. The element, so G is SLN, and this is the origin, the location. If the degree of P is If the degree of P is greater than 2 P and 2, P and P, so you have so what is so you have you have G G this is our notation P and what is this? So for every element G we put this this can say okay and now if you have G equal to E so you have E is going to ground. Actually in this case this is the same Actually, in this case, this is the set of unimodal lattices in Rn. No, I'm asking about P. So, in the degree of P, it's greater than 2, then H could be small, right? Just it could be torus, it's okay. It could be Taurus, but it could be, for example, it could be autonomous group. No, no, no, this is this is completely general. The degrees we have with. We have not any restriction. We simply say that this polynomial, we don't say nothing about the degree, this completely, completely general thing. Okay, so we apply this to the particular case of product of force, but we can apply this in the three previous case for the quadratic forms, for other polynomials, or what you please. And And uh anyway, but I simply use this to prove the previous theorems, you know, try general observation. And uh now the previous castles and swimming through them can be explained in the following way. So let this already be a product of any independent over C linear force in n variables. And the conjecture was over R C over. Okay. And so Uh so uh let n equal to r plus to s, where r is the number of uh forms with with lin with real coefficients and s is the number of pairs of conjugated complex forms. Okay. We suppose this, then uh f x does not s if f f x does not represent zero over q, zero is an isolated force, so f x should be a known force. Fx should be a known form. So, in particular, if all forms are linear, we get the previous conjecture. I'm sure that if the previous conjecture is true, this should be also true. So, and this can, this, again, this this restriction cannot be omitted. I have one two examples. And now, this can be can be reformally negated in can be reformally negated in terms of action of toy, but this time not uh split toi, but uh any toric. Actually a maximum torus that there's such that his a split part, okay, the every torus over I is a product, you have isotropic part and anisotropic, which is a compact the astrologic part, the isotropic part, has dimension at least two. Greater than two, okay equal to two. So if the orbit is bounded, then it's compact. Okay, and now this is some show that the importance of this kind of affections. And so if we if we compare So if we if we compare uh so the first uh results concerning uh the the black false with with the conjecture, so we have uh so in the first case we have uh theorems, okay, which is important. In the second case we have still still conjectures, and what distinguishes the first and the second case distinguish is that in the first case the group is generated by unicorns. In the first case, the group is generated by unipotent elements, and second case, this is the torques, more general case. The maximum split torques. And so we have geometric interpretation of this, so maximum the orbit of maximum split torb. And we geometrically, for example, particularly interval. where we have okay these examples like holocytic flows on tangent bundle on Riemann manifold or and B correspond corresponds to geodesic flow flows on this bundle. And now I need so the point why these two cases A and B are so different. They are different because of the very simple process Property, the property of divergence properties elementary. So we have an orbit is called divergent if the orbit map is a proper map. And we have plenty of divergent orbits in when we act with diagonals with split torque. On the other hand, when we act with unipotent parameters, so the basic case is one So, the basic case is one parameter unit often group. We don't have at all. So, even more, we have a very classical theorem of Buris, which says that if we have one parameter input in groups, then this is this so-called recurrency or it's this orbit never goes to infinity. Actually, this result, this was the first version afterwards. This was the first version. Afterwards, there was some generalization by Daniel, Animal Buddhist, and so on. So we have much more general results, but the time is running, so I miss minimizations. And so we have this recurrence theorem and And this is very important. So this is one of the main reasons why this fundamental theorem of, okay, proved by Rabner in 1990 was, okay, she succeeded. This theorem, this phenomenon is essentially used in what ways. If we have some unipotent orbits, H or G is not. Always not going to infinity. So we can define a natural way some measure. So we start from here. We are going up to T, to the point T. We take the average on this piece of trajectory. So we get some probability measure. Afterwards, this is going to infinity. We have some sequence probability measure. Because of the previous theorem, Algorithm theorem, this theorem this we have this the limit measure is not is still in in g mod gamma okay this one phenomenon and afterwards there is another phenomenon that in this case for action with one parameter important groups so if we this is we have one orbit which points somewhere afterwards she returning and uh this this pieces are remaining two long time almost parallel. Time almost parallel. And so this means that if we have an element which went send these points from here to here, okay, this is an element. Okay, well, obviously, this is an element which should preserve this measure. And so we have two parts. So, first First we have result about so-called measure regity and afterwards we have a result about orbit closures. So the first was conjectured, okay, first we Aribunaton conjectured this the orbit closure, afterwards Danny conjectures this for measure and afterwards Rapner first And afterwards, I rubbed my first first proof for the measure rigidity and next for this. And this was generalized by Maguis and myself. And there is another important moment here. So we have this orbit L, this group L. It's important for the application, in particular, in the proof of this tilt. In the proof of this theorem which I formulated about the proof about nor forms to know what is the structure of this group. And this structure is okay, which use all this is proved in this theorem. Okay, so in the real case, this means that the group L is C. This means that the group L is simply generated itself by unipotent elements, but in this S and D case, things are more complicated. And now, so since the divergency properties is very important, so now it's what remains to prove, to be understand this is basically the closure. the closures of of the orbit of maximum split tori. And here we have this theorem. So this theorem says simply that the divergent orbits, in this case, is the basic play cases are just the obvious divergent orbits. Okay, this is orbits. And afterwards it was generalized It was generalized, this still name was but by Baragweis and myself for any semi-simple groups and now so we have and now it's And now is uh is it possible to as we see that uh in in rank one we we don't have there are plenty of orbits of split ori of rank one which with projects which is not homogeneous. And this is one one of the reasons in two thousand we were used to formulate this general conjecture. This generally say it follows. So if you have some semi-simple we have some split toy. Semi-simple, we have some split toy, okay, and this orbit does not admit the quotient on which T acts as a one-dimensional torus, okay? Then in this, then this closure should be homogeneous. So a typical example is the following one. Take, for example, SL2R by SL2R. Take gamma like this. O is the ring of integers, a quadratic extension of Q. Take 14 this product of 14 this product of diagonal matrices and of course according to this conjecture it should be every orbit should be should have homogeneous closures. First we had some confirmative results in this direction by 94 Shakar Moses published paper in this direction also. So 2006. But in general, it turns out that this is not the case. And here we are arriving to another basic definition. So we have divergent orbit and we have locally divergent orbit. Locally divergent orbit is this definition is valid only in the This definition is valid only in the SAD case. So the orbit is locally locally divergent. So since T in this case is a product of T V, if every T V is divergent, so every T V is divergent. So for example, in the previous case, so we have D by T. The action of D of the first copy of D give a divergent topic, the action of the second copy of D, divergent topic. Okay, this is a locally divergent. It is a local indiversion. And next we have a complete description of all these locally divergent orbits. So here T R is the product of T V when V belongs to R. Actually it turns out that this orbit is closed. Orbit is closed if at only if it's divergent. Okay, if I is a single tone, and only if at only if I is a single tone, and if G is also, this should be a standard, standard also, or locally divergent orbit, a standard. And we have now what about we have a description of all close locally divergent orbits. Divergent orbits and all simply locally divergent orbits. And if S is greater than or equal to S, always we have locally divergent orbits which are not closed. Locally divergent orbits which are not closed. And now so in this So this CRM allows to okay, the first, the part two of the CRM allows to obtain results about various of homogeneous forms at integral points, in the case when we have a product of linear forms. But in the previous theorem five, we suppose that zero is that the form does not the problem does not represent zero over q, okay? 0 over q. Okay, here we now have this. Okay, this is application of part 2. An application of part 3 allows to obtain a class of orbits which are not closed, but which admits closure, which is not locally divergent, contradicting the the previous conjecture, the general conjecture. The general injection. And so first we have rationality criteria, so we have this. So for example, take a particular case where forms are real. We suppose that they are linearly independent and this is discrete. But we don't suppose that it's possible that the product represents zero. This the difference between this and the previous results. And the previous results. Okay, but on the other hand, this is more general because we do not suppose that Q is that Q is not represent over Q. And then we have the same. So Fx is rational. So if FZN is discrete, then Fx is rational. Okay, we have this. And now we arriving to the next. To the next theorem. So, for example, we take the product of n copies of SL2 and let gamma be irreducible non-uniform lattices in G. We take by T the product of all the other groups and we suppose that this uh uh locally divergent no f no closed solute, which always exists, always exists if n is greater than equal to this order. Than equal to this orbit. And in this case, we have two. Okay, if n is equal to two, then any closure of such orbit is a union of two or four locally divergent orbits. In particular, it is never homogeneous, which contradicts the conjecture. On the other hand, if n is strictly greater than two, we have always the global divergent The plot of the global orbit is is uh is dense, so we have okay with the potential. Uh and uh let me note that this was before this uh this result we have two two other examples of completely different nature for Swamo Purana in two in 2010 proof when n is better and dimensional T is The T is n minus 2, so the T is not maximum, which is not quite good because for the application we need maximum toy, to give also a counter example. And also Yui Shapira proved in 2011 if he considered the case when n is equal to 3 and t is maximum. But all these results are completely different. And now the next result, I am considering this case. In this case, any semi-simple groups, NI semi-simple, okay, the locally divergent orbits in the general context of any semi-simple groups. Here we distinguish two cases when the number of variations is equal to two, and the second case when the number of variations is greater than two. And now, if we have this is equal to two, We have this is equal to two. That is, we have G is a product of two groups, G V1 multiplied by G V2. Then we have the following. We have, okay, look, the three. The following conditions equivalent T, this is, the orbit is closed. If and only if the closure is homogeneous, if and only if we have this. So if we This. So if we any non-closed locally divergent orbit has a non-homogeneous closure, which is a contradiction for this general fact. And even more, so in this case, so this is more complicated. If we take such closure, which is non-homogeneous, we can completely describe this. This closure. So, this is not homogeneous, but this is a finite union of other evocative divergent orbits. And there is bijections between, one hand, between, so we take G, this gives a locally divergent orbit, and we associate to this G using Bread decomposition. Brad decomposition, some set of parabolic subgroups. And afterwards, to every element of this set, to every parabolic subgroup, we associate an orbit, locally divergent, which is in the closure. And if we have if P1 is greater than P2, so the orbit which corresponds to the bigger parabolic group contains the orbit. Contains the orbit corresponding to the small one. So we have complete description. So in particular, we have, so in this set, we have a minimum parabolic subgroup. This minimum parabolic subgroup corresponds to close orbit in the closure. Close orbit in the closure. What is the biggest parabolic group? The biggest parabolic group is simply G by this. Okay. So So this this this corresponds to to the whole order. So we have such such stratification which is such a complete classification. And now what is the case when S is strictly greater than 2? When S is strictly greater than 2, in certain case we have something completely opposite. But here we need some, so we suppose first that K is not a C and field component. Not a C and field, complex multiplication field, so I said so. This means that K is not a quadratic extension of a totally real number field, which is not totally imaginary. So I recall that we have a reductive group, reductive group, the semi-simple of this reductive group, the s the semi-simple rank is simply the rank of its rank of its commutator, okay, its reductive group. It's a simple rank, it's the reductive group of the commutator. And so we have this result. So now s greater than 2, okay, and we take some closure of locally divergent orbit. This closure is squeezed between two Is squeezed between two close orbits, first and second one. Okay? And this H1 and H2, these are orbits. So both of them are inductive groups with the same center and the same semi-simple rank. So they're groups which are very very close to each other. And the fact that they are very close, it's uh demonstrated by the color of this. The color of this, which says that in the case when the group G is simply SLN, we have the perfect result. So we have the following. So in the important, so in the case, this theorem implies that in this case, k is not the same, I think. So we have that the closure is homogeneous. So we have what we need. Now we have again, of course, some small some. of course some some small uh some um some uh restrictions so we we suppose that k is not a seed field since if if k is a seed field simply this is not true so it's cannot but this is a slightly small restriction and actually for the application what is important is the most important cases for example one case a total degree field and so on so we have a good result So we have a good result here, and of course, when you have a good result about orbiting, we should expect good applications to two number theory, which is the case. And okay. Oops. Here I have how many seconds? Okay, now we have like in Boreal Prasad, we have product we have fx, okay, which is X, which is product of linear forms with coefficients in Ks. And we have a result which says that if the set of values at the integer point is discrete, then this form is rational. And the natural equation is: suppose that the form is not discrete, that the form is not rational. What we say is is not is not rational. What we can say about the closure. And we have a general conjecture, so we have this, okay, is not okay, f is irrational. In this case we should have this, okay? Like in the theorem of modulus. And what the previous theorem said that it confirmed the... Say that it confirmed this conjecture in the case when F is locally K decomposable. What does it mean here? I'm saying this when I finish. This means the following. So we have, so F is a collection of forks. Okay. Now a locally KD composable. This means the following. This means that each of these F V is Each of these f is with coefficients from k. But all of them are not proportional to some fixed form. And in this case, if between these they are not all proportional, we have confirmation of this conjecture, so this previous year. So this means what? So we have, for example, F1, which is rational, we have F2, F3, F2, F2, F2, F2, We have F2, F3, F2, F3, rational but not proportional. We have two of them, the first coincides with the second, but the third is different. And afterwards, we take the values at the integer points. Here we have, okay, we take F1, Z, F2, Z, okay, F3, Z, okay, and this is, this belongs to all. And this is this belongs to all this belongs to K S. S consists of three elements. Then all these points are are dense if we have at least three forms. Now, suppose that we forgot the third one, we have two, okay, which are not proportional. So in this case, we don't have density. Because in this case, the previous theorem is true only for when S, the primary of S. S, the primality of S, is strictly bigger than 2 for S equal to 2. The Mergois conjecture, the general Mergois conjecture is not true. And so this is the application. And let me mention that this Mergouis conjecture, all counter-examples for now, considers the orbits of non-bounded orbits. The uh for the moment uh there there are not uh the conjecture is completely open. The conjecture is completely open in the very important case of forbids which are bound. This is really if we prove for bound it, so we prove this famous little conjecture. So I think this the most important case is still Thank you. Any questions or comments? Can you look at those questions in positive relativistic? Do they make sense? I have never thought about this because I should I think that uh I'm more than ninety percent sure that More than 90% sure that you can, but since I had never thought about this, I cannot say something more precisely questions or remarks. If that's not the case, I'd like to thank the speaker again and now have our coffee paper. We will now have our coffee break and we will resume at 3.30.
