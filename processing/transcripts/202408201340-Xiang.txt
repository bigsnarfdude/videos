Thanks a lot, Bao Pim, for this uh introduction. And I would like to first thank uh the organizer for this very nice invitation and uh it's really an honor to present here. So today I got to talk about the mixing property for random forced wave equation. It's a hyperbolic equation or dispersive equation. And it's uh a joint work with my colleagues in Peking University including Professor uh Zhefeizang and uh Dong Yi Wei. and uh Dong Yi Wei and uh Zi Yuinyo and uh Jia Chenzhou. So our motivation is actually to explore the mixing property for a large class of uh physically important models and namely the dispersive equations. And but meanwhile we find that the existing literature on is quite uh limited. So I mean that is to be compared with Marvi-Stokes equations or the other Parabonic equations. Parabonic equations. Uh so briefly we have obtained two results in this paper. The first one we get a general criterion or general framework for the verification of mixing and this criterion is uh of course inspired by the existing ones uh and the main novelty here is on the use of an observation from dynamical system. And then we have applied this uh criterion for the exponential mixing for non-linear wave equation and this Non-linear wave equation. And this model, this non-linear wave equation, is quite general, as I shall explain later on. And we very much like this result because we find this is a natural and vivid combination of several research directions. So to be more precisely, when we solve these nonlinear wave equations, we have to deal with the open problem from dynamical systems and we meet a central step in the problem from That we need the problem from the PD point of view, and we also need to deal with a complicated control problem. So here we go. And this this talk will be composed by three parts. In the first part, I will give some uh basic introduction about the areas that uh we need to face. And the second part is more is devoted to the probabilistic framework. And in the third part, we got to use this criterion to solve the mixing problem for the Mixing problem for the nonlinear wave equation. So actually, as we can uh see here, uh this very general, this uh abstract uh formula can can characterize three four different type of uh areas. More precisely, if there's no eta, if eta is zero and then you you get to uh investigate the free flow of the equation, this is the research on partial differential equation. It's the research on partial differential equations. And in some sense, if you add the eta, and you can this eta can influence the dynamic of the solutions. And this is to the dynamic systems. But now if you are able to choose the eta, now you choose the eta, you design it, and by choosing the eta you can change the flow of this equation. And this is the control theory. And uh finally when eta becomes random is the random in differential equation. Random is the random in differential equations. So, uh, as I said, this introduction part, I will briefly talk about all this uh a quick review on these areas. So, the first new way will meet the stability problem. So, this is the starting from the very general, very easy stability problem. It's uh so A here, so A so A here is actually a matrix, it's just a linear OD equation. So, stability as So, stability asks yourself whether the solution will converge to zero. If it is, if yes, whether it converges exponentially to it. And the simple criterion shows that if you only need to investigate the spectrum of this operator, if the spectrum is on the left-hand side of the complex plane, then the system is actually stable. Otherwise, the system is unstable. And then, what about if you deal with a nonlinear equation? So, this is a nonlinear equation, and this can also characterize the partial differential equations. So, we can ask the same question. And for this nonlinear equation, actually, we show that there's actually a Markov property, which means in order to solve this exponential stability problem, you only need to show that there exists a capital Need to show that there exists a capital time t such that at time capital T the energy is divided by two. So this is very simple. And the problem is now it's become much harder if you want to solve a non-linear partial differential equations. The reason why this is m m more delicate is because you want in this case we need to h handle the global stability problem. So by global means the state can be as large as you want. Can be as large as you want. So at this time, you cannot perform the our favorite perturbation arguments. And next, we uh turn to the control theory. So what is a control theory? Control theory is about if you are able to act on a system then what can we make it to do? So this is a control. So this is a control. Before without eta is the it is what we have explored before for the partial differential equations. Now Partial differential equations, now we're free to add the eta here. A eta is a control. So by adding this eta, you're able to change the evolution of this equation. For example, this Sanvino equation, and this modernize the river, the flow in the river, and here you have two dams. So you can see on the left-hand side, you get eta1, and on the right-hand side, you have eta2. This is actually a control to adjust the to um adjust the flow that uh pass through this gate. So by choosing by choosing this eta, you are able to change the flow or the height of this river. So this is a control theory. Actually control theory is uh composed by two parts. The first one is uh controllability, means that you have a given initial state and you get another final target state. So you want to change you to find So you want to change, you to find the control such that the solution can evolve from this given initial state to this final target state. It's very simple. And there's another question called stabilization. Okay, this picture. I don't want to emphasize the importance of stabilization technique because this picture is not taken on Earth, it's on us. So so which means it's very important. So stabilization is it's about this. It's about this. If you open up a dictionary, it tells you that stabilization is a process to make something physically secure and stable. So it's very easy because you can decompose stabilization by two parts. The first part is stable and second part is action. Stable plus action, which means the action to make the something stable. So how in order to formulate this in a mathematical need we know that now In the mathematical knee, we know that now we are facing the bad situation. So this equation is actually unstable. So by adding a control, is that possible to make the system stable? That's the stabilization. So again, due to the Markov property, you only request that you find a control such that energy is divided by two or three or one hundred as you want. And again, I would like to emphasize that the problem becomes much The problem becomes much more difficult if you want to stabilize a system on non-linear partial differential equations. So, to be compared with non-linear partial differential equations, the theory is already known for linear OD equations and even for non-linear OD equations. You have optimal control techniques for our favorite Niyaplov function method. Okay. And now, if the force becomes random, so we meet our uh the random differential. The random differential equations. And so this is nothing, but you imagine that omega is random, so you have a distribution of this flow. So you have to look at the solution as a distribution in the probability space. And so here is we can introduce the definition of a mixing. So because this is actually a Markov chain, mixing is about Is about the conver exponential convergence or convergence to an equilibrium state. So, in this sense, we have to find a unique invariant measure. Invariant measure is nothing but the equilibrium state of this random process. So, to I know that there are many people familiar with partial differential equations, and mixing is just the exponential. Just the exponential stability of this invariant measure. Okay, so this is the definition, and we want to ask about whether we can get exponential mixing for these random differential equations. And again, we can it's very helpful to consider the discrete model. So because uh this is very simple because you only need to find the capital time t and you consider the flow at the You can see the flow at the time n capital T. And again, due to the Markov property, it suffices to show that the distribution of the state at x at will converge exponentially to the unique invariant measure. So that's the problem that we are going to talk about. And because And because mixing an ergotic is very important, and there are many, many mathematicians who have been devoted to this problem. Probably we can go back to 80 years ago. First criterion probably I can check about is about Dublin. And then there are Harry's and the work by Flandori, Wenang E, Professor Wenang E, Martin Yan Sinai. And more recently, the work by Martin Huer and Martin. Work by Martin Hare and Martini, and the group of Kuxin, Shikin, and Nexi Sing. And actually, all most of them, most of these criterions are the so-called Harry-Stamp framework. So what does it mean by Harry-Stamp framework? It means that you can get exponential mixing or mixing of a system as long as this system can verify several hypotheses. More precisely three hypotheses. So I'll explain these three three hypotheses one by one. Uh the first one I call it the dissipation hypothesis which means the so this is your initial initial state X, the small X, so which means after uh some time T it will enter a compact obsorbing set. So it means something like a compactness argument. And then the second one is The second one is irreducibility. Sometimes in the work by it's also called recurrence. So irreducibility means the so you remember that after the first step, the state will already enter into this small x. And then we show that with a positive probability, the state will enter into an even smaller or much, much smaller ball. And you know that this is actually real. You know that this is actually real, it's actually related to the global stability problem, right? And then we have a coupling condition. Sometimes it's also called squeezing or asymptotical strong final property. This means suppose now it so this is already in the third stage. Now every imagine that two ball two states they're already in the small ball, they're close to each other. And coupling condition shows that with Condition shows that with high probability, these two states will keep conversion. I mean, at least in the distribution sense. And actually, this is in some recently it is covered by Schwikin that this is related to the linear control theory. And before that, there is a there's a work by Martin Hay and Martini for the for the work on Labi-Stokes equation. It's uh they are using some uh somehow they are using some non-linear control techniques. They are using some non-linear control techniques or the Maliwang calculus. Okay, so this is the history about the Harris type framework and it has been leading to a lot of research on the mixing of Navier-Stokes equations. And I'm not going to talk about them one by one. And leading to many other applications, well most of them are based on the parabolic models. On the parabolic models. Okay. So now we go to the problem that we asked before. So we want to ask whether we can get global mixing or exponential mixing for a dispersive equation or hyperbolic equation. And in this case, we replace Navier-Stokes by a wave equation. And then we find several difficulties. The first one, I mean, if you remember, we have a very good point. One, I mean, if you remember well, if we want to apply our previous high-risk type framework, we have, you remember well, the first step is um distribution. So in this first step, you need to have a compact observing set, which means no matter the initial state is uh as large as you want, you always get a compact observing set. So for example, if your initial state is L2, then you have uh State is L2, then you have you need to enter a bunch of in H1 or H3P. But which apparently is not the case for wave equation. And now to I mean I think this is the global stability analysis is more slightly more difficult than the usual parabolic models because of the non-smooth effects and something. And we also meet a loss of derivative issue for control problems. Derivative issue for control problems. This is very technical for control problems. So, in conclusion, if you have again have a look at these three major difficulties, you find that the first one and the third one, all of them are related to the lose of compactness, right? So, which means we actually need to face an essential problem on the missing of compactness. So, is there a way to compensate for the missing compactness? Compensate for the mixing compactness. That's our major problem. And actually, we find that this is not only a problem for our exponential mixing problem, it's a universal problem for the whole mathematical world. So for example, if you have a look at the calculus variation, the very famous work by Pierre Luynes is about the concentration compactness method. And I mean, this is probably one of the reasons he got a fuse metal. And we And uh we also meet the same similar problem for group group theory and also dynamical systems. And now we find that our problem of compensating the missing compactness can be solved by dynamical system point of view. So why? So we need to briefly talk about the dynamical system. Dynamic system is about understanding and predict predicting the evolution of a system. System. Of course, many important people have been devoted to this beautiful theory, but what is important is that in such a beautiful theory, there is a hiding compactness from the chaotic evolution, which is called attractor. So, which means attraction of the dynamics of the system can indicate the compactness. And so, that has but what is more important is because this So what is more important is because this dynamical system point of view or this attraction theory can naturally apply for the dispersive equations. So have a look at this. If we go at first we go to the parabolic equation and we know that for parabolic equation you have your favorite smoothing effect and then you get a compactness issue. And now for this dispersal equation you don't have a smooth effect but you have an asymptotic compactness. So which means and this asymptotic compactness And this assumptive compactness is exactly what I said about the abstraction before from dynamic systems. So, what is this assumptive compactness? It means that the solution, it will, for example, if the initial state is L2, it always stays L2, but it will converge exponentially or asymptotically to a compact set. For example, I have this trivial equation for the wave equation, linear wave equation. So, for this dumped wave equation, so this is a, for example, if your initial state is the very natural H1 times L2, and then the solution is always H1 times L2. There's no chance that you can improve the regularity. But we can find a closed ball in H2 and such that the solution, even if the solution stays in H1 and the solution will In H1, and the solution will eventually converge to disclose ball in H2. So this is called asymptotic compactness. And we find that this new observation on asymptotic compactness from dynamical system per view can be used to compensate for the mixing compactness for the mixing property. So that's what we have proved, the first result. It's the general criterion for the for For the for the exponential mixing. And it is composed by three parts. The first one is exactly what I just introduced, the asymptotic compactness. And the second one is the existing one already. And so which means you have to deal with irreducibility and the coupling condition in this time also on the compact set. So that's the way how we prove. How we prove at first the flow will converge to a converse convex set compact set and then we pro perform a projection on this compact set. On this compact set we use already the very well known irreducibility and the coupling condition to get exponential mixing. And so this is this is a detailed proof of this and so I mean this picture I this picture is a nil by cheating and even this one is also needed by cheating because This one is also needed by cheating because I don't know how to draw a dense net in the H1 space. So what that means, it means the initial state is X, and then it will converge to this plate K. And this K is actually a compact set. And then on this plate K, we perform the irreducibility and the coupling condition. And I'm not going to show the detail of this proof. So you So using this uh new criterion, we come back to the problem that I asked at the beginning of this talk. Can we solve this exponential mixing problem for disposal equations? And the answer is yes. Okay, we we actually deal with uh uh random force wave equation with a localized damping. And as I said at the beginning of this talk, this this Of this talk, this model is quite general, and I shall say, I'll explain why this is general. So, at first, we need to say that we need to add a damping term. And so, this is a damping. A depends on x, but this a can be localized. So so which means a so for example you are for example the support the For example, the support, the support of A is some in this domain. And outside of this domain, this is uh zero, which means this is a dumpos uh localized damping. And of course, it can cover the usual case that the support of A is the whole domain, right? The very fair, the very usual one. And we also want to emphasize that the damping term here is sharp. What does it mean by sharp? Sharp means if there's no damping, no mixing. Mixing. So this means sharp. And of course, this localized damping, the reason that we investigate this result comes from the physical importance of this or application of these models. The application comes from noise reduction or design optimization and some other. And also from this economy or radar and your your acoustic headphone, all of them. Headphone. All of them are localized damping. And then I also want to emphasize that the noise can be also localized. So of course this excludes for example everybody is familiar with the white noise. But white noise is not is not localized. Now we can deal with localized noise. But we also want to say that in this now in the current In this now in the current version, we are not able to deal with the unbounded noise. So which means now we need the noise to be bounded. But we are still working on to get to generalize this result to an unbounded version. So this is the second theorem about the mixing of the wave equation. So you have a non-linear wave equation with local as a damping and also the noise. And also, the noise is also localized. And we show that there is a unique invariant measure for this Markov chain. And we show that there is exponential mixing for this problem. And this exponential mixing result is also sharp because this is exactly the same bound that we can get for Navier-Dox equations. So, and now I want to give Now I want to uh give some um a sketch of the proof of this result. As I emphasized before, the p in the process of sol solving this problem we need to deal with three hypotheses. And interestingly, these three hypotheses is related to three different topics. We handle open problem from dynamic systems and uh we get a central unit problem, but not this time we this result is actually already known. We treat it as a black box. We treat it as a black box and uh we deal with a complicated control problem. Okay, so in the in the first part of asymptotic compactness, if you remember well I before I give a very simple naive model is a linear dumped wave equation. So it's uh at very beginning way I show this result, u plus a ut equals to f. For this result, A is just a constant. For this result, A is just a constant and then you have asymptotic compactness and it's also a linear model. There's no difficulty. But now the tricky part in this problem is because we not only because of this non-linear model, but also we need to add a non-autonomous force here, and also the damping force here is also localized. And we find that this we cannot find this uh this result in the literature. This result in the literature, but we can find some similar ones. So the first one is a case that's the linear model. So it's exactly what I write here. The proof of this linear model is not complicated. It's just you separate the evolution by two parts and you can show the proof. And the second one is about the case that if A is not an organized, if Ax is just a constant, and this can be is it was solved by Zenik 20. is uh it was solved by Zenik twenty years ago and he used so a sort of energy method. And the third one is a case that A is actually localized but the F here does not depend on time. If F does not depend on time this can be transferred easily to a case that without source term. Why? Because you you only need to take another time derivative of this equation then there's no F. Then there's no F. And this was solved also mostly 20 years ago. And but by combining all these three factors, there's no result. And the major difficulty for this problem I said is come from two factors. The fact the first one is uh the case that A d depends on X, which means the very usual energy method cannot be applied here. And the second one is about the the the Is about the fourth term here, it also depends on time. Because it depends on time, it's very difficult to use the Nyaplow function method. And so let me this night I just want to uh explain why this problem is uh not that easy. So this is the equation that we are dealing with, right? And then suppose that the our favorite energy of this equation, and they take the time derivative of this equation, you get Derivative of this equation, you get this. So suppose there's no F here, no F, then the energy decays, right? And the energy is also positive definite, it decays, everything's fine. And again, so but now there's F here. F make extra difficulty. So and then and also here, suppose A does not depend on X. So this uh this This uh this damped wave equation is uh actually non-degenerate. And if this is localized, then it's a degenerated model. Even if it decays, you don't know whether this decay is exponential or not. So as a first step of our proof for this non-linear wave equation, we solve this problem and we show that this model is also a sum total compact compact. And the proof, the strategy of proof is mainly composed by four parts. Four parts. And so, I mean, it's quite difficult, but it's quite technical. I'm not going to show details. Briefly, in the first part, we show that if there's no F, and we show that if there's no F, this equation is actually global stable in a large class of Sobolev equations. For example, includes S equals to 0, S equals equals to 1 half, S equals to 1. And this part actually I will explain later. And this part actually I will explain later on in the second part for the irreducibility condition. And the second part is a case that f equals to zero is not equal to zero. So for if you remember well, so this is the time evolution, this is the time, this is for example this energy. So if there's no f if there's no f, the energy actually decays. Maybe you don't know whether it decays exponentially or not. Whether it decays exponentially or not, it decays. But now it has F, you have no idea whether it's how it evolves. So, what we show is somehow a discrete monotonicity, which means we don't show that the energy will decrease along all the way along this time evolution. We only show that there is a capital time t here, such that Here, such that the solution at this capital time t is smaller and than the initial state. But this is already enough if you can show this discrete model genicity. And then we, in order to get asymptote compactness, you need to face, deal with some compactness or higher regularity space, we need to use tree shots as mesh on boundary domain. And this uh this work with the this uh this result due to uh This result used to uh SOG and Nigel-Buker Patty Jah. And we also use a transition of this attraction. So we which means we don't what we want to show. We want to show that if your initial state is H1 times L2, you want to have some total compactness in H2 times H1. But this this thing, we cannot prove it directly. We want to transit this attraction, which means we first show that we can Show that we can, if the initial state is in H1 times H2, it will converge exponentially to a space like which is called H4 divided by H3 times H1 third. And then from this higher regularity space, we can converge exponentially to the H2 times H1 space. But but this one is actually But this one is actually a standard technique for the theory of attractor for the dispersive equations. Okay. Now we go to the second part for the irreducibility problem. As I emphasized before, this relates to the global stability problem. And again, the main difficulty come from the fact that this A is only localized. And actually, in the so we again perform our favorite energy estimates, we show that we Our favorite energy estimates, we show that when we because f equals to zero, then the energy it decays, but we have no idea whether it is exponential decay. So and there are uh in the literature there are many two results, two type of uh method. The first one is called multiplayer method. In this case, the the support of A should be in a star-shaped domain. This is called a star-shaped or gamma-sharpen type domain. Carbon type domain, but it can be very thin here. You know, this it can be as thin as you want. And uh it was introduced, this method was introduced by Nunes and uh and followed by many other co-authors. And the advantage of this method is shows you that using this method you can get uh quantitative estimates on the decay rate. And the second one is uh about micro localizer size. So using micro localizer size they may give the so-called Using micro-localized size, they give the so-called GCC geometry control condition condition, which means this is actually related to the propagation of the singularity, which means if the initial state is here, or at any point is here, then you suppose from here you get a ray, night ray, and then it will reflect on the boundary of the domain in a capital time t to enter into this small medium. To enter into this uh small omega, the control domain omega. And this is used macro logic, I say, but uh the the drawback of this method is that you cannot get quantitative information. And okay, of course there are many other result um other methods uh for example the one used to uh Daniel Tataru and uh and I also contribute uh a bet on this uh problem uh before. Okay, that was about the linear wave equation. Was about the linear wave equation. But what about the non-linear wave equation? So the non-linear wave equation, again, you know that the naive energy estimate decays, but again we have no idea whether you have exponential decay. But especially we want to face the global stability problem, which means this episode here does not depend on the size of the initial state. So the answer to this problem is yes. This problem is yes, but no. What does it mean? It means that you have to have some constraints on the equations. For example, in 30 years ago, for this model, and I mean this model is actually a defocusing non-linear wave equation. Joazua showed that this is globally stable. He used the first method, which is called the multiple method. And And several years before, Johnny and Lorraine proved that this is actually global stable when A, the support of A, satisfied the micro-local analysis constraint. And recently, together with John Michel Kohung and Joachim Krieger, we also showed a similar result for wave map equation. For this problem, we emphasize more on the geometric and algebraic topology features. And the algebraic topology feature of this equation, I mean, on the target manifold. Okay, now we could go to the last part. I mean, the last technical part, and uh this is the probably the most complicated part of this work. Uh it's uh it reduce actually to a control problem. So why it reduce to a control problem? So um so why it's a problem. Um so why it's a reduced to a control problem? Uh because here this is the this is the compactable in in H1, the compactable in H1. And you know that the state, there's one state X1 and X2, they're already in the small ball in H1. And we want to show that these two states in the probability in the distribution since you are Distribution since you will converge or keep converging. But so this is a state, and uh now imagine that after time t there is a actual force, random force eta here. And then here you get another random force eta prime. Right? For example, if eta uh eta prime is re is uh replaced by eta here, there's no chance that you can hope that these two states can these two states can can keep converging, which means the this distance is smaller, is smaller than this distance. But this is the case if you choose eta you choose eta and you plus another uh control force, which means you are able to control uh find another force here. By using this control, you there is a chance that you can make the distance of these two steps. You can make the distance of these two states to be uh become more closer. So that's the stabilization technique as I introduced before. And such uh stabilization problem was uh was solved like in the easier case when A there's uh the dumping force here is uh does not depends on X. And they used uh the classical theory of uh optimal control theory. Now we we need to handle the case that uh A of X doesn't A of X does depend on X and it is locally supported. And so we provide a new method for this stabilization problem. And this new method Hanford has more on the frequency, on the explicit control of the low frequency. And we can also get a quantitative information for about this control problem. And but in the process of doing this showing this control problem, we need to Control problem, we need to do. I mean, I wouldn't say that this is difficult, but we need to redo some country estimation, redo some, reprove some unique continuation and Hilbert map regularity problems. Mainly because of the case Q, we replace A by A X. This is the technical part. So the proof essentially will compose by three parts because of course we are you know that we are solving we are you know that we are solving a non-linear wave equation but first we we perform the linearization. We perform linearization the this is the control problem about this linear system and so the as people in control theory we usually when we have a linear system we usually need to face the adjoint system. This is again another linear system and so to show that this system is That this system is controllable is equivalent to show observability inequality. And but now what we want to show is the essential part is something like that. So this is so which means the initial state belongs to capital H. We want to find a control eta such that the solution, the energy of this solution can become smaller than the initial state. So the in and in the three part we have to show at first the observability inequality. This observability inequality is shown in a cl in a large class of solvent spaces and we use a technique introduced by Amari by I don't know how to pronounce but uh do do two cards and shui kin. Sorry. And Shui Kien. Sorry. I mean, it's also the same story because when I was in France, people don't know how to pronounce my name. So my name is Senchuan, and so I also get a French name. The French name is Senquan, because they don't know how to pronounce. Okay. And the third part we use a technique that I introduced during my post-walk for the quantitative low-frequency control analysis. And but the most difficult part is this part, to show the observability inequality. And the way of solving this observability inequality is composed by this is the way that we show it. And the proof is quite technical. I invite you to have a look at the paper on our archive. And mostly it's composed by four parts. In each part we need to use different kind of techniques. But the good news is that we can we finally solve this problem. Finally, we solve this problem. So, in conclusion, uh we have introduced uh a general criterion for the for the mixing property and now finally we are able to solve the exponential mixing problem for for wave equations for and hopefully for some other dispersal equations. And we've get by using this criterion we get exponential mixing for a nice class of wave equations and this Equations. And this is a quite general model. In the sense that the noise can be localized, the damping can be also localized. And we can get a higher regularity. Essentially, we can get super energy, almost get a super critical energy. And also we have can be used to a lot of different type of noise structure. So this is very good, but what So this is very good, but what w we are looking forward to the more possibility of this work because we believe that this problem, this criterion and the method introduced here has a hope to be applied for a large class of dispersal equations like Schrodinger equation and Cady equations. And we are now also considering a case that if we replace the bounded noise by an unbounded noise or even white noise and we want to And uh we want to also want to show if we can use some uh non-linear geometry control techniques on this uh problem. So that's uh I think I shall stop here. Thank you.
