Welcome back for the afternoon session. So, who's the talk by Pien Nguen? She will speak at the fundamental gap in ingredients, theory for an important spaces. Thank you for coming and thank you for inviting me to this talk. So, this is a highlight of What happened in the theory of keeping the fundamental gap? So I will talk about Euclidean space, I will talk about spherical space, and then hyperbolic space. So introduction. Given a bounded smooth domain omega, then Mn, so Euclidean spherical hyperbolic. The eigenvalue equation of that fraction is minus. Is minus lambda phi minus delta phi plus lambda phi. But delta is an appraction. The eigenfunction sometime will be phi, sometimes will be u, sometime will be h. Please adapt to that. So we know that the first eigenvalue is simple. That there's going to be a second eigenvalue that will form a discrete, so sequence that goes to infinity. Sequence that goes to infinity. Sometimes when Laplace plus a potential or convex potential is considered, most of the talk is going to just be potentially zero. One property that we know is that there's monotonicity. So if omega 1 is a subset of omega 2, then lambda 1, lambda 2. Lambda 1, lambda k of omega 1 so it would be bigger than lambda k of omega 2. You can see that will be at least for lambda 1 the radiquotient formulation, which I will give you later in the talk. So definition, the gap between the first two eigenvalues of the Lafraction or more generally a true operator is called a fundamental gap. Operator is called a fundamental gap. It's very hard for people online to see after my bed. Yeah, apologies. So think of lambda one as the steady base state and lambda two as the next more excited state. So it's a simple. So physicists, mathematicians are interested in seeing how much energy it takes to go from steady state to the next level. Now this is kind of a lie, well a lot of people are interested in finding optimum of upper and lower bound. In this talk I will talk about the lower bounds of the fundamental. About the rowabounds of the fundamental. So let's do a simple example. Let's do a one-dimensional segment. The equation is phi second plus lambda phi equals zero. And then I look like we only know that the general solution is sine squared of lambda t equals. sine square root of lambda t equals lambda t. Now remember there is our European value condition. So we want it to be zero at zero, which is why C2 is gone. And we want it to be zero at L which means the square root of lambda is some integer transpi over integer. Okay, so the first eigenvalue is with k equals 1. The second one is with k equals 2. So 2 square minus 1 is 3. Fundamental gap is 3i square over x squared. Okay, so we've done a one-dimensional case. Let's do a two-dimensional case. So now it's a rectangle, 0m bar 0 epsilon. We separate variable this equation and I divide it by f8. So that's standard trick in either advanced undergrad or beginning graduate course. So the thing in red now is stress functions of y and the thing in blue is stress functions of x. So there were re-important constants. So there when we import a constant, the constant where we've seen in the previous slide, I write it as k squared pi square over epsilon square for the red one. That is the same constant here. It's k square pi square over epsilon square and lambda. But solve the one that mentioned before. So lambda is is constant plus n squared pi squared. Pi squared. So lambda 1, well, it's k equals 1, l equals 1. So I did that. For lambda 2, you have a choice. You can either increase k to 2 or increase l to 2. And you see that if you want the smaller one, you should increase l to 2. So now that two is pi square over epsilon square or pi square over n squared. square 4 pi square over L square. So the fundamental gap now is 3 pi square over L square, which is L is not really the diameter, but it's close to the diameter. And as epsilon goes to 0, then L converges to the diameter. And the fundamental gap could converge to 3 pi squared over D squared. So this is the second time we've seen 3 pi squared over D square. It's time to make a conjecture. And the conjecture says if you have a bounded convex domain, Rn, which would be the operator where V is convex, theoretically boundary condition, the fundamental gap conjecture, which was conjectured in the 80s, by 80s by Vandenberg Asbar. They noticed that the fundamental gap is always greater or equal than 3π squared over T squared, where T is the diameter of your domain. The lower bound is a close rate B equals 0, and the domain is a thin rectangular box. Example we just saw. So this is So this is like the outline of my car. So Levine did something in one dimension. Of course, we did something in one dimension, but he had the potential. And I will now talk about the proof. He proved the fundamental gap projection in one dimension. There is a technique called a one-point maximum principle that will get you I square over d square. I scroll over d square and I will talk about that. Then it was proved by Andrews and Prado that it's actually 3π square which is called the technique called the two-point maximum principle. After that it is generalized to STE. So it's better, but sure and just sell the state food to Andrews and Crudeberg. Ben Andrews and Judy Crudeberg. Ben Andrews and Julie. I would say if you have any question you should ask her, but she couldn't come today. That's very sad. She just said she would be pretty sad. She said she needed something fun to do at 5 a.m. So then for hyperbolic space I will explain why the conjecture is Why the conjecture is false. And then I will try to explain why for positive curvature. So now the curvature is no longer constant. The metric close to the sphere, in n equals 2, we also have this. So this is the same one-point maximum principle technique. Now, Ji Ching, Liu, and Julie Olet. Wrote it that work with triangles, one-dimensional collapse. Like you saw the rectangle collapse to a line, then the things with triangles, sectors collapsing. And Seto did computation for spherical unit, which are geodesic coming from North Pole to South Pole. So you take two geodesic. So you take two geodesic and form a present, and then half them to select half of those. And then its own computation. So I mentioned these, I will not talk much about those. So it actually would work this order. So one point maximum principle together, little bit about the two point maximum principle, and then hyperbolic space. Hyperbolic space. Okay. So one point maximum principle. So the notation is omega is a convex domain. U1 is the first argument function. U2 is the second argument function. And the fact that we need is that if u1 is log concave, that means log u1 is concave, then the fundamental gap is squared or more than parcel with squared. I will give you a sketch of that proof right now. And the first idea came out with single wang, yao, and yao. So, we're assuming U1 is block concave. So, block U1 is concave. And the idea is to look at W, which is U2 over U1. This function will satisfy normal environment conditions. Then compute the Laplace of the Voodoo. So I'm going to skip a little bit. two one minus one two three one square and then you do that one more time you get it up class two which means you're having that two some point you get it up class one which keeps you in this case that one And if you compute the rest, this is the equation for gradient of U. So law view one comes here. I'm going to cite something. This is most. This is most of their paper. Using this equation and the fact that it has no math boundary condition, they prove an estimate, which is gradient w square plus lambda two minus lambda one supremum w minus w squared. It's left side form the supremum of L2 minus W1 is supremum of W minus W. It takes a little bit. This is why they use draw concavity and we get this big inequality. So So there are other what do we do with this? I'm sorry, the first factor is the supremum of the two factor? Is that correct? Yes, it's a supremum. So this, of course, we can take out, but it's a supremum of the whole scale. Of course, the critical default thing happens when this gap is the feminum of Wikipedia. And well, the new should be writable. Well, maybe I don't have to. This is we call it W square and this we call it A square because it's a constant now. Because it's a constant now. So we get that gradient w is lambda 2 minus lambda 1 a square minus w square. And this may as well be a gradient of big w, because the supremum is a constant. So now I solve this a little bit. Square root of a square minus w squared. So I'll get two minus one. So what happens now is we take a look at the domain, we integrate between We integrate between q1 and q2 and q1 is exactly where del derview is equal to supremum and q2 is where del der W is equal to the infinite. So when you integrate this, you're integrating the constant of this path between q1 and q2. So on this side, you have square root of lambda 2 minus lambda 1 times almost the diameter. And on the left side, well this is, if I integrate this, this is an arc sign. This is the arc sign of W of A. So when length of W is, let me see from where we go. We go from Q1 to Q2. And let's w equal to C submun. Then beta W is zero. So arc sine of zero. So, let's start at Q2 Q2 when little w is the infemum, big w is supremum minus infemum, which is equal to a, so arc sine of 1 is pi over 2. And the other one, one big little w is supreme of big w. Supreme of big W is zero, x sign is zero. So what you end up with is pi squared over four SOI called the lambda two minus lambda one D square, which is their argument over. There are two things for that. It's an integration, stripped a little bit, but the main part of the proof is inequality. Then u john may improve it to get to pi square over d square. So it improves this argument. Now How do you prove local cavity? So we needed local cavity. How do we prove local cavity? This is the first sketch. So local cavity, where we set the function v to call law of u1. That class v happens to be to doing some computation in this form. And the goal is to prove that the hashing would be. That the cation would be at any point on the domain is negative semi-lift. That's not the case. So the argument goes like this. Suppose it's not. So then what happened? We take a family of domains. This is omega. And this is the last one. The first one is a small ball. So why small bomb? Because we know that if I do eigenvalue that I eigenfunction on this, then it's not concave. We can compute it for ball, it's known for small ball, that's true. And we take a one-fermulum convex domain that goes from omega naught to omega one. To omega 1 on omega t. So, yes, all we use will look like and we look at the first eigenfunction of any omega t. And suppose there is a first prime with t between 0 and 1 and a direction and a maximum point where we actually have that the second derivative of that direction is 0. So it's not. Is zero. So it's not negative, but it was the first time where it reaches zero. So note that for ij i and j not equal to one, it's negative semi-definite. So all the other direction, it's still going to be less or equal than zero. And lambda one of the j is gonna be zero. This one is our gonna optimal direction. Of optimal direction. The call is maximum physical. It's usually done, so it's a proof by contradiction. You have a maximum point at P0, you're going to prove that that class P11 is positive, which means it's a contradiction, therefore it's just true. Oh, I went a little too far. So the thing in blue is possible to improve it a little bit if you have a if you have instead of zero a positive function. So let me talk about how to prove block to calculate in R n So, an RN is actually fairly simple. So, that's one of the pass, so V11. And the nice thing about R of course is I can switch the order of it a bit. Then I use this thing. Derivative of lambda one is going to be zero. So we have a square in V square. So it's um The sum will be j minus yeah. This is you have a B1K, B, and actually yeah. And you have A2. Two one to one k So this is zero because of this and this is zero because e one one is maximum at p naught. So at p naught this is zero. This is zero. This is zero. So I don't quite have this. But this is not really the proof of rest here, and it could be fixed. Now I will tell you what happened on SN. So this is really the proof on SN. On SN well, we are the beyond this topic. When you switch the order here, there's a bunch of curvature which I'm not gonna and be. Derivative of B. So that's one switch. Second switch is we're gonna get some derivative of curvature and you're gonna get your curvature, something something, and second derivative. And second, they will be able to so second the derivative with this one, they will be able to hit this one. And spherical in the sphere, it's very nice because this is zero. Permit your tensor derivatives are zero. If you're working on something that doesn't have constant or it's not homogeneous, that doesn't have constant curvature tensor. Constant curvature tensor, then you will pick up stuff from this. This thing will end up adding some motors to that class beam. But the one, one thing would have a bunch of one, one, one, one, one. Would have a bunch of 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1. So we almost have a class, but we don't have the 1, 1 coordinate. But it's fine because the 1, 1 coordinate, V1, 1 is 0. And then when we switch over here, we also picked up a bunch of curvature stuff. So this thing is EJ11 plus. dj1 plus the bunch of curvature star and this gives me a gradient b square so this part adds negative radium v squared and again we don't have the one coordinate the first coordinate Coordinate, the first coordinate, the third, and there's too many ones in here. So this and this, we go to here, and it gives you delta one. And then there's this guy left over V1 squared. One squared. This one is zero. So for the sphere, it's actually strictly positive and it works. Now, for negative recursed things, it's not going to work. For things that don't have constant curvature, it's going to be really hard. Part because this comes out R for the sphere is nice because all of the sectional curvature were one, so we can combine all of it and that's how we get that pass. But if you have different curvature in different directions, then there's no combining to ever apply to you. Maybe you have one V1, one V22, and two V3, and it's not good work. And it's not good. Same thing here. This is not really combining. So, for example, the problem is still open for CPN. CPN is a nice manifold, but the curvature, textional curvature is not constant. There is some improvement to be done. Now, instead of zero, you can ask, hey, is it actually slightly Hey, is it actually slightly more negative? Is there B times the metric? And that's actually that's what that's the recent work. So yes, it's possible that then you're going to have an equation in B here. If the equation in B, or whatever B you choose, ends up being positive, then we can run to the argument and say, We can run to the argument and say fundamental gap is greater or equal than chi-squared over t squared. Slight improvement is very hard because of all the curvature terms that run around. Okay, so on Snow with I squared over D squared. Acts for d squared. One in 2000 did a slight improvement. So we found a B that could be a constant. And so if you have an improvement on locking cavity, you have a slight improvement on the lower bound on the fundamental gift. And some condition on positive decrease minor form n equals to. So we follow the function b. On if I close to or things that would be mostly close to the sphere. So Hibliochron Magic Turfin would anyway make sense. So now that's one point massive movement support. Oops. So now I'm going to talk about two point massive movements. Now, I'm going to talk about the two-point maximum principle and the proof of the fundamental gap in Rn. So to the point. So cocaine is the condition in one dimension. Instead of writing a second derivative, we can write a condition on the first derivative. Write the condition on the first derivative. Now we have two points: e prime y and which e prime x over y minus x is less than equal to zero. So what does it look in more than one dimension? The derivative are replaced by gradient, and now the direction is the direction of from y to x, not from x to y. X by yes, we did this. So this function is called the modulus of concavity. Concavity, it's a negative function if you get it proved concavity. Improve concavity, large concavity, then you can improve the bound on the fundamental gap. So the bone. So the first step, maybe the second step. The first step is to prove an improved binary cavity with a nice function here that is actually negative. And then the comparison of ODE and saying if this is true. And saying, if this is true, and this is a good function that solves a particular ODE, you have the fundamental gap. The 3 pi s go over d squared. So it was done in RN by Andrew Spreaderberg, and on SN, most of the people are here. The diagnosis away for Hila. So I asked them. So you could ask them. So this is what happened in Euclidean space. I'm going to spend only a minute telling you why two point is more information than one point. So if you have two point then you can take derivative in x. So things in x derivative y They use tensor notation. So think of this as there's a basis at x, there's a basis at y. I'm going to take a derivative only in the x direction, I'm going to take the derivative only in the y direction if I do this. And if it's crossed, then I take both at the same time. So if you have a two-point, then when you The two-point, then when you look at the fashion z, then you have this is like x-derivative. That's what we had before. You had a one-point differentiated at least one point. If you ignore the x and differentiate in this direction, you also have one point. You also have one point, which is y. But in the proof of the two points, there are the off-diagonal plots here. And that's what is used. So there's extra information that is here that is used for the two-fold mass lockets. If you want to do it on a manifold, it gets a little bit messy. Now, instead of the line between x and y, so geodesic, gamma. This is gamma. This is gamma of minus d over 2. And the rate unit dotted with the unit vector of it. It makes sense, it's almost the same as this, but then when you vary x and y and this goes around with destinies, and then you have to figure out what is the geodesic between this one and this one, which thankfully is nice on the sphere, but not that nice. And then take the derivative, it should suspect. So there's a lot going on on the two-point Going on on the two-point maximum principle. Okay. Convexity. So why does convexity matter? If you don't have a convex set, then you can make the fundamental gap go to zero. And it's very easy. To zero, and it's very easy. If you don't have a convex set, yet let's say I have a disk here and a disk here and a very, very small digit. On a disk, the first eigen function looks like that. Ignore this for a second. So it's either that one or For a second. So it's either that one or negative diagram. So the first eigenfunction on this is going to be this, but I can also construct one where it's positive here and I take negative here. So the flag and the weight functions are not multiple of each other. They would be here. But here they're not. Here they're not, and they have almost the same eigenvalue. So this would be lambda 1, this would be eigenvalue second eigenfunction, and so lambda 2 would converge to lambda 1 as the neck gets smaller and smaller. So we can play with the fact that if the place is a small neck, it almost acts like two disconnected cells. So, complexity allows you to get very quick. Say smallness actually don't exist if your status mention that another way to prevent small neck is to impose interior rolling ball condition. So if So if you put a ball of a certain diameter and roll it around the boundary and it stays in the interior, then there is a lower bound for the fundamental gap also. Okay, so hyperbiotic space. So, what happens in hyperbiotic space? There's a half-plane model the f square is the x square plus the y squared the y square this is the infinity and geodesics or And two desix or half circles that are perpendicular or this map and the disc geodesics are fast and for that also probably probably triver to infinity or Or diamonds So, this is a joint work with Wolfang, Julie Claudebach, Alina Theodora Borny, and Valentina Wheeler. We started with an article. Was an article brought to us and said, Well, she has an article that says there are convex domains in H2 such that the first eigenfunction is not log concave. So the path of, hey, we want to prove that the first eigenfunction is log concave and get a lower bound pi squared over d squared is not there anymore. And the only other result I know is a Banguria blender. Not going to use it, but it says that for valid domain without any context condition, if the domain has the same first eigenvalue as a ball of some radius, then the ball maximizes the setting of fundamental value. Okay. So we found that for she's example, for example she looks like this. It's part of the geodesic here, another geodesic here are sort of they have the same center. Sort of they have the same center if you look at these guys. And then we took away. And this is convex because things that run here and here are the geodesic is this way. Then we tread it off here. This is the domain. And then, so we found that for their mental gap conjecture is not true. There was still a question of whether there was a different constant, not being a high school mediation, but a different constant. And about a year later, we figured that there's actually no constant. So every time you give me a Every time you give me a constant epsilon, I can find a domain for which the fundamental gap is less than epsilon I squared over t squared. So there is absolutely no hope of finding the lower bound of older one over t squared. Um here is a very brief sketch of definition. Here's a very brief sketch of the proof. So that's the domain. It is inspired by Xi's domain, except she for some reason had a different angle here. We made a domain completely symmetric. Just angles and this radius goes from 1 to e to the pi over square root of mu. You'll see why it's crazy constant. And as mu goes through. And as mu goes to infinity, what happens is it gets thinner and thinner and thinner. So let's talk about the diameter. The diameter is a G by the distance P to R. And then there's very nice bound, lower bound, upper bound, independent of u, so we don't really have to deal with the diameter anything. Really, we have to deal with the diameter. Lower bound distance, yes, which you can compute explicitly because this guy is PTT So I'm actually Going to skip this. The nice thing that you should know about this is that it does have a nice separation of variable because metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric. We compute it. It separates nicely. And this is the first order where we have R. Order what we have R which brings the exponential, which is why this is a bit easy. So here is the plan. The plan is to show that the first eigenfunction begins that and show that the maximum moves towards minus n as mu goes to infinity. When it goes to infinity, we also want to show that this lower point goes to zero and that all the derivative of the first eigenfunction goes are nice and controlled. And you see, this function is really not lock concave. After the separation of variable, like in the rectangle case, we only need to find what happens to the first, the difference of the first and second eigenvalue of this equation. So write a rating quotient and when we look at lambda two minus lambda one. Lambda 2 minus lambda 1, instead of lambda 2, we take the Rayleigh function of s function that's perpendicular to each one. And then for lambda 1, we take the Rayleigh function that our first eigenfunction. So once you prove that the first eigenfunction looks like this, then a nice test function would be this guy. Would be this guy and this guy. So, in order to build the second test function, we just multiply H1 by a transition function that goes from 1 to negative 1. So this will serve as the test function for the second adding function. And if everything is smart enough here, Everything is small enough here. Whatever you do here, it's so small that the difference will be good to see. So I'm gonna skip a bunch of the proof and I'm going to stop here for one second. So, the goal is to prove that in the middle it grows exponentially, it behaves like cosh. Because this thing is positive, and so solution of something like that will behave like a cosh or sitch. But it really goes exponentially in the way that because it goes so fast, each one has to go to zero. So I can skip the proof because so we did all the proof. First we did a bunch of MATLAB computation that tells us the fundamental gap goes to zero. We didn't believe it. Then we did the proof and then we're like, okay, this is true, but why is it true? Why it's true is because I show you the picture of the I show you the picture of the domain like this in the half-frame model. If you look at it in the front camera in this model, this is a geodesic, this is a geodesic, the domain has a neck curve. Here, the distance is smaller than the distance. So it's convex, but it has a neck in hyperbody space. The hyperbody space allows you to have necks for convex domain. For convex domain. And as this shrinks to zero, this distance shrinks to zero. So the neck gets smaller and smaller. You get in this configuration and the fundamental gap goes to zero. So I gave this talk at Iowa State University because we have a geometric analysis seven in R. And we created it so the faculty there gets to give a lot of talks. So I gave this talk, and one of our new faculty gave a card framework. This should happen in hyperbolic space, like any negatively curved space, because if you have a negatively curved space, it can also be in domains with that's the next. That's the next variable negatively pinched curvature. So let Mn beyond to remain manifold, the session of curvature is negatively pinched. And suppose there exists a minimizing geodesic of length D. So indeed our original geodesic, then for all epsilon there is a domain bigger diameter. Omega of diameter d, which is geodesically convex, and again, it's best at epsilon rubber. So it's almost the same idea, but there's no separation, no variable, so there's no ODE, and there's no symmetry. We use symmetry to say, oh, we're going to transition from plus one to minus one, and that function is perpendicular because Perpendicular because everything is symmetric. So here's the plan of this. First, there's no symmetry, but there is comparison theorem that says if you have same thing here. If you get geodesic NH N or it's doing two damage and then we start a geodesic here and it's going to spread quite fast So, because it spreads so fast, there's always a way to put a big enough rectangle away from the neck so that I can control the first egg. And then to get it into an ODE, this is not a new idea, but But this is the x direction, we're going to integrate over slices like this. So suppose define v to be the integral of h1 square over slice and take the second derivative. So again, we want to say that v grows exponentially. So this is computation. If the metric is nice, then the second derivative would come in here. That would give you this part. I replace the second derivative and we just back to actively. derivative with respect to x of h1 by Laplace minus second derivative with respect to 1. And then I have a gradient with respect to x squared. That's about lambda 1 h1 squared. That's the first eigen function. This getting made by part because everything is nice and zero on the boundary. I don't really care about boundary terms. Don't really care about boundary terms, you have this gap. So ignore this. What this says is that we're really looking at the first eigenvalue on cross-slices, the y-square, which is going to be very large because the neck is very small. They're comparing it to lambda 1. Into Lambda 1. But Lambda 1 is not so large because there's a big giant dock sitting in the domain. So it's kind of a tussle between how big the neck is, how big the vertical slices of the neck are, and how big lambda one is. As I said, lambda one, not so big because I can put a big I can put a big chunk here. In here, this is going to be small compared to what happens earlier. And so if it's greater than a constant V, then my V grows exponentially in the center. And as before, if you have exponential growth and everything is normalized, then it can't be that big here because otherwise everything. Here because otherwise everything goes up too much, so it has to be small. If it's small, I can construct another function. Same idea. So if this is h1, I can construct another function that transitions. So what do we do about the lack of symmetry? How do I know that this guy is perfectly connected to each one? This is when we take, we actually take a family of domains. But this domain, this is not going to work, where if I take the inner product of h1 and my test function is going to be negative one. To negative one. This domain is not going to work, but it goes from plus one to negative one. So somewhere in the middle, there is a domain that still has a big enough box for which the who, like the first and this test function is are going to be perpendicular. So instead of knowing it's going to work, we have Now I get a work. We have we actually do the whole thing for the fancum domain and one of the domains. There is a so there's a continuity argument. This is the last theorem. It's also possible to do it if you have one tangent pain of negative sectional coverage, not negative sectional effort. But the price to pay is that the domain is going to have to have a small diameter because now the curvature derivatives might be Curvature derivatives might be crazy, and so the diameter has to be small enough so that we keep enough negative curvature. So what do we do with the positive curvature? Well, if it's negative curvature in this direction and positive in this direction, you have to make sure that the height of the negative curvature is small enough compared to the depth. Small enough compared to the depth of the positive curvature, so that whatever happened in the negative curvature and the growth would be what happened in the positive curvature. So positive curvature behaved like cosine. Cosine doesn't move as fast as cosh. And so we have to control the ratio of depth to height so that we keep what's happening in the negative curvature. Keep what's happening in the negative curvature there. And it's not beaten, but what happened in positive curvature. So diameter is small because curvature and its derivative can change. What happens to the metric? Well, there is sadly vector expansion of the metric at the pool. The metric is So the metric is the standard metric plus if you expand the lower order terms are again curvature starts to show up. So we have to control it quite enough, which is why the domain can be very, very small. But it's still possible to do it in if you only have one plane of negative. Kind of negative approach. So that's the end of my talk. Thank you.
