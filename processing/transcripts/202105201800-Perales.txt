Invitation. I want to apologize if you have seen this talk, but okay, let's start. So my talk is going to be like this. I'm going to give the motivation and then we are going to talk about the convergence results that my collaborators and myself proved. I'm going to tell you a little bit about intrinsic flat distance and Intrinsic flat distance, and if time permits, I'll tell you how to prove the main theorems. So, let's start with the motivation. So, the motivation is that we can study Riemannian manifolds that have a lower bound in the Ricci curvature and that have a bound on the volume. So, this bound says that our manifolds are going to be non-collapsed. Collapsed, and if we impose that our manifolds are closed, so they are going to be compact and they won't have boundary, then we might impose a diameter bound so they don't converge to something that doesn't have a diameter bound. So, under these conditions, this class of manifolds that they are written in this way are Chromo-Hauser pre-compact. Chromohausor pre-compact, so they converge. I mean, if you have a sequence, then there will be a sub-sequence that will converge, but it does not necessarily converge to a manifold in this class. It will converge to a metric space, and actually the metric space is quite nice because you can divide it in a regular part, and the regular part will have the same dimension as the dimension of. As the dimension of your manifolds. So, this is the dimension of your manifolds. And the singular part will be of co-dimension two. And moreover, if you enlarge a little bit the regular part, you can actually show that this is C1 alpha. Well, and actually, U means trigger colding proof that this enlargement of the regular part is C1 alpha. C1 alpha. Okay, so here is a little bit of history. Bishop-Gramov volume comparison theorem implies the pre-compactness, and Schiger-Colding proved that the limits are nice. So because Gramov-Hauser convergence seems to be very nice, we want to prove some theorems. And what Chigger and Colding proved in 1997 was the following. So if you have a sequence of closed Riemannian manifolds here of the Manifolds here of the same dimension, the dimension is M, whose first Betty number equals the dimension of your manifold, and your Richie is almost zero. Okay, so Rich is bounded below by this negative number, and this sequence of negative numbers is converging to zero. And we fix the diameter, then there is a sub-sequence that converges in chromophauser sense to a flat torus. Sense to a flat torus. And actually, you can prove more. You can prove that there is an epsilon that depends only on your dimension. And once that you are epsilon close to a torus, you are actually a C1 alpha torus. And I mean, this is shown because you have this C1 alpha metric. Sorry, C1 alpha manifold. Okay, so you are actually. Okay, so you are actually by holder to Ataurus once that you reach this curvature, reach lower bound curvature estimate. So Grammo-Hauser convergence seems to be very powerful, but something happens if you remove this Ricci condition and you replace it by a scalar curvature condition. So here we have two very Have two very famous theorems proven by Shen-Jiao, Gromov-Lawson, and by Shen-Jiao in Witten, and they say the following. If you have a torus whose negative scalar curvature is greater or equal than zero, then you actually have to be a flat torus. So this scalar curvature condition is telling you that actually the sectional curvature should be equal to Curvature should be equal to zero. And this second theorem, which I'm just writing part of it, so this is part of the positive mass theorem, says that if you have a manifold, and here I'm just writing three because of convenience. So if you have a three-dimensional manifold with a scalar curvature that is non-negative and ADM mass that is zero, then your manifold has to. Then your manifold has to be equal to the Euclidean space of dimension 3. So these are very nice theorems in which you have a scalar curvature and you can deduce something very rigid about your metric. And then you wonder what happens if I try to prove a similar theorem as Tigger and Golding did. So what about if we relaxed one of the conditions? Conditions. But actually, if you try to use Chromo-Hausdor distance, there will be a lot of sequences that will converge to something that is not going to be a nice manifold. So it's not going to be a platorus if you require scalar curvature almost zero. And you won't converge to a Euclidean space if you relax the ADM mass. If you relax the ADMS condition. Okay? But they converge to nice to what you expect to if you use the intrinsic flat distance. So these are the following results. So using this theorem, we are going to prove Aptorus stability result. And this theorem was proven by It was proven by Alan, Sormani, and myself last year, and it says the following. So, we are actually going to fix our manifold. And this is the manifold, well, I mean, we fix our manifold and a Riemannian tensor. And this is actually the manifold that we want to converge to. So, here you see, we want to converge to this manifold. And what we have to impose to the have to impose to the sequence so the sequence mj is that we have the same differential manifold and then these dj's are Riemannian tensors that can only be continuous so actually that's very nice because you don't need the whole regularity of your Riemannian tensor and you require these three conditions so this So this diameter bound is actually very, I mean, very common. And now we have these other two conditions. So one is on the Riemannian tensors. So you actually want that the distances in your space to which you want to converge to be smaller than the distances in the other manifolds. And this one, you want the volume to actually converge to the volume of MCO. To the volume of M0. And actually, I mean, once that you require this first condition at the level of the Riemannian tensors, you actually have that the volume of mj is greater or equal than the volume of m0. So it makes sense that if gjs are kind of converging to g0, well, you will have the volume of mj converging to the volume of m0. Okay, so Okay, so this, so if you have these three conditions, then you converge in intrinsic flat sense to M0. And this is a picture that shows what can happen. So here in the inside of my picture, I have a sphere and then I have these other spheres, but these other spheres have like bigger distances. Like bigger distances. So, these spheres that have kind of spikes, the spikes are becoming thinner and thinner, and actually, you can have more and more and more. But using this intrinsic flat distance, they will still converge to this sphere. Okay, so then with that theorem, with Cabera Pacheco and Christian Ketterer, we proved that if you, okay. That if you okay, what we did is we found a class of tori. So, this MDA is a tori. They satisfy certain conditions that are encoded here. I mean, basically, this D is a diameter bound, and this A is a non-collapsing bound. And if you require your tori or your sequence of tori to have a scale. Of tori to have a scalar curvature almost non-negative, then the whole sequence actually will converge to a torus, which is a flat torus, and it will converge in this sense, in intrinsic flat sense. And okay, so what I want to remark is that this class was inspired by the work of Huang Li and Huang Li Sormani, and they did some. and they did some work about the positive mass theorem, stability of the positive mass theorem, which I'm going to recall in the next slide. And this type of stability results are proven, I mean, people want to prove this type of stability results for Torai. And some of the people that have done this are the following. So this first group in First group in Brown. So, this is one paper, and they use Chromo House of convergence, and actually, they have like very restrictive hypotheses, and that's why they can prove Chromo House of convergence. And not only that, but C0 convergence of your sequences, of their sequences. And then there is a paper by Alan, and he studies torized, I mean conformal torized. I mean, conformal to rise. Also, Chu and Li study conformal to rise. And then there is this new paper by Lee Neighbor and New Meyer. And actually they propose a new type of distance, which is actually a combination of Chromo-Hauser distance, but you don't look at the length distance of the manifolds, but you look at at different type of distance. Okay. Okay, so the next result, in order to tell you about the stability of the positive mass theorem, is the following. And it looks very similar to the theorem that Alan and Sormani and myself proved. The only difference here is that we will allow our manifolds to have boundary. Okay, so M is a manifold now with. M is a manifold now with boundary, and we require the following condition. So for our tensor G0, we want that M0 has totally convex interior. So what does that mean? So that means that whenever you have two points in the interior of your manifold, you can connect them by a geodesic, and this is going to be a G0 geodesic, and this G0 geodesic has to be in. Geodesic has to be inside the interior of M0. And actually, when we apply this theorem, we just apply it to an Euclidean ball or a hyperbolic ball, which is totally convex. Okay, and then the other Riemannian tensors, the ones that can be only continuous, we only require this extra condition that the volumes of the boundary. That the volumes of the boundaries can be uniformly bounded by some constant A. And so, under these three conditions that we already have, and this condition and the totally convex interior, we can also prove intrinsic flat convergence to our fixed manifold M0. Okay, and so using And so, using this theorem, we can prove an instability result of the positive mass theorem. So, what we did, okay, so all this started in the following way. First one, Li define a class of manifolds in which they could prove stability of the positive mass theorem by using the flat distance. But using the flat distance. And then Sormani came in into the picture and they refined that class. And for that class, they proved intrinsic flat stability of the positive mass theorem. But then there was some gap, and that's where Alan and myself appeared. And then we gave a full proof in Wangle and Perales. And the theorem, which theorem which i mean i'm not stating the way it was proven there uh goes more more or less like this so you have this uh class of manifolds which are which are going to be complete and asymptotically flat and actually they are so if your manifolds are of dimension n these mj's are actually embedded in the euclidean In the Euclidean space of dimension n plus one. So actually, they are graphs over a function. So you have a function that goes from Rn minus possibly one ball that you take off, and then mj is this nice graph. Okay, so we have these manifolds in Euclidean space of dimension m plus one, and we are able to. And we are able to prove that when we intersect our manifolds with a cylinder, so this is the cylinder, these vertical lines represent the cylinder. So then we end up with manifolds that are actually compact and that have boundary. Actually, they have two boundaries. So the outer boundary and the inner boundary. So these manifolds will converge in intrinsic flat sense. In intrinsic flat sense, to what we expect, which is the ball in Euclidean space of dimension n. Okay, so these are the two technical results and the two applications of our technical results. And now I would like to talk a little bit about ingency flat convergence, which I think is kind of hard to. I think it's kind of hard to define. I never know how to start. So let me try. And I don't know. I mean, if you want to take a break, you can come back after five minutes because we actually only need that it looks very similar to the grandma house or distance. Okay, but if you want to know the technical details, here they go. So we start with a metric space, which is going to be complete, and then we are going to define this M plus one topos. So this M plus one topos consists of Lipschitz functions, so all of them are Lipschitz functions, but the first one we want it to be bounded. And these n plus one topos, we think of them as. M plus one topos, we think of them as m dimensional forms if you were in a in a manifold of dimension m. Okay, and then a current it's a linear functional, it's actually multilinear function which takes values in this dm set and it goes to R. Okay, and it satisfies certain conditions that I will tell you about in a minute, but before that, minute but before that let me give you the basic example in which we are going to define a current in Rm, so Euclidean space of dimension m, and we only need to have a function theta, which is going to be L1. And actually we call this function our weight function. So and what it does to a topple in here is the following. Is the following. So the first entry, you multiply it by theta, and that's why it looks like theta is a weight. So you are weighting your function f by multiplying it by theta. And then here you take the derivative of this m topple of Lipschitz functions. So then you get an m by m matrix, and you can take the determinant. So this is like a Jacobian. Like a Jacobian. So you have this Jacobian and you have your weight, and here you have your function f of x. Okay, so this is the basic example. But here we are in Rm. And remember, I told you that we can use any complete metric space. So what do we do if we want to have currents in a general metric space? Well, basically, Well, basically we do the following. We take a Lipschitz function from a set in Euclidean space to our complete metric space and then take the push forward of this current. And the push forward of this current just means that here you have your weight, you compose your function f with phi, and you compose your function. And you compose your function pi with phi. So everything makes sense now, and well, you integrate this quantity. Okay, so now let me tell you which were the properties that define a current that I skipped. Maybe the first two are not too important right now. What is important? Right now, what is important is the following. So there exists a measure, a finite boreal measure, mu such that the following is satisfied. So if you take the absolute value of your current t and you evaluate it in any m plus one topo, f pi, you want this inequality to be satisfied. Okay, and if you think about my basic Think about my basic example. What we are actually doing is that so you can bound this determinant by the Lipschitz constants of this pi's. And so at the end, what we are going to get as a measure is this weight multiplied by the Leverett measure. Okay, so basically, that's what we have here at the end. And the other property. And the other properties that are or definitions of currents that are useful, well, we already see the push forward. We can define the boundary of a current and it's just put a one here and then put all the other entries that you have here. Okay, and here we have a mass measure. Mass measure is the smallest boreal measure that satisfies this. That satisfies this condition. Okay. And then you take the mass of your current and it just evaluates your measure in the whole metric space. And then we have nice points. So nice points are the points which have positive lower semi-continuous density with respect to this measure that we just found out. Measure that we just found out. Okay, so let me see how much time do I have. Okay, so maybe let me skip some of the definitions and let's look actually to one very basic example. So we have a sub-manifold in a Euclidean space. So we actually, I mean, for sub-manifolds, we have charts, and actually, we can Charts, and actually, we can find charts that are just by lip sheets. And we just take the push forward of the functions that are constant equal to one. So my weights are one. And if you want to look at the example, I mean, this example is not really what I have in this formula in orange, because actually I'm choosing for this part of my manifold, I'm choosing the weight to be one, but for this part of my manifold. for this part of my manifold I'm actually using the function equal to two in this part. But that's the way currents look like. And an important thing that happens is that then the measure that I get using this complicated formula is just the volume measure. I mean, this is when I choose weight equal to one. And then the mass of my current is simply the volume of my manifold. And then the boundary. Default. And then the boundary can go inside these brackets. So the boundary of my current given by M is just the current given by boundary of M. If I have this more complicated picture, we will actually get to boundary components, one that comes from the outer part and one that comes from this inner side. And this happens because the multiplicity is dropping. Is dropping. Okay. So that's the basic example. That's what we have to have in mind. And once that we have that in mind, I can take the distance between these two currents. And the distance between two currents that actually should have the same dimension is the following. We are going to take an infimum of masses of some other currents. Of some other currents, and these other currents have to satisfy this very nice equation, which is actually represented in this picture. Okay, so I have current in red, current in blue, and I have a yellow current, which is this two-dimensional current, and this green current, which are the sides of this picture. And when I take the boundary of this manifold, The boundary of this manifold, I mean, this manifold is oriented, then I get as boundary these three parts, and actually, this equality is going to be satisfied. So, we take the infimum over all these masses. And remember that for manifolds, masses is just the volume of the manifolds. Okay, and we are almost. We are almost at the end of this very long section. So, let me just tell you what is finally intrinsic flat distance. So, intrinsic flat distance, you will have your metric spaces, a current defined on your metric spaces. This current has to satisfy other conditions that I didn't mention, but just think of them as metric spaces and a current. And then, what you do is you embed Do is to embed these metric spaces in a larger space set, and then you can take push forward of these currents T1 and T2. So I take the push forward, and then there I measure the flat distance between them. And remember, the flat distance is calculated in this way. And so, this is the equation that I wanted you to have in mind. That to define intrinsic flat distance is Define intrinsic flat distance is very similar to when you define Chromohausdorff distance. Okay, and so because they are very similar, we can actually prove that the intrinsic flat distance equals to zero if and only if geometric spaces are isometric, but they also have to preserve the current. So this push forward of T1 has to be equal to T2. And well, here And well, here I have the basic example that I already explained. That if you have a compact Riemannian manifold, well, you have your space, your metric space, m dj, and then the current that we just saw. So you just chop off your manifold with Lipsheet charts and then take the push forward of currents that have weight equal to one. Good. And this is the picture that will tell us basically what you have to do to prove the theorems that I presented. So if you want to estimate ingen sig flat or chromohaz or distance between two spaces, well, I told you you have to embed the metic spaces. So actually, it reduces to construct the metic spaces or find them. And so you have to be very clever finding or constructing these spaces. And once that you are clever, you also have to be clever about which conditions you have to impose to your manifolds M0 and M1, so you are able to construct a space that tells you that then the distance is small enough. Okay, so if you have a sequence of manifolds and you want to show it convergence. Manifolds, and you want to show it converges to M0, you hope that well-chosen embeddings and well-chosen metric spaces will satisfy that the house of distance inside of these well-chosen spaces goes to zero. The limit of these distances goes to zero. Okay. So proofs. In the remaining minutes, let me tell you how. Let me tell you how we construct these spaces. So, what I'm going to try to tell you is how to prove the theorem of Alen Perales and Sormani and Alen and Perales. And I'm not going to talk about how to prove the applications. The applications need more work. They don't follow straightforwardly. But let me just tell you about the technical results. Technical results. Okay, so here is how we construct our metric space. So remember that we have a fixed manifold which is oriented and compact. So here I'm writing compact because with Alen and Perales, we don't need our manifold to be closed. So we allow boundary. Okay, so this term works for both cases. So you have your fixed manifold. So you have your fixed manifold and you have your fixed remaining tensors. And then what we are going to do is the following. Well, we require this condition. So we require that our manifold has a set W, and this set W has to have big measure inside M. And when I say big measure inside M, this is what I'm talking about. So the volume with respect to any of the With respect to any of these Riemannian tensors, it has to be very small. And actually, we want these pj's to go to zero as j goes to infinity. And we also want this following quantity to be satisfied at the level of the length distances of my manifolds. So we want that this tensor, well, this distance with this tensor is less or equal Is less or equal than the distance with respect to 10 sort of zero plus some error. And remember that I told you, because we have this condition, we actually know that in the whole manifold, in the whole M, the distance with respect to G0 is less or equal than the distance with respect to GJ. So here we are actually saying that we want in this set W that the This set W that the distances are actually very, very similar. Okay, so then we construct, well, we take this number hj that is going to be a height and depends in these parameters, so the delta j's and the diameter of your manifolds, which actually we require to be bounded in our main theorem. So we set up these heights and then We set up these heights and then the metric space that we construct is basically just like a tube. I mean, it's mj times, or let's say a cylinder, right? So it's mj times this interval. But then we have to glue some parts to one side and to the other side of the cylinder. So in the zero height, we glue M0 with the identity. Zero with the identity function, and to the other side, we will glue only in the points that are outside of this set W. Well, the closure of the set W. Okay? And we have to give an appropriate distance to this set because, I mean, this is just a set. So we have to give a nice distance so that we can embed our manifold N0. embed our manifold M0, we can embed also our manifold MJ. And once that we have these embeddings, we can also embed the currents and calculate the flat distance. And the flat distance is going to have this very nice bound. So we will bound it by two times these VJs, which are actually going to go to zero. 0, these heights, which are also going to go to 0, multiplied by this volume, which actually will converge to the volume of M0. And again, these are going to be bounded. I mean, Hj goes to 0 and volume of Mj is going to be bounded. So we will get in the end that our sequence converges. Okay, so once that you came up with this idea, You came up with this idea. The only thing that you need to do is: how do you get these sets? W's? Okay. Well, I mean, here I wanted to explain a little bit how to calculate this flat distance. And I mean, I told you that this set Z is basically a cylinder, but M0 has smaller details. But M0 has a smaller distance than Mj. So actually, this is the picture. So this is M0. No, this is M0. This is Mj. And with a one-lips function, you can pass from this cylinder to this cone. And actually, it's easier to make calculations with a cylinder and then use this one-lipschitz function to get the estimates that look very similar to this equation. Equation. So basically, work with cones and cylinders and Lipschitz functions, and that works. And this is actually the picture of the manifold. So the sphere is the manifold with the Riemannian tensor G0. The blue part is going to be the set W, the one that has very big volume and the one whose distances are very close to what you want to converge. What you want to converge, and these yellow parts are the parts that we don't want, so that's actually your manifold minus W. Okay, so this is the nice picture of what is going on. And actually, this is the gluing. So, this is your space. And remember that we only identified in the set W and we glue the remaining parts. Okay, so now. Okay, so now in the last minutes, let me tell you how to construct this set W. So here I have basically repeated the conditions that I have in my main theorem. We have our tensors to be bounded this way. We have a volume bound. I mean, we will have later on volume convergence, but this is enough. And then if you have, if you are. We if you have if you are able to prove that almost everywhere your distances converge so dj pq converges to d0 of pq under this condition then we will have our sets w lambda k. Okay, so here I wrote the theorem in the way we actually prove it. It's, I mean, you have to use several parameters, but if you want to just think about the big idea. to just think about the big idea that that i gave in in this in this um theorem okay but we we had to deal with several parameters in order to to one have that the distance with respect to the remaining tensor gj is less or equal than the distance with respect to g0 plus some error and that the volumes of these sets are actually going to converge. Going to converge to zero. Okay, I mean, this will converge to this volume, and here we are dividing by kappa, and this kappa is just any number that is bigger than one. So, okay, so actually, once that you have basically this condition, you are able to prove the existence of this W lambda lambda cap. And how to prove this? Well, actually, this was. Well, actually, this was something that Alan and Sormani had already proven. So we actually had this for free. And so how to do the last part? How do you get W lambda kappa? Okay, so let me tell you quickly how you do that. Okay, so what you know is that the volume of MJ's is going to converge to the volume of M0. To the volume of m0, and you have that these dj's will converge to this d0. But remember that here I have almost every pq. So I'm actually looking at these distance functions as if they were defined in m times m, not just in m. So because they are defined in m times m, what you really, really know is that there is a set S containing S. S contained in M0 times M0 that has very big volume, so almost the volume of M0 squared, in which this condition is satisfied. Okay, so you have this condition, but here, remember, you have points in M cross M. You don't have it separately. So, what we have to do is just take projections. So, this. So these are my projections, sp epsilon. So I choose a point P and I project all the points Q that are remaining. And I want that these projections of this, so it's basically S epsilon and you make the projections to M and you want these projections also to have very big volume. And then these projections that have volume almost the volume of your manifold, you The volume of your manifold, you want that to be in your set. Okay, so these projections that have very big volume, you want them in your set. And for these projections, well, this theorem is going to work. Well, there are more things that you have to check, like the volume bounce, and finally get at this. This is just like a This is just like a triangle inequality, and knowing that all your slices have very big volume, so then this quantity has to be satisfied. And well, just to recapitulate, that's the way we prove theorem one and theorem two. By Allen and Sormani, we have that the distances converge almost everywhere, and then And then, using previous steps, we find this W that has big volume and whose distance, and I mean, and when you restrict your distance dj to these sets, it's almost the distance of d0 plus some some here. And we dose w lambda k to construct these spaces and these spaces isometrically embed in the Symmetrically embed in the space that you constructed because you constructed it very carefully. And so you have that at the end the flat distances between your manifolds converge to zero. And that's it. Yeah, I'm not in Oaxaca, but I expect it to be in Oaxaca. Thank you for your attention. Thank you very much. Do we have questions for Jaquel? So I'm curious about the what's the relation between this flat convergence and Gromov house door? Is there any? Well, so there is actually one flat distance and house door distance. And flat distance was used by And flat distance was used by Feder and Fleming to solve the plateau problem. And I mean, it used kind of minimal surfaces, but then if you study minimal surfaces, then they also have like bifault convergence and other types of convergence which are weaker. And then, so that's at the same level of like you fix your metric space or your manifold and then you study what is inside. And then when you want to make the definition an intrinsic definition, An intrinsic definition, then it's chromo-hauser convergence or intrinsic flat convergence. And I mean, yes, if your manifolds, well, I mean, it's not that if you have intrinsic flat, that implies Chromo-Hausdorff, that doesn't happen. And also, the other implication does not happen. But when you have both convergences, intrinsic flat and Chromo-Hausdorff, then in Gromo-Hausdorff, then intrinsic flat limits are contained in the Gromo-Hausdorff limit. But contained means that your intrinsic flat limit can be something that is called the zero limit. And that happens when the dimension drops. Okay, interesting. Is there any sort of compactness result for intrinsic flat? Yes, there is. Then you only need to bound the diameter and the mass of your The diameter and the mass of your current, and the mass of the boundary of the current, and you converge to something that is countably rectifiable. I mean, you converge, it's actually a compactness theorem. So you end up in what is called what? A space, this, I mean, this space, metric space, and this current, which is nice. Yeah. Okay, cool. Thank you. Cool, thank you. Are there any other questions? Okay, well, let's thank Arkel again.
