Thank you so much for the invitation from the organizers. Hello, everyone. Okay, let's start. So, to give a context, first we are in the context of chair numbers geography, which is of three-fold general type, which is the study of slopes of chair numbers given in the projected plane over the Projective plane over the rational numbers. In this case, we have the chair numbers coincid with these three quantities. These quantities are four minimal threefolds, zero of general type over C. In this case, just to have this in mind, is that the minimum treefold of general type has positive volume. So in the projected In the projected plane, we always will have a chart to study. We always can study this problem in the first chart, distinct from zero. And classically, these invariants are the volume of the canonical divisor, which is the tripling intersection of the canonical class. We have the analytic Euler characteristic with the alternating sum of the cohomology. Sum of the comology dimension of the surface chip, and we have the topological Euler characteristic, which is the alternate sum of the Betty numbers. An important feature is that from minimal model program, these numerical quantities are invariant between the minimal models of the rational class. So these slopes are well defined. Then a very brief Then, a very brief history of geography is first that in dimension one, there is a unique churn number, which is two minus two g, which can see the degree of the canonical divisor. And in this case, geography asks for curves of genus G greater or equal than two. And in this case, we just have to construct all of them. Sorry, to construct a curve of genus G, we just have to consider a double cover of the Riemannian stream. There is a double cover of the Riemann sphere branched at 2G plus 2 points. In dimension 2, the problems becomes harder. And in this case, we have just two churn numbers, which are the self-intersection of the canonical class and the topological characteristic. Since this problem becomes really hard, words of Hirsch Brook Person Somese show that if we Somese showed that if we consider the slopes approach, in this case, we get a compact zone where we have a density of these slopes. And then to these days, there are density results in the interval one, two, three after we fix an x-ray variant, in this case, the fundamental group. In all this previous result, the n-root cover construction were. The n-roots cover construction were a key tool. So, the question is: it is possible to get an optimal georgian for slopes of threefolds? Well, it is proved that in general, in any dimension, the churn slopes for a threefold general type lies in a compact region. But the problem is, what is that region? So, the key point. And the key point is that n-root covers allow us to create massive families of batteries with controlled churn numbers. And this is because we start with a pair, SIDA and D, where SIDA is a non-singular default, in this case, very general. And D is an effective divisor whose components are D1 to DR with simple number crossings. And this means that the divisor looks This means that the divisor looks locally as the intersection of no more than the ever planes for local, in this case, for local coordinates CDA1 to CDAD. And this means that locally, for example, in dimension two, a device of this kind looks like the intersection of two lines. And in dimension three, we have two cases, the intersection of two lines. We have two cases: the intersection of two planes or the intersection of three planes with a triple intersection point here. So any such divisor has a logarithmic differential shift. And this is the vector bundle generated by one force with the most simple powers at D. And this is a shift that characterizes the open variety given by zeta minus. Variety given by zeta minus d. And since this is this is a vector bundle, we have logarithmic classes, it's shared classes and shared numbers. And we put the name logarithmic here. So to drop down this definition, for example, in dimension two, for curves, the logarithmic turn number coincides precisely number coincides precisely with 2 minus 2g minus the the the quality of the of divisors that in this case they are points and in dimension greater or equal than two we have that the the the first logarithmic nature number coincides with this uh top dimensional product and on the other side the top dimensional logarithmic churn number coincides with the difference between Coincides with the difference between the topological class of the variety minus the topological class of the divisors. And the importance of the logarithmic churn numbers is that they depend explicitly on the combinatorics of the pair, including the intersection theory. So, the main construction here is that we fix a prime number and greater than one, and we assume. And we assume that there are integers between zero and n, and the existing of a line bundle L, such that we have this linear equivalence between divisors, then we can construct a normal n-root cover which is branched at D and is etal of degree D over zeta minus D in this open variety. So So this construction is basically the generalization of the following example. We start with our liner sections on the projective space of dimension three in variables C1 to C4. And in this case, we assume that the hyperplanes given by this linear section are in general position. So in this case, this liner equivalence. The this liner equivalence becomes just the to a assume or a partition of the number n. And in this case, then root construction is just the normalization of this projective variety given by this homogeneous polynomial. So, the main remark is that for curves, in this case, each one. In this case, each one will be a point, and we have the theorem of Riemann-Hurbit. And we have the following observation: is that if we compare the Furture number over n, we get the seed entity. And when we take n to the infinity, we get the logarithmic churn number, which is the difference between the furature number of the curve minus the quantity of points of the divisor. Of the device. So the question is: does this happen in higher dimensions? This means that for n sufficiently large, we expect a strong relation between these ratios of churn numbers and the logarithmic churn classes of the pair. The problem here is that, as the case of curves, a normal curve is always Always smooth. So, churn numbers are always a resolution of singularities such that we have a notion of churn number or some equivalence with another numerical quantities. And a key property of the simulativ of the n-root cover is that they are toric, so we can use So, we can use Tauric methods to resolve these singularities. And a partial answer is that this is true in dimension two. So let me explain a little bit about that. First, over an intersection of two components of the divisor, the singularity of Yn looks this a fine. looks this a fine variety given by this polynomial where the q j k in this case depends by the these two multiplicities of the of the divisor and this case this singularity is homomorphic to the product of cq with the affine spatial surface signal cohesion Affine spatial surface sigma quotient singularity of type q1 over n. And recall that a default sigma quotient singularity of type q1 to qd minus one, where the q are integers over n, where n is the order of the singularity, is this quotient where phi is this automorphisms, which is just Automorphisms, which is just basically multiply each coordinate by the corresponding power of the primitive group C. So coming back to the case of surface quotient singularity, they have a well-known algorithm to resolve them, which is called the Hirsch-Venjung resolution. And basically, it's a chain of weighted blow-ups with a simple. With a simple normal crossing selectional data. And the sectional data are a collection of P1s satisfying these identities. When the important identity is this one, the self-intersection of the exceptional divisory alpha, coincident with minus K alpha, which is encoded in this continuous fraction of the n of the n. Of the n over q. And this continuous fraction is known as the Hirsch-Venjun continuous fraction. Two important qualities of this resolution is the length, which is basically the length of the continuous fraction, and the derrick insume associated to the resolution, which is basically this expression when the double parenthesis. When the double parenthesis function is the it's called the sorted function so this quantity are related by the following as integrated theorem which says that for n greater or equal than 17 will exist a set O from the integer from 0 to n such that n such that for any q in this set of n, the deric insumes and the length of the resolution behave as the n square root of n. So this means that the deric insume and the length over n goes to zero as n goes to infinity. And moreover, this set of n becomes larger as n becomes larger. So, with this, we can state the resulting dimension two that says the following. For asymptotic arrangements that will be defined soon, the synthetic result holds. This means the spectral relation between the chair numbers and the logarithmic chair numbers. And moreover, if the canonical class of the n-root cover is n, then we can replace x with his minimal model. So, in this case, A minimal model. So, in this case, we have the same synthetic result, but now for minimal models. So, with this result, we're done a very nice position to do geography of surface. So, for now, this is a part of my research, is that the case of three falls. So, the first problem for three folks is that the singularities of Yn are not our sibling type. Type and indeed they are of order n to the d minus one, where g is the dimension. But this result says that in dimension three, at least we can we can resolve the singularities to get singularities of lower order, of order than at most n. So we start with a non-singular reactive threefold and we take again asymptotic arrangement. Take again asymptotic arrangement that will be defined soon. And this says that for prime numbers n sufficiently large, we have a signal singularity with at most significant singularity of order at most n such that the expected asymptotic result holds. So now an asymptotic arrangement based And asymptotic arrangement basically is that we assume that the components of the divisor satisfy the following two conditions. The first one is that there are multiplicities, nu j between 0 and n, such that over intersection of the components, we have in chairs in this asymptotic set O n such that we have this aromatical condition in the multiplicities. In the multiplicities. And another one is the existing of a divisor L such that this linear equivalence holds. And this is indeed to construct the n-root cover. And so the main setup of the theorem is to take our variety inside a projective space and then assume that each one of our devices. Each one of our devices in line are equivalent to an e-per-plane section class. So, in this case, we just have to concern about asymptotic partitions of the prime number. In this case, in 2009, it was proved that this asymptotic partition exists densely for n sufficiently large. This means that the probability of a partition of n to be asymptotic tends to one as n grows. Tends to 1 as n grows to the infinity. So for n sufficiently large, we always can take an asymptotic partition. So the idea of the proof, the first one is that the invariant chi is asymptotic for any resolution. So we haven't too concerned about the resolution. The resolution. And in this case, the analytical statistic depends only on the base and on the dairy consumes, depending on this number QJK, which we know that make asymptotic, the Dairy King zoom. But the problem starts when we want the symptotic result for the invariance k to the three and the topological characteristic. In this case, we have. In this case, we have to choose a partial resolution of singularities. And in this case, we know that the singularities of yn are analytically isomorphic to the normalization of this affine variety. And as I said before, these are tracing variety, but of order n squared. And as I said, this is bad because at the bad choice of a resolution, we may have a lot of exceptional data and we lost the That data, and we lost the symptom result. So we are obligated to resolve the singularity. So this is the transversal section of the cone defining this toric variety, where the generators are these three lattice vectors, and we have that they depend explicitly on P and Q. Explicitly on P and Q. So here we mark the Hirsibron-Jung resolution to each wall, because remember that the Hirsch-Brune Jung resolution is a toric algorithm to resolve the singularities. So the importance of this red dot is that they depend between them. That they depend between them. So, and they are precisely of surface cyclic type. So, we can use all the tools from the surface cases. The resolution that we take is the following. We choose a lattice point inside the cone such that they lie in the plane. They light in the plane generated by the three generators of the cone. And this, and then we proceed by doing blow-ups along each red dot marked by the Heresy Group in June resolution. So with this, we get a bunch of cyclic singularities of dimension three, and all of them depend on the Hirschrung Junk program. On the Hearst Jung process. So we have a well-controlled singularities in this case to proceed with another resolution in the future. And this election of this center blow-up allows us to have the asyntheticity of the volume and of the topological characteristic because these invariants will depend only on the length. Will depend only on the length of the QJK and on the data consumes. So, by the asymptotic result, we get the asymptotic behavior of these invariants. So, with this, I finish with some conclusions. The first one is a corral of the previous theorem that if we take a basis, the basis. As a basis, the pair, we start with a minimum non-singular predictive treefold of general type, which has a positive volume. And as the device or D, we take something with a collection of uber plane section in general position. This means that we have to take asymptotic partitions. Then, for prime numbers n sufficiently large, there are finite morphemes. There are finite morphemes coming from the resolution such that the positivity of the volume is preserved. And moreover, we have singularities of order lower than n. And these slopes are arbitrarily near to the one over three. And this comes from the fact that we can compute explicitly the churn numbers to the logarithmic churn numbers to this arrangement. Imager numbers to this arrangement. And so, as we said, the moral of this Karate is that if we have a basis with a positive volume, then our signal resolution preserves the positive of the volume. So we are in a very nice position to start to resolve again. And finally, since this signal resolution appears to be a first step. To be a first step in a bigger process, we have to question how to get an asymptotic algorithm for threefold cyclic quotient singularities. In this case, there is known an algorithm to resolve any cyclic quotient singularity, and it's known as the Fujiki-Oka resolution. The problem with this algorithm, that is our generalization of the Hirsch-Kunjung algorithm, is that sometimes Is that sometimes some resolutions have ordered approximate to two to the square root of n, and this drop the asymptotic property that we spec. And finally, if we get a terminal asymptotic algorithm, this means a resolution of the cyclic singularity with now a terminal singularities. Then, how to apply the M. Then, how to apply the MMP in order to replace a resolution, the chosen resolution, which is minimal model, as happens in the surface case. And a possible path of research is trying to generalize the metals for surface, but first we need to understand how the imperence change through the MMP process. Thank you very much for your. Thank you very much for your attention. And I give you some reference about this topic. And the main reference to the case of dimension two and three are this one from Bruce Kunt. Thank you very much. Someone is there. I can listen.
