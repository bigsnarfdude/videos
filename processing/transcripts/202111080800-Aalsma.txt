For the invitation and also for the nice bio. I don't think I could have summarized it better myself, so that's very nice. I'm looking very much forward to this workshop. That's very exciting, lots of interesting talks. And indeed, so I'm going to talk today about the weak graffiti conjecture and some works that I've done over the years. Over the years. So, this based on these two papers and also a paper that appears tonight. So, maybe just to sketch a bit of the context, it is also the first talk of this workshop, is the idea of the swamp land. And I think sort of what has been lying around for a long time is that if you want to ultraviolet complete some theory of quantum gravity, then it's typically not the case that if you then go down to very low energy scales. Then go down to very low energy scales that you have no constraints at all on your EFT. Instead, in quantum gravity, I think the structure is much more interesting than that. And it turns out that there are certain UV effects that don't fully decouple when you go to low energies. This is, of course, a very exciting prospect because that might perhaps mean you can probe some ideas of quantum gravity basically just being a low energy observer. Observer. And this idea has been formulated most sharply in the context of the Schröding, which goes back to 2006, where the idea being that you at high energies, you have your consistent quantum gravity theories. I guess it depends on your taste if this is a unique theory or there can be maybe multiple options. But then if you go down to low energies, then Low energies, then the effective field theories that arise from consistent quantum gravity theories, we call them to be in the landscape, meaning that they are consistent. You can perhaps have different areas of the landscape, but the landscape is surrounded by a possibly even larger region, which we call the strong land, which consists of effective field theories that at first sight might seem to be compatible, but then you try to UV complete them into a consistent. UV complete them into a consistent theory of quantum gravity, you run into some troubles. And then the goal of the sampling program is really to try to understand sort of what are these constraints that determine if you're taking EFT, if you're either in the landscape or the swamp. So in order to distinguish the landscape from the swamp, various swampand conjectures have been proposed. Some of them are more rigorous and have more evidence in favor of them. More evidence in favor of them, and some of them are more speculative. And I guess there's sort of an interesting relationship between the usefulness and also the rigorousness of Swampled conjectures in the sense that they typically show an inverse correlation. So you can try to plot all the different Schondlett conjectures in what Erin Palti recently calls an Oguri-Herxun-Russell diagram, where you would indicate the different Schondlett conjectures where the axes range from speculative. Where the access range from speculative to rigorous and from useless to very useful. So, for example, one, I guess, one of the most strong and well-understood solving conjectures is the idea that quantum gravity should have no global symmetries, as this is something that can be proven quite rigorously. At the same time, it's not quite clear how useful this conjecture is, because it doesn't actually tell you directly at what energy scale a global symmetry should be broken. We know, of course, that there are. We know, of course, that there are very sensible effective field theories that at low energies do have global signatures. Perhaps on the other sort of extreme axis, you have the Sitter conjecture, which says that there should be no meta-stable desitter space in quantum gravity. So if this is true, this is a very useful conjecture and would be really remarkable because, as you might know, we seem to be living in a beta stable dissipative space. A beta-stable disipper space. However, this is also on the more speculative axis of the OHR diagram. So, what we'd like to do is to perhaps make this more speculative conjecture a bit more vigorous. And I think the weak reference conjecture lies somewhere in between. It's not quite as rigorous as the no-global symmetries argument. At the same time, it's also a bit more useful in constraining on effective field theories. The feature of the Filters. The feature of the goal of the Sonten program is to try to map out this OHR diagram and try to see if you can move the conjectures to this corner on the right top, where they are very rigorous and also very docial. So today I will focus on the big graffiti conjecture, which I think is at a very nice place in this OHR diagram because there's quite some evidence for it. So we can also use some interesting techniques to. Interesting techniques to study it. So, one way of thinking about a V gravity conjecture is that it's sort of a refinement of this statement that black holes do not carry global charges, or said differently that in quantum gravity, a global charges should be broken. So, sort of really the most simplest way to think about this is that if you take a black hole and you have a particle that carries a global charge, if you would throw that inside of the black hole, then basically because the Then, basically, because the black hole obeys on no-hair theorem, it does not carry information about this global charge. And then, if you let it hocking evaporate, then this global charge seems to be destroyed. So that is sort of the zero-order intuition why quantum gravity should not have global charges. And you can try to make it a bit more rigorous. Of course, you can also consider gauge charges, and there's nothing wrong with that. If you take, let's say, a particle that is Let's say a particle that is charged electrically under a U1 gauge field, then you can throw it inside of a black hole. And then this black hole would basically be electric field lines peaking out of the black hole. And in principle, if you're an experimentalist, you can try to measure this charge of the black hole. So there's nothing wrong with having gauge charges. However, we know that this black hole obeys an externality bound. There's a bound on the amount of charge that you can put inside of a black hole. Put inside of a black hole. And when you take the gauge coupling G to zero, and then basically these electric field lines become impossible for you to measure. And effectively, this gauge symmetry reduces back again to a global symmetry, which would then lead you to this pathology that you seem to have a global symmetry, whereas we just said that those should be forbidden in quantum graffiti. So then the weak graffiti conjecture, what this does for you is this tells you that there should be a That there should be a bound that prevents you from, that obstructs you from taking this limit where this gauge symmetry effectively becomes global symmetry. And that was one of the motivations that led these authors to think that this weak gravity conjecture might be true. So setting words, what this weak gravity conjecture means, that if you take an effective field theory with U1 gauge symmetry, that arises as the low energy limit. That arises as the low energy limity of some consistent quantum gravity theory, then that EFT should contain a state that is super extremal with respect to the black hole externality bound in that theory. So if we take a concrete example, when we look at four-dimensional electrically charged rise and neurons and black holes, then we know the black hole aximality bounds are based as follows, m should be bigger or equal than square root of two times q. And then the weak gravity conjecture is a state. And then the weak gravity conjecture is a statement that there should exist a particle that is super extremal with respect to the externality bound. So that flips the inequality. And then of course you might wonder, why should this be gravity conjecture be true? Or maybe first let me just tell you a little corollary of this we graphic conjecture, which is the case that if you take these extremal black holes, let's say rice and nursing black holes, then because they're extreme Holds. Then, because they're extremal, their hocking temperature is zero, and they seem to have classically no decay channel that allows them to basically set their charge. So, what that means is that if you take an extremal black hole, and then there would be for every basically charge of the black hole, you can create a tower of states that would be stable because they would not have a way to decay by emitting Hartman radiation. However, if you now include However, if you now include a weak rafflety conjecture satisfying state, so you start with an extremal black hole that has a charge to mass ratio C equals to one, then now this by emitting one of these V graffiti conjecture satisfying particles, which I indicated here with gray, you're now able to decay to a state which has a finer temperature and because it has a C smaller than one. And then this black hole can decay because now it gets a finer temperature. Because now it gets a finite temperature. So there would be no large tower of stable states that are not protected by any symmetry. It's a bit difficult to actually make this very precise in the sense that you want this as a motivation of the graphic conjecture. So typically, if you think about global symmetries, then it's important that there should not be an infinite tower of states that are stable. However, this would only if the V graft. Only, if the regraphic direction would not be satisfied, it would only lead to a finite amount of states for some energy window. But it's an interesting observation, and we'll see later how that will be important. So when we think about DPS states, so supersymmetric states, those would satisfy the V-gravity conjecture bound. So then this decay would not happen, but you would basically have a large star of states. But then those are protected by a symmetry which is super. Those are protected by asymmetry, which is supersymmetry, and doesn't seem to be any pathology associated with it. And typically, we expect that while BPS states saturate this weak gravity conjecture balance as a consequence of their BPS-ness, if we take a non-supersymmetric state, we expect them to strictly satisfy. So it'd really be an inequality. Okay, so what is the evidence for the gravity conjecture? The read graphic conjecture. So, I think most evidence in favor of the read graphic conjecture really comes from explicit examples. So, looking at string theory and string theory compactifications. But I think it's fair to say that there is no complete proof that has been found yet. In various corners, there are interesting derivations that you can give. But most rigorous tests, I think it's fair to say, have been done in supersymmetric settings. I guess this typically allows you to give you some computational control. Give you some computational control, but there are also some non-supersymmetric results. And I think one example that was already given in the original UFT conjecture paper is that of the heterotic string. So if you look at the mass charge relationship of the heterotic string, and there is a left-moving sector and a right-moving sector, which is so the mass is proportional to alpha prime, you have an expectation level, and you have a charge. Then the heterotic string, you look at the right moving sector. You look at the right moving sector and you take the excitation level to be zero, those are supersymmetric BPF states, and you find that the charge to mass ratio of those states are equal to one, which saturates the V-graffity conductor bound. However, you can also look at the, sorry, this is a typo, it should be the left-moving sector. So when you look at non-BPS states, you take N left equal to zero, but then you find that Q left divided by Ms should be bigger than one. Should be bigger than one. So that follows from the mass-charge relationship. So here you see that the heterotherm satisfies the interesting to understand if you can find more evidence away from sort of this particular string theory lamppost and also to understand sort of what are the general principles in quantum gravity that would give rise to the read gravity conduction. And maybe I should briefly stop to ask if there are some questions. uh to ask if there are some questions that are more general about the big graphical action okay um if not let me continue uh so the outline of the talk will roughly look as follows uh so i will first talk about a sort of refinement of the weak gravity conjecture known as the mild swarm of the weak gravity conjecture and then to already And then to already give you a hint of what it is, so the Mildromal 2D gravity conjecture allows black holes themselves to play the role of the states that satisfy the 3D gravity conjecture. And this is possible because high derivative corrections can correct the externality bound. So we'll see that in a bit. So then I will derive a universal relation for these corrections to the externality bound of a wide class of black holes and making use of the Eyer-Walt formalism. Irwald formalism, and then we'll see some applications how to apply this to these particular highly derivative corrected black holes. And I will end with some conclusions. So, as I mentioned before, the weak graffiti conjecture itself does not directly specify the mass of the states that you satisfy it. So, in the example that I just gave of the heterotic string, it was a string state that satisfied it. State that satisfied it. But in principle, it could also be a state that is very heavy, for example, like a black hole. This is an interesting possibility. And at first sight, it might be slightly confusing because we know that black holes should obey a black hole externality bound. So how can you have super extremal black holes? Well, this is possible because, in general, when we think about a low energy effective field theory, the net EFT can be corrected by a higher dimension operator. Be corrected by higher dimension operators. So, when we think about quantum gravity, what could happen is that there are higher curvature corrections or high-derivative corrections that modify the two-derivative action. And those would also modify the black hole externality band slightly. And that could happen in such a way that we now are allowing a bit more charge than mass than you would be before in the two-drift theorem. So, then you think about Einstein-Maxwell's theory. So then you think about Einstein-Maxwell theory, which would have charge rising Norsen black holes as a solution. Then the two derivative action does look as follows: the Richie scalar and the field strength. Then if you look at the leading corrections to electrically charged black holes, and those consist of an FAB, FAB squared term, which is proportional to some Wilson coefficients A1. And then there's also the possibility of an FFWild term or. Of an FFWeil term, or this is the Weil tensor. And so, when you compute the corrections to the externality bound, so what you can look for is now with these high-derivative corrections, when you consider them as perturbations, you can look for the solve the equations of motion with these as corrections. And then you find that there is a slight modification to the axiality band. So, without high derivative corrections, this was just equal to one. Equal to one. But now we find that if 2a1 minus a2, so this particular combination of Wilson coefficients, when that is positive, you are now allowing a bit more charge, the mass inside of the black hole. And that will mean that indeed these black holes themselves would satisfy the weak gravity conjecture, or at least this mild form of the weak gravity conjecture where black holes themselves satisfy it. So again, this allows So again, this allows extremal black holes to decay, but this time not by emitting particle states, but by smaller extremal black holes. So when you draw this behavior on a plot where you look at the mass versus the charts, then this dashed line is the extremal line in the uncorrected theory, as it is a linear behavior. But then when this 2A1 minus A2 combination is To a one minus a two combination is positive, then you see that when you go to smaller black holes, the effect of the high derivative corrections will become more important. And you see that this line goes down. So what it means is that if you now start with a large extremal black hole, which asymptotically has C equals to one, then now it can emit a smaller black hole that is C bigger than one, and then the resulting black hole would again be sub-extremal. So in this way, you see that you can, if you start. That you can, if you start with a large extremal black hole, you can go down through this curve and emit smaller extremal black holes in such a way that you're able to shed the charge of the black hole. And then this first part of the curve is monotonic, just by the argument that I gave you. However, at some point, the high derivative expansion breaks down and subsequent terms of higher order will no longer be suppressed because the black holes become so small. The black holes become so small, their curvatures will become very large, and the entire high derivative expansion breaks down. And then, in principle, you can't compute what happens. But of course, we'd like to understand if this curve goes all the way down to the particle region. And we'll see in a bit, we'll see a situation where that actually happens. So, of course, now you also might wonder: are there arguments in favor for the fact that this particular combination of Wilson coefficients should be positive? Of Wilson coefficients should be positive. So, again, it turns out when you look at just the particular high-derivative pressures in string theory, for example, the hyderabadic string, then you indeed find that this particular combination is positive. So, string theory itself seems to satisfy the mild multi-gravity conjecture. However, what's very interesting is you can also derive some more model-independent statements. So, when you look at unitarity and causality of this EFT, those principles. Those principles can be used to argue that, for example, this A1 coefficient in front of the F2, the fourth term is positive. But in general, there is no model-independent bound on A2, which was the coefficient of the FL term. So only sort of in situations where this A2 term is subdominant with respect to the A1 term, you can use unitarity to argue that the redravity conductor is satisfied. Of course, we would like to. Of course, we would like to understand if there is some principle by which you can constrain this A2. So then the question becomes: sort of, what is the structure of quantum gravity that you additionally need in addition to unitarity to really prove this mild form of three gravity conversion? So, one way how you can do that, which I already alluded to, is to try to connect sort of this mild form of the weak gravity conjecture that talks about. From of the gravity projective that talks about black holes to elementary particle or string states that are down here. And so we know that if the males from the graphic conjecture is satisfied, it follows this curve. Then there is some regime that we can't really compute because the high derivative expansion breaks down. But then we do have some evidence for particle state satisfying in the gravity conjecture, for example, in string theory. So we'd like to see if there are some situations that can sort of connect. Situation, we can sort of connect these two curves to actually show that this entire line is monotonic. So, for BBS states, this is relatively straightforward because we know that if we take some BPS saturated states, that because of their BPS-ness, they are protected from receiving corrections when you increase the string coupling. So, then those would line on the extremal line. They could just easily continue that along the entire line. However, I guess the more interesting. However, I guess the more interesting regime would be to look at the non-supersymmetric states where this is much more difficult. Because in general, there is no symmetry principle that protects you from receiving large corrections here. So you could imagine a situation where corrections shift you in the wrong direction, which would then tell you that at some place in this diagram, you would sort of find a graphic conjecture. Okay, so but there are some things that you Uh, but there is some things that you can do if you use some uh nice ingredients of string theory. So, what you can do, for example, if you look at the world sheet conformal field theory, particular string theory, you can, so here we're just considering a left-moving sector of a two-dimensional CFT that's described by a partition function which contains a level K U1 current. So, here's the partition function. So, Q and So Q and Q is related to the modular parameter tau as follows. And μ here indicates the chemical potential associated with this gauge symmetry. And delta is the conformal dimension, which you can think of as the mass of the state. And C is the central charge. Okay, so when you have such a partition function, for example, describing the world sheet of a string theory, then you can apply moduli invariance. Mausoleum invariance and you and gauge symmetries to apply a transformation on a particular state that is described by this partition function that looks as follows. So this is in context of n equals 2, this is known as spectral flow. You can also see it as a combination of different modular transformation properties and any one case transformation. So what it means is that if you now take some particular state that's described by this partition function, That's described by this partition function, and you now apply this transformation. You will generate a new state that is also described in this partition function. So, starting with, for example, a state that is very light, you can generate a tower of states that are much more heavy and have also different charges. And then, an interesting observation you can make is that when you look at the masses, the charge diagram, if you start with a sort of state that is extremal. Sort of a state that is extremal, where the externality bound is sort of defined in this CFT. And if you apply this transformation, you basically find that this combination delta minus Q squared over 2K is invariant. So the only states that you will generate when you apply this transformation on an extremal state, they will all lie on this particular line. However, if you apply this transformation to a super extremal state, you will generate Generate a curved line, but importantly, you will never cross this extremal line. And this is very interesting because it seems to be some reading gravity conjecture type of behavior, in a sense, where this curve is really monotonic and you do not cross the axomality line. However, this does not yet relate to the maltram of the V gravity contraction. But what you need to do for that is you need to show that the states that are very heavy here, that those are black hole states, and that. Black hole states, and that when you properly describe them as black holes, that they do not cross this extremality line. So, as of yet, this is just evidence for a particle version of the V gravity conjecture, but what you would like to do is connect these states that are very heavy to high derivative corrected black holes. And we'll see in a particular example how that works. Okay, so the idea is that if you now turn on a small stream coupling, then the stage String coupling than the states which have a conformal dimension, which is of the order of the central charge, those are expected to form like holes. As I just mentioned, what we would like to do is to use this to argue that the charge to mass curve is monoatomic, that it does not cross this extremal line. So in general, this is not possible because GS corrections typically modify the mass and thereby possibly ruining the shape of the curve. So if you include some gravitational effects in principle, Some gravitational facts in principle, unless you are looking at BBS states, there is no argument by which this line would not be shifted. So, then the question is: can we find a situation where we do have some control of these corrections in a situation that is non-supersymmetric? It turns out that this might be possible, and the reason comes from the following observation. So, let's say that you consider one of these highly You consider one of these highly excited strings. So there's an excitation level that is very large and it's also very weakly coupled. And now, what you're doing is you can adiabatically turn up the string coupling. And then, so here we have some excited string. The Newton constant is related to the string coupling as follows. And then you expect at some critical string coupling, basically, when the size of this string becomes of the order of the order of the structural radius, then you expect that this string would collapse to form a black hole, which then has a structural rate. In this case, it's a structural black hole, which then has a structural radius given by this. And then the interesting observation is that this transition where this should happen, it scales inversely with the black hole mass. So when you look at very large black holes, this transition should still happen at a place where the stream coupling is relatively small. Stream coupling is relatively small. So then you might hope that you have some control over these GS corrections. And this observation was used in a famous paper by Horizon Polzzinski to show that actually indeed this change in the mass is not too large. Now you consider the string entropy, which scales as the square root of the excitation level. And you also look at the string mass scale. Similarly, then when you evaluate this entropy. You evaluate this entropy at the transition point where you expect the string to transition over to form a black hole, and then you find that at this transition point, actually, the black hole entropy is equal to the string entropy up to an order one coefficient. So what this implies is that, or this provides evidence, the idea that during this transition, the mass correction is only shifted by an order one factor and the situation is somewhat under control. However, in our However, in our case, this is not really good enough because an order one correction could still shift you over the externality bound in the wrong direction. So we need to be a bit more, need to be a bit more precise about this. And there are a class of black hole solutions for which this is possible. So these are known as small black holes. So if you take a particular two-charge black hole solution in string theory, then those are black holes. Then, those are black holes that, if you take the extremal limit, their classical area is zero. And so you see that the higher derivative correction breaks down for those black holes because the curvatures become so large. However, there's been quite some evidence if you now include higher derivative corrections, because you need to include those because the horizon becomes small, but those stretch the horizon to some finite value and then leading to some finite entropy. And then it turns out that Gusti's. And then it turns out that because these black holes enjoy a BTC neural horizon geometry, you can compute their entropy using Cartik's formula, which states that the entropy of these black holes is given by the following formula, where C L and C R are the left moving and right moving central charges, and N L and R are the excitation levels. And then for a particular class of two charged black hole solutions in the Halorato string theory, you can compute the central charges basically. Charges basically using anomalies. And this is very nice because this yields results that are exact in alpha prime. So you know that there are no other corrections that can correct these central charges. So that gives you the exact entropy. And when you do this, when you do this computation, you find that these central charges are given by 24 and 12. And this are precisely the central charges that coincide with these central charges that you would get. With these central charges that you would get when you compute the entropy of a free heterotic stream. So, what this does is it tells you that, at least for this particular class of small black hole solutions, you find that the entropy matches exactly. So, you also notice order one coefficient. And this therefore also tells you that the mass is not corrected during this transition, but it's protected not by supersymmetry in this case, but by anomalies. And this is very interesting because this holds even. Very interesting because this holds even for non-supersymmetric and non-extremal black holes, which then allows you to really identify these small black holes as string states. So at least in this very particular example, you can use this argument to really show that the curve is monotonic. So sort of the diagram here at lower masses, you have these heterobotic string states, and at some point they transition to form black hole states. Transition to form like whole states, and you know that their mass is not corrected too large because they are protected by anomalies. This is really, I think, one of the few examples where you can really make this very rigorous for non-supersymmetric strings. And of course, the hope is that you can you will be powerful enough to compute this also in different situations where there is not necessarily this anomaly protection. But as of yet, I don't have a good idea how to do that. Okay, maybe I should briefly stop for my questions before I continue on. See no question. No question. Remember, you can also post the questions on the chat. Yeah, feel free to if something is. Yeah, feel free to if something is unclear, feel free to stop me. That's fine. Plenty of time. Okay. So now I would like to switch gear a little bit. So maybe to sort of recap what we saw as we looked at this mild formal to read gravity conjecture, where the gravity conjecture states are played by black holes themselves. And we just saw that in general, it's very difficult to try to argue in favor for this. In favor for this weak gravity conjecture without assuming some additional ingredients about quantum gravity. We just saw this example where modular invariance was very important to argue for this malt form. But you like to also move away a bit from sort of this very particular two-charge hydraulic example. And for that, it will be useful to understand sort of how black hole action earthy guns are corrected more generally. So for more general black hole solutions. Hole solutions, which can happen as follows. So, if we have black holes at the two derivative levels, then extremal black holes, they obey Q over M equals to one, so extremal black holes. And then what can happen is that these black holes, they are surrounded by some, let's say, heavy matter. This is described by some matter Lagrangian. And then, when we integrate out of that matter, you generate these high derivative corrections and that. Derivative corrections and that could correct the black hole aximality bound. And then the goal of the mild formula to be gravity conjecture is to show that this quantity that these high derivative fractions have a definite sign and such that you satisfy the mild formula to be gravity conjecture. So then it will be nice to understand sort of what are the general conditions that you need to put on this meta contribution in order to show that the re gravity control follows. So what I will do now in the rest of the talk is I will do. Of the talk is: I will derive a universal expression that holds at least for Kerr-Newman black holes, but I think you can generalize it to more general black hole solutions that gives you some insight in sort of what is this structure or what are the properties of this matter contribution that caused the reactive conductor to be satisfied. Okay, so what we need to do for that is we'll make use of the IRWALT formalism. So then the starting point. So, then the starting point of that is that let's say that you have some Lagrangian that depends on some arbitrary set of meta fields, and you see that Lagrangian as a particular D form if you're working in the D-dimensional space-time. And then very generally, if you consider some variation with respect to the matter fields, then the structure that you get looks as follows. You have some form that is proportional to the equation of motion. So, when E of i is equal to zero, the equations of motion. Is equal to zero, the equations of motion are satisfied. And you can also have some boundary terms. And these boundary terms in the Eyerwald form you write them in terms of this theta, which is called a symplectic potential. And then you consider the situation that if this action has some particular symmetry generated by a factor of psi, and then you can define a notor current associated to the symmetry. And it generally takes the following form. Generally, it takes the following form. There are some constraints of the theory that are zero when the equations of motion are satisfied. Then, here you have the exterior derivative on some noiseless. And using some manipulations, you can write it in terms of this potential and the Lagrangian itself. Okay, so when you take this formula and you perform variations, you now perform an integral of these variations over some particular Cauchy surface sigma. Particular Cauchy surface sigma, and then you can derive the following equation. And that basically relates the variation of some particular neutral charge associated to some symmetry of a problem to a variation of these constraints C. And here this integrals over the boundaries of the Cauchy surface. So this looks quite abstract, but then when you look at a particular theory, you will find that this leads to a very useful relationship. Very useful relationship. So let's say that we, for example, I use this evaluate this relationship for Einstein-Maxwell theory, and then the Lagrangian looks as follows. So I include a possible cosmological constant, and then you have some gauge fields. Then you can derive the constraints that are associated with the metric G and the gauge field. And so here you indeed see that when the equations of motion are satisfied, then this gravitational. Of motion are satisfied, then this gravitational stress tensor should be zero, and then this constraint is set to zero. And similarly, when the so J here is the electromagnetic current, somewhere that is zero, you also find that this constraint is satisfied. And you can also look at the nodes of charges associated to the metric and to the gauge field. So you integrate this over spheric infinity. This would give you the electric charge. And this will be related, for example, to the mass and the angular momentum. The mass and the angular momentum, if we're looking at a Kern-Newman black hole. Now, when you look at the Kern-Newman metric, it has a particular killing factor for which the black hole horizon is a killing horizon that is proportional to a time-like killing factor plus a rotational potential if this black hole is rotation times this axial killing factor, which is associated with the invariance of rotating the black hole along the particular axis. To access and then, when you evaluate this, oops, when you evaluate this relationship on the previous page using these particular forms of the constraints and the charges, you now find a very interesting relationship that relates variations of black hole quantities to possible perturbations to your theory that you're considering. So, here you have the variation of the mass, angular momentum, electric charge, and here there's a variation. And here there's a variation of the black hole area, in particular the bifurcation surface, and that is proportional to the surface gravity. And then here on the right-hand side, these are perturbations of your gravitational stress tensor and perturbations to your electric field. So this is all very general. So it just tells you that if you apply some particular perturbation to your theory, this relationship should hold. And what we'll see later is in particular when we... And what we'll see later is, in particular, when we're thinking about the mild form automatic gravity conjecture, you can think of these perturbations as being the highly derivative corrections. So it's very useful is to rewrite this right-hand side involving the perturbations in terms of what I call an effective stress tensor. So it's not precisely the stress tensor because it also contains this electromagnetic piece that is not exactly the normal gravity. Exactly, the normal gravitational possible electromagnetic stress sensor, and then when you set delta t effective to zero, so you basically are setting the perturbation to zero, then you find that extremal black holes have a zero temperature, which then applies that this particular combination is zero. And you can easily verify this just by taking the expressions for the current Newman metric and see that an extremal black hole obeys this particular condition. Particular condition. What now is very interesting is when you now do include a particular perturbation, then the sign of the effective stress tensor, the sign of the integral of the effective stress tensor, determines the correction to the externality bound at the entropy. So when you look at black holes that obey t equals zero, then you find that this particular combination, which determines the corrections to the axiomality bound, that those are given by this particular integral of the stress. Integral of the stress tensor, and this should actually be a variation of the stress tensor, which in perturbations. Similarly, you can also look at black holes that obey this equality, and then you find that this integral over the effective stress tensor gives you the perturbation to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. It's important if you have a sharp eye for subtleties, it's important to know that this is not the bald entropy. That this is not the bald entropy, but the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. And the reason for that is that we're considering the when we're later considering high-derived fractions, we would consider them to be perturbations and not contributing directly to the entropy. But it's not so important for now. Okay, and when we think about the weak reference conjecture, so when I, for example, evaluated it previously for a Reiser-Nordstone black hole, I typically evaluate it in a canonical. Typically evaluated in a canonical ensemble. So, what it means is that you fix temperature, electric charge, and angular momentum. So, for the Rise and Nursing black hole, what it just means is that you evaluate the mass correction at fixed charge. So, when you do that, this equality or this equality reduces to the following. So, you find that the mass correction in a canonical ensemble is given by this integral of the effective stress sensor, and then the military of the B graffiti conjecture. Mild multi-big gravity conjecture requires this inequality or this right-hand side to be negative or saturated. Perhaps when you're looking at supersymmetric states, at the same time, you can also look at corrections in a microcanonical ensemble. So that means that you fix the mass, electric charge, and angular momentum. And in that case, you find that this integral over the stress tensor, the effective stress tensor, gives you the entropy corrections. And of course, Corrections. And of course, you see that the right-hand side here looks the same. So, this implies is an entropy-externality relationship. So, that means that at externality, the corrections to the mass in the canonical ensemble, they are directly related to the corrections to the entropy in a micro-canonical ensemble. So, what this means is when the B-graffity conjecture is satisfied, in the sense that it decreases the mass of extremal black holes in a canonical ensemble, that also In a canonical ensemble, that also implies that their respective micro-canonical entropy should increase. And that allows you to go back and forth between sort of two pictures and try to understand the weak gravity conjecture from either side. Okay, so I don't think this is the first time this relationship has appeared. So, this relationship between entropy and externality. So, you can also derive it. So, you can also derive it just by explicitly looking at corrected metrics. So, when you include high-derivative corrections, for example, you can sort of brute force your way to find this relationship. There's also a nice derivation that uses sort of black hole thermodynamics to do that. So there's a small difference, as I already alluded to, in the sense that the relationship, how we derived it, involves the Beckenstein-Hawking entropy and not the Vault entropy. And what this implies in And what this implies in particular is that when you consider a topological high derivative term, then those topological high derivative terms will typically not contribute to either the externality mount or the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which is just given by the area, because it only appears as a boundary term, so it does not influence the equations of motion. However, it in principle or in general does contribute to the vault entropy, and because the vault entropy is sensitive to these boundary terms. Is sensitive to these boundary terms. So, in that sense, this relationship between entropy and externality is really a relationship between entropy or sorry, between area or Becketstan Hawking entropy and externality. And there has been some, I guess there was some confusion in the literature about this point, but you actually see that this also happens sort of in the entropy externality relationship that is involved in the weld entropy. That is involved in the wild entropy because these terms that might contribute typically vanish when you take the extreme on it. Okay, so now we sort of have a very general relationship relating the externality corrections to this integral over the effective stress tensor. I mean, now we want to understand what sort of conditions should this effective stress tensor satisfy in order to be compatible with the weak gravity conjecture. So, for that, it's useful to So, for that, it's useful to remember the definition of the effective stress tensor, and you can try to relate it to the standard stress tensor that appears on the right-hand side of Einstein equations. You find that there's only a small difference between the two, that is a particular combination of perturbations of the field strength. So, what it means is when this term in brackets vanishes, then actually the tensor that determines the axomality correction. That determines the absorbability corrections is just the ordinary stress tensor. So, in situations where that happens, that is very interesting because then you can just make really statements just about the normal stress tensor to see how the weak reference injection follows. And in particular, if that's the case, then a variation of the normal stress tensor should be, this integral over it should be negative or zero in order to satisfy the graffiti conjecture. And then it's very And then it's very natural to try to argue, to use some particular energy condition to argue that this particular integral should have a definite sum. And so we'll see in what situations that is possible. So maybe I should already mention indeed that the situations where this happens, where this effective stress sensor reduces to the usual stress sensor, it for example happens when you look either at curb. Example happens when you look either at curve black holes, because in that case there is no electromagnetic contribution, but also for electrically charged rising nursing black holes. So those are two situations where it's really the ordinary stress sensor that determines the collections. Okay, so in general, to know sort of what the energy condition is that you should think of, we can look at these at the killing factor and the unit. vector and the unit normal that appears in this relationship. So an A is the unit normal to your Cauchy surface. So by definition, it's a time-like vector. And this killing vector K, as we saw previously, it has a timely component and also has this axial component. So you know that when there is no rotation, when you set the angular potential to zero, you also find that it's time-like otherwise. Otherwise, its character depends sort of on an angular parameter, as it can both be time-like or space-like. But in general, it's always possible to find the point where it's also time-like. So when both NA and KA are time-like factors, we now find that a necessary condition for the B-graffiti conjecture to be satisfied is that this condition holds. So it's a necessary condition that this contraction of the Condition that this contraction of the stress sensor release to time-like factors is negative or zero. And when you're into energy conditions, you might recognize this as being a violation of the dominant energy condition. So the dominant energy condition states that if you take two time-like vectors that are both pointing in the same direction, so yeah, for example, both future pointing, then Then a contraction with the structure should be positive. What we find is that because the mass should decrease, this should be negative, and this amounts to a violation of the dominant energy condition. However, in general, this is not a sufficient condition to satisfy the weak gravity conjecture, because it's still necessary to perform the integral over the Cauchy surface. So, what in principle could happen is that at some particular point where you look at the stress tensor, it violates the dominant energy condition. It violates the dominant energy condition, so it's negative. But then, along other points along the Cauchy surface, it gets overgone by positive contributions such that the total integral is still positive. That's a situation that you want to prevent if you want to show the microfit conjecture. So, this necessary condition that the dominant energy condition is violated is sufficient when either there are some integrated conditions on the stress system at hold. Condition on the stress system that holds so that there are some conditions that tells you that it should not be the pointwise energy condition, but there's this integral over the Cauchy surface. So, in general, I'm not aware of any energy conditions like that that constrain these structures to re-integrate it over sort of a space-like surface. It's mostly either time-like or null geodesics where this happens. So, the other option is that the dominant energy condition is violated along the condition is violated along the entirety of sigma and so basically that when you look at the when you evaluate the stresses and that it turns out that it has a definite sign and you can check what happens in very specific cases so that's what we'll do next okay so the first example that we're going to look at is a bit similar to a previous example is when we look at charged black holes in When we look at charged black holes in entity sitter space, as this we considered using also a thermodynamic approach in this paper, and we're considering these particular four-derivative fractions in ADS4. So now you have your Richie scalar, you also have a cosmological constant, electromagnetic contribution, and then we're focusing on these two particular high-derivative fractions that we also saw before. Then the metric looks as follows. So you have some angular part that depends on this parameter k. This parameter k and k specifies the horizon geometry, so it can be minus one, zero, or one. So for minus one, you're looking at hyperbolic black holes, k equals zero are the sleep black brain, so planar horizon, and k equals one are spherical black holes. So the gauge field in the gauge that we choose takes the following form. And in this case, because these black holes have no rotations, you also know that this the killing factor is purely time-like. Factor is purely time lag. Okay, so then you go through the machinery, you perform variations with respect to the metric and the gauge field, and this way you obtain the variation of the stress tensor and the electromagnetic current. So in general, this results in somewhat lengthy expressions. I don't think it's very useful to explicitly show them, as I will just tell you what happens. And what happens is that when you look at the steps, Look at the stress tensor, the effective stress tensor, and you contract it with this time-like killing factor, then you find that it reduces to the ordinary stress tensor. So here we are in a situation where we can use energy conditions to say something interesting. Then we want to know if there are indeed energy conditions, or they lead to sufficient conditions to constrain the Wilson coefficients. So, for the cause of a hyperbolic horizon, those horizons are negatively curved. This negative Are negatively curved. This negative curvature spoils having a definite sign of the stress. So, in those cases, you cannot use it. However, for spherical black holes and black brains, then you find the following result. So, in general, the correction proportional to the f of wild term A2 also has an indefinite sign. And it's really only the term proportional to the basically the F to the fourth term that has a definite sign. That has a definite sign. So, when you evaluate that stress center, you find that it's proportional to minus some particular function that is positive definite times A1. However, you can also look at the null energy condition to see if there's something interesting that happens. So in that case, when you do that, when you look at the null energy condition, so you contract this stress sensor with a null vector, then you find that only the A2 term contributes. And then when you look at both of these equal. Of these equalities, you find that this necessary condition that the dominant energy condition is violated when A1 is positive. And this is also the condition that follows from unitarity. And when you look at the null energy condition, that implies that A2 should be negative. So then combining these two things. Okay, so yeah, it's important to remember indeed these two inequalities. And then we can see how those relate to the. And then we can see how those relate to the black hole externality bound to actually see if this implies to be gravity conjecture in this case. So for that, we need to perform also the integral over the effect of stress tensor. You can do that for arbitrary horizon geometry, so the arbitrary k here. In general, you get an expression that looks a bit unwieldy. But then when you take the limit where you look at small black holes with respect to the ADS curvature, so these are not the small black holes for which the high derivative. The small black holes from which the high derivative expansion breaks down, which just refers to the ADS length, and then you'll find that the combination of the also coefficient that controls the axomality bound is 2A1 minus A2. So it's the same combination as before. This makes a lot of sense because we're looking at small black holes in ADS. So they don't really notice the ADS curvature. So this externality bound looks similar to the one for flat space, or it is exactly the same as the one for flat space. However, for large black holes and black brains, you can Black holes and black brains, you find that there's a different combination of Bilson coefficient that appears. So, what this means is for these black holes that are small with respect to the ADS length, then a violation of the dominant energy condition plus satisfaction of the null energy condition does lead to the weak gravity conjecture. So here we have one, at least this particular case, where you see that energy conditions are really interesting and lead to weak gravity conjecture-like behavior. So, as I said. So, as I said, you can also look at rotating black holes. So, for rotating black holes, there's not necessarily a direct weak reference conjecture expected behavior, because extremal rotating black holes, they are unstable by themselves due to the Penrose process. But it's still interesting to see if you could use energy conditions to say something about the corrections. So, in that case, there's only a single six-derivative term that contributes. However, at least However, these black holes are not spherically symmetric because they have rotation. And in general, when you look at these stresses, so let's say contracted with some arbitrary factors. And then in general, it has no definite sign precisely due to this rotation. So even if you would impose an energy condition, you would always could go to a different basically rotational angle and see that it would be violated. So in that case, it doesn't seem to be so useful to use energy conditions. Use energy conditions. But then, so when you perform the entire integral to understand the axiality corrections, you find something that's proportional to these Wilson coefficients, plus a function that is difficult to see. But if you plug it in Mathematica, then you see that this is positive definite because R plus is bigger than R minus. So what this means is that the mass is corrected negatively when alpha is negative. So you could sort of say this might be So you could sort of say this might be the gravity conjecture like behavior for rotating black holes. But in general, there's no energy condition that leads to this result. And you might wonder if there is sort of a different argument like unitarity that you could use to constrain this Wilson coefficient. In general, I'm not aware of any unitarity argument to constrain this Riemann cubed term. So I guess it would be interesting to see if that happens. To see if that happens. Okay, and maybe the last thing that I'd like to say before I conclude is that you can also, because we're looking at these, we looked at these ADS, charged ADS black holes, and it's interesting to sort of talk a bit about sort of what the correct formulation of the gravity conjecture in ADS should be, because that's not entirely clear. So for black holes that in flat spaces that are charged, we know that we have this sort of R. We know that we have the shortage argument that we'd like these extreme black holes to decay and that should increase the charge-to-mass ratio of the externality band. However, in ADS, it's slightly less clear what the correct formulation is. And recently, there was an interesting conjecture put forward in the context of ADS CFT that goes by the name of a convex charge conjecture, which tries to formulate a weak gravity conjecture-like behavior purely in terms of a dual CFT. Of a dual CFT. And it relates to a particular sort of convexity conduction, convexity condition of charged operators in the CFT. When you take some operator delta that depends on some charge in the following way, it should obey a particular convexity condition. And now that we have these, when we look at the high derivative corrected black holes in ADS, you might wonder if a mild form of this conjecture could be true. form of this conjecture could be true whereas these the dual of these particular operators would be black holes and cells in ads and i think this is quite difficult to uh do for the following reason because what happens if you look at the axomality bound of these large black holes in ads at least in ads4 it always scales as q to the three halves where this a is some particular constant that depends on the wilson coefficients but in general this is always But in general, this is always a convex function of charge. And if you change the sign of the Wilson coefficients, it would not change this convexity condition. It would just shift a little bit this curve, but it would still be convex. However, at the same time, when we go to small black holes in ADS, those behave like flat space black holes, their externality bound looks as follows. So they are sort of, if this is a concave function as here or a convex function as here, that depends on the sign of the Wilson coefficient. That depends on the sign of the Wilson coefficients. And in particular, when the gravity conjecture is satisfied for flat-space black holes, it means that this becomes a concave function. There's sort of a crossover between convexity and concaveness. And on top of that, it seems not possible that a mild form of this conjecture will be true, because in that case, you would expect that this would constrain the sign of the Bolshevik coefficients for the large black holes, which is not the case here. Is not the case here. So it's interesting to think about this in a bit more detail to see if we sort of what would be the correct formulation of a malform of such a complexity condition. And that brings me to the end. So what we saw is we looked at the miles from which we graphitic conjecture. I think it's a very interesting conjecture in the place on this Ogruvi-Huxman-Russell diagram because it's sort of rigorous. Russell diagram because it's sort of rigorous enough and it allows you to really do precise computation about it, and it's also close enough to a stable that could be very useful for phenomenology. And in particular, what we were interested in is to understand what are the conditions of quantum gravity that are necessary to satisfy. It seems that you need some information about the U of V. And in a particular example that we looked at, modular invariance was very crucial. And then to also understand this condition. To also understand this condition a bit more broadly for a wider class of black hole, we used the IRWALT formalism to formulate the Mahal-B-Gravity conjecture as a condition on the sus-tensor. There we saw that a necessary, but in general, not sufficient condition is affecting you and need to violate the dominant energy condition. And it would be, I think, interesting in future work to also try to understand this relationship with energy conditions a bit more precisely, because also typically energy conditions. Because also, typically, energy conditions are only satisfied classically. And we know that when you include quantum effects, they can be in general violated. But in that case, there are more general statements like average ending conditions that are true. It will be interesting to sort of investigate the relationship with the corrections that we talked about here. And I hope this formulism will be very useful in sort of further sharpening how much UV information. How much UV information you precisely need to prove the milestone of three traffic induction. And with that, I thank you. Thanks a lot. So I invite you to put your microphones on that we can say glass. Okay, so do we have some questions? We have some questions. You can raise your hand or just start talking if you like. Jonathan Hegman, please. Hi, thanks for the talk. How much have this been tested in the context of higher derivative corrections for other types of black objects? Other types of black objects. So, for example, like in five dimensions, we can have black rings or black Saturns, and in other dimensions, we can also have black strings. So, how much has this been tested in that context? Yeah, so there's, I think, a huge literature on these corrections. I know definitely there are lots of examples of black strings indeed, where you just find if you look at a particular high-derivative corrections that at least arise from string theory, you'll find that those also. From string theory, you'll find that those all satisfy this conjecture. I'm not directly familiar with any works that are looking at more complicated things like black saturns or stuff like that. I think in general, if you look at the high derivative expansion in string theory, then all these high derivative corrections there are controlled by alpha prime. I don't think there are any known violations of it there. Okay, thanks. Thank you. Some more questions? Well, while we wait, I have a general question. So, do you think that this is now like a proof of the mild weak gravity conjecture or what? Weak gravity conjecture, or what would be missing to have a proof of this smile version of the weak gravity conjecture? Yeah, that's a very good question. I think there is a proof in sort of restricted settings. So the argument that I gave in the beginning, for example, about unitarity, typically that only constrains this F to the fourth term. And you really need to assume something more about the UV structure to also constrain this A to sum. To also constrain this A2 sign. So, for example, in that case, what has been used, if you assume that you V-complete your theory in a weakly coupled string theory, then in those cases, this A2 coefficient is subdominant, and then you can really use unitarity to argue that the V-gravity conjecture is satisfied. However, there are examples where this is not the case, but we still expect the Regravity Conjecture to be satisfied. The conjecture to be satisfied. So, in those cases, I don't think there is a general proof. And it seems sort of the general principle seems to be that at the moment, if you really need to include gravitational effects, so sort of this F2 to force is just an electromagnetic operator, but this FFWild includes gravity. The moment you need to include gravitational effects, it becomes much more difficult to prove anything. And the reason for that is that typically to derive these bounds on the Wilson coefficients, for example, you Uh, on the Wilson coefficients, for example, using unitarity, uh, you use like dispersion relationships that are very well understood in basically Q of Ts, not including gravity. The moment you include gravity, it's much more difficult. You need to assume more about how the things are UV completed. So, I don't think there's really a general proof of it yet. Um, okay, but also, yeah, also this my version is a hard to prove, okay, Oscar? Okay, Oscar question. Thank you. Thank you. Lars, thanks for the nice talk. I have a very naive question. Maybe you mentioned it, but it's about considering these black holes in type 2B theory. So usually we think about these black holes, supersymmetric black holes like deep range wrapping some Lagrangian cycles in the internal manifold. So in that context, how can we understand? How can we understand this decayment of black holes? Do you have any pictures? That's a good question. I think in principle, if you take, I mean, for the supersymmetric cases, if there's no breaking of supersymmetry, then I think you expect those black holes to be stable. If you're looking at non-supersymmetric situations, At non-supersymmetric situations, then I think you can probably think of the fact that there's some instability is related to the fact that there's finite temperature. So, from an EFT point of view, it says Hackney radiation. Now, from the microscopic point of view, it has to do probably with the fact that there now is, if you have BPS states or BPSness, then there's a no-force condition. And when you break supersymmetry, this would generate an instability because there would be basically a force between these objects. So, then I guess the microscopic picture would be. I guess the microscopic picture would be that there are some instability there. For example, if you take like two D-brains, they now experience a force with respect to each other, which would generate this instability. At least that would be my intuition. Thanks. Thank you, Lars, for this very interesting talk. I have a I have a very general question. In your conclusions, you mentioned modular invariance appearing in a particular example that you presented as a key ingredient in order to know how to prove the weak gravity conjecture, if I understand correctly, in the context of quantum gravitational theory. And modular invariance appears over and over again in string theory, sometimes just simply to cancel anomalies, some other times recently as flavor symmetries. Recently, as flavor symmetries, and now you present it as part of a quantum gravitational theory. So, I wonder whether behind this program that you have, you can actually link modular invariance to the deepest nature of quantum gravity itself, whether it is possible actually simply to say there is nothing else to do but study better what modular invariance means. Better what modular invariance means. Yeah, that's an interesting question. So, of course, modular invariance is very general in the sense that sort of the argument that I gave applies to any 2D CFT. In effect, you can generate these states. I think to relate it to the weak graffiti conjecture, you probably want to have some notion of like a black hole in that theory, and that might sort of restrict. Might sort of restrict the type of CFTs that you're looking at, for example, like if they're like holographic CFTs or if they're CFTs that describe the world suit of a string theory. I think, I mean, there are, I guess, situations where you would like to, you still expect a big gravity conjecture to be true, but there is not an obvious way how to describe it in terms of a 2D CFT. So, yeah, I'm not completely sure if. I'm not completely sure if it would be fair to say if that's sort of the really the deepest principle that leads to sort of like regraphitive industrial like behavior. I think at least the way I use it is sort of a very useful tool just because you sort of are able to derive the spectrum like related spectrum in the IR and the EU V in a nice way. I think you do expect other situations where there's no obvious way of formulating modeling variance where you Obvious way of formulating model invariance where you expect to be graphic conduction to be true. I guess the example I would have in mind is take like a higher dimensional CFT, like D bigger than two, in that is holographic. In that case, you have a bulk description in which you have charged black holes that you, I guess, you expect to show bigraphic conjecture-like behavior. But then there's no obvious way how to formulate modular inference because you're looking at a higher dimensional CFT. Do we have more questions? Yeah, could I ask the question? This this modular invariance is is that you are talking about two dimensional CFT. So is is is that in a certain way something which then In a certain way, something which then makes a link to string theory, or how do you see modular invariance when you have your four-dimensional black holes and discussing your things? Where does the modular invariance come from? Where is it? Yeah, so the modular invariance comes from, in this case, I started with the saying, like, just take it to the CFT, but then to make the link with the heterotic string, in that case, it will be really the world street theory describing the heterotic string. The anerotic string. I know, I understand, but why do you consider two-dimensional conformal field theory? That's an assumption. If you don't think about string wordsheet theory in your approach, it's just an assumption to talk about conformal field theory at a given point. Yeah, no, I agree. So, I think, in general, indeed, you cannot use modeling inference to say anything interesting. So, what I did in this particular example, where we looked at sort of these small black holes and everything, there was this one case. Everything there was this one case where we can use modeling inference because we have the world C description, and in that case, it leads to some interesting results. But more generally, I don't think you can use it. So, in some way, here, this is just string theory comes in and helps you with the weak gravity conjectures. Exactly. So, it shows you sort of another corner. How do we gravity conjecture arises in string theory? Of course, you would like to be able. Of course, you would like to be able to let go as much assumptions about the UV and prove the regressive conjecture. If you're sort of like sort of investigating what are these structures that you need, model inference seems to be one nice structure, but it's very closely related indeed to string theory as well. Okay. Thank you.
