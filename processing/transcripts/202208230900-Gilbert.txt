Good afternoon. It's a pleasure to be here. And let's see, I will talk about some causal approaches to evaluating surrogate endpoints and to using those surrogate endpoints for predicting vaccine FC for a new setting. And I'd like to begin by paying homage to my fellow workshop organizers. So, you know, Layla was the one who suggested this workshop and This workshop, and you know, you've already seen how organized she is, and you know, got this workshop off to a great start. So, it's been terrific to work with her, and also great to work with Lang. We're old friends going back to University of Washington and Harvard Biostatist. So, it's always a pleasure to be a good colleague with Lang. And in preparing for this workshop, we sent out broad invitations. out broad invitations seeking international colleagues as well and including many Mexican colleagues so with this workshop in Oaxaca I hope many of our Mexican colleagues are able to join many parts of this workshop and I'll be focusing on circuit endpoint evaluation with application to COVID vaccine FC trials and in these studies basically several vaccines were approved based on phase three were approved based on phase three trials using a vaccine efficacy parameter which was the causal effect of vaccine risk placebo on the cumulative instance of symptomatic COVID by a certain time point post vaccination and these studies were supported by you know US government in public private partnership with the companies so so basically the vaccination parameter we estimated in these primary analyses was one minus the reduction in One minus the reduction in the probability of COVID by about six months after dose two. Now, the importance of a circuit endpoint is that there are many time-critical decisions that are needed for new settings that were not present or represented enough in the phase three trials. So, we'll be lacking the ability to make these decisions purely based on clinical endpoint data. And I'll illustrate this with a Moderna. And I'll illustrate this with a Moderna Co-Phase III study, which is the study I'll use throughout for illustration. And so this study was done in adults, in most of the immunocompetent persons, and in persons SARS-CoV-2 naive. So we can't learn about FC directly from this trial for children, immunocompromised, and then the non-naive. And then the circulating strains tended to be homogeneous, basically close to the strain in the vaccine. So we can't learn directly about FSI for delta and Omicron. About FC for Delta and Omicron. And also, duration of vaccine FC, we were limited to about six months of follow-up in the blinded period. And then the vaccine regimen, you know, it was a two-dose regimen, four weeks apart, and later boosters were added. And then the strain of the vaccine was one particular strain, you know, isolated from a person in Wuhan. So we don't have direct clinical data for thinking about Boozier's dose modifications or changing the strain. Changing the strain of the vaccine. And so we have many decisions that are needed. Of course, it's going to be hard to wait for new phase three trials, and they might be infeasible anyways. So specific example applications are to predict vaccines of Moderna's vaccine in its phase three trial had the study population been children instead of adults. Another question would be predicting the VE of the vaccine. Be predicting VE of the vaccine had the trial had Omicron BA5 circulating instead of the Wuhan lineage. And we could also think of more forward-looking questions about, say, this fall there's decisions to be made about whether to get a booster with a COVID vaccine and what to boost with. And there's been a lot of discussion about what's the optimal strain or strains to put in the vaccine. So one would want to try to predict what would the efficacy be of various potential strains of the vaccine. Of various potential strains of the vaccine in the fall vaccination campaign. And so we know that there are many approaches to predicting VE and quantifying uncertainty in the prediction. You know, trial level, meta-analysis, certain endpoint evaluation is one of the overarching frameworks. And yesterday we learned about many methods. We learned about many methods that Garrett and Mark have worked on for many years. I think Erin Gabriel is speaking in this session. I think papers that she's written are really helpful as well for this problem. And there are also methods that have tended to focus on one or a few phase three trials. And I'll mostly be talking about methods in three different causal approaches when you only have one phase three trial. Okay. Okay. And if we think very generally, what we're trying to do here, we're trying to analyze data phase three trials, build a model from which we can calculate predicted VE, and then apply that prediction. And I think of it in three steps. Firstly is the critical thing about thinking about our question and what vaccines parameter we're interested in. And that needs to consider the exact stuff. Needs to consider the exact study endpoint, needs to consider how long we're following people after vaccination, needs to consider the set of circulating strains and how we're dealing with that in the parameter definition. And then once that's defined, the step two is coming up with some way to predict a VE in a new setting, which is based on inputting data both from one or more phase three trials and also from measuring the surrogate and baseline covariates in some new setting. And then the third step is going to be the And then the third step is going to be the external validation and trying to understand how well we did. And I think if you have 100 statisticians, they could come up with 100 different ways to build this step two model. And yesterday we learned from Garrett and Mark and Mark and others of many different ways to try to do this. And as I mentioned, I'll be considering three causal approaches for doing it. Doing it. And so the data we have: it's the data from the phase three trial and the data on the surrogate from the new setting, like a phase one, two immunological bridging study. And before going into those three approaches based on one trial, let me start by showing a meta-analysis result for the COVID vaccines. This was one of the early papers on surrogate endpoints for these vaccines. Surrogate endpoints for these vaccines using trial-level surrogate meta-analysis based on seven phase three trials. And basically, the correlation was pretty good with a marker here. I'll be in this marker throughout, it's the neutralizing antibody titer to the Wuhan strain. In other words, the vaccine strain. So, there is a strong correlation of vaccine efficacy with the geometric mean neutralizing antibiotic titer. So, with that starting point, let's go to these three frameworks. With that starting point, let's go to these three frameworks. So, firstly, is what we call controlled vaccine efficacy. And me and my co-authors, G, and Avi and Marco made obviously major contributions to this, critical contributions to this work. And essentially, what we did is we transferred the controlled effects framework of causal inference to VE trials. So, Jockey and Green is an important paper for thinking about that. For thinking about that. And then we define a controlled vaccine FC parameter as one minus this cumulative probability of failure ratio, where our potential outcomes, it's the time to COVID under an intervention that assigns the entire study court to randomization assignment A, and also assigns everyone to have a fixed value of the neutralizing antibiotic or S. And in these trials, And in these trials, everyone is enrolled naive to the past, and almost everyone, everyone we included in the analysis. Yes. Sorry to interrupt. I'm still seeing slide eight. I'm wondering if that's what you're presenting. Oh, no, I'm not presenting slide eight. I'm not sure if it's just me or if it's others as well. No, I see slide eight as well. Same here. Okay, I guess I'll have to stop sharing and reshare and see if that fixes it. Thanks for pointing that out. I have no idea. I have no idea. Maybe, Peter, when you do reshare, you could go back to the meta-analysis slide, because I think it's key and we did not see it. Oh, okay. Well, I'm glad you spoke up. Okay, can you see the meta-analysis slide? Looks great, thanks. Okay, I'll um Okay, I'll go back into full and yeah, so let me know if anything goes wrong. But the meta-analysis slide is showing there is a pretty strong positive correlation of the geometric immutizing MITRE with vaccine efficacy. So that's a good starting point that the new titer could be valued as a certain endpoint for COVID vaccines. Yes, and now defining controlled vaccine efficacy. So, in a special case where all the placebo recipients basically have a zero value of the newtiter because they weren't exposed to the virus and they weren't exposed to the vaccine either, it simplifies the parameter because the numerator, which is the risk for placebos and also assigning their marker, we know their marker value is zero. So, the denominator simplifies to simply the risk in the placebo arm, which is very easy. Risk in the placebo arm, which is very easy to estimate. So, really, the whole problem focuses on dealing with the numerator, which is this controlled risk in vaccinees and their newtiter assigned to a certain value. And criteria for a useful controlled VE cop, when we estimate this parameter as a function of newtiter S, is we want to see wide variability in the curve with S. Equivalently, the controlled risk curve varies a lot. Curve varies a lot. And full mediation of X and F C through S is characterized by the C V E at zero being equal to zero. And Tyler reminded us that that can be thought of as a strong surrogate with Lauritsen's definition in a paper a while back. Okay, so how do we identify and estimate the CVE curve? So I'm putting the usual causal assumptions we need, one of the most important ones being sequential. One of the most important ones being sequential ignorability, where we're kind of pretending that the neutralization titer was randomly assigned. And so the DAG is assuming we don't have unmeasured confounders of the effect of S on T. And under these assumptions, we can map the controlled risk causal parameter to a marginalized risk parameter, which is a marginalized Which is a marginalized mean of a conditional probability of failure. And of course, we know how to estimate this. It's a statistical parameter that we all spend a lot of time estimating parameters like that. And so when we estimate this parameter, we have to deal with the two-phase sampling design for measuring the marker and also deal with the fact that the fader time is subject to right sensoring. And if we put a semi-parametric model on this condition, Put a semi-parametric model on this conditional risk, then the asymptotic theory is straightforward, and we basically have a single time point G-computation formula for estimation. If we use a non-parametric approach, then it's challenging due to non-standard asymptotics and a lack of literature for continuous S and right sensor failure times. And this has been an area that Marco, especially with his students like Avi, have focused on in their research. So, applying this approach to the Moderna data. To the Moderna data. Top left figure is showing results with the results from the marginalized Cox model in the purple with a smooth curve and then the non-parametric isotonic regression type monotone constrained approach from Avi and Marco in the blue. And so the result is we get increasing vaccine efficacy with the level of the new titer. The level of the new titer measured four weeks after vaccination, it's through about 100 days of follow-up after a dose two, actually after the marker was measured. And because sequential ignorability is a critical assumption and it probably fails, and it's very challenging to collect the baseline covariates that we'd have enough biological knowledge about that they could explain the confounding. That they could explain the confounding. So we did various sensitivity analyses where we posit a certain unmeasured confounder that makes the controlled risk flatter. And we basically try to quantify how bad does the unmeasured confounder need to be before we start to lose the increasing shape of vaccinates increasing with the marker. And so I can't go into details, but we used a couple of sensitivity analysis approaches building on papers that. Building on papers that Ding and Van der Weeel have written. For example, with E-values, I think the evidence is fairly robust that it'd be hard to explain this effect by confounding. So the second framework was led by Nima Hijazi and David Benktiser. This is what we call stochastic interventional vaccine FC. And so, one of the potential drawbacks. And so, one of the potential drawbacks or challenges with the controlled accessive framework is it imagines we could assign deterministically everyone in the cohort to have the same fixed value of the new titer. But it's not obvious that that's a conceivable thing to do given the dependency of immune response on things like host genetics and state of innate immunity and even immunity. Of innate immunity and even immunosenescence in the elderly. So, an approach that avoids that potential challenge is this stochastic approach, where instead of deterministically assigning the new titer, we take a random draw of the new titer from some specified distribution. And then we estimate what is the mean counterfactual risk of. Mean counterfactual risk of COVID under that supposed intervention. And this extends work from Sebastian and Andrei Arniski and Ivan Dias and Mark and others have worked in this field, of course. And NEMA used a Tima Lee method to estimate this mean counterfactual risk. And the causal assumptions are the same as for controlled accent, except now the positivity assumption changes. Positivity assumption changes to have to deal with not shifting values to where there isn't any conditional density of the marker. And to make a comment on kind of unification is that we can think of controlled vaccine analysis as a special case of stochastic interventional vaccine analysis. It's the special case where we draw the marker from a degenerate distribution where everyone has assigned the marker at a given fixed value. Given fixed value. Okay, so this is NEMA's data analysis of the Cove study. So it's showing the stochastic given of X-MC on the y-axis, different shifts of the geometric mean titer on the x-axis. So this vertical red line is where there's no shift. So that's basically from the observed data, where there's overall 92% vaccine F C. And then you see if you shift the new titer upwards, The new titer upwards, the vaccine gets higher toward 100%. And if you shift new titer downward, of course, that vaccine goes down. And this is what is going to happen if you have a surrogate endpoint. And now let me explain what does the color coding mean here. This is a way to annotate results. It actually wasn't part of the data analysis. The data analysis considered. The data analysis considered a grid of shifts covering the whole space of geometric mean titers in the support of the distribution. But the reason we annotated it is, as I'll explain now. So I'm sure it's in a lot of our minds of how well Moderna's vaccine will hold up against Omicron BA5, you know, probably the dominating circulating strain in the world now. And so we need to have a model for measuring a new titer. For measuring a new titer and predicting how well the vaccine will work against something like BA5. And so this slide shows data from a phase one images trials from the Montefiore lab looking at what was the new titer against many strains of SARS-2. And some of these were measured after two doses, some were measured after three doses. And for concreteness, And for concreteness, and for focus here, I'll just focus on the ones in the blue boxes. So the blue is the neutralization against the moot strain. And you see the neutralization was quite abrogated for this virus compared to against the vaccine strain. And then the box to the right is showing the post-dose three neutralization titers to several Omicron sublineages. And you see that after three doses, the new titer is lower than what the new titer was. Than what the new titer was after two doses against the vaccine strain. So the vaccine strain after two doses response is in that horizontal dashed line. So then we look back at our results and they're telling us that, you know, had in our stochastic modeling here, had mu been the dominant circulating variant in the COVE trial, we're predicting that the FC. We're predicting that the FC against mu would have been about 50%. And then also from this modeling, we're inferring here that had these Omicron sublinges been the ones circulating during that phase three trial, and it would have been a three-dose trial, not a two-dose trial, then we would have seen about 75 to 80% vaccine efficacy. So this is kind of one framework to try to make bridging predictions of what vaccine efficacy would be in some new setting. What vaccinepsy would be in some new setting. I've pretty much already said that. So those first two approaches are causal approaches. They're interventional, that we envisage an assignment or manipulation of the marker. So another causal approach that does not involve any manipulation or intervention of the marker is principal stratification, where basically the Where basically the marker is whatever it happens to be in vaccine. And then in the numerator, we're looking at the risk of COVID in placebo recipients for their counterfactual newtiter had they gotten vaccine. So one way I think about this kind of analysis is that you can say it's got an advantage that it doesn't need the strong sequential. Advantage that it doesn't need the strong sequential advorability assumption, but then you immediately have to come in and come in with just a strong assumption to deal with the fact that we don't have data on the missing counterfactual immune responses if vaccinated for those who actually got assigned to the placebo arm. So we need some strong assumptions and sensitive analysis to deal with those missing data. And Dean has shown that cross-several vaccination is. You know, shown that crossover vaccation is helpful. Even with that, we need baseline predictors of the immune response to have some precision analysis. And for the COVID trial, Ying-Wang-led analysis of the data, and you can see the principal stratification VE curve here. And an important part of this analysis is that these are uncertainty intervals that account for partial non-identify of the parameter due to the Due to the fact that the vaccine had some efficacy before the marker was measured. So, most of the methods of principle certification make the simplifying assumption that there's no vaccine FC until you measure the marker. But this is one of the papers that formally relaxed that assumption, which we felt was critical for the COVID data because I think the FC was already about 85% by the time the marker was measured. Okay, so. Okay, so coming back to this kind of cartoon about, you know, how do we think about trying to predict VE, I'm going to go the next step of, so how would we predict VE in a new setting based on one of these three approaches? And so approach one is basically to use the stochastic vaccine FC framework, which directly gives us an answer. Gives us an answer that's interpreted the way we want it. And here we think of the new setting as in the context of the original phase three trial, but then swapping in some new counterfactual realities, such as, you know, had the study population been children, had the circulating strain been Omicron, you know, had the refined vaccine, you know, with three dose of intestine instead of two doses, those kinds of questions. And then the second approach. The second approach would take the results on the estimates of the CVE or the principal state of vacation VE curves and essentially average those curves over the distribution of the marker in the new setting and therefore predict vaccine FC in the new setting. So, if we want to look at some math, we're thinking about kind of averaging these. These vaccine FC curves over new baseline covariates and new distribution baseline covariates and new distribution of the marker in the new setting, where we're going to need some kind of sensitivity analysis to admit that we're not sure transportability will exactly work between the two settings. Okay, so let me conclude by making a few remarks on what are some of the advantages and What are some of the advantages and the challenges of the three different approaches to studying Assuria and then to applying it to predict VE for a new setting? So on the issue of concedability of the causal parameter, I'm putting a challenge marked by controlled VE, you know, for reasons I mentioned. And whereas we don't really have a challenge for stochastic interventional VE or principles VE because VE because stochastic intermediate VE and thinking about specifying a distribution from which a shift can come from, we can actually analyze data and have observed data in new settings of interest, you know, in phase one trials, say, guide us on what are fully feasible shifts. And then with the goal to predict, the second issue is, is the The second issue is: is the method interventional and how well is it connected to the objective to predict VE in a new setting? So, here I've given plus marks for controlled VE and stochastic interventional VE because these are interventional frameworks. And I think when we're thinking about a new vaccine, kind of the appropriate proper thought process is, if we manipulate the marker by some probe, like a new vaccine, then what does that impact have on risk or on vaccine FC? So, that's kind of the right way. So that's kind of the right way of thinking about predicting VE for a new setting. Whereas personal satification is kind of dead or inert in that fashion that it is not interventional. It's basically a vanilla subgroup analysis of how does vaccine FC vary across subgroups defined by their utilization titer if assigned vaccine. And then identifiability, well, that's challenging for all three frameworks. For all three frameworks, where I mentioned sequential ignorability is particularly challenging for the first two, and missing potential immune responses is particularly challenging for the third one. And for SUFA, there's challenges for all the frameworks because in infectious disease context, the assumption of no interference of units can be violated. I gave more of a negative for the control VE and stochastic dimensional VE than for the principal certification VE. VE than for the principal terrification VE, only because often in these studies we have multiple immune markers of interest and that can potentially introduce a violation of the part of SUTVA which states multiple versions of treatment, something that Tyler and Miguel Hernan and others have written about. And this is something we haven't really thought about very much yet, but the notion here is that basically Notion here is that basically, if you intervene to increase the marker, say the new titer, then other parts of the immune response will increase with the immune system works as a system. And you can't increase the new titers without also increasing CD4T cells and a whole bunch of other things. And so I think that's an interesting area to think more about. Okay, and to acknowledge. And to acknowledge, folks, you know, the study team for the Moderna, the many biostatisticians who worked on these COVID vaccine studies. And I've highlighted the statisticians that have worked directly in those COVID studies. So it's been a pleasure to collaborate with all these folks. Okay, I'll stop there. Thanks. Thanks, Peter. It's been nice. Thanks, Peter. But nice presentation. I wonder if there's any questions from the audience. So maybe I'll. Okay. I'll just make a comment. And thanks for the talk, Peter. It really was helpful and illuminated some things for me. Just a comment about the controlled VE. You talked about it, sort of the VE for a group. If everyone in the group had that particular assignment on vaccine versus a On vaccine versus a particular assignment on control. I always think of it as, I've always thought of it as sort of a group of one, that it's an individualized sort of VE. Maybe that's just semantics or anything, something, but I imagine each person could imagine, oh, if I set my antibody level to this, this would be my VE. Yeah, I think that's helpful. And in a way, if we go back to Garrett's talk yesterday, we could think about the controlled VE as kind of in the individual surrogate paradigm and the Paradigm and the stochastic VE is squarely in the kind of trial level because the outcome is what is vaccination overall for some context. This is Layla. So I was just wondering what the limitations would be, if any, in using these three different approaches in a non-vaccine setting? Vaccine setting. So the way you phrased it, it's very appealing for me to think of, you know, if I'm doing a like a diabetes prevention setting and I want to say, you know, let's say the outcome is diabetes diagnosis and the surrogate marker is glucose. And so I've done a study, but now I want to use one or all of these approaches to ask what would the efficacy of The efficacy of some treatment be on diabetes incidence, you know, using the using glucose as a surrogate marker, but in children instead of adults, we kind of touched on that yesterday, or if the treatment is a little bit different. I mean, it sounds like those are the questions we exactly are the questions we could ask with what you're presenting, but I just like, is that much harder in a non-vaccine setting? In a non-vaccine setting? Yeah, I think this methodology is really generic, that there's actually nothing special about the vaccine context, except for this kind of helpful factor that the marker has no variability in the placebo arm. But the paper we wrote on this stuff, it can handle the variability in the placebo arm. It just becomes a bit more complicated and cumbersome to do it. Do it. I sometimes think that what's one thing that's special about vaccine studies for surrogate endpoints is that the adaptive immune response, it's a lock and key system. And basically when the body makes an antibody to recognize a specific pathogen or makes a T cell to recognize a specific pathogen, the only thing those antibodies or T cells do in their life is to recognize that specific pathogen. So the immune system is so exquisitely specific that I think that's something. That I think that sometimes gives an advantage for feasibility to actually find a pretty good surrogate endpoint. So, in other words, things like off-target effects are less likely for vaccines than for cancer, heart disease, whatever else we're talking about. So, potentially the validation for surrogates of vaccines is a little easier than for some other disease areas. And neutralization tighter, it's been accepted by the FDA. By the FDA for use as a corollary protection for many applications for at least nine different approved vaccines for bacterial viral pathogens. So there's a track record that it can sometimes work and be really, really valuable. Peter, this is here. Letter, can I ask a question? Sure. Well, thanks again for an excellent presentation. Excellent presentation. Staying within the vaccine area, what's of course special in the COVID case is not only the sense of urgency, but also the huge amount of data that we had available. That's sometimes forgotten. But if we develop a vaccine for Ebola, for example, that's a completely different ballgame because we can have a study as large as we want and we can look at, let's say, immunity as much as we want, but there will be less challenge. Be less challenged. So, would you see a qualitative difference there in the use of the methods like in this current or previous pandemic period versus in a different situation where it's endemic or it's even not circulating at all to a large extent? Yeah, that's a maybe I'll ask Han van devar. Ask Ann von debosh to answer that because she worked on the Ebola vaccine program. So, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, let me think about that, Gear. Yeah, maybe rather than trying to come up with a link to the it's interesting to continue the conversation on that, Peter. Okay, yeah, that's great. Thanks. All right, thank you, Peter.
