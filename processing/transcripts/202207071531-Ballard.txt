This is probably a poor decision on my part, but I couldn't decide between two topics, so I split it halfway down the middle between two. So, bonus, if you get bored with the first one, you can hopefully check back in in the second one. Let us know when to check out. All right, so I'll start with the first one. First one. So this is joint student with my joint with my student Hat Link at South Carolina. And supported by the Science Foundation. Partially supported, whatever the correct phrase may be. Let's start with a big meta statement. We're given an algebraic structure. Some things and some ways to put things together. What's a good way to understand it? Well, figure out the minimal set of things that I can. Figure out the minimal set of things that I can combine into everything else. If I have generators for my structure, I have a better handle of what it looks like. It reduces the complexity. It allows me to understand things. Like we talked a little bit about. You have generators on one side, you have some objects on one side, some objects on the other side, the endomorphisms match up, and you fill the whole category. Then, in fact, you have an equivalence category. Let's see. More elementary, you know, you want to present a group, right? Finally present a group, you find some set. Maybe not finally present it, you find some set, you write everything out as a word in that set. Or monoid if you don't like to invert things. And if you're a module of a ring, another way to say that, you know, just have a certificate from some number of copies of the ring itself. Okay? So what I care about is I care about. So, what I care about is, I care about a triangulated category. And my operation to build, and I care about objects. I want to say, how can I get all my objects? How do I get new objects from old? Well, I start with a pair, a map, and the nice thing about a triangulated category is it assigns to any morphism another object. I mean, I'm not functorially, but I don't care. They're isomorphic. I mean, you kept isomorphism. Maybe not a unique isomorphism. Maybe not any of you guys want them, but I don't care. I just want the set of objects. And what I want is I want a subcategory, or just the objects of that category, to build everything else out of. So a precise way to say this is that I look at all the subcategories that are closed under finite sets, shifts and sumands, closed under these triangles. These triangles taking cones like this. So if I have two things, I always get the third, and it could be here, it could be here, two other, you know, you can rotate a triangle. And so, um, it has to contain my set of objects, and I want that to just be TSL. So you should think about this in a more constructive fashion. This is in a more constructive fashion as saying, I start with my objects, I start with maps between them, I take a cone, I get a new object. I map to one of my set of objects, I take a cone, I get a new object. Map to one of my set of objects, I take a cone, I get a new object. And I build something up like this. Pretty basic idea in mathematics, right? Simpler structures you built up step by step. More complicated things. And so, some notation. If we're talking about Notation. If we're talking about the smallest subcategory in general, we'll just write angle braces around S to denote that. I should have put some words up on the board. If you want to preview the slides in real time, you can just go to the webpage and just look at them. And then you can ask insightful questions. And if you want the raw materials for them, this is where you can find. For them. This is where you can find them on GitHub. Alright. And then we say if it generates, we just write the quality, you know, being rather abusive of a notation. So, think of your favorite triangle at a category and ask yourself, other than the category itself, what's a nice set of generators? What's a minimal set of generators in some sense? You have some measure of complexity. Measure complexity. And I am burning through this, so we might get out early. We can wait two talks. So feel free to ask questions and we can have more discussion. Oh, the keypad time's out. A good idea. Alright, why don't we go too far now? A little too far now. All right, we want our example here. I'm interested in commutative algebra, algebraic geometry. So, base thing, I take the commutative ring. And the smallest category, smallest triangulated category generated by R, is the subcategory of perfect complexes. Finite complexes of finitely generated projective functions in each degree. Clearly, triangle is a category. Clear triangle is a category because you can just tack on more copies. The colon over two such things is another such thing, etc., etc. And now, in general, if we're regular, or then this is just a different way to say something we're familiar with, the bounded direct category of modules in limit. But in general, they're not going to be the same categories. In general, they're not going to be the same categories. Once inside the other course, because bounded complexes of finally generated projected modules are bounded complexes of finally generated modules. But that containment is an equivalence if and only if R is a regular ring. This is one nice statement that allows you to encode singularity, non-singularity of a ring into some categorical notion. And And if you want some sort of conceptual understanding of this, well, kind of think about a local case, right? If I can get the residue field, I'm doing pretty good in terms of singularities. Just start resolving. And at some point I stop. This is what oscillating at Buchbaum tells me I'm smooth. If I'm not, then I have to go further and further out. This also tells me that if I look at the perfect category, I'm never going to generate it with a bounded. I'm never going to generate it with a bounded number of operations, starting from one. I'm always going to get new objects for the next step, because if I try and resolve my residue field, I keep going, I keep going, I keep going, and that perfect complex is never going to break up into smaller pieces. If it did, I would have K as part of it. I gotta keep this thing alive, I guess. Ordered by. Okay, so here's something you can meditate on. I'll give you some examples here in a second, as you probably noticed. A challenge. Okay? I hand you a ring. Say Netherium. Or even finite type over a field. You hand me back a generator for the boundary direct cat workload. Hand me back a generator for the boundary direct workloads. I just said R is not going to do it in general for singular. Is there some type of holistic way to construct a generator from something that is simple, as simple as R itself? So you don't want to take the direct sum of all modules. No, I do not. Right, I want it to be. I really, I think, yeah, I mean, that's a good point. Yeah, I mean that's a good point. It is it's legitimate point, right? If I'm allowed to just throw in as many objects as I want, right? And so you you win, you win the challenge. But I should have made it harder to hand me back a single object that is not that is finally generated. That generates the whole thing. Better yet to send me back a single finally generated module. Does there exist such a thing? Alright, let's see if we awake now. Wait. There we go. I should just keep in contact with this. Alright, so it turns out that if we're working over a field of character compete, the magic The magic operation that we always have in characteristic P actually saves us here. So if R is Ethereum and we know that the Frobenius pushboard, which is just R viewed as a module over itself via the p power operation, is finally generated, then we can take large enough powers such that the iterated fruit being a push forward generates Pushed forward generates the boundary direct capillary locks. In fact, I didn't mention this in the slides, but there's a notion of strong generation. I kind of mentioned it as talking about this. And that notion of strong generation says there is a uniform bound to the number of operations I have to use to realize any object. So starting from this, there is a single number so that I only need that many cones. Many cones to get any object in the category. You can kind of think of it as we can kind of think of it like finite projective dimension for modules, right? You could imagine that if we have finite projected dimension, that you could have just everything has finite projective dimension, but it just gets unbounded the further you go out. That's not the case. It's just bounded, it's bounded by the dimension of the ring. Bounded by the dimension of the ring. That uniform bound. That's a similar kind of statement here. Except you're going to need to use more than just maps of modules. You're going to have to use honest extensions of maps in the dragon order. What is the coronary hunt? That's a good question, isn't it? Hopefully I'll tell you, right? Yeah, hopefully I'll tell you. I didn't treat this with enough. This is like all the plants I have. Don't give enough effects. They don't give enough affection and then more attention. And then, you know, they die. Even ones that aren't supposed to. Take it very personal. So it's important to note that the most direct translation of the statement doesn't work globally. So if you have a curve with positive genus, then f lower star of a structure sheaf will not generate. Of a structure sheath will not generate for me. There's a little bit of work going into showing this, but it mainly goes back to computations and observations through the Vandenberg Smith when they thought to introduce this notion of geometric finite for Benius representation type. You don't know what that is? Don't worry about it. You do know what that is. It's great. I didn't assume anyone in the audience did. Okay. Okay. I should keep talking so this looks back up. There we go. Alright. So we have two natural questions out of this. For what x can we make this statement? Some power of the Sprovenius push forward generates the direct parameter. Because that's a very simple statement, right? O of x is the most natural thing in the world if you're handed a skin. And Rubenius. Herbenius is the most natural thing in the world if you're ever a characteristic P. So if I can generate with something like this, I have very great control over the category. I mean, if O of X generated, I would be FI, or plus A F on it. So, up to some Frovenius pushboards, I am like being F5. And then another way to translate this corollary. Translate this corollary, if you go back up here, is, well, we said, right, oh, did I give you the challenge? Here are the challenge wins. I think I skipped over this. So if you want to think about, I give you an answer, but maybe do this in characteristic zero. My challenge. Think about what can generate for these two guys. So I come back up here. All right, we mentioned that. Mentioned that basically up to these operations, it's the same thing as perf. So, of course, over a non-affine scheme, we have a category of perfect complexes, those that are locally quasi-isomorphic to bounding complexes of projectives, finally generated projectives. And that is not the same thing as the full subcategory generated by O in general. If O has no cohomology and If O has no cohomology and you're proper, the only endomorphisms of O are K. So if I'm just taking O and I'm trying to build things, all the things that I'm going to build are going to look like vector spaces. And we don't derive categories. Varieties in general are a lot more complicated than vector spaces. We're talking about a field. It's turning out. Okay. All right, so for the first question, here is a guess. What is it guess from? I don't know. Just a guess. Just lines up with existing data. So if you assume X is smoother projector, because this generation by F lower star of O is something that makes sense outside the singular case, unlike what we just talked about for the app on the Talked about the app on the back. Having this Vrobenius generation, I think we, in the paper we're writing, we call it F thickness because people who like to do F stuff always put F in front of everything. And all the names get taken. I think F generation already existed. So it's the thick subcategory. So you're F thick, if and only if your boundary category possesses the full exception function. Category possesses a full exceptional collection. So, what is a full exceptional collection? Another way to say that is it is built up from the derived categories of points. That really, you have to be, you have to really central simple algebras if you want to go over not close fields. But it looks like about as simple as you can. These semi-simple categories just glued together over and over to get the direct category you're born. Your brain. The nice thing about, and no one really understands when this happens in general. I mentioned Horloff's conjecture that says it's rational if we have something like this, right? But a geometric understanding or characterization of which varieties possess full exceptional collections is still outside our grasp. And for instance, you know, that notion doesn't localize very well. Localize very well. Whereas the other one does. Maybe that's useful, I don't know. That's for the first question, just a guess. And for the second question, it's true. Okay? So if you take, again, this is the same assumption as that one on the corollary, x is an ethereum. X is an Ethereum, right? And the push forward of O is coherent under Frobenius. Then there's big enough E such that for all big enough E, this push forward of the perfect complex is generates. The result that you saw with Corollary is a correlated bit with the statement that R generates the perfect category. Because once you have a generator for perf, well, you can build all of perf. You can build all of perf. You can just push it down, and that thing will build all of De Eco. Oh, it worked. It went. All right, good. And like I said, this is a very nice byproduct in that pushing this forward converts weak generators, ones that may build every object but may take a lot of time to do it, into strong ones. Ones that build objects with a fixed uniform bound. Someone should compute. So much compute, I don't really know what the optimal effect of one is, but there exists one, and every object can be built using that many cones at most. And so if you take your favorite generator for the perfect category and just push it forward, now you automatically have a generator for the boundaries category coherence. So, what's your favorite category? What's your favorite generator for the perfect category? Let's say you're. Let's say you're smooth, projective, not well, maybe not smooth, because this is so interesting. Let's say you're projective. What's a generator that comes to mind? What's a thing that detects a lot of the geometry or projective thing? Ample line model. Ample line model. Okay, well, one copy is not enough, though. It turns out that you can generate the perfect category with d plus 1, where d is the dimension. Sums of the twists of your ample line, very ample line. Of the twists of the Apple line. Very ample line work, I should say. And that's a result of all of many things online. Yeah. Maybe you already said this, but like in your proof of this, do you kind of construct the E, or does it just kind of show that there exists an E? Here's the magic. Okay. So the magic, it's really strange because. Strange because it's a very simple idea. Let's say I have a local ring. I know that there is a perfect complex who has supported the maximum angle. I can build such a thing. In fact, Hopkins first did it, and then Neiman amplified that and double-sit took it all the way to. Okay, well, of course, I have to get all the way down to the residue field. I have to get all the way down to the residue field. Well, if I could somehow act by high enough power for my generators, then all of a sudden what looked like a thickening of this ideal is just acting by the max module. Okay, so that perfect complex under iterative push forwards becomes something that's just built out of copies of the residue field of the maximum. Okay, so now that you know that, you basically use an Ethereum deduction and work your way down. Induction and work your way down. Now, a question you want to ask also probably is: what's the E? What is the E that works? Because if you've seen results about push forward of R under Probenius and its behavior, like Kuntz's theorem, you know that there's a statement that says, well, if I know that F lower star of R is flat, in the non-linear case, then I actually know my ring is right there. And it's equivalent to being F lower star up through E of R being flat. Upper E of R being flat for summary. We don't know that. But, yeah, so let me finish this line because it's going to go away here in a second because I pushed the button. So if I have a variable line bundle in X, then here's a generator that's, I think, pretty simple. I think pretty simple to describe. It's a strong terrier. All right, so I should mention that the idea of generating that residue field actually appeared, I was informed by Shree, back in the early 2000s. The idea that you could generate finite length modules over a local ring using pushboards of Hobenius, which was a portion idea. Push forwards of Frobenius, which is a supporting idea, work of Yangar and collaborators. Generators, in general, for DBCo, it's actually known in some pretty broad generality that you can find a single object in DBCo that generates the whole thing. But the construction is somewhat like I alluded to, for the proof, it's very much via Metherium deduction. Usually used. Usually, you assume your scheme's excellent, so there's some open subset of smoothness, you generate there, and then you reduce to a singular locus that's smooth on some open locus, you generate there by some object, and you go all the way down, you just push all these forward, and then solve them. So, in particular, you have no sense that your object is the object that generates is close to being torsion-free, right? Like the Free, right? Like the previous example I showed. And then we learned weeks ago, last week, I don't know, work of Iengar Pulitz and Bukapahe. They did the affluent case independently. But they also know that you can take E equals 1 for complete intersections. And I guess it's probably that you can do it. Are you working over an arbitrary field? So are you working over an auditory field, so particular imperfect ones? If I'm if I'm excellent? No. No? Oh, okay. Well, then forget that argument then. Some generic irregular basically. Oh, sorry, sorry. If you are F finite, if you're an F finite field, if you're an F finite scheme, then you're excellent. This is a result of Kuntz or is this Giles? Is Kuntz or is this? Yeah, this is Kuntz again. So it's F finite is really close to being perfect. No, I think generics and Outless function field has to be separable in the sense of higher transcendence because imperfect fields, not all extendance, are separable. So your branch also generically have higher energy. Okay, so let me be more careful about what this is. More careful about what this is. So I think the most state-of-the-art result here is that if you are Ethereum and quasi-excellent and separated, then you have a generator. But they always work through this type of Newherian induction, working step by step. The original arguments that I'm remembering that I tell you about, the one that's originally due to Roukier worked over a perfect field. I think you don't need smoothness, you need regularity. And excellent implies generic regularity. Oh, okay, sorry, I see. Yeah, I'm being cat regularly. Sorry. I'm garbling my words. I apologize. You need regularly, because that accident gives you. I apologize. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, so one of the takeaways from this is that you can get a lot of information and rigidify problems about derived categories by considering verbenius and its action. So I asked this question at our question session about equivalences that commute with verbenius. And then And then Dan told me he'd already thought about it, and then he showed me a proof written up for it. That if you commute with Frobenius, I think Martin said he'd also thought about it. Okay, all right, all right. That if you commute with Frobenius and you're an equivalence, then actually the two varias are isomorphic, but I'm not equivalent. Then the two varias are isomorphic. If you have an equivalence of derived categories that commutes with Frobenius push forward, then the varieties have to be isomorphic. Of it. So I take that as akin to in this general theme of this discussion. No need to clap, but that's the end of the first talk. So you can, we're going to turn tune back in, but questions would be good, yeah. Yeah, so I just want to, I just got a little confused with all the various hypotheses, but like, is what you're saying was Is what you're saying was it implicit by you know that quasi-compacts have separated quasi-excellent schemes, so finding dimension of the strong generator? Quasi-separated? Quasi-compact separated quasi-excellent schemes. No, you don't. So, yeah, you're looking at it. We squeezed just by that, it seems, because we looked at that. It's just the difference between separating. It's just the difference between separating and quasi-separable. Because you need some version of the GAAP compactification for quasi-separating ones. And perhaps that exists. I mean, the base can be whatever, but the map itself. You can glue things together that satisfy the conditions and make things that possess something. I see. So we do sort of seem to squeeze in there to get a new case. But I think the main utility, the main The main utility, the main novelty of this is that this is a very simple description of how to generate a category over characteristic P versus more complex ones that existed before. You should think, well, can we do this in characteristic zero? And can somehow the generators over P move over? No, there's no reason to expect that, but in some nice cases it seems that the answer is this goes to a lot of other questions in that direction. Lot of other questions in that direction. But upshot of this is that if you can understand, you know, objects, if you can understand the objects, like I had before, just push forwards of ample line bundles under Frobenius, you can understand all their X groups, et cetera, et cetera, you know how to make one category equal to it, the category you're talking about. So it gives you a good mind control. Yeah, so that's marvelous. Yeah, that's marvelous timing. I don't know how I did that. All right, talk number two. So you can tune back in now if you did not like that. I suspect this will be even more out of the lane of this talk. Can I ask you a naive question first? Yeah. So, do things like Robini is splitting structure sheet type results help you? They help. Yes, they help. Because there's so you get a bunch of numbers out of this, right? You have the E, right? But you also have how fast is it generating? What's the minimal number of cones I need to build everything out of? Revenious building tells me that just in zero steps, I have a copy of the ring itself. And it helps me bound that generation time on the top. So yeah, it helps it be faster. But these th you don't have to be F split for for this result to push the role. To push through. That other result from the previous talk a long time ago. Other questions? Huh? All right. So, uh you traumatizing me. Alright, so now this work is joint with Nitton, Chidambaram, who's at Bonn, is going to move to Edinburgh, has moved to Edinburgh, something like this. He's not on the Zoom, so I can't answer this question. David might be on the Zoom. There is a David, but it is not. And his face is up there, but that's why I'm called. And then get partially supported by some of the Science Foundation, and then say, okay. And what this is going to talk about is one of the central questions in derived categories, something that's motivated the field from the beginning. And that is how much you can understand about birational geometry of a variety from a strive category. Okay, now I'm being a little cavalier with singularities and such here. With singularities and such here, and what type of divide we're talking about. But this is the basic thing. When you're talking about a flip, you've got maps onto a single common variety, and ampleness goes from one sign to the other over the finite. And usually, you know, when I'm talking about the minimal model program, this D is going to be the canonical bundle, the canonical divisor, and I'm trying to make it more and more positive, right? Or more and more negative? Okay, here the negative curves. And then a flip is a flop if I can pull back to some common resolution, and the canonical devises agree. Alright, so what does that have to do with drive categories? Nothing we know yet. So one of the simplest ways to construct a flip is just to take a grade of grid. So an affine scheme with an actual GM and just take proj of the positive, the non-negative, or the non-positive part. And we get two varieties in the projective over the space. And I guess I have to be a little careful about making sure that it's isomorphic in codimensional one and above, but forgive me for a moment. But forgive me if you're holding it. I I'm confused. So what if this greatest ring only lives in non-negative three degrees? Yeah, that's right. You should be confused by that. Because I should be a little bit more careful about, like, I need some assumptions on the number of generators for a positive and negative H. So let's assume we're generating plus or minus one. I want more than one H. And then I'm fine. Alright, so that's a fertile source, as we saw from work of Thaddeus, of flips. Almost any flip over an affine, okay, that's a strong statement, many flips over an affine can be realized in this way. That's basically what started off with that paper, if that is. Now, if GM is nice for GIT. GM is nice, for GIT. Then higher rank groups, those are nice too, probably even better. But the examples get more delicate. You have this nice trade-off. For the GM case, the group is very small, simple underground. I think we understand GM, at least in this setting. But the ring itself can be highly singular. So as the group. As the group rank increases, maybe you get away with something that's less singular. We'll see this in the example here. But the group, the higher rank group, makes the loci you're removing, you're exercising and including more complicated. So what we're going to do here, we're going to just take two vector spaces over a field, and just for simplicity, we're going to normalize so that one is strictly small and the other. Going to normalize so that one is strictly smaller than the other. I don't want them to be the same. And here's an example of flop that I care about. Take g to be the automorphism group of the smaller vector space, and you just look at generic linear maps in each direction. And I look at the ones that compose to zero as endomorphisms of V itself, the smaller one. That carries an action of G. That carries an action of g. Act on the left, act on the right. Orange and spaces, fermions. And we get two geographians. And they're related by a flop, basically because I have an equal number of positive pieces from the hom into V and negative pieces. That's an equal number of copies of the representation for the standard representation that's Google. Sorry, I didn't catch what the plus or minus means? Yeah, so I threw this in because I wanted to use this notation, but I Because I wanted to use this notation, but I didn't want to tell anyone on the board. I will tell you now: say this is where A has full rank, and this is where B has full rank. And of course, they're birational over this large set where they both have full rank. That's the nice feature of these flips, right? There's a large open set where they're birational, or they're isomorphic. Okay? And as long as you're not in these two extreme cases of whether you're looking at lines or hyperplanes, Or hyperplanes, then the things that you get are called strap block blocks. And they have a long, interesting history in thinking about drive categories, which we'll see here in a second why. So, like I said, one of the OG conjectures of drive categories is that if you have two smooth projected varieties related by flop, then they are actually rectified. Dimension 3. By work with Bridgland. I can't bridge it. Everyone knows this work. Bridgland is awesome. More recently, there's work by Albert Leisner about derived equivalences for Bridgeville moduli spaces of hypercarriers. And then in between, there's a bunch of examples, special cases, where you have a particular aimed flop or flip and you understand the drive category, but Understand the drive category by doing some construction. That may highly depend on the presentation of the flip itself, right? What you would like is you would like, if you're ever going to solve this conjecture, that's not in the positive, let's say. The negative is give me an example, and it's blown out. If you're ever going to solve this conjecture in the positively, you're going to want to know a way to extract an object on the product, two varieties, from the flip itself. From the flip itself. And you want to be able to do it in some reasonable fashion. Okay? Well, can anyone give me an object that you can extract from that diagram I put up that fills in? I even turned it on its side for you. Right? Actually, it's a little confusing because I think F plus and F in the bottom line is not used correctly. That's what? In the bottom line. That's what? In the bottom line, that you don't really need a proper story. I do not. Thank you, Mark. Thank you, Mark. I gotta correct that. That is okay, so forget this. This should be, say, G. I don't really want to call it G plus and say G and H for some kind of resolution. Sorry. Right, well, the natural thing that goes here is the fiber product. Right? If you're just sort of, you know, not thinking and following your nose, like we do most. Like we do most things in life. That's what lives there, and maybe that answers the question, right? Maybe that solves the model world conjecture. But we have to wait a little bit to find out. Yeah. So for a brief moment in time, that was the hope. That was the answer. You just take the structure sheet for the fiber product, and that gave you a point in the cut kernel. What fed that? Well, was. What fed that, well, was Bonnie Roff's original work, where this was a Fourier chi kernel. Richland's work turned out to give you this as a Fourier Mychai kernel, even though three-fold flops are fairly complex objects in themselves. It only wasn't until we encountered stratified Mukai flops that our dream broke. We were left. But alone crying to Taylor Swift in our room. That's a good question about this on theology. Yes. So, like, in what sense are they stratified? I would say because the unstable locus is multiple strata. But I don't think that is so. This is originally Markman's terminology. Was it earlier? That's my sense. The standard, like a Mukai flop, is one where the dimension is one or the codimension is one for me. So yeah, so because why a singular? This fiber product is highly bizarre usually. Yeah, it could be some weird stuff. Yeah. Can you say something about how complicated it looks like? In what In in what oh so in this particular example or in general no I mean I I can't I I don't I other than say yes it can be highly singular in the general case I can't think of I don't think it has to be but don't quote me yeah it has to be we'll see an example where things are so the nice case for Bonnell did you someone said something knows more than me Nice case of where Bonnel law for working was a standard Atiaflop. And then it could also be described as the graph, the closure of the graph of the birational isomorphism between the two. However, the dream did not die in general. So some people interested in not theory producing not invariants for direct categories came to the rescue and produced. Came to the rescue and produced a 40 Makai kernels for stratified Makai farms. And the technology they used was very much, or at least it seems to me, most other people, very much localized to talking about cases like this with something called categorical SL2 actions. So we do not have categorical SL2 actions in general. So for three bulls, we're not going to have them. Don't quote me on that. Don't quote me on that process. Alright, so now we get to the point where we try and do something to extract a kernel from this local model for a flop. And we're going to need a little bit of extra data that goes into it. So if you just want to take your affine to be an affine space, it's not. To be an affine space, it's not going to really help or hurt in terms of conceptual understanding. But the extra data that goes into this is we're going to need an honest model whose units are G. So if we had GM, it would be A1 with either the point at 0 or the point at infinity. If it's GL, like we had in this other example, then one obvious thing is to compactify to endomorphic. That's not going to be 1. You kind of get any from that embedding into probably doesn't surprise you that someone, many someone, spent time thinking about the structure theory of linear algebraic models, especially deductive ones. Natural thing to do once you think about it. Alright, so um now I will give you a bimodule over the coordinate ring. Over the coordinate ring of the product of the space we're acting on with itself. So say you have G acting on Z. Alright, and I'm affine, so I only care about this because I can handle things that are affine, but you know, if I can handle flops that are over and affine, I can take care of the rest of that. It's not a big deal. Okay, so then we have this map. Okay, so then we have this map. Okay, what does it do? On each factor, so for functions on this factor, it just pulls straight back to z. It just constantly pushes part. On this factor, we just pull back by the action. And on the final factor, well, we can just restrict the function on the monoid to the function on the roof. And we think about what we actually hit when we do this. I'll give you some examples. I'll give you some examples so you don't have to think about what this is. An example in your head. But any questions at this point? Oh, so that this catches up. And then by restricting to the the product which is semi-stable loci, I can make from q an object on the product. Q, an object on the product of the two quotients. And, you know, maybe we, let's assume that these things are actually varieties instead of stacks. But this one, I don't really care. I mean, I do to an extent, but as we saw with stratified McCaiflops, we have smooth varieties coming out where things are happening that we don't really understand. We'll deal with the more complex stuff as it comes. But I mean, these stacks would be arguing stacks since you're looking at still. Would be artists since you're looking at some stable rows there. Yes. They, in general, will be artists. But hopefully I did a nice generic one where semi-stable is stable. Hopefully, right. And hopefully I did one where semi-stable is... There's just no stabilizers for anything. So I don't know. And know where this lives. This lives in. Well, you can get bounded. Bounded is not terrible. But Quasiko. But quasi-co in general. Because one compactification of the mono is the group itself, and that's not going to help me so much. It's basically just push forward on the common open sets. And so my question here is, if I have this as my P, when is the associated integral transform fully faithful? Is there any setting by which I can say stuff about it? So let's look at some examples. This is the example I kind of excluded with my dimension restriction talk about stratified. With my dimension restrictions, talk about stratified chi flops. So if dimension is v is 1 and dimension w is n plus 1, oh, that's an error too. It should be n. Or that should start indexing by 0 like a good computer scientist. We get this graded writer, right? Some maps from W to V and then maps from V to W. And then the condition that they compose to zero is just their pairing is zero. They're pairing these two. Value differences. So this is singular, of course. And this associated flop is called a Mukai flop. And you can check that this P that I described is actually the graph of the induced birational map between the two factors. This Mukai flop is, if you want to think about it geometrically, it's a flop between the total spaces of the cotangent mortals of projective spaces, in this case Pn, depending on which notation you believe. Depending on which notation you believe you're Pn or Pn minus 1. That contracts the zero section and then blows it back up. It's on a different direction. But the graph of the induced by rational map is not a Fourier transform in this setting. That's another thing that Nelberg Powell is showing. Because even before that, they looked at Bondel and Orloff and they said, ah, well, you know, this was the example that turned out. Why don't we just try and take a look at the example? That turned out, why not just try and take the graph of the birational map between the two things? That makes sense. That's sort of even simpler than the fiber product. But no, it doesn't work in this case. And the fix for this case, this example, and conjecture in general, is you need to derive the ring itself. So instead of considering this guy, I toss in the variable. I toss in the variable, let's say I like CBJ's. I toss in a variable, a homological variable of homological degree 1, negative 1? What? I don't know what your convention is. And honest degree 0, and set a differential to be this. And I apply the same operation as before. And I do that, I produce something that is strictly different than if I just did it underived. And it turns out that. And it turns out that you actually get back the fiber product now, which has two components. One, this birational map, and one, the product of the two projective spaces. Move together. Saying to fit derived quotients? No, I'm saying apply my funct, my Q is a functor, from commutative rings to something else. Apply it to cofibrant, simplicial commutative with a G. With the GM action, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have to construct some. When we wrote the paper originally in a very bold task, we actually made a new model, not really that new, but we made a model structure. And then we just applied it to cofactor things, that model structure, and we said some stuff about it. Okay? So we have the, we have, okay, that's good. I mean, we can kind of handle that. But the the white whale here, the thing that broke our heart, was stratified McClai. So what can we do in that situation? So what can we do in that situation? Wait, bated breath. I'm going to jump all over the place now, aren't we? Yeah. So as we said, for a general, for the Mukai plot too, what it looks like is it looks like, you know, a matrix, it's transposed, and the composition and the smaller size equal to zero. That's what the coordinate length of the plot looks like. The flop looks like. And it has this GLD action, we say gives us more. So that deriving that's not terrible because this is a complete intersection in this case. But understanding the resolution of that derived thing, which is what we have to do in order to make these things go. We have to understand the resolution of Q as a bimodule of two factors. Know that the representations live in a certain area. Live in a certain area. That was, that still is not working out so well. Okay? So instead of exterior algebra for deriving, why we look at Skoslov? Then I have polynomials. I like polynomials. They may be in some weird homological degrees. But they're even, right? So, you know, if I forget about that, things behave well. So instead, let's look at A, B, and T. Now, T is A, B, and T. Now T is opposable dual to the epsilon here. Generic endomorphism of my vector space B. And now for this thing, this thing here I can give you an explicit presentation of what Q is. No dir here, because this is a free. No dir here because this is a free algebra, right? So there's no need to derive anything, I would hope. So I'll let you. Oh, I rolled back where my changes. There should be a T L here. Right? Because remember how I described this. You have functions on one factor, you have functions on the other factor, and then you add in a function on the monochrome. So the L's are on one factor, the R's are on the other factor, and the C is the function on the monochromator. Okay, and this just describes what the kernel of that map is. math is where I just include ALAR into ABT and G and then I act on the other side. These are sort of the obvious things you would think of, right? This is the action here, multiplication. This is the action here. T carries the adjoint action. So if I multiply by C on one side, multiply by C on the other side, and then they have the same character. And then they have the same characteristic polynomials because, well, they differ by the two things that differ by the conjugate if I invert the determinant. So they have the same characteristic polynomials by mistaking polynomial relations. And my goal here is to understand a resolution of this thing as a module over the A's, B's, T's, and even the C's to be fine. Fine. Because I want to understand what representations occur as components of the minimal resolution of this one. Okay? And so first, I guess each talk has one theorem. The theorem here is that if we know the dimension of d is 2, then this thing is actually a Ford and Kutch equivalence for the flop associated to this. Total space in some sense. Why the dimension two restriction? Well, it turns out that before I was even a twinkle in my mother's eye, Bruxbaum and Eisenbud told us how to describe a resolution of such a thing in this lower dimension. Told us how to describe. Resolutions and grade three ideals. Okay, turns out that that's exactly what we need. We have a conjecture about what we need in general. Would you believe that no one knows that the scheme of commuting matrices is reduced or not? How many people knew this was a question that we still see now? Take K A B square matrices AB AB minus BA. Those are your equations. Okay, this is a ring. Is this a reduced ring? Can't you relate it to the zero-dimensional scheme? Maybe, but I don't. That's not ringing a bell from there. But that doesn't mean you can. Yeah, this is a. This is, if you add a little bit in and say it's Cole-Macaulay, this is sometimes golden by the Arden-Hoxter Hoxter conjecture. So, if you want something that you can tell your undergraduates that we don't know, that's a good one. And you can kind of see how that's coming into play here when I have C on both sides of two matrices. It's a little bit better because I have three matrices. But still. So if I knew debt C was not a zero divisor in my ring, I'm done. Not a zero divisor in my ring, I'm done, basically. That's it. That's all I really want. You know, computer program can help you with that to an extent. And then, if you take the closed little dual, go back to where you started, this closed duality gives you an equivalence of derived categories. I'm being a little loose with what exactly is happening, but it gives you an equivalence of derived categories, so I can just pass this equivalence. Categories, so I can just pass this equivalence back, and I get one for stratified mu chi, at least in when the dimension is two. So I'm looking at g2 something. So I know it's an equivalence already, just from nonsense, general results. And then we also compute its, I say zero here, it might, we compute its first, um, first, last, we compute its last cohomology sheath. Last cohomology sheath. And lo and behold, what shows up is one of the kernels that Kauditz, Kamnitz, and Rakata gave. Okay, no SL2 actions involved, but this is just what comes out of it. And probably the rest of Amish, I think we spent some time flicking and trying to convince McCall that he'll do it for us, for the rest of them. Or at least the next one up. Of course, that's not going to get us anywhere in general, but you know, fun to do. So, in this case, you have this one construction now that can reach this example that was an outlier before. And so the question is, in general, can this work? How much can this work? In what realm of flops does this work for? And that's the answer we don't know. Okay, so if I remember correctly, that is the last. Remember correctly, that is the last informational slide, but I do have one more thing I want to talk about. It will only take me another half hour, right? Is that okay? So coming up next summer, there will be a AMS MRC in derived categories and things that might interest people in this room. There's the dates, the week of the 4th, 2023. This is an image. I probably should have gotten a higher resolution. I probably should have gotten a higher resolution one of where it will be. It will be in Java Center, New York, upstate New York, at the Beaver Hollow Resort. Quite pleasant to participate in. You will see some very handsome and esteemed people involved in this. If you go to this webpage, for instance, if you click on, this is probably better because. This is probably better because this will not be the permanent webpage for this. Easy. You can go click on this link and go to the description of it. And you can click on any of these people's faces if you don't recognize them. There'll probably be one more mentor, too, that we're still working on at this point. But basically, the mentors and the organizer will pair off on topics and then they'll lead research groups like shows. So we especially encourage. So we especially encourage people who are early career, within five years of their PhD, people who come from groups that generally don't make up a majority of mathematicians, to participate, to apply. And I wish I could give you a link to the applications, but they are not yet open. Maybe I could pretend that I gave you one. I can pretend that I gave you one. They will open soon. On math programs. Oh, I didn't even have. I don't know how weight to send out a good notice for this. But anyway, keep your eyes open if you're interested. You can find it there. Yeah, it's like working groups and it's for people who are maybe around candidate have reached candidacy in their PhD or so. So if you know anybody who might be interested, Anybody who might be interested, word of mouth is always great too. Don't forget to spread the word. If you have students, post office. Version will apply. I think it'll be a very good experience. I will split that. Anyway, thank you for your time. Questions from Activision? Just to zoom in, is there a reason why you wanted to sign stuff to SL2 structures? I mean, is it they can help with SL2? I mean, one of the weird things, like, it I mean, one of the weird things, like at first we thought, no way, no way are we going to get these things out because this is such a general idea for construction. It might say that the kernels that they get out are, they can be characterized in some other way that is just sort of built purely out of the fiber product, doing something to the fiber product, perhaps. I can't say anything beyond that sort of speculation, but th th it's just the SL two actions are so about so much about hypercaler stuff. About so much about hypercaler stuff. Talk to them about how they love multi-kernels? Not productively, no. Not productively. Because I must ask this question of one of the authors, and I got an answer, but I don't. It was 15 years ago, I don't remember what it was. So Countess did us a favor, and he wrote afterwards, he wrote up a paper describing the kernel more geometrically. So it's like the Colombo qualification of the push forward of a line bundle on the smooth focus. Push forward in the line bundle on the smooth locus. Because this fiber product has multiple components, and you look at the smooth locus, and they describe a particular line bundle and they push it forward, and they look at the S2ification. And that is what their kernel is. Up to some twist of line buttons. Somewhat familiar. Yeah, that's, I mean, but that doesn't that work? I mean, that I don't I have no way of trying to probe that working in greater generality. But it's it's valid. But it's valid approach I have. That again, then. Oh, yeah. See, that's a weird thing. I think it just reminds us of that office. Yeah, before they create this. Oh, okay. Okay. And so. And so somehow I didn't so I don't really know what the question is whether you're in the bottom of the link. There are that's like this is one where you can somehow it doesn't have to be a lot of money. Oh yeah, there's Oh yeah, there's a number of them so that's right. And the way you have to reduce this phi from the x to this bar. I guess the point is just a big barrier. Each of those and what they do it are just each of those five separate programs to bunch of people like the page automatic. So creating one of Y is printing read that LGBTQ. So they have these like magic. Oh, it's not a problem. Yeah, so this works. I mean, it doesn't change the thing about the fourth basically. But everybody always told me that there's this one. But everybody always told me that there's this thing that's not everybody. I mean you never wrote down anything I do like in the show. Anyways, that was never fun there. Yeah, you can also give a similar experience and then I never punished. I might be on long walks and I'm not there at 60 and stop reading. So we're using future volume expertise. Yeah, exactly. But I still think, okay, there's different ways to do this and better ways to small. I think that's the number of things that the summit is best number for you. Oh, and I think what you do kind of just finds out. It's like X alpha is just a point. The one is over here, it is a lot. Yeah, I agree. But regardless of, I think there shouldn't be this many more just one time. You still get them like that. It's very well colourful. I call hands. I don't really know exactly what's done, but it doesn't actually. I guess it just extends some of these things. When I saw that, I just started. So he was exactly. Yeah, but yeah. And here is in use for that. So you can like But yeah, I mean, I've never written for writing not to go through different stories. So there's various different tasks which decay very differently. So one thing to explain these tools, in general, and you can always remove the tools by pressing the surface, maybe nothing on what So depending on what kind of preference as something about the like background. I kept sharing like the picture space obviously. There's all these different things. All these different things. Maybe I'll see you in the lane. So that rates are volumes. The season is that other teams are actually different. Especially when you have programming. It's very much. Oh, okay. Yeah, I think so. If I take a video for this, that would work much better. Something like that has to sound like a little bit of a test. Well, it helps you sometimes. If you do want to find
