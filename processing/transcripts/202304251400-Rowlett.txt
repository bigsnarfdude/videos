So welcome everybody to the afternoon session. I'm going to start with our first speaker today, Professor Julie Rowlett, who will speak on Co-Formally Compact with Mass Mystery. Thank you. And first, I'd like to thank the organizers for inviting me to this beautiful place and also to everyone for Everyone for the wonderful talks so far. So, not only is the place beautiful, but the mathematics has been beautiful and very different and wonderful discussions as well. So, it's really my pleasure to be here. Thank you very, very much. So, I'm going to talk about, I should have probably written it here, joint work with Nalia Haralambo, whose name you might recognize because she Recognized because she's also worked with Jichin Lu, and this is very much related to Chichin Lu's topic. So you might even view it as like a light version. Okay, so go like this. Yes. Okay. In case anyone doesn't know what a conformally compact manifold is, just a heuristic explanation is that Explanation is that they're a type of complete manifold that has a certain structure, and I'll give you a precise definition in a moment. And this is a very, very broad class of manifolds. So one of the reasons they were introduced is because many of the geometric models that are used to describe the shape of the universe fall into this broad class of. Into this broad class of conformally compact mathematics. Okay, so the precise definition. So as I mentioned, they're complete, but they're not compact. And I'm going to use the dimension convention n plus 1. So in the last talk, the dimension was n, or mine is n plus 1, but I think Juchin also used n plus 1. n plus one so um maybe i'll just write some of these things on the board okay so my manifold is if you want one way to imagine it like this at like a poincare model for the hyperbolic space the disk model so you can think of infinity as a bound As a boundary that you'll never actually get to. And row here is called a boundary-defining function. So that's a function that's smooth, it goes from your manifold to the non-negative reals, and it vanishes simply at the boundary. So, in other words, it defines the boundary because you can tell the boundary, oh, that's where the row is zero. And so then it could. And so then a conformally compact manifold is a manifold whose metric is of the form. So a metric divided by this boundary defining function squared. And an example would be if I instead used the upper half space model for hyperbolic space and then had Space and then had rho being the coordinate that vanishes in that upper half space. Then you take the Euclidean metric, divide by rho squared, and that's your hyperbolic upper half space metric. So M was a complete manifold. Yeah. And so is it embedded in some other manifold, or do I how does that be performed? Um quite correct. Yes, model would draw a few line. We have group this one would be what the box has the image. So do I look at equivalence classes of geodesics that go to infinity and or equivalence? This metric g bar upstairs is a metric that's defined on M union, the boundary. So you have a metric inside and then you also have a metric on a n-dimensional smooth A smooth, compact manifold, which is the boundary. It's a smooth, compact manifold. It starts out being smooth. Okay, sorry. Yeah, so we start out with M and its boundary. And its boundary is an n-dimensional manifold. And M is an nth one-dimensional, you could say, open manifold. You could say open manifold. Boundary is open. Yeah, and the boundary is closed. Yeah, boundary is not boundary. Compact. Yeah. So that's the starting point. And then the conformally name comes from the type of the metric that you have. Are we good? Okay. Okay, so as far as I can tell, they originally go all the way back to Penrose in the 1960s, who used them to investigate stuff in general relativity. I think that's the oldest reference, but if anyone has anything older, please tell me because I would be curious. And then, so these, they have been studied in books. They have been studied in both the physics literature and the math literature, and I can't name everybody. But Hawking and this MM is a Swedish thing where we say, but I realized it works exactly the same in English. You say, many more. And then on the math side, by many people, I mean Eric too, and probably others here, but I just drew some names that. I just drew some names that people might recognize. Okay, so now the main reason I wrote the definition of the Laplace operator is so that you know my sign convention, if there's a minus or not. I like the minus, so and this is like a crucial, like a central operator, you know, because it appears in the Helmholtz equation, the In the Helmholtz equation, the heat equation, the wave equation, the Schr√∂dinger equation. So, this is an operator that everybody knows and loves and wants to know things about. And because our manifold is complete, there is a canonical extension. So initially, it makes sense to define this operator as smooth, compactly supported functions. But then, well, if you're doing L2 spectral theory, you want a Hilbert space and You want a Hilbert space, and otherwise we want a nice Fanach space. But there is fortunately a canonical self-canonical self-adjoined, essentially self-adjoined at L2 and a canonical extension to closed subspaces of LB, where the other values of P between 1 and 2. Okay, so then I wanted this talk to be very inclusive, so that's why I'm giving. So that's why I'm giving, trying to give all the definitions and not leave anybody out in case you work on something different from what I work on. So just the spectrum for an operator. So basically it's associated, you have your operator, and then it's acting on some space, which doesn't have to be a Hilbert space, it could just be a Vonach space. And the And the spectrum is basically all of the complex numbers where your operator minus that number times the identity isn't a variable. So the complement is called the resolvent set. I suppose I just introduced this backwards. So this can come from different, so the operator H minus So the operator H minus lambda identity can fail to be invertible for different reasons. So it could be that there's an eigenvalue, so there's some element in the domain of the operator, so that h of i to that element is lambda times that element, or its range could be proper, so it's not closed. And then there's also potentially residual spectrum, but also. Also, potentially residual spectrum, but often there's none of that. So, a really familiar example that you all know from calculus is: let's just take our operator to be minus d dx squared, and then let our Hilbert space in this case be h20. So, essentially, h2 with zero boundary condition, or Dirichlet boundary condition, and then sines. And then sines are eigenfunctions of that operator. And then these n squared, pi squared are eigenvalues. So these are spectral. All right. So I'm interested in the spectrum of the Laplace operator on a conformally compact. Laplace operator on a conformally compact mantle. And back in 1988, my supervisor, Rafe Matzeo, proved that the L2 spectrum is contained, or actually, I should change that. The L2 spectrum contains, not is contained in, but it contains the interval from n squared alpha 0 squared. n squared alpha 0 squared over 4 out to infinity. So Jichin drew this picture and I'm going to draw this as well. Sorry, this is just curiously boundary conditions. No, because it's complete. So there's a canonical self-adjoint extension. You don't have to worry about any sort of a boundary condition. Sorry, is that V rho zero on Rn? Is that the alpha zero? Is that zero in Rn? That's actually Rn wouldn't be of this type. The reason Rn, with its normal metric, I don't know, you could put some other metric on it, the reason is because the sectional curvatures will tend to This on the boundary, and d rho, as I said, the boundary defining function vanishes only simply. So the d rho at the boundary is non-zero, and the boundary is compact. So absolute d rho is a strictly positive function. And the sectional curvatures tend to minus absolute d rho squared, which are negative. And that doesn't really happen. And that doesn't really happen in new planes. Yeah. Okay, now I was just wondering if that recovers the spectrum in RN, right? It's just zero to infinity. I mean, the spectrum for RN is zero to infinity. Exactly. Yeah, yeah, that's true for that setting, but Rn isn't one of these. I see, I see. Because this is my easiest intuitive way to see it, because the sectional curvatures in Rn don't tend to negative stuff. They kind of are just zero. Yeah, so this, right, so this is my complex plane shoulder, which isn't here. So, this is our L2 spectrum. So, our L2 spectrum is precisely this integral where the bottom. where the bottom depends on this minimum of t rho squared over the boundary. So you see that curvature appearing in the spectrum. And then I like this quote, so that's a quote, something Maseo said. So this alpha one squared is the maximum of degrowth squared. So that's going to degree squared. So that's going to appear somewhere over here. And Rafe said multiplicity presumably varies in a complicated manner in this interval. And he left it at that. So there's eigenvalues in that continuous spectrum? I think the only possible would be an embedded eigenvalue at the bottom. What does it mean with multiplicity? Yeah, but it's it's a bit big. Okay. It's an interesting question, maybe that's arguably about multiple seconds. Question: If he does egg about this, yeah, I mean, yeah, so that was proven later. So, he proved this is, I think he that contained in is wrong. It's limited section. I think it is this exactly. So, there were no more, to the best of my knowledge, there were no more spectral results for conformally compact manifolds until Borthwick in 2001. But if I missed something, 2001. But if I miss something, feel free to jump in and point it out. To the best of my knowledge, though, there's this rather large gap between the next set of results, which we're by Forthrick. So what did he do? So it's kind of natural in this setting to introduce a second parameter related to the spectrum. Related to the spectrum. So set the eigenvalue parameter to be alpha zero squared s n minus s, and then now consider s in the complex plane and look at the resolvent and study it on L2. And so this interval That Maseo had this vague statement about. So when we unwrap this into the spectral parameter S, then Borthwick obtained a meromorphic continuation to the complex plane minus these little funny intervals. I can't draw them, but I can refer you to his paper where there's a nice picture of this. And these little funny intervals, And these little funny collections of intervals correspond exactly to this part of the spectrum. So, why is S times N minus S the natural framework? You're going to see later in my talk, I think. I hope it will become clear. Right, so that was 2001, and then So that was 2001. And then the next spectral result for conformally compact manifolds that I'm aware of, there's another large gap. Because it's in 2016. And there, Antonio Saka, I'm sorry I don't remember the name, first name, the second author, Wong, proved that if you assume non-trapping, which is a very strong assumption, non-trapping means there are no Assumption. Non-trapping means there are no closed geodesics. So if you like closed geodesics, then that's kind of an unfortunate assumption. But if you make that assumption, then you get nice estimates for the resolvent and you get some... So resonances are the poles of this meromorphic continuation of the resolvent. And so you obtain near the spectrum a little. A little bubble of resonance-free area of resonance-free. So the resolvent is continued to the complex plane to be meromorphic, but so it has poles. And that's saying that if you have this non-trapping assumption, then you get a little area of pole-free around the continuous spectrum. So these closed gender six units in M or in R? In M. In M. Yes. So I think that's quite a strong assumption. M is not simply connected, it should be clear. That's wrong. Tromat infinity, we cannot even go. Well, so, yeah, another way is actually you can prove. Actually, you can prove, and Saparetto did in earlier work, that all the post-geodesics in such a manifold are contained in a compact subset. And then you can look at the dynamics of the geodesic flow and ask things about topological entropy. And it's entirely possible that the topological entropy is positive, in which case this is not true. If the topological entropy is positive, then the number of closed geodesics grows like e to the ht of ER. HT, where H is the. For HT, where H is the entropy, and this is counting the geodesics of length less than to T. So there's like a lot of those geodesics. And for example, if you take so further examples of conformally compact manifolds are infinite volume complete hyperbolic manifolds, so H n plus 1 quotient co-compact group, and those very often will have. Those very often will have lots of close GNSAs. So Jichin gave some nice motivation for the study of the loss operator not just acting on L2, but actually acting on LP. And I don't know if you mentioned the motivation. I don't know if you mentioned the motivation for the heat equation, but if you have a solution to the heat equation that's non-negative, then if you take the L1 norm of that solution, you get the amount of heat over your manifold. So in some sense, L1 makes a lot of sense as a space if you're interested in solutions to the heat equation. But L1 has its challenges. Of course, it's not a Hilbert space. It's not reflexive. And so there's some difficulty to, there's some other aspects to the analysis that one has to take under consideration. But so now I get to my results. So as I mentioned, this So, as I mentioned, this is joint work with Nellia Haralambu. And the first result is for the L1 spectrum. So, what we were able to prove is that the L1 spectrum contains a certain region of the complex plane. And you can see the way I've written it, so X and Y are. And so you're... And so you're, if you set x equal to the right side, you can see that that's a parabolic type region. Sorry, if it's equality, then it's a sideways parabola. And x greater than or equal to the outside means you're on the inside. So we could throw The inside. So we could prove that this whole corrupt parabolic region is contained. Oh no, there is a typo here. Actually, this should be gone. And then let me draw this a little better. So forget the shift. So for the L1 spectrum, it's uh it's not shifted. So what should we think about that shift? So what should we do with that? It's very good. Uh I think that this guy should just be gone. Look at the curve. Why don't you rewrite the current curve off the board? Okay, what? Yeah, I hope I'm remembering this correctly. It will become quite apparent when I explain the proof. Yeah, I believe there should be no shift. And the reason, so what we, our second result is, you see, if I had, if this were here, these would be the same. So it would be a rather redundant statement. But what we proved is that it can. What we proved is that it contains this region and it's contained inside this other region. So this parabola is just the same but shifted to the left. So we were not able to get, and I have a little picture of this. There we go. Right, so note. Right, so note that my inside parabola starts at zero and my containing parabola is shifted to the left. And so all we were able to get is that the L1 spectrum contains this darker blue region and it's contained in a larger region, but we're not sure about what happens in between. Happens in between, and this is related to this variable curvature at the boundary. So the sexual curvatures tend to this minus d rho squared. And then d rho squared is a continuous function on a compact sex, so it's got a min and a max. That's where the alpha zero and the alpha one come from. The alpha one comes from? And if those are the same, then we would have the precise description of the L1 spectrum. We would know exactly what it is. But because those curvatures can vary, there's this weird region in between, somewhat analogous to this inaccessible region in Borthwick's work, that's coming from the variable curvature at infinity. Which are at infinity. So if anyone has pardon? Let me just check. So were you not assuming Einstein's equations? No. And if you did, that would resolve this issue. Yes, because then the sectional curvatures would tend to a constant. Yeah, exactly. Yes. So this is after the ship of the space. So this is after the shift of the spectral parameter. Is that correct? Remember how there was like that n s times 1 minus s? Does that happen for this x plus y 1? No, this is the actual spectral parameter. Yes, the actual spectral parameter. So, we also studied the LP spectrum. And this is, I'll show you a picture, but so this is not just a parabolic region. So, if I fix the value of a, then x greater than or equal to the right side is a single. The right side is a single parabolic region like this. It's the inside of this sideways parabola. But this value A ranges between the min and max squared of like coming from the curvature at the boundary. And so if you stare at this, so if p is one, then we would get back our other result. But if p is not one, Other result. But if p is not 1, then what happens? Well, if you make a larger, it shifts to the right. But you're dividing by a in the first term. So it shifts to the right and it gets skinnier. And if you make a smaller, then it's more to the left, but it's right. No, no. No, no, no, sorry. If we make a larger, it gets farther to the right and wider. If we make a smaller, it's farther to the left and skinnier. And I have a little picture of this. And then this one, though, is just a single parabola that contains the LP spectrum. So for PLACHNF2, it's will because of. It's well because of duality it's great, but some of these values sitting up here that don't seem to be very complex. So it's what P are they? I mean I just didn't we just didn't look at any other range of P because it's not necessary. Yeah right no just that's this are these regions? I mean in principle it shouldn't be like where on the the if you substitute one over P by one minus one over P you should get the statement. Oh, you can do an exercise I can check it afterwards. So you see, as the parameter A goes in one direction, they go to the left, but they get skinnier. And then as they go to the right, and they get faster. Go to the right and they get fatter. So instead of being a single parabolic region, it's this whole ensemble. And this shifting, this ensemble also comes again from this variable curvature. So you see, if the curvatures at infinity were constant, i.e., d rho were constant, then this phenomenon. Then this phenomenon wouldn't happen. It would just be a single value. And so I think it's kind of interesting that these L1 and LP spectrum really pick up and feel the variable curvature at the boundary. Okay. Okay, so how does one prove such results? Well for starters you can near the boundary get a very nice specific form for your metric. So there's a neighborhood of the boundary which has a It's like a worked product type metric. And so, in this way, you can see you can separate dx from dy, which is very convenient in a loss operator. And whatever remains is, remember, so x is my boundary defining function here. It's a particular Here. It's a particular one so that the metric has this form. So at the boundary, x is going to 0. So O of x to the infinity means that that vanishes faster than any power of x as x goes to 0. So you can just sort of ignore it, which is convenient. And then what these h's are, so h has dependence on x as a parameter, but not in terms of Not in terms of the metric. So H is a family of metrics on the boundary that varies in a smooth way depending on this boundary defining function. And when x is tending to zero, it converges to a fixed smooth metric on the boundary. So then, because of that, we get this nice form, maybe it doesn't look nice to you, but I think it looks nice, of our Laplace operator. And that allows us to do some analysis. And right, so Okay, so the idea for the first part, the first part is to obtain the parabola or the ensemble of parabolic regions to show that that is all in the spectrum. And then the second part is to find the larger parabola that contains all of the spectrum. So what we're looking for to show that What we're looking for to show that certain complex numbers are spectrum is we're not going to be able to get actual eigenfunctions. So we're going to try to get approximate eigenfunctions. And in that way, show that the plus minus lambda i can't be inverted. So we start with powers of the boundary defining function, and we apply our Laplace. And we apply our Laplace operator, which has this nice form. And you see, what we get is: okay, imagine, ah, right, let me go back just a second. So that's not bad, that was cold. Okay, so this alpha squared here and this alpha squared here Basically, it's minus 0 squared. This is minus alpha squared y. That's exactly what this function is. And as I said, that's what the sectional curvatures tend to as x goes to 0. So going back to our little calculation of just a power. Just a power of the boundary-defined function. If this were constant, then you would have Laplace of x to lambda is a constant times x to lambda. And now you see what is the constant? Lambda times n minus lambda. So that is why it is common to instead use capital lambda for this thing and have this be what I And have this be what it what was Orthodox S before. So that's S n minus S, that's one way of seeing where this comes from. So this would almost be an eigenfunction because you have this other stuff, but remember as you go to the boundary, x tends to zero, so it's decaying as x goes to zero. So it's up to this. Up to this lower order term, you would have an eigenfunction, and the eigenvalue would be precisely alpha squared lambda minus lambda. But alpha is not constant. So this is our heuristic for trying to build functions that will be approximate eigenfunctions, but we have to work a bit harder. A bit harder. So, what we need are basically what we're going to do is alpha is a nice smooth function on a compact set. So in a little neighborhood, alpha is close to a specific value. Right? So, we're going to take two cutoff functions. So, y So y is our coordinate on the boundary. So the b of y is going to localize around a point on the boundary. So b will be supported in some neighborhood of a point that we will shrink. Then we also are going to have these We also are going to have these x to different power terms that we want to have go away. So that means we're going to want to sort of go closer and closer to the boundary. So our other cutoff function, phi, is going to move us out closer and closer to the boundary so that we can control all of the extra junk that we get from the boss operator applied to function this more. And these aren't all the terms, they wouldn't fit. So, if you apply the Laplace operator to such a function, because it has this nice form, what we get is a first term that looks almost like, well, if alpha were constant, then this would be like a constant times my function, like an eigenfunction. Alpha is not constant, but this localization is hard. But this localization is how we're going to deal with that. And then we have these other terms that have higher powers of x. So as x goes to 0, they're going to be small. And we have two more. And then, because remember the form of the metric and the form of Laplace operator, they were both the specific form and then O of x to the infinity. So we then. infinity. So we then also carry along an o of x to the infinity, but that's quite nice. We decays very fast. So it's the first term that we use to approximate an eigenfunction because if alpha were constant, it's going to be a constant times our function. Right, so it's alpha squared is a continuous function. Alpha squared is a continuous function, so we take any point in its image, and then the free image contains an open set. And so in particular, it contains a ball. So our b function is going to be supported in this little ball. So then in this little ball, alpha squared minus a is less than epsilon. So then, Then we get that the difference between alpha squared lambda n minus lambda s, which is the first term when we applied the Laplace operator to our test function, and then this eigenvalue parameter, the L P norm of that is less than S, X1 times the L P norm of S. So all we then have to do is get the one, two, One, two, three, four, five, six other terms to also be less than a constant times epsilon times the L P norm. Sorry, does L P norm is the whole manifold then? Yeah, but I have these cutoff functions. So my thing has compact supports. Let's see, it's already called region. Yeah. Also, because I only have this special form of the Laplace operator. Form of the Laplace operator and the metric and everything near the boundary. So, like this statement only holds when I have things that are supported like near the boundary. So it's supported near the boundary, but so really it would be in like a little B has support there, but my test function would have support like in this part. So, as you can see, it's a compact subset of my. No, it doesn't go all the way up to the boundary. It gets closer and closer and closer. Okay, so if I have a function in x, will it be closer to z? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have these six remaining terms, and we want to give them less than epsilon times the p norm of f. Than epsilon times the p norm of f. And then we can say that the whole thing, Laplace F minus eigenvalue f norm less than epsilon norm f. And then we can let epsilon tend to zero, and then we have a family of linearly independent approximate eigenfunctions, and then we get that our parameter A, which is the value at the center of At the center of the ball. So it's some value in here, and then times lambda times n minus lambda, that will be in the spectrum. Okay, so we have this function x to the lambda, and we have this form of our metric, which has basically this x squared downstairs. So if you imagine you're integrating in y coordinates and x coordinates, then you have integrals like x. Have integrals like x, you're doing a p norm, so you have absolute x to some power, right? And the power has complex numbers in it. So absolute x, complex number powers, that will turn into x to the real part of whatever's upstairs. And so basically, we want this to be big so that we get the six remaining terms to be small compared to it. And what happens is that our f integral is going to look more or less like doing x to the minus 1 from a small number to a fixed number. That blows up. And then our other integrals are either going to look like doing x to the minus 1, but from a small number to another small number. So then you basically get log 2, which is fine. Or x to a power that's larger than minus 1, which is also fine. Which is also fine. So, in that way, we can make all of those six remaining terms smaller than epsilon. And then we get that this a lambda n minus lambda is a value in the spectrum where a is anything between alpha zero squared and alpha one squared. Okay, so then it's a well known. I don't know. Well known, I don't know how well known, but fact that the LP spectrum contains the LQ spectrum for Q going from P up to 2. So that's how we get... So we initially, when we have one value of P and one value of A, we would get A for alphabet. But then when we have this whole range, we get so this whole range. This whole range for Q, going from P up to 2, is contained in the spectrum. And when you calculate, that gives you the whole inside. And then if we just write out lambda as, you know, real part plus i imaginary part, that gives you this region with this inequality defining. And um so oh I can skip it because Jitchin already defined it. So using basically the larger parabola that contains the spectrum is essentially just a big corollary to Chichin and Nalia's result. So I think I'll actually just skip those details and leave it at that. So the containment parabola is thanks to Jichin and Parabola is thanks to Jichin and Nelia. I mean, it really is just a corollary to their results. And I'll stop and see if anyone has questions, comments, thoughts. Questions?
