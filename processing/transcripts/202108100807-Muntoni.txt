Institute for Genomic Medicine and the Polytechnic in the Polytechnic University of Turin in Italy. So I'm a physicist. So probably the approaches that I'm going to talk about today are kind of different to what I have heard like today or yesterday. So I'm kind of sorry about that. But anyway, so today I'm going to talk about this work that has been made in collaboration with several co-authors, as you can see. Co-authors, as you can see, and the idea was to apply some methods borrowed from statistical mechanics. Sorry, Anna, can you make your speaker volume up? Because people are having hard time to listen to what you speak. I can change the volume of the microphone. Yeah, your volume, I think, because if many people are having the same problem, maybe you can. Yeah. Is it better? Yeah. Yeah. Is it better? Yeah, better. Thank you. Okay, perfect. Sorry. So, okay. So the idea of this work was to apply some methods that come from statistical mechanics to the problem of mitigate the COVID-19 spreading that all we know about that. I think so. I mean, let me, I don't really need to introduce what's the problem. Really, I need to introduce what's the problem here because basically it affects everybody in these two years. But I just want to fix some ideas. So, the virus that is responsible for this disease is called SARS-CoV-2, and it is very hard to mitigate this spreading because the virus spread also through asymptomatic individuals. So, it's been let's say clear that one of the key aspects to mitigate this spreading was to identify. Was to identify, so trace, then test, and then isolated the people that were tested positive for COVID-19. So at the beginning of last year, basically what people used to do is the following. So suppose that we have some kind of temporal contact network where you have two individuals, like for instance, I and J, that meet and are in contact in, let's say, at a certain time T. So these. On time t. So, this is, for instance, our contact network, this small network. And whenever one of the nodes was tested as positive for COVID-19, it had to inform the health, let's say, system about the recent contacts. So, most of the time, they were relatives of friends and someone that they know each other in a sense. And so this is kind of a weak. This is kind of a weak system because we don't know all the recent contacts, right? Because maybe you suppose that you go to a restaurant, you go for shopping, or I don't know, use public transportation, but it is impossible to say detect all the rescued contacts. So one idea to improve this scheme was to use digital contact tracing, where individuals download an app for the contact for the tracing based on the Bluetooth signal. Based on the Bluetooth signal. And so that, I mean, the temporal contact traces can be known, let's say, can be fully known. And whenever, let's say, a user sends to the app, inform the app that has been tested positive to COVID-19, the server sends a notification to the recent contacts. And these people need to be tested. This strategy worked somehow in some states, for instance, in the UK. There are some papers. In the UK, there are some papers published about this success. But, however, there are some drawbacks. First of all, the app says to you, well, I mean, that you have been in contact with someone that has been tested positive, so it's just a notification, but it does not quantify how lucky you are. You are infected, right? So it doesn't give you a score in a sense. And you can imagine that as they Uh, you can imagine that as the PDF, if the epidemic starts to spread very fast, then the number of individuals that get identification is huge, and uh, this is basically leads to a misuse of all medical resources from, say, human resources to COVID swaps and so on and so forth. So, our idea was the following. I mean, if we assume a certain model for the propagation, can we first try to reconstruct all the epidemics over all the times and then give a The times and then give, let's say, an estimate of the individual risk of being affected at a certain time where we want to make some intervention. And more mathematically speaking, I will define, let's say, as X, as a function of T, as the collective trajectory of the N individuals. And here, time is the time T is a discrete time, but of the time scale of a day. But we can extend, say, this model even for. Extend say this model even for continuous time epidemics. And I call the set of observations using big O. And the results of medical tests are both, let's say, both the positive test and the negative test. The latter also give important information about the spreading. So from a probabilistic point of view, we can use bias theorem and we can say that the a posteriori probability of observing probability of observing a trajectory X given a set of observation O is given by the following formula where okay I have let's say enlightened the likelihood function of the observation given a trajectory divided by the evidence of the observation which as you can see is independent of the trajectories and therefore we'll be neglected in the following because our target let's say quantity are the trajectories here so the x times the prior probability of the trajectory times the prior probability of the trajectories which is the p of x and and here we put we we encode all the information about the epidemic model that we have and to to make the the this all the computation uh kind of simple we use as a as an epidemic model the sir so the successible in factor recovered model this is a compartmental model where all the population is subdivided in three sets uh so at the Uh, so at the initial time, all the population is in a successible state, except for maybe a few nodes that are called a passion zero and are infected. Then, if a contact occurs, then between a successible and infected individual, there is a probability, constant probability lambda that the successible nodes become infected. And after a while, all the infected individuals have a constant probability move. Have a constant probability of changing the state in the following time step and so becoming recovered. So it's a very simple model. It catches some features of the COVID-19 disease as, for instance, if you become recovered, then you don't get successful again in the interest. In the interesting time window. So you get some kind of immunization likely for us. But anyway, this is very too simple because assuming that the probabilities of infection and the probability of recovery as a constant in time is very hard, let's say, assumption. So we slightly change this SIR model to take into account, let's say, the complexity of the COVID-19 disease. Of the COVID-19 disease, and to do that, we consider this model which is called the OpenABM model, and it is suitable for COVID-19. Here, as you can see, this is the scheme of propagation, let's say, where all the 11 states and the rates that allow for going from one state to another. So, the first step was to map each of the 11 states into one of the three. Into one of the three possible states of the SIR model, and then to learn, let's say, the probability of infection and the probability of recovery using, let's say, this model as a tool. So what we have seen is that this two probability depends on time and depends exactly on the time elapsed since infection. And let's say the probability Say the probability of infection is basically a gamma function, gamma probability that has, let's say, an average value of six days. Instead, the probability of recovery is also distributed as a gamma, where the expected value is here of 16 days. So at the end, we can, let's say, write our prior as, let's say, the product between an initial condition that takes into account. An initial condition that takes into account the number of parts and zero at the first time step of the dynamics times of the transitions probability. And because of this, let's say known constant in time probability of recovery and of infection, this term is not, this process becomes non-Markovian, and more or less the memory of this memory term is more or less of two or three weeks as we have seen. Plus, the likelihood. Plus, the likelihood is basically gives you how I mean how probably is an observable given the trajectory. And with very small effort, we can introduce here the false negative rate and the false positive rates associated with the medical test, which are not exact, unfortunately. So, even if we introduce all these, let's say, ingredients in the posterior probability. In the posterior probability that I've shown you before, this problem becomes intractable because we cannot compute the posterior probability given the observation. And our idea was to use two methods that comes from statistical mechanics. One is called simple mean feed, the other one is belief propagation message passing algorithm to approximate the exactly the marginal probability distribution of the full apostate. Distribution of the full a posteriori probability. And okay, I don't have to, fortunately, I don't have the time to talk about simple mean field. What I would like to introduce to you is to believe propagation. And okay, so to use this scheme, we need to map, let's say, the initial problem of determining the trajectory over another problem of determining the infection times and the recovery times. But I mean, But I mean, the two problems are basically the same because once the trajectory are fully determined, then the recovery times gives you exactly the same trajectory, right? So suppose that you have this series of states, then you can determine the infection time, the recovery time, and there is no confusion here. And so for that, I mean, in order to, let's say, to Say to define feasible infection recovery times given a trajectory, you or actually is the opposite. I mean, you need this compatibility function that basically gives you like some hard constraints on the times. Then, okay, the two sets of variables, so the Z and the R, defines the fully determined trajectories, but in order to use belief propagation, we need to introduce. Belief propagation: we need to introduce some auxiliary, let's say, infection times that are instead associated with, let's say, edges of the temporal networks. And these variables are called Sij, and this is the time at which a node I infects a node J that is susceptible. So this is the Sij with S is the conditional probability of the Sij given infection time and the recovery time of the node I. Of the node i. And okay, so this is the first part of the compatibility function, just tells you that the infection time, if i infects j, this time needs to be between the time in which the node i gets in the infection and before i get recovered. Plus, a second term that takes into account the situation where node i does not infect node j. And this is also possible. The recovery delay. The recovery delay is let's say a prior over this difference of time, and it is distributed according to the gamma function that we have found from the open MDM model. As well as, I mean, here in the conditional probability we have used as probability of infection between I and J that obtained from the very complicated OpenABM model. So at the end, we can write. So at the end, we can write, let's say, our a posterior probability of these three sets of variables given the observation as this formula. And what we want to do is to apply a belief propagation scheme, so message passing algorithm to this probability distribution, because even though we have done all this mapping, the problem is it is as the initial one. And to apply belief propagation, we need to first build of We need to first build a factor graph which is associated with the posteriori probability distribution. And to avoid some very small loops in the factor graph over which we run message passing, we have to collect basically the Sij and the SJI in a unique variable node. Once this process has been done, you can see that basically Done, you can see that basically each piece of the temporal initial temporal contact network is kind of similar or the final, let's say, factor graph, and we can run belief propagation on a network which is very similar to the initial temporal graph. So, I don't have the time to give you all the detail of this algorithm. Let me just say that belief propagation is an algorithm which has been based in machine learning, but also in statistical mechanics. In statistical mechanics, and it's based in iteratively solving a fixed point equation over these messages that runs in the factor graphs. So there are messages associated with the ages of this object. At convergence, we can compute the so-called beliefs, which are associated with the variable nodes of the factor graph. And these beliefs gives you an approximation of the probability that a certain variable takes. Say a certain variable takes a certain value. And in our case, we are interested in the probability that each node of the original temporal graph gets infected at a time, say Zi. If we want to estimate, let's say, the risk of each node i, we can, let's say, compute the intervention time that I call t int as the sum of the beliefs of all the previous, let's say, tau days, where we have seen that for time. Where we have seen that for tau equal to one week is sufficient to get very nice result. So, our, let's say, to conclude, our scheme was the following. So, we have, let's say, a temporal contact network that was obtained using digital contact tracing and a set of observations, so both positive and negative tests given by the users. Then, at a certain time, Then, at a certain time, so at the intervention time, we run our reconstruction step, in our case, either simple mean feed or belief propagation, and we compute the probability, this posterior probability for all the nodes of the networks. From that, on these measures, we compute the risk of each node and then we test the nodes that have the highest risk. So, the test has positive. So, the test test positive is they are confined, so they do a quarantine, and instead, the tested negative are free to go. To quantify our performance and to test whether this scheme works, we use the dynamical model provided by OpenABM. So, OpenABM gives you both the epidemic model and also sorry. So can you hear me? Yes, you can. Yes, we can hear you. Sorry, I was, I heard someone talking, but okay. So this OpenABM gives you both the epidemic modeling, but also the dynamics. So the temporal contact metrics is. The temporal contact networks is actually a superposition of the households, which are small, fully connected models linking, let's say, all the families, and a superposition of workplaces where the graph for the workplaces are small world networks, and some random networks connected uniformly at random of the nodes of the graph. And this gives you basically some random interaction that you can have public transportation, so on and so forth. So our scheme was the following. So, our scheme was the following. We took a graph of 500,000 individuals and we choose randomly 50 nodes as the partial zero. Then we let the epidemics evolve up to 10 days and then we perform our reconstruction strategy. We make several tests according to the number that you can see here in the top. You can see here in the top of the plots, and then the people that have been tested positive go to quarantine and so on and so forth. So, we compare our performances with respect to the random guesting, where we randomly instruct some individuals and we test them, and the content tracing, which is what actually is doing in practice. So, where people get a notification and has to do a test. And so, the plots. And so the plots here show you the number of infectors over time as a function, let's say, as a hyperparameter, the number of observations, which is the number of tests used in this scheme. And as you can see, basically for 1000 to 150 observation, very propagation is the unique method that is able to have, let's say, the better reconstruction, so the better estimate of the risk. And so it is able to stop the epidemic after basically 50, 70. 50 75 days. But then, I mean, these results have been made using, say, medical tests that are exact and an app adoption of 100%. So all the contacts has been detected in this experiment. But this is not realistic. In a realistic scenario, we have that the medical tests are inaccurate. So we test, let's say, against the false negative rate of the test. And as you can see, Rate of the test. And as you can see, if you use belief propagation, even if you have 30% of error in the medical test, still it is able to stop the spreading after 100 days. Instead, I mean, if the contact network is not fully known, the results are very sensitive to it. And the performance is dramatically changes, as you can see. So the number of the infected grows and the epidemics is. Growth and the epidemics is not stopped anymore. But for all the cases, but as you can see, the number of infected still is reduced with respect to, for instance, a random guessing, suggesting that these methods help anyway in gaining some time and introduce some other, let's say, restriction measures such that lockdowns, local lockdowns. Lockdowns and local lockdowns, and so on, and so forth. So, I'm finished here. So, I talk about how to use some methods that come from statistical mechanics to reconstruct epidemic trajectories and to use the reconstruction to implement some tracing and testing strategies against COVID-19. Well, we are working on some development on this. What we want to do is basically to introduce some new ingredients. To introduce some new ingredients like vaccinated people, or well, let's say, for instance, introduce two different false negative rates of the medical tests, for instance, in conditions in which you have, let's say, PCR tests, but also the fast tests that are less accurate and so on and so forth. So, I thank you for your attention, and I'm happy. And I'm happy to answer your question if you have any. Thank you very much.
