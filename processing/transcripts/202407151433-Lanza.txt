Thank you for the presentation and thank you for the opportunity of being here and doing this talk and also of course listening to all the other talks, very interesting. My talk will be on a topic quite different from the ones at least that I have the occasion of hearing this morning, and in particular it's not related or at least to the extent I I need the occasion of dipping into. Of dipping into with the non-Newtonian fluids. So the system I will describe is fully Newtonian. But follow-up applying to Newtonian features is of course something that is possible to do, as I will mention at the very end. But before that, I forgot to say that I'm a postdoc and working at the University of Oslo, in Poland, in particular. I joined Laboratory between Tornado and Tonal and Peter, and these are the names of the collaborators that were eventually involved in this project. I want to start with the news that happened in Italy, in Sicily. Italy is where I come from. Not Sicily, but still, there was an eruption of the famous volcano, Ethna. This is not particular. This is not particularly breaking news in the sense that an eruption from a volcano happens more or less once a year. Still, it was very impressive and good to see it. In particular, when I looked at this new, I wanted to see if there was a particular feature, the one I'm going to talk about, and there wasn't, which is the presence of this channel, in the sense of the fact that LABA from the RPA. Fact that the lava from the eruption point here, the common in the case of ethanol can, is spreading through and also under the surface in form of channels. There are literatures also as a finger. And then there are this distinction also between preferential pathways or or even tubes and its classifications of the ology depends also on the width and the size of this channel. But Sides of this channel. But anyway, there are always this you can observe for the Elton volcanoes, this thermal channelization, and the last volcanic eruptions is not an exception in the sense that you can see here in this review. In the last 400 years for the main eruption, at least from the eruption point, lava has spread in forms of channels. Of channels, channels of different sizes, but always ranges between a few tens of meters to even kilometers, and actually also the neighboring villages. So understanding how lava transports themselves through the eruption point, of course, has many practical applications. Ethna is not the only volcano in the world that has this feature, of course. Volcano in the world has this feature, of course, but there are many volcanoes, notably volcanoes in Hawaii and in Iceland, in which region of the world, in which, for different reasons, we have many active volcanoes in the last years. And so, in the last year, there have been a lot of observation of this phenomenon. Here, I'll just show you just some images, very nice images, in which you can clearly see with pair of eyes this phenomenon. Now, there are different reasons for this. Now, there are different reasons for this phenomenon to occur. For example, the pre-existent topography around the archae point of course influence the possible path that the lava can form, of course, influence the spreading of the lava material, as well as the initial condition in the sense of how lava is blowing up. How lava is blowing up from the terrain. If it is particularly explosive, of course, this can create some pretty valuable path in the displacement of the lava. But still, even disguising this geological mechanism, one possible physical, properly physical mechanism can be regarded as a mechanism that provokes this channelization. I should mention that this volcano, not the blip, sorry, are basaltic volcanoes, which are very common volcanoes that we have around the world, and that produce lava, which is particularly viscous as the content of silica is lower than the average of other volcanoes. Drop other volcanoes. And the fact that the viscosity is low, of course, this enhance the transportation of lava. But it's not the absolute value of viscosity, the important feature here, but its dependence with temperature. Indeed, if we have to neglect all the geological details of this problem, I'm not a geophysicist, I'm not a geologist, if we want to reduce to the bone, let's go If you want to reduce to the bone of the skeleton, the fundamental aspects of this problem in order to understand this phenomenon of channelization that I'm going to show, these are essentially two. First, the fact that as lava cools down, as in many fluids, its viscosity increases of course can be intuitively think for the honey, but it's even more valid for other foods. Is even more valid for other fluids, including lava. Second, the lava invasion, as I was mentioning before, can happen over the surface, for sort of rivers, or also under the terrain, for example, going into fractures, already pre existed, or from forming fractures, or layered in the terrain with a high gap when we related it as surrounding one. The fact that the geometry is confined doesn't mean that. Is confined doesn't mean that it's thermally isolated, but it's still able to lose heat, and this is probably a fundamental mechanism for understanding this phenomenon. So, reducing to the bone, the power outcome. Before that, I should mention that there are different models, multiple models, for mapping the viscosity of functional temperature. Here, I did some collection of measurements for different kinds of lava of the viscosity. F lava of the viscosity as a function of temperature. And it's possible to parameterize it with an exponential law. And if we want to write the temperature in a one-dimensional way, then we're using a simple equation in which the important parameter here is the ratio of the viscosity between the highest temperature possible and the lowest temperature possible, in a range of ratios in which that particular kind of lava is observed to occur going up. To occur during an eruption, essentially. The hottest is when the eruption starts, and the lowest is when ladders start to crystallize and become more solid, and are described as a freedom more properly. So, coming then to a model that allows us to understand the mesh mechanism, let's think of a Hilly School cell, flat one, in which initially I In which initially I have a cold fluid at temperature zero indeed. And at a certain point at time zero, I start injecting from the inlet of this initial shell hot fluid at the hottest temperature that we can get. In general, we inject the fluid at a certain average flow rate, but we can think of the front, virtual front. A virtual front between the hottest fluid going and the coldest fluid defending to be slightly perturbed, so not being straight, but slightly perturbed. Of course, here it's exaggerated, but we can think of a smaller perturbation. And the perturbation can be induced, for example, imposing that the local flow rate here in the central region, the image is slightly higher than in the southern region here. When this perturbation occurs, then Perturbation occurs, then in the region in which the perturbation is slightly higher, the temperature will be slightly more advanced than it was plotted for the local flow rate, a bit more than the surrounding region. But this will turn out into a significantly lower viscosity, being the viscosity dependent on the temperature to bi-hodden variants. So, this will enhance even more the transportation of the temperature despite the fact that the system overall is using heat. But this will not stop the transportation locally here or the temperature more and more to this mechanism. Uh u until of course the cooling will stabilise this mechanism. stabilize this mechanism. This is not valid indeed in the slightly cooler region surrounding the unit in which the being that the temperatures transported slightly less efficient, the viscosity will be nevertheless much higher than the regional region. And so eventually the topic The turbator will not be transported properly, but and the cooling will win, provoking even a shrink of the cooling. And so, this is basically intuitive. How can we describe what this mechanism of realization has, for the reason I just saw? This will provoke sort of localization of the flow in a form of thin. The flow in a form of finger, and this is basically a dynamical instability. We can compare this instability with the very celebrated Staff and Televisor instability, which you might be familiar with, in which we inject a less viscous fluid, displacing a much higher viscous fluid. And we indeed observe, as the font advances, a formation of low viscous fluid. A formation of low viscous fingers. Notably, these fingers evolve in time exponentially. And a remarkable feature is the fact that if we perturb the front with a particular wavelength, here the perturbation of the front is easier to imagine than before because the we have a physical surface pattern through it. There is a a wavelength over which we observe the instability. We observe the instability. And also, there is a wavelength higher than the critical one for which we maximize this goal for. Now, I want to define a bit more mathematically the problem. Being the historical shell flat, we can think of this problem as a quasi-tri-dimensional problem, in which we can define the variable as a temperature, also pressure, and the local velocity. We are neglecting then gravity effect. Then gravity effect, and we also neglect the inertial effects. So, the main equations describing the problem are essentially the Darcy law, in which the mobility is affected by the viscosity, which is affected as well by the temperature. And so, an important parameter here is the viscosity ratio that I was mentioning before. Then, we're assuming the fluid are incompressible for the mass balance. And for the energy balance, And for the energy balance, the advection diffusion equation is the one describing how the temperature volts in time and space. These are indeed alternative distribution terms. We have also tailored dispersion terms that emerge in flat geometries that enhance the direction of the temperatures of the streamlines, and also terms that represent the global pit loss. For all this term, other For all this term, other two par parameters are individual numbers, which represents essentially the relation between the reduction and the diffusion force, and the cooling rate. That in general depends on the visible different physical mechanisms that are regulating the loss of heat of the system through the two that you run in the environment. So now, supposing we have an unperturbed state in which we have a fixed temperature at the inlet and also a uniform And also, a uniform flow rate, so the width of the system. Basically, the system can be solved, and we actually turn out that the temperature is decaying from the hottest point to inverse of the system exponentially with that particular cartel, which is uh described here. And so, what we are doing uh what we are interested in is to perturb uh this uh inlet flow rate. This inlet flow rate and we want to tune the perturbation wavelength. So we are imposing the sinusoidal perturbation, where epsilon here is much smaller than one, which is the undimensionalized average local flow rate for the width of the channel. For simplicity, but also to isolate for binary condition, we want to have very binary conditions or lateral walls. This means that the width of the system can coincide. The width of the system can coincide with one wave event, essentially. So, just to summarize, this is the mathematical problem, and once we have defined it, we can solve it. We hope for solving this differential equation using a free method. And we want to and we fix before that we fix the the parameters, which are the ones listed here, three coming from the equation and one coming from the Coming from the equation, one coming from the binary condition, essentially. And this is a sketch of the results. So I hope the video are working. So essentially, these are just two examples of possible results. Here we have the column of the temperature in space and now our work in time for two different combinations of these four global parameters. And here I'm just with respect to the first, here I'm increasing just. The first here, I'm increasing just to the wavelength. And these are just an example representing values for sigma of reproducibility. And you just see that while for sufficiently low wavelength, we make the time evolve and nothing happens, and we have the exponential decay of the temporal constant in time. Here, instead, we observe a channelization, so essentially, close to the point in which the Close to the point in which there is the highest perturbation, we actually see a finger growing. And far from there, we see that from shrinking a bit. And so this is the evidence of channelization, observing the temperature parameters. We can actually also observe this channelization, looking at the map of the two components of the local velocity field, in particular looking at a component along the main direction. Component along the main direction, we can see observed emergence of preferential path in form of finger. So, another way to see this finger is also looking at the x component of the velocity field. While for the y component of the velocity field, we see the merging of this channelization looking at the initial close to the init, while The inlet, while for sufficiently far points along X, we actually see that the Y components in the future. So let's try then to characterize more quantitatively this finger, in particular the spatial time evolution of this finger. Again, we don't have a physical service like in the case of self-multi-instability, but Instability, but what we can do, if for example we look at the temperature map in the space, we can define some iso curves, so curves that collect points at the same temperature, which resemble like this, and we can do it for the arbitrary value of the temperature. And we want to look at the maximum and the minimum position of these isocules, isothermocles. I want to look how this point, in particular, their difference, evolves in time, as the span will change in time if the instability is observed. And indeed, when the instability is observed, we actually see a growth of this span between the maximum and the minimum. And in particular, if we like the system. Or, if we let the system evolve in time for a significant amount of time, we can actually distinguish between two different regimes. A transit regime, which we can actually see very clearly an exponential growth. And the growth happen at a certain growth rate, gamma, which is independent of the choice of isothermal surface, isothermal surface. And this first stage is followed by a stationary stage. So when Stage. So, when the ratio of the forces, the competing forces of attraction, diffusion, and cooling are stabilized, then the finger indeed will stabilize and the spine as well will stabilize to a particular stationary value. So, in general, now that we found a way to characterize this channel, we can observe how gamma, so the growth rate for the transit stage and the Of the transit stage and the final length of the stationary stage varies as a function of the global parameters. So we have, in principle, a phase space of four dimensions. I didn't manage to explore this whole space, but I will show you at least the results that come out when tuning the perturbation wave lens. So we can connect also what So we can connect also what some surfaces observe. And tuning the wavelength, we can actually see the following. For the growth rate, if we fix, so these are just some example values, all the other parameters, but we just tune the perturbation wavelength, we can actually see the emergence of a critical wavelength under which we don't see any stability growing. Stability growing. This corresponds to values of growth rate smaller than zero. While the stability will grow only for values above zero and corresponding to lambda bigger than this lambda c. And this curve will present a maximum which corresponds to the wavelength that maximizes the process. So exactly like in the So, exactly like in the self-material instability. If we now look at the stationary stage, then we observe another feature, namely the fact that the span of the finger goes with the wavelength, and in particular grows approximately in a linear way, and the growth. And the growth happens of course from lambda equal to lambda c, but doesn't stop at lambda equal to lambda maximum. So if we are imposing a perturbation wavelength which is above the lambda maximum, we can still see a finger which is bigger than the one accepted for the maximum. So the growth rate, a bigger growth rate, doesn't correspond to a longer finger necessarily. Okay, in just Okay, just coming to comment in a bit more the stationary state, which is the state indeed that we we managed to have after a certain time. And to characterize, and we wanted to have a look of how it looks like geometrically, essentially. And to have a we can again have a look at both the temperature and the X component of the velocity profile, and we can see. File. And we can see some interesting features. For example, the fact that if we plot in slices the temperature and also the x-component velocity along the y, we can actually see that the profile looks like has this bell shape which presents a maximum whose position coincides with the position of the maximum perturbation. And the shape seems in some way self-similar while going along x. Going along x, indeed, we can plot the maximum value of both the temperature and the velocity profile, and we can see that at least to some extent there is a decay, and this decay, to some extent, at least can be described linearly. Yeah. So, in particular region closer to the maximum and uh sufficiently um distant from the inlet where we can neglect the y component of the velocity, we can actually have this kind of description, a tentative description of the temperature and exponential velocity profile. So, quadratic So, a quadratic approximation along y around the maximum, and a linear decay of the maximum indeed along x. To test this, then of course we have to do an analytical check. And so we wanted to, so we tried to solve the equation regulating the evolution of the temperature and velocity, making the assumption I was Making the assumption I was telling you before, so neglecting the right component, this is the C-low, that the flow is conserved because it's incompressible. And using these answers, we can actually manage, I will skip the details of the calculation, but we just present the results, the fact that the X component of the velocity will have basically if we are assuming the quadratic approximation around the maximum, it turns out that the X component around the maximum will have again a quadratic approximation. Again, a quadratic approximation, multiply by a term which is linear in the temperature, and putting this into the advection diffusion equation, which turns out in ODE for the maximum value of the temperature along y, which is solvable if with the answers of neglect of putting to zero the secondary relative, so having a zero the secondary relative so having a linear evolution of the temperature and the coefficient with the coefficient given by this formula and and this is the indeed the linear approximation plotted against the evolution coming from the simulation we can see that it works quite well especially close to the I mean for higher temperature and this model allows us also to explain why the the Why the maximum position of the, I mean, the tip essentially of the finger goes linear, leaves with lambda. So to conclude, this is an ongoing project, but at least numerically we managed to simulate a fluid whose viscosity depends on temperature in an easy social geometry, and we did observe a dynamical instability. Of dynamical stability in a particular region of the phase space, a particular tuning that the ratio wavelength, we managed to look at this personal relationship with a critical and a wavelength, and a wavelength maximized growth. And we also managed to do, at least to some extent, some approximation or description of the such an early stage. Of course, now a complete description is missing and is. Description is missing, and is otherwise a linear stability analysis. So, of course, the calculation will be accessible in some sense. Now, coming to the outlook I was mentioning at the beginning. So far, indeed, I assumed the lava to be Newtonian, because, of course, complex fluid in the sense that it is the penalty of the temperature, but fixed the temperature, the fluid is Newtonian, because there is any relationship between the flow rate. There's any relationship between the flow rate and the partial gradient. But what if we assume the lava to have a heat stress? Well, in literature indeed, lava, including basaltic lava, not only basaltic, can be described as a crystal fluid as long as it occurs crystallization. This crystallization, important. Crystallization in particular depends on temperature. So, and there are different models for modeling the dependence of the crystallization, so essentially the crystal percentage, the contains lava, as a function of the temperature. And parametrizing it, we can reconstruct the viscosity as a function of the temperature in the liquid crystal regime and also the instruction. And we can actually see that. And we can actually see that the plot I was showing you at the beginning, so the dependence of the logarithmic disc as a function of the temperature, is much more enhanced in presence of this crystallization and also hysterical. So of course we have to modify our model for the Darcy law and this is a general model that we can eventually imply in which the pressure threshold will depend on the temperature and also probably on. Temperature and also probably an exponent is acquired to the screen on linearity. But since again we will see this dependence of the viscosity enhanced, probably we will see the flow focusing will be enhanced even more in an East As picture rather than in a Rittonian picture. So adjusting the model will bring to even stronger heavy to even stronger evidence of what we wanted to look for. So of course the Newtonian model is limitated, but this is still able was still able to observe a phenomenon that will be present or distress and crystallization will be even more enhanced. And this will conclude essentially what I wanted to say. These are the features of the the person involved in this collaboration. I'm I'm happy to answer to any questions. To any questions. So I'm a bit confused by your conditions.
