For the invitations. Yeah, I think, like everybody else, I'm a little sad that I'm not in Canada. Also, you know, birth has a special place in my heart. The first time that I gave a talk at a conference, it was at birth. So I, yes, it will always be significant in my career. So, So, well, Liam said, I mean, and yes, the title that I had sent is Frame Instanton and Higher Floor Homology of Surgery on Torres Notes. But really, you know, like as I was preparing, I realized that I'm really going to talk about Frame Instant on homology. And then as a corollary, I'm going to mention Hagerfloor. So the title that I have now in my notes is maybe more honest than the one that I sent. What I am going to talk about is joint work with Ty Liebman and Chris. With Ty Liebman and Chris Scaducho, and I know that a significant portion of the audience has already seen me give this talk, but I hope this version of the talk is better and then I'm still able to transmit something new. So what I am going to do today is really tell you how to compute frame instant on homology when I have integer surgery. Have integer surgery on a positive torus nut, and then in the meantime, I'm going to define a grading on the instant on contact invariant. So, what's the main theorem? Theorem, and you know, I have a question. You know, like people usually just put the first initial of their name when they're talking about their own work, but if I have two last names, is this okay? I don't know. What is the CC is fine? An analogy with if people have hypernated, they put both. Okay, thank you, Kristen. I appreciate that. And then, Chris. Then increase. And so let's say the G is P minus 1, Q minus 1 over 2, and then both P and Q are positive and their CCD is 1. Then the instanton, the frame instanton homology of N surgery and the PQ torus NOT. Torres not is going to be given by minus n and then just 2g minus 1 when n is negative. Then we have another second case when n is between 0 and 2g minus 1, and then when n is bigger than 2g minus 1. And here we have Okay, and so here notice that I am assuming that Framing Centon homology is a vector space over C and I am assuming a Z mod to grade. So that's what I'm going to tell you about. So let's start by, you know, defining what this is. So here, the definition is that the frame instanton homology of a three-manifold Y is going to be a certain restriction of a certain instanton homology. instance on homology on the connected sum of y with the three torus. And the restriction has to do with the two torous in an S1 component of the T3 here. What I mean is that I am looking at T3 as T2 cross S1. And so this S1 is this S1 and the T two is that T two. Is that T2. And so what's, but you know, like, what is the instant on homology here? So let E over this connected sum be an SO3 bundle such that the second stiff with Nikla is the Poincar√© dual to the circle. To the circle. And so then what we say is that this instanton homology of the connected sum determined by the S1 is, and there's a lot that goes into that. So morally, it is the morph homology of the Chern-Simons function. Of the Chern-Simons functional, or really, you know, we descend to a certain quotient and take the circle value function, where here I mean that this is A of E, the connection on E. On E, but I am modging out by some gauge transformation. Only the ones that live to SU2. Again, there's a lot of technical information that I am hiding behind that. And then in the ideal case, We take a complex in which the generators are going to be the gauge equivalence classes of web connections. In other words, the critical Toward the critical point of the chair-simmons function. And then the differential is going to be a count of instance on the infinite cylinder y cross r. Or actually, in this case, the connected sum of y with the three torques. Why would this three torus cross? What am I doing? Cross R. But in reality, one has to deal with perturbation. Okay, and then, so far, I have described everything except maybe this. Except maybe where this T2 comes from. So for that, let's say that we have Y a point in our connected sum and then, well, T2 the surface. Then we're going to get from both of these sub-manifolds, we're going to get a map. A map, a self-map on this vector space. And because they're both, you know, both y and t2 are even-dimensional, then we have that they commute. And then also we have And then also we have that MY has degree 4, actually let me forget about that, 0 mod 2 and same thing for T2. So finally I can tell you what we're going to do and so by work of Munoz and I And I always like it when I can actually pronounce last names. So there's that one there. Kronheimer and Moroca. It's Murufka. Well, yeah, so that's why, you know, like, that's why I said Munoz correctly. The other one is. What? It's Mr. Mrka. Perfect. Great. Let's see if I remember in five minutes. Okay. Anyway, so right. So the eigenvalues of the simultaneous eigenspaces for these two maps are Are in the set, well, they're either 0 and 2 or 0 and minus 2. And so to define this restriction over here, then we just restrict that is exactly what the frame instantane homology is. Great, okay, but I really want to compute and based on this definition, well, this is very, very complicated. It's a beautiful definition. Morphomology is one of the most beautiful areas. Is one of the most beautiful areas of math, I think. But in this case, there's a lot of analysis that goes into making sure that everything works. And then that makes it a little hard to compute everything. So something that is very, very useful, actually very powerful. Actually, very powerful in all of these homology theory is exact triangles. So, this is, I'm going to give credit to a lot of people, Flore, and then Rama McDonaldson, and then also Chris. What we have is that. What we have is that the triangle that we get by looking at a certain three manifold, the result of doing n surgery along a not K in the three-manifold and the homologies here, and then doing n plus one. Well, we have frame instantones for all of them. We have cobordism by attaching two handles. And so the cobord designs gives us map. And the theorem is that the triangle is exact. We have a little bit more information. So I believe that for this particular theory, this is work of Chris. If we take the Euler characteristic, oh, yes, I haven't talked about the grading. Well, okay. So the Euler characteristic of Of frame instanton, well, this is just going to be the way I'm looking at it. This is going to be the dimension of the even part minus the dimension of the odd part. And this is going to be the absolute value of n whenever n is not zero. And so, what's the grading here? So, what's the grading here? So, here the Z mod 2 grading is obtained from the virtual dimension of the modulus. The modulus says of instant trans on a four-manifold X, such that the boundary of X is going to be, well, in general, Y connected some that's three torus, but here I guess I'm assuming that Y is That's why this surgery, but you know, like this is stranger, anyway. Well, this part is true. So, I only want to consider that Zeemon2 brazen. There are others, but I am only going to talk about the Zemot2 brain. Great. So, already with this information, there's a lot that we can prove. So, for that, let me make a definition. Make a definition. So y is said to be an L space, I guess, instance on L space. If I have a little bit more than just this inequality or this equality, I want to say that It's the whole dimension of the frame instant on homology that is equal to the cardinality of the first homology. Well, unless the first homology, unless there's D1, and then in that case, the D print is not the cardinal. Okay, good. Good. So already with that, we have a lot of information. So if we know that this is an L state for some M that is bigger than M that is bigger than the three genus of the not, twice the three genus of the not minus one, then in fact this is the same is true for every value bigger than that. And this is apparently oh. Oh, I missed a number of comments. Oh, I guess they were not that important. Anyway, yeah, so this is common knowledge. I have been told that this is something that is obvious, but it wasn't obvious to me, and I don't want to assume that it's obvious for everybody. So the experts are going to fall asleep for the next three minutes. But for those of you who are not experts, this is something that. Experts, this is something that is very common, it's very useful, and it's used a lot in very fruitful ways. So, let me show you more or less how that goes. And so, what we need is precisely this exact triangle. Okay, maybe I'm only going to give half of the proof. So at least part of the proof. Okay, so let me do the case first where n is between actually no, I want to do the other one first. The other one first. If I have n bigger than m. So, for example, let me do it for m plus one. And then the idea is just the same. So, I have the surgery triangles. And so, what do I know? Well, something that I guess I didn't tell you before, but this is only C and it's supported at degree zero. And then the assumption being an L space, well, for this one, you know, like we have that the Euler characteristic is equal to M and the dimension is also equal to M. So then that means then. equals one, so then that means that this is going to be supported in degree zero and it's just going to be of dimension m and so you know so from this we already get for example you know like a very simple application without really having to go into exactly what the cobordisms are doing and what the degrees of these maps are are, then we can already get that the dimension of the Of the bottom one is less than or equal to m plus one. And then I think in this case, I believe you can get more by if we actually look at the degrees of the map, then we're able to do better. But let me just say that I am going to. Let me just say that I am going to prove the other boundary. Okay. And then if we want to do it for slopes that are between 2g minus 1 and this m, then really In the interest of time, I'm not going to tell you exactly how it goes, but it's a combination. The surgery triangle and the adjunction inequality. And then we get something similar. Now, what I really want to do is, well, you know, so here really, even though I advertise it as a whole computation of both, you know, like lower bounds and upper bounds and a precise isomorphism, I only really gave you an upper bound, right? So here I have an upper bound. So, here I have an upper bound. So, to finish my computations, I want to get a lower bound. And this is when the contact invariant is going to come into place. So, what I want is I want to explore the connection between the frame instant on homology and contact topology. And contact topology. Okay, so definition. So now let's say that here I have a contact gray manifold. Very manifold, and then I want to define the instant on well, um let me denote it by. Let me denote by Theta Sharp. So, first, I need to choose an open book decomposition for my contact manifold. Sorry. Sorry. And then I'm going to, so this is a surface with boundaries. And H is an element of the mapping class group of the surface. And then Y is going to be obtained as the mapping torque. Tor of this spring. So now to define it, I want to use this open book decomposition of my contact manifold to get the invariance. So what I'm going to do is first, I'm going to take the union of my surface S. S with another surface T and I want to actually close it so they have to have the same boundary and then what I am going to do is going to first construct Extend H to R by identity and then I want to form the mapping torus on R, which is going to be let me take this so. So if you notice, sort of in here, I have a copy of these mapping tours. So let me say that I'm going to have, so let's say that C is an art basis for my surface S. So for example, Surface S. So, for example, if S is a torus with one boundary component, then what I want to do is just take the course. So, art basis means if you cut, then you get a disk. That's all I want. And then, so let me look at these curves. So, I take a copy of one of these arcs at the level one. I take its image at level minus one. And then, to connect them to get an actual closed curve, a knot in my three manifolds, I want Three manifolds, I want to connect with some vertical portions, you know, like identify pretty much just identify the endpoint. And then I'm going to form for manifold B by taking the product of these three manifolds, well the cylinder, and then attaching two handles along the gamma. Along the gamma i. So, why am I doing this, right? So, why am I doing this? Well, first, because one, this is the boundary of Z, where Z is a left-shaped fibration. Maybe that's not the best thing to highlight right now, but it's going to become handy. Two, you know, sort of like what. You know, sort of like what I was pointing out before, the mapping torus of or why itself is sort of embedded in these mapping torus. But I don't want to have it sort of embedding. I need to have Y itself because I need an invariant of the contact here Y and C. And so far, Y is very hidden somewhere in there. So the So, the advantage is that we chacobordism from, of course, this twisted product to the connected sum of y with just the regular product, the normal product. Okay, so then what am I going to do? So, now I am actually ready to make the definition of. To make the definition of the contact invariant, well, I'm going to look at the instanton, the frame instanton homology here. Cobordisms in this theory induce maps. Oh, sorry, too soon, too soon. And then notice that before in the definition of frame instance on, I was actually taking first a connected sum with three tors. Here I almost have that, except I didn't say anything about the genus of R, but then I have excision. And so with excision, I can go back to the three tours. And then here there are decorations. And then here there are decorations, but the decorations work fine. And then the next restrictions, the restrictions also work fine. So I'm sort of going to be lazy. Not ideal, but. And so I get a map from a certain form, actually, to the frame instanton homology. Instant on homology of y. And here, now it's the moment to highlight this fact. So here I'm going to have an element which is going to be given to me by z. And I am going to call this the generator of this group. I guess I didn't tell you this, but this is work of well, of a lot of people, but it follows from, I guess, I guess. I guess I'm just going to say this. Munoz, and I think to some extent to Kronheimer. What it is to myself. And Morovka. Maybe. Okay, and so this is the map. Here I have the combination of excision and Extension and the map induced by V, this is what I am going to call the instant on contact invariant. Except really, to be honest, I had to take negative at every step of the way. But at this point, lack of Okay, great, great. So we have the contact invariant. We're almost there. Here's one fantastic theorem of John and Stevens. Well, this is actually an invariant. And so, what does the name in particular? It is independent of all the choices. Of all the choices. For example, the choice of the open book, the choice of closure of S, and etc. The next thing that I want to do, so part of what I told you that I was going to do is I was going to tell you how to get a grading for these. Get a grading for these contact invariant. So, for that, I want to say I want to have a four manifold that is almost complex, meaning this J is a map on the tangent space, the square is minus the identity, and And the contact structure, the contact plane, the distribution is going to be given as the complex tangencies. Then I'm going to define these numbers in terms of the some algebraic topology, entirely in terms of algebraic topology of these four manifolds and the three manifolds. And the three manifold and the proposition is that the contact invariant is, in fact, homogeneous. With respect to the Zimatu grading, and this is supported in degree. So we can compute the grading entirely. We can compute the grading entirely in terms of the algebraic topology of a four-manifold. Well, we do have to require the four-manifold to be almost complex. And the proof is really, you know, like this very long, if I take X to be Z union V along the correct boundary, then Boundary, then this has, I guess, the proof of the second part has an almost complex structure and the degree of the cobordism map. On instant on homology agrees with this quantity delta of minus y. Great. We're almost there. I'm almost done giving. I'm almost done giving you all the, you know, like saying all of the things that I need to be able to compute, which is good because I want to finish very, very soon. So here's what I want to do. I mean, I said, you know, like, let me just go back to the statement of the theorem. This is what I want to compute. So, what I really want to do is I want to is I want to get a little bit more than just an almost complex structure. I want to construct some stein manifolds and so for that I need a couple of things. So this is again John and Stephen so just if I have a small If I have a smooth four manifold and I have some Stein structures and then I say that each I'm going to get corresponding contact structures Contact structures in the boundary. If the first chain class of these sign structures they're all different then We have linear independent elements in instanton. So here I have a finite dimensional vector space over the complex numbers. Okay, I have Z mod 2 grading. If you don't care about the Z mod 2 grading, Care about the ZMO2 grading, then well, I mean, it's even easier, but we can do it with the ZMO2 grading. So, what we're going to do is we're going to use the delta, the invariant that we defined that gives us the grading of the contact element, and the fact that we have some linearly independent elements, and then that's just going to give us a basis, and then we're just sort of going to be done in a certain Going to be done in a certain way. Well, actually, we get the lower bound that I was after. But for that, I want to, I need a theorem of, which is if I take the result of, so allegendre naught, I have oligander naught, say in S3. In S3 and then I do I attach a handle along this manifold along this knot. Then the first is that this is Stein if the Fermi coefficient is given by Verston-Benicking number of the Legendre naught. Number of the Legender not minus one. And in that case, if J is the sine structure, then the first term class is going to correspond to the rotational of these, the gendered knot under the isomorphism that identifies each two of these manifolds with the integers. And then from these, well, so here's the HF corollary. One, there is an analogous linear independence result for the Hagar. Hagar4 contacting variant due to Olga if Olga wants to teach me how to pronounce her Latin, then I don't know, she's there and to the grading. The grading for the contact invariant and the one that we define. I agree. So I don't think I will have time to show that, but that's sort of like that's how you get. So you get, you know, like you can run the same argument on the Hagar Florida side, and then you get the same thing. side and then you get the same thing and they so you get an isomorphism and the isomorphism is given precisely by taking the contact element on one world to the contact element on the other world so um how do we get so let's just do say I want to get the lower bound So I can start. Oh, I lost it. This was nothing else. I guess it doesn't matter. Here's my trefoil. The TB of this Legendric representative is going to be the right, which is 3. Minus one half of the cost. So three minus one half of four. So I have TB one. Okay, so here, but I really, what I really want is to get another representative of the trepho such that. Such that the third synbenecking number of these new representatives minus one is actually minus two. Okay, so how am I going to do that? Stabilizing. So we have two stabilizations. I guess I'm not going to draw the stabilizations, but the idea is that here, so if I compute the rotational for these guys, just one half of the down cost minus the up cost. And in this case, so if I orient in this way, these two are up costs and these two are down. So here I get zero, and then I so. And then I so let's look at the rotational TB mountain range. So here we have, we start with three, zero. I stabilize one time and then here I get Thurston-Bennecking number is going to decrease, so I get two in both cases. In both cases, and then the rotational is going to decrease in one case and increase in the other case. Okay, but this is not yet. So, here what I really want is TB to be, well, uh let's do minus one surgery. Because Because because so I need to I need TB to be zero, I guess this is not true. I am using a different uh why why did I get the three? Okay, okay, now I see why I'm confused. Okay, never mind, apparently I cannot remember things. So this is one, so okay, but I'm still going to do negative. So I need CB0. Negative. So I need CB0. Okay, good, because I got it already after one stabilization. So the reason, I guess the reason why I had chosen negative two was because then I would have had to stabilize one more time. I think these are pairs TB, R, the way you've written it. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you. Okay, yes. See, you know, like I saw the clock and then my brain cannot get past that. But anyway. Get past that, but anyway, so 0, 1, and then, but then you see, so this is the line, whatever rotationals are, this is the line. All of these are going to have Tb equals to 0, and all of these are going to have Tb equals to minus 1. And so the whole point, what I'm trying to say here is that if we look, if we wanted to get a computation for the instance. Computation for the frame instantaneous homology of minus one surgery on the triple. Well, so here this means this theorem that I had just written down. Well, so here this theorem of Gomph tells me that I have these two give rise to two different Give rise to two different stein structures to the result of attaching a two handle to the four ball along the trifle with framing minus one. And then the theorem and of John and um And of John and Stephen tells me that, in fact, all of the contact elements are linearly independent. So then I know that this is going to be, if I look at the rank of this guy, then this is going to be in one of the gradings, which I know is going to be zero because I computed it using all the information that I gave you. This is going to be. You, this is going to be at least two in this case. And that is sort of, you know, like that's that's sort of the game that you play. And so you mean greater than or equal to? Greater than or equal to? Yes, that's what I mean to have a lower bound. And I'm going to write this in. Okay, thank you. Thank you, John. Okay, um, so I guess I gave you all of the ingredients. So once we put everything together, meaning on one hand we get some upper bounds. Upper bounds from the surgery triangle and two lower bounds getting linear independent invariance coming. Coming from Stein structures, then that's how we get the precise computation. And that is the way of computing. The way of computing this, and then again the grading, this grading. This is obtained using the rating that we define. And I think I'm going to leave it at that. Thank you. Great. Let's all unmute and thank Juanita. Great, let's all unmute and thank Juanita. So I think there's time for a quick talk before we transition. Sorry, quick question, if there is one. Juanita, sorry, I might have missed something at the beginning. But can you, I mean, can you use the same sort of digital stern approach to the representation varieties and understand this? And understand this calculation in those terms? I haven't tried. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, like, these are all, these are Breeze Gorn spheres with three singular fibers. And so you, I think, even though they're rational homology spheres, the sort of representation of that is still barely understandable. understandable yeah but i don't know how um those are fantasy so three invariants right uh right oh yeah so sure okay but these are two yeah i mean one one issue is that we're working sorry we're working with framed instantonical harmology here so it's not this clear yeah so this is you know like this this restriction over here uh uh I don't know. I don't know. I mean, if somebody wants to tell me what the corresponding restriction in the AP located picture and in a representation space picture is, then that would be great. But I don't know. Yeah, no, I'm not saying I wasn't implying it follows from anything in the literature. I'm just saying, like, did you, like, is it possible that you could approach it sort of via direct computation? But I wasn't implying that it was easier or anything like that. Or anything like that. Yeah, well, no, but actually, you know, like this is, well, okay, so I didn't mention it, and I should have. I apologize to Ali, but Ali's talk yesterday gave us, you know, like this is one, I defined instant frame instanton in one way, but then Ali has a different definition that maybe is more suitable to, you know, like the Lagrangian intersection picture in the pillowcase. And so maybe there's hope. Oh, but also three. Oh, but also, Chris. Yeah, so Chris, yeah, Chris indicated in the comments. I mean, the one way in which that sort of thing can be helpful is if you know, for example, that all of your representations are SU abelian. But if that's not the case, then I think it's hard to understand anything about phloemology without looking deeper. So another question. Couldn't you keep going? Like you have got some ciphered fibered manifold, and now you take some fiber. And now you take some fiber of this and you make, you know, you continue going this way and get the results for cipher fiber spaces with the more singular fibers. Right. So you mean like, what if I change the why am I restricting my attention to integer surgeries and not all of them? In S3, why not in S3? Why? I mean, what you use is well, you use the surgery exact triangle and then some computations. Some computations from contact invariants. But yes, why don't you take surgeries on some, say, fibers in some cipher-fiber spaces? That part, I don't know. We didn't even think about, I don't think, I didn't try. I don't know. Maybe Chris has a better answer. Or, well, I don't think Ty is looking. But also, but just one comment, you know, like. One comment, you know, like John and Stephen have already improved it. So maybe John can say more about that. Yeah, so that yeah, I think that you know, like we were unable, so in our case, the reason why we were unable The reason why we were unable to get the rational case was that we didn't get the linear independence result. We were not producing enough Stein structures on the feeling. In our case, the ones that we were looking at, but you know, like this is this depends on a specific choice of diagram, and so we were just not very smart, I guess. Very smart. I guess. Okay, so well, maybe we should keep the rest of the discussion for the breakout rooms and just thank Juanita again.
