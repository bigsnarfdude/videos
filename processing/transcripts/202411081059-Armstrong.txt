And thanks also to the Baby for providing entertainment and thank you to the New Zealand Mathematical Society for funding my travel, my 74 hours of travel. So yeah, this is joint work with Lisa Olof Clark, Maya Ganahari, EJ Kang and Dylan. Is that any more? And yeah, the project actually started at Banff, so this was a project from the second Women Inoperator Adaways workshop. Although all of us, this was 2021, so we were actually all just doing it over Zoom. And we all wanted to learn about topological full groups. I mean, Dillian had a paper on them, but the rest of us didn't really know much. And so, and thought we knew about Steinberg algebras and Kupoid's Easter algebras, and we just sort of had this vague question of, yeah, what's the Question of, yeah, what's the connection? The question becomes less vague as we go through the talk. So here's some definitions that we've already seen this week, but I'll just quickly go over them. So a topological group weight is ample if it has a basis of compact open bisections, which I'm going to abbreviate to COBS. And an inverse semigroup is a semigroup S such that every element has this unique inverse in this sort of partial isometry sense of the word inverse. Sense of the word inverse. And throughout the talk, I'm going to be working with ample Hausdorff group audience with compact unit space. And so, in particular, the unit space will be a compact open bisection because bisections have random source being injective, and the range and source maps the identity map on the unit space. And the unit space is open because the groupoid's empty. Okay, so if you have such a groupoid, then the cobs form an inverse semi-group. Then the cobs form an inverse semigroup, and I'm going to denote that by S of G. And so this is how you multiply some cobs. So you just compose everything that you can. And then to get the inverse of a cob, you just convert all the elements. And yeah, the inverse semi-group has identity unit space, because if you multiply by that, it doesn't change anything. Alright, and then we call a cog full if you look at all the ranges and sources order elements, you get everything. Ranges in sources of elements, you get every unit, and you hit like at most once because it's a bisection. So the topological full group of G is the group of full cobs. So it sits inside this inverse semi-group S of G. And yeah, the same operations as the inverse semigroup. And the topological full group will just consist of the non-entry cobs if and only if G is a group. G is a group. And in this case, COPs are just singletons, and so the topological group looks like a group. An example that we've seen a bunch of times this week is, so if you take the Kuhn's groupoid, which is the graph groupoid of this graph, then we've seen that you get Thompson's group B2 for the topological full group, and the full and reduced C stragebras are the Kuntz algebra. So they're both the same because the group weights are meanable. Group weights are meanable. But yeah, you can get a whole bunch of groups from topological food groups. So the topological fool groups have been used to solve lots of open problems in group theory. And another reason that people like them is because of this theorem that we've seen this week a bunch of times, which is that topological food groups are like an invariant for group weights, certain group weights that satisfy these adjectives. So, I mean, I won't define them, but I think they came up in Ilya's talk. I think they came up in Ilya's talk and maybe others. So the group weights need to be minimal and effective and ample in Haustorf and the unit spaces are cantor sets, and then you can use the topological full groups to tell the group weights apart. So these are some reasons, like this example in this theorem are some reasons that people care about topological full groups, but we were more motivated by the connection to C-star algebras and C-star simplicity. So there was a paper by Brix and Skapara that looked at the connection between the C-star algebra of the topology. Between the C-stra algebra of the topological fold group and the C-stra algebra of the groupwide. And we also wanted to like, we wanted to think about that, but also think about Steinberg algebras, which are the purely algebraic analog of groupoid C-stra algebras. So I don't know if they've come up in any talks this week, so find them here. So Steinberg algebras are named after Ben Steinberg, who introduced them, but they were also independently introduced by Farvin Sims and Stanford. Farving Simon Tomford. So to define these, so you take the span of characteristic functions on COBS, remember SFG is the COBS, and this gives you all the continuous functions that are locally constant and have compact support. And then the multiplication just looks like the multiplication in the inverse semi-group of cobs, and the involution comes from the inverse of the cobs, and then you extend to the whole algebra. So this gives you a star algebra, and I'll just And I'll just emphasize this notation. So, people that work with topological full groups might commonly use A of G to represent the alternating group or something. I think it means something else for topological full groups people. But this is the Steinberg algebra, just so when it comes up later, you know. And actually, Steinberg algebras, like we often think of them as having coefficients in some just arbitrary commutative unital ring, but in this talk, I always mean coefficients in the comp being. Always mean coefficients being the complex numbers because I want to use the fact that the Steinberg algebra is dense in both the full and reduced sister algebras. There's another algebra that you can get. So if you just take the actual inverse semi-group of cobs, so each cob is just a point in that inverse semigroup, you can obtain a star algebra by just taking the span of the point mass functions on the cobs. And so this has operations. And so this has operations like they look like these, except that you're multiplying point mass functions, not characteristic functions. So it's a different algebra. And then because the topological full group sits inside the inverse semi-group of Cobbs, the group algebra of the topological full group just sits inside this inverse semi-group algebra. So we were interested in what the relationship is between the Steinberg algebra and these two algebras that I've just defined. These two algebra that I've just defined. I mean, I just told you that the full group one embeds in the semi-group one, so I've answered that part of the question. But we were more interested in what the relationship is between the Steinberg algebra and the topological full group algebra. I think Nora mentioned the other day that when Steinberg introduced Steinberg algebras, his idea was that he took an arbitrary inverse semi-group algebra, so you like this thing here. Like this thing here, but just have an arbitrary semi-group. And he realized that as the Steyboid algebra of some groupoid. But that groupoid is like Patterson's universal groupoid of, which is something that you construct from the inverse semi-group. Now, if you start with a groupoid and then build this inverse semi-group and then build Patterson's universal groupoid, that's not the groupoid you started with. So although this algebra, this inverse semi-group algebra, will be a Steinberg algebra, it's of a different group. Will be a Steinberg algebra. It's of a different group point to G. It's of this universal group point. But this inverse semi-group algebra, it does quotient onto the Steinberg algebra. So I think I actually have this on the next slide. So you can build a representation of the inverse semi-group algebra, and you just send the point mass function of b to the characteristic function of b and then extend that to the whole, like extend it linearly. And yeah, you get a star homomorphism. And this is suggested. And this is subjective because the one sub B's generate the whole Steinberg algebra. But it's typically not injective. And that's just because, like, cobs, I mean, if you think about like a cob and say it's like built from b1 and b2, which are non-empty cobs, then if you add together the characteristic functions of b1 and b2, you'll get the characteristic function of b, like assuming they don't overlap. But the point mass functions, they don't have any relations like this. Like the cops are just. Don't have any relations like this, like the cops are just separate points. So, because of that, this is not an injective map. So, then we restricted our attention to this representation, but restricted to the topological full group algebra. And we thought about questions like when is this pi injective, when is it surjective, and what does its image look like? So, its image is the span of the one sub B's. The span of the ones that these are full cobs. And yeah, we wondered whether this could be injective. I mean, it's not injective if you have the domain being the inverse semi-group algebra, but maybe if we get the domain small lump, it could be injective. And yeah, when is it so injective? And then we also thought about like what about, like, so the Steinberg algebra is dense in the full and reduced seaster algebras. Could it possibly be the case that when quiet Could it possibly be the case that when pi is not subjective, you still have that the image of pi that is dense and needed for a reduced lease to attributes? So, yeah, that's what the rest of the talk is about. That's sort of the questions we tried to answer. So, this was one of our theorems. So, pi, this representation, is subjective if and only if g is a group. So, if g is a group, I mentioned before that the topological full group is just the collection of non-empty cobs and these, like the And these, like the characteristic functions of those, generate the Steinberg algebra. So you get pi being an isomorphism in that case, so that's quite boring. There's a little bit of work, but not much, to show the converse. So that's the only way you get surjectivity. And then we looked at when it's injective, and it turns out it's hardly ever injective. So it's injective if the group word looks like one of, has one of these two forms. So if it consists entirely of isotropy, so the isotropy is the loop. So, the isotropy is the loops in the groupweight. But only one of the isotropy groups is non-trivial. So, in other words, your group weight looks like a group, and then you've just got a bunch of other units, but no non-trivial elements attached to them, and then no morphisms going between different units. In that case, the topological full group just basically looks like the group part of it. So it's easy to show that pi is injective. And the other case is that. The other case is that if your group weight doesn't consist of isotropy and there's only less than three non-unit elements, so what happens in this case is that you'll have, so take a gamma that's not in the isotropy, then its inverse will also have to be in the groupoid. And then these are your two, you only have up to two non-units. So you're going to have exactly two non-units, and then everything else is a unit. So it's also another kind of boring case of groupoid. Group weight. The topological full group of this one just consists of the unit space, because that's always in the topological full group, identity. And then the other co-op that you get in it is the one where you throw in gamma and gamma inverse, and then you just take out the range and the source of gamma, and then you have all the rest of the units. So in that case, the topological full group has two elements. You can reasonably easily show that pi is rejective. So the main interesting part of this proof is the converse of part B. So why is pi not? So, why is pi not injective when, like, like outside of these two very limited cases? There's a bunch of cases to consider. I think we broke it up into four or five cases. I'll just give you an example of sort of how one of them works. So, hopefully, if your group weight is nice enough, you can find, I'm going to kind of draw this a little bit, you can find a full cob, B, that kind of breaks up into a B1. Breaks up into a V1 and a V2. And hopefully the range and the source of each of these, the range of B1, is equal to the source of V1. So this is like infinite space. And this is like the range and the source of B1, and then this is the range and the source of B2. If you can do that, then you can just build a new full cob D1 by just taking like that bit and that bit, union those together, so it's D1, and then another full cob. And then another full call, D2, where you just take b2 and the range of b1, that's not very clear what's what. But anyway, if you do that, then you'll get this relation between the characteristic functions, like 1 sub d1 plus 1 sub d2 is just, yeah. But you don't have this relationship between the point mass functions. If it's not possible to build a, like, to create this scenario, then you can do other things with like inverses of co-ops. And anyway, it all works out. It all works out. So that's how that works. And then we look at the density of the image of pi. So recall that the Steinberg algebra is dense in the full and reduced C-stra algebras. And when G is not a group, pi is not subjective. So the image of pi is not the Steinberg algebra. But maybe the image of pi could still be depths in the full or reduced C-struct algebra. So is this possible? Well, going back to this example. Well, going back to this example, we have a theorem about, well, it's my algorithm. There is a theorem about this. So for the Kuntz groupoid, yeah, we have Thompson's group B2 for the topological full group, and the Kuntz algebra is the Cister algebra. And the Steinberg algebra is just the Lebert path algebra, which is, if you haven't seen those before, I'm just throwing a word in to connect it to those, but they're just purely algebraic analog of graph C2 algebras. And in this case, there's this really And in this case, there's this result that says that the image of pi is dense in the Kuntz algebra. So, and that's pi is not subjective because the Kuntz group weight is not a group. So, yeah, it's possible for the image of pi to be dense in the fuller reduced C-stro algebras. We wanted to sort of think about this question a bit more generally, so not just for a specific group away. So, we started by looking at a bunch of examples, and we realized that. And we realized that the discrete setting, like the case where the group weight is discrete, is quite nice to work with. So, discrete group weights are ample, and if you want them to have compact unit space, then you'd have finitely many units. And then you can sort of think of your group weight as like a directed graph, I think, units of vertices. And you can talk about like adjacency matrices. So that was quite nice. And yeah, I sort of want to amortize this technique, because originally we did the whole paper just for discrete groupoids. But just for discrete groupoids. And then once we got those results working, we were like, oh, now we can prove stuff for ample groupoids. And we were just mostly working with matrices the whole time to work out these proofs. So from now on, G is going to be discrete with finitely many units. And so I'm going to talk about the image of pi being dense in the full C-stra algebra first, and then I'll talk about the reduced. So the theorem's kind of boring in the full C-stra-algebra case. The full C-stra algebra case. So the image of pi is going to be dense in the full groupoid C-stra algebra, if and only if G is a group. So if and only if pi is subjective, and then the image of pi is just the Steinberg algebra. So one direction of this, yeah, it's what I just said. The image of pi is the Steinberg algebra, gives you that dense. So in the other case, let n be the number of units, and suppose now that n is greater than the unit. Suppose now that n is greater than 1. So we have a group void that's not a group. And as I said before, we're going to think of, we're going to try and use matrices. So we're going to build this representation of the Steinberg algebra in the n by n matrices, where n is the number of units. And a bisection corresponds to, if you think of your group word as a graph, a bisection is like a subgraph, a subgraph, where each vertex has at most one edge coming in and at most one edge coming out. One edge coming in and most one edge coming out. And so to represent that with a matrix, like if you take T of, so T is going to be the name of this representation. T of one sub gamma is just going to be the range gamma source gamma matrix unit. So you put all the units on, like to label the matrix entries, the rows and columns. And then you can extend this map linearly to the whole Steinberg algebra because every function can be written as a linear common. function can be written as a linear combination of the one step gammas. And this representation is bounded in the full norm as well. The way you prove that is that there's a paper by Lisa Olive Buck and Joel Zimmerman that they have like a bunch of descriptions of the full norm and like normally we soup over like representations of C sub C of G but you can also soup over the Steinberg category, representations of the Steinberg category. So that's how you prove that. Anyway, once you have that, we do this Anyway, once you have that, we do this little calculation where we show that if your function is in the image of pi, then the matrix that you get by applying t to that function f has constant row and column sums. And so therefore, if you look at like one sub gamma and you apply t to it, that's not going to have constant row and column sums because it's a matrix unit. So it can't possibly be the limit of things that do have constant romant column sums. And there's a bit of like bullying limits in and out of t, which you can. Of, like, pulling limits in and out of t, which you can do because it's bounded in the full model. But you end up showing that all the one-sub-gammas can't be in the closure of the image of pi, so it's not dense. Okay, so then the interesting part is that this result doesn't hold in the reduced setting. So in the reduced setting, you can, there are groupoids that aren't groups for which the image of phi is dense in the reduced algebra. So we just have one example of that. One example of that. I mean, there's many examples, but you just put one in the paper. So, yeah, we're going to construct a groupoid with more than one unit, and the image of pi is going to be dense in the reduced C stragebra. So, this is the groupoid we use. We take two copies of the free group with two generators, and we're just going to view this as like pairs G, I, where the G is the free group element, and I tells you which copy you're in. So the unit space is just set one, two. So to be, like, so thinking about the topological full group, to be a full cob, you have to contain two elements, so like a g,1 and then like a g prime, two, which means that the topological full group just looks like f2 cross f2. And we want to show that all of the well it suffices to show that all of the like the one sub singletons are in the um in the closure of the image of pi. In the closure of the image of pi. And by symmetry, it suffices to just show this for the first copy of the free group. So, okay, so how are we going to do that? So, we order the free group by word length, so it's just increasing order of word length. And I'm going to define this sequence of elements of the image of pi that converge to one subg1. So these are my elements, clearly they're in the image of pi. Of pi. And remember that pi sends a point mass function to the corresponding characteristic function. So it just does this. And now I can split up this characteristic function into a sum of like the two bits, like that. And then I've got like n copies of that and then divided by n, so that just goes away. And then I've got this sum here. And then we found this old inequality, which is like a bound on normal. Which is like a bound on non-zero elements of the free group. So that allows you to bound this whole sum and then you divide by n, so it goes to zero, as n goes to infinity, and then therefore the phi n's go to one sub g one. So yeah, we just thought it was interesting that you could get this like this star algebra of characteristic functions associated to full cobs, and it's dense in the reduced C2 algebra, but not in the full CR algebra. Full C draft draw. And yeah, that's it. This is the paper that the talk is based on. Yeah, thank you. Any questions?
