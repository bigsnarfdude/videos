Okay, let's start. We are already late. So, our next speaker is Cisa Querindo. He's going to talk about trivializing group reactions on autessor categories. Thanks. Thank you. And thank you very much to the organizers for the opportunity to speak here and for the invitation. Kane, it's very beautiful to see all the snow, but also to be here with you. Well suppose that we have an action of a group on a tensor category. So here by an action, I mean the following. I will assume that G is, in most of the cases, a finite group, but many of the things that I would say can be extended kind of easily to bigger families. Families. But an action is by definition a monoidal photor from the group seen as a discrete monoidal category to the tensor out equivalence of C. That's by definition. But here, in order to do things simpler, especially in notation, I will assume that, I mean, in general, what we have is for every element of here, I'm not saying. For every element of here, a tensor ultra equivalent, and for every pair of elements, a natural trans isomorphism that satisfies some cumulative duty. But I will assume by simplicity that I am going to the strict tensor functors and that this is a group homomorphism. Seems to be to ask too much, but in general you can replace your category in order to get something that is tensor equivalent and so it's some kind of coherent theorem. So I will do that. Coherent theorem. So I will do that. So here is some homomorphism. Can you write a bit larger, please? Yes, I will. Some homomorphism of groups. So what I'm saying is that for every element of your group, we have a 100. I will denotate the action of the group on this way, in such a way that if you apply the other one, this is the same as this thing. And also, if you tend have the tensor product, this is the same thing. Have the tensor product, this is the same as this, and the same for the unit of it. Yeah, so it looks very strict, but again, in general, you can replace using the natural isomorphisms as to translate everything that I will say in this example. So the first thing that I want to say is that in general, if we are talking, let's say, of action of a group over a set, to have, let's say, To have a, let's say, a trivial action, it's again, it's a condition, it's a property, let's say. But here, I want to talk about trivialization as an additional structure. So if we have, again, an action of a group on a tensor category, then we always have the trivial action. And here, trivial action job means that for every element of the group, you're Means that for every element of the group, you associate identity, and the same for the natural isomorphism. So, a trivialization is just a natural, a monoidal natural isomorphism between this one and the trivial. It's just that. But then what exactly it means? It means that you have a natural isomorphism for every element of your group and every object, you have a natural isomorphism from here to here. And it should satisfy the monoidal condition that it is written down in this particular case as this equation. Again, because I am assuming that something is a script, so it's kind of simple. So it looks, in principle, looks quite similar, like a one-co-cycle condition. And this is, of course, for every pair of elements. In the group. And the point is that in many cases, I want to check if I have, let's say, an action in nature. I want to check if the action is trivializable in the sense that it exists at trialization. And in case that it exists, how many of them do you have? Because this is an additional structure. So in order to see that, of course, you need that for For suppose that this is the functor, the tensor functor associated with the element of the group, you need to first verify that in fact this is natural isomorphic to the identity. So you need to fix, let's say, a natural isomorphism. And then, for every G, and then the other thing that you need to check in this case is that if you, let's say, apply Twice here, let's say GH G this way, and here. This is a tensor, this is a natural isomorphism from X to X. So in this case, this defines an element And the tensor of the morphism of the identity. And this action is trivializable if and only if the commodity class of this is zero. And in this case, the set of all trivializations is a torsor over this group. This is, of course, something very well known because it's a nice interpretation of. An easy interpretation of it's a very easy interpretation of this, uh, seen as amoloidal functions between uh two groups. Okay, so what I want to do in the talk is to present two, let's say, two problems that can be solved using trializations. In the sense that it's an additional structure that you need. It's an additional structure that you need in order to understand another part of the structure. One, it's braided structures over G, over G cross-braided tensor categories that I will explain in a moment. Another is work that I will do with Corrigans, fissions, subcategories of the karmicization of a pensive current. So the first So that the so then the first that I wanted to describe is rated group extensions in this case anyway. But I want to say that for this there is a very beautiful and interesting theory developed by Dmitry Plishich and Alexei Davidov when they explain that in order to understand this you need to Describe, I mean, you can describe the whole problem of classifications. Suppose that, and in this case, the idea is you want to describe, I mean, suppose that you have B, a graded category, you want to describe an extension I will call A. Again, this is, I mean, here is graded and this should have some decomposition. Here the group is abelian, the key is abelian. The group is abelian, the G is abelian. This is again graded and a faithful G extension. And the idea is to try to describe, assuming in this particular case, that B is equal to AE. And this is described in the paper of Dimitri and Alexei as braided functions. Braided functions from the category G seen as a braided monoidal two category, that is three braided monoidal two category, to this again, braided monoidal two group. So functors I describe in this way, but this, I mean, this description allows to also to explain, for example, obstruction. For example, obstruction theory and the abstraction and the homology that is behind all this is the Ellenberg McLean commodity. For example, there are H pepper 4 appears and it's very interesting. The equate that I will explain much more elementary, the astronaut. Elementary in pedastrian, I can say, so cannot explain the whole, let's say, theory and what is happening really behind, but nevertheless, for some computations and for some examples, I believe could be useful to see in this other perspective. So, before to present what I want to say, let me put a small motivation that came from Algebra because it helps to. Algebras, because it helps to understand what is idea. So, in algebras, we can define, suppose this is an algebra, we can define the notion of a grading again. And in the grading, there is a notion that is called strongly graded. That for those that know about Hof-Galois theory, this is a particular case of Hof-Galois extension. When you consider When you consider in this case the group algebra, let's say. But the important part is that in this particular case, these strongly graded rings over a fixed group G, they correspond to monoidal functors from here to the Picard group of the trivial component, monoidal functors. And in this particular case, there is an action. Case, there is an action that is called this Midjita action that, in general, for Hofalger, is called Midjita Ulgrid action. But the point is that I will assume something for simplicity. I will assume that this is implicitly. This is not a necessary condition, but just to simplify things. And in this case, you have an action of your group on A, and this action is characterized by the following. Characterized by the following. If you pick something in the G component and arbitrarily A, X, Y, the action is completely, let's say, characterized by this one. The action is what you need in order to switch this part. And that action plus this gradient makes this algebra as a commutative algebra in the Drifel center. In the Driesl center of A, and this is in fact a commutative algebra in this set. But the interesting thing here is that if you take the invariance, ordinary invariance, this is exactly the center of your group. So this is a long way to say something almost trivial: that is, if you want to see if your algebra is Algebra, it's commutative, then this is exactly the same. I mean, that the media gita action is trivial. So we want to do the same here. We want to see when, I mean, we want to classify or to try to understand brain structures on these kind of things in terms of trivialization of something that is completely analog to the media data action. That's the data. So we will do I want to do a parallel and this is again a theory developed by Edding of Nietzsche and Ostrich when they describe extensions, central extensions of braided categories. So here by central extension I mean the following. Extension: I mean the following. I mean you have a breakdown category again with a, sorry, you have a fusion category in this case graded by a group in such a way that the trivial component is included in the reflect center of A in such a way that when you apply the forgetful functor, you obtain the same inclusion. So this is a central extension. Extension and it's in some sense analog to what is happening here. And they describe again this kind of objects because here, one of the things that of course happened is that this has a braided structure. So something that happened here is that again, there is a very nice description of all these objects using some homotopy ideas as monoidal functors. Monoidal functors from here to here. When this is the Picard group of the braided category, so it's the invertible module categories with some particular tensor product that came from the fact that this is a braided category. So again, there is some obstruction theory that tends from this perspective, and that allows to describe homologically what is happening. So now, again, one of the Now, again, one of the results in this paper of ethics of nutrition lost is that this admits, let's say, up to equivalence, a unique, I will say, immediate action in this moment, just to do the parallel. So what happened here is that, again, there exists an action of the group G of this A in such a way that is compatible again. Compatible again with the it's quite similar to the other cases and of course much more complicated because it's tensor category and now the action again is characterized by something similar to this but in this case you have X and Y and you don't have that is equal because we are in tensor categories so what we have is the action in some sense characterized by the existence Characterized by the existence of a braiding, and a G-brading is the technical terms. And this G-bradient, it's, again, this natural isomorphism respect to the action, it's compatible in the sense that you have similar diagrams. I mean, you can describe, let's say, this half-grading of elements on this way. Of elements on this way, again using something like and similar for the other. I mean, what I mean is that of the structure that you get here, it's called a braided G cross, in this case, future category. But what happened? But what happens if you have a trialization of that action? So if you have a trialization of this media data action, so suppose that you have some natural isomorphism between this action, then you can define, I mean, in this case, you have this X and this Y, and this goes to This Y, and this goes to G, and this goes here, but then you can use this natural isomorphism, you are again in Y and this defines an honest grading on your category B. What is then the result? The result is, of course, that this assignment defines an This assignment defines a V equivalence, we have a V equivalence between, let's say, extensions. Oh, I will be very sloppy about this, but maybe I won't try to write better. Between braided, let's say here, A, well I'm using the word G. Well, I'm using the word G. G, but G is a million. G, G cross 10 categories, in fact, plus attributation and A graded. Perhaps here I have to say when a fix tens G cross-graded tensor extensions of let's say P and here G graded graded extensions of B. Here, I mean the statement is not complete in the sense that I haven't said what are the Haven't said what are the arrows here, of course. But you can fix the arrows in order to really have the equivalent. So I haven't said here what means that two G-cross-predented categories without realization are equivalent, but it's, let's say, the natural one that draws off the actors. How this can be useful. So let me explain an old result in this term that is how to How to understand the gradient structure over Tambari and Magami categories. It was done like 20 years ago by Sealer, and I won't, but this is a, with this, this is a different, or I don't know, it's different, but it's. So the example, it's considered Tambaria Magami. Tambaria Magami has an abelian group as immediately. Has an abelian group, asymmetric and non-degenerated by character, and some scatter that the square of this is one over the element here, something like that. And you have the tensor category has, it's said to graded, and you have the, in the zero component, you have the elements of the group. So, in some sense, you have only really back A. And then there is another simple object, M, and the fusion rules. Aim and the fusion rules are basically please. And using this, this chi and this tau, you can define the associated. So the point is that if you want to, let's say, to try to understand the braided. To understand the braided structures over this, one way to do it is to see what are the possible central extension structures of FEC A on the drizzle center of Stambaria Magami chi. Because we are only interested in, let's say, in central inclusion, so in additional, we have to have that the forgettable here corresponds to the identity. Corresponds to the identity basically, this is pretty easy to describe. I mean, in general, it could be much harder, but in this particular case, it's just some scalar. And really, it's a scalar that is pretty simple to compute. And this colour is just a quadra. I mean, you can prove that central extensions corresponds are in ejective correspondence. With polarizations, I think is the word. So, quadratic forms such that this is Q of A, Q of B equals Q of A. And in this particular case, the paradigm corresponds to the same by character sinus. But perhaps the interesting the most interesting part is that the action, let's say the media data action, in this case in A, it's inversion. So for that reason, if you want to know if the category admits a braiding, of course, one condition that you need at least is that this action is trivial. So in particular, that means that in this part, In this particular case, you need that A should be elementary available. Avilia.tubou. And in fact, later, if you really want to compute, let's say, this automorphism that I am saying here, in order to compute In order to compute explicitly, you need some alpha and scalar such that the square is equal to tau by basically the Gauss sum. So in this particular case, braided structures over Tambaria Magami and the condition that the group is elementary amelian corresponds to pairs. Corresponds to pairs that is the quadratic for that do these things and the scalar alpha. So that corresponds to really the same data corresponds to set to cross-raided structures, but in particular corresponds to braided structures. So yeah, so that's one way. And now yeah, so that's Yeah, so that's one possible application of to have a trivialization. And now the other application of when a trivialization can appear is the following. Suppose that you have again a finite group acting on a fusion category. Then there is a way, I want to enter in details here, but there is a way to construct a new category that is called the equivariant of equivalentization. So a natural question. So a natural question is what are if we can describe the tensor or the fusion subcategories, these categories, let's say in terms of fusion subcategories of C and some additional data related with G. And the way that this appears again, this is in a joint work with Corey Jones. Corey Jones. But this is also done later we learn about this by Alex Levin, a student of Dimitri, that says that fusion subcategories. Yeah, independently. And fusion subcategories of the equantization can be parametrized by triples where this is a It's a fusion subcategory, G invariant. And by G invariant, I mean that if you act by G here, the action again will be inside of. So that is stable under the G action. That's what I am saying. The other part is a normal subgroup of G, and the third part is a It's a um it's a etha G equivariant. This is something that I haven't defined yet, G equivariant, but this is the point here, the equivalent realization. Of H but when of H on C. What I mean is that this is a trivialization of the action of H, that is a subgroup, on E. And this equivariant here, it means that It means the following. It's some condition that probably right now is not terribly important, but anyhow, it's basically this condition for all H in H and G in G. This is the G that we are. This is the key that you have. So, what is the idea? Now, the idea is the following: if you have this data, then one thing that happens is that actualization general allows you to include in the AQ. I mean, here we have, by definition, a trivialization of the action of H on E. So that allows you to define. So that allows you to define an inclusion let's say an inclusion of E inside of here. That's part of the thing. And now the point is that because this is a normal subgroup, in fact the quotient group also as a group act on this category. And the equivalent condition, this equivalent condition, This equivalent condition, it's the condition that we need in order to see that this action also goes to this quotient. So, in particular, you can equivariate to both sides. And this is canonical equivalent in our case to C to the G. So, that is the fusion sub-category inside of this. Just to finish, now we apply. Now, we apply these results to some particular examples when you have a half algebra include in another a central inclusion. So in this case, you can define the quotient that corresponds to a, it's again a cofaligra. And the interesting thing is, if this is central, then the category of co-modules of this can be explained. Of these can be expressed as the category of commodules over Q being quantized. So, in this particular case, fusion subcategories of the category of commodules corresponds to Hopsabalgebras. So, that allows you to define for things like this. Hop-sub-algebras in particular we apply to a family, a concrete family of Hopf algebras called Caption-Palewski algebras. And values the algebras. And we describe, let's say, the lattice of sub-algebras in terms of some, let's say, comological data. Thank you. Anyway, Cecil, do I understand correctly that this G-equivalent realization of an action of G on C is the same thing as the section of the forgetful form? Is the section of the forgetful farmer from CGPC? Yes. I mean, Equivariant, you said. Yeah, Equivariant, yes. I'm not sure about that. Maybe you don't need Equivarian? Maybe you don't need Equivariant, yes. But to be honest, I have to think about that. I don't have it in the top of my mind. Yeah, but and for us the technical reason to use is to try to to to in order to be sure that the action of G quotient, I mean you you get an action over the quotient group, that's it. Any more questions? Any more questions? Yeah, so the problem is that E doesn't fit to the time sensors, so you don't have to separate it. But it does fit to the G button. But if you look at the G button, you can actually have some functions on there.
