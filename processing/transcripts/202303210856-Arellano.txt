Our first speaker this morning is Alve Palamalo from the University of Arizona, who will talk to us about some of the challenges and opportunities in invert modeling using carbon monoxide as a piece study. Okay, thank you, Dylan. I'm sorry I could not be there. I had some urgent family matters to attend to. Last time I had Time I had a nice carbon data workshop on this was 2021, 2022 carbon data simulation with Richard Minard was involved as well. And so my key word here is 23 years. It has been 23 years since we started a global inversion of global Inversion of global carbon monoxide sources starting from Peter Bergermash's work in 2000. I know there were several other regional inversions before that, but it started really with 2000 and then obviously driven by the satellite era, Muppet, and then come OMI and many others. So I want to kind of give you some overview of my perspective on this. Of my perspective on this. I started this on my PhD in 2000. And bottom line is that while there are several or a lot of literature with regards to carbon monoxide inversion, there are still a lot of challenges. And I think it's still an important thing to consider. Although there are also opportunities, and I'm going to show you some of these opportunities today. Opportunity to speak today. So just to acknowledge my co-authors, this is really work by my former student, Enfil Tang, previously by OISAM, who's now at the USC, and my colleague Ben Gobert. So he is now working on the CAN CAN. On the CAM-CAM DNKF side of things, which has started before. I listed here Kazu, Andy, Jay, Bo, Johan, and Yi since I'm going to show you later on an attempt to do the comparison of CO sources, which I think prior to COVID essentially stopped during COVID days. During COVID days. So I abandoned this. But there's an opportunity to revive this as well. So the other thing is that there's a related activity under IGAC, which several of our colleagues are involved, Dyland, Davin, Kazoo as well, and Jenny, wherein it could be a venue to actually. To actually look at intercomparisons of inversions, estimates, emission estimates using satellite data. In fact, there is a workshop prior to GAEA conference this June in Brussels on data simulation and inverse modeling and interpretation of subtle observations. Observations. Before I start, I want to kind of show you why CO and what's really the it's not moving. All right. Why CO and why we're interested in this and what's peculiar about this, as Tushard mentioned yesterday, the goal is to bring together some of the tools that the Met community. Some of the tools that the MET community has done, and also point out some uniqueness with regards to chemical DA and inverse modeling. So, I wanted to kind of show you this. And so, you know this very well that CO has a lifetime of about one month or so, depending on where you are. Takes a while. And so it sits in that middle. In that middle point, wherein it has still reactive, it's very reactive in terms of OH, but it's also prone to errors in terms of how we simulate weather and meteorology and transport. And so this is kind of in between. So we have to consider model transport errors, and also we have to consider non-linearity with regards to CO. This is also from Karassi et al. where you can think about this scale on 100 kilometers or so. But this again boils down to what methods are appropriate for this when you actually going zooming in, especially in the future where any goes higher resolution and the demand for more high-level information. For more high-level information on emissions and uncertainty, and then you kind of shift from a traditional linear Gaussian DA or universe modeling to a more non-linear and coupled system. And so the other thing that is unique to CEO is that it's a product of incomplete combustion. And so whether you have fire or you have smoke. Or you have fire, or you have smoke, you have CEO. So that's a good tracer for combustion. But the good thing about this also is that during combustion, you're interested also of other products, intermediate products and oxidized products like CO2 for fossil fuel combustion. And then you have other NOx for high-temperature combustion and SO2 and so on and black carbon. So they are co-located, co-emitted during the fire, during a combustion prior to whole. The fire, uh, during a combustion product, whether fire or power plant. Um, and so you when you look at this problem, then it becomes clear that you can actually get some information on the correlated species like NO2 and black carbon. If you have observed CO, then you may have some idea of emission factors or emission ratios for different species. For different species. And so different species also, or a different efficiency of combustion, also show you different ratios, different ratios or values of these intermediate products. So more fully oxidized would be less CO, high CO2. More high-temperature combustion would be low, high NO2, maybe low CO2. NO2, maybe low CO because it's more efficient now. So there's actually an opportunity to actually look at the correlative species as well. A good thing and a bad thing. So we had this a long time ago. That's me my age now. Sam Silva looked at the ratios of different mega CDs, and it was promising to see that you can actually separate. See that you can actually separate that with regards to efficiency in terms of CO CO2 ratios. Then, then there is, we followed up with looking at CO and NO2. And again, depending on where you are in the diagram, you'll see that you end up with more high fossil fuel energy or more renewable or waste energy sources. Sources, so more CO, less NO2. So these are all proof of concepts because we want to kind of understand how this can be translated to an emission estimate later on. And I think we stop there because we do know how to do it. Bottom line. The other thing is, as I said, there's non-linearity of CEO, and there's also a conundrum wherein CO is both. CO is both emitted in the combustion but also emitted naturally from VOCs, biogenic VOCs, and also methane oxidation. So it can be a source, it can be a sink, it's a sink of OH, but it's also methane is a source of CO and VOCs as well. So it's a conundrum because OH depends on that as well. And so the abundance of As well, and so the abundance of OH depends on CO, the abundance of CO depends on OH, and so on. And so that has to be, I think, said non-linear nature of CO and issues with model transport. That, in effect, also involves methane. Methane loss is essential function of voltage, and so when Google. And so Ben Gobert was looking at this problem, and we noticed a decrease in CEO over the decades. But then the secondary production of secondary CEO actually increased. And so, and also the lifetime of the higher method loss also was an effect on this. So, when we look at emissions. When we look at emissions, right, so we have CO on the left-hand side, it's observed abundance or concentration or columns. And then on the right-hand side, you have emission. But this emission, in fact, is not that CO abundance is not only a factor of emissions or a function of emissions, but also a lot of factors, right? Turbulence, convection. Convection, boundary layer height, boundary layer processes, and then also the chemistry. So it's very hard to actually get CO right, especially the anthropogenic CO, because you need to account for secondary CO, which is all over the place, and you need to account for errors in the representation of this. Of this. This is just to show you the posterior column of CEO here in the, I don't know if I can do this, maybe, in this panel, wherein you actually have a convolution of sources. And so if you decompose the sources using a tagging scheme, then you end up with this spatial distribution. This spatial distribution, a fire would look like this: CO from biogenic emissions, and the secondary CO from non-methane VOCs and methane to CO. So if you just look at it blindly, you can see that, yeah, there are some signatures that they have different spatial distribution, but most of the time also they are collocated, or they're pretty much the same. So it's very, very hard to distinguish, especially. Hard to distinguish, especially during in the remote areas. In the nearby sources, then you can see maybe it's a fire or maybe it's essentially from biogenic. Now, if you look at the timing of this, the distribution, temporal distribution, then you can actually see also that there's a difference between the timing in anthropogenic CO of fires, obviously, and the biogenic. Obviously, and the biogenic CO and the secondary CO. Okay, it follows OH, in fact. Okay, I thought I heard something. So both the spatial differences and the temporal differences will give you some signatures. That's the hope when we do the inversion. And so I said 23 years, right? Said 23 years, right? And so, this is really just papers related to inversions, related to assimilation of CO and estimating sources or estimating the state and some improvements on that. And that's pretty much a stop pre-COVID. And so, this is 2008, and Francois Muller's work on OH. And there's On OH, and there's several highlights here. Zejang has done a lot on terms of looking at the algorithm and issues with regards to OH inversion, LCO inversion. And then there's obviously Kazoo working on the ENKF multi-species, and then Ben Gobert as well. So challenges. In fact, I'll just focus on I'll just focus on two things that I already mentioned: non-linearity nature of this and the sensitivity of these estimates to the model treatment of transport, either bond or layer induction mixing processes. And so it's very, very sensitive. Estimates are very sensitive to this. So I was kind of frustrated with this. So I went on and looked at. On and look at several of the reanalysis, both state estimation and source estimation. And so these are the people that are involved. And the idea is really to do a transcom X, similar to TransCom CO2 and Transcom Methane. We didn't really go far from this, but we started this and was an attempt to actually look at comparing this. As Brad pointed out, the fluxes are. out the fluxes are or it's very hard to verify this emissions and the only way to do it is looking at it from the directly through abundance and the consistency of the abundance not just on CO but other species as well I think is important so we're looking at this and so there are several of this configurations here cams again and there's three cams paradoxeries and UEF and then we have camp And then we have CAMCAM, we have the USCAM from Z, we have DCR from Chaser, and then we have LMDCs from LSE, BO and EN. And so they were kind enough to give of this their analysis, including some of the diagnostics that is helpful for looking at the variability or spread. Variability or spread across this reanalysis. So, this is just a distribution of this reanalysis products. This is a spatial mean across, I forgot the time period, 2000 to 2017, depending on the reanalysis period. And so you end up with G-Scan on the left panel, top funnel, and then you compare it with MOPIT. So these are very, very simple. Take what they have. Simple. Take what we have and just plot the columns and calculate the burden. Again, you have variations of the burden from 400 to 386. The other motivation for this was that all of this reanalysis show a decreasing CO, but they actually have different magnitudes in the trend. So I wanted to kind of get some sense of what exactly is the trend and the spread of this trend. The spread of this trend estimates. Overall, there is an issue with regards to the tropics. We expect that issues with tropics with regards to transport, again, and also OH and the sinks of sinkable CO. There's variability whether or not we look at it from a state estimation or a source estimation or focus on source estimation. We've kind of looked at this trends and again see that there is, in fact, a lot of variability factor of 50% variability with regards to just the relative to the mean of these trends. Seasonality as well, you'll see differences in the seasonality, whether or not it's coming from the old age fields or from this transport is. Transport is a thing to consider. But we haven't really done a lot of this. We stop here and then abandon it. The other thing that I want to show you is opportunities. We're thinking about CO, CO2, CO as a constraint for methane as well. And we showed you this in the correlative because they are correlated and co-mutant and they have some impacts. And so we kind of built a system very, very rudimentary. Very, very rudimentary in a CAM-CAM framework. We can also simulate metrology using DART and sample-based framework. But here we are thinking of looking at just nudging with MERA. But the idea is that you have emissions of this air quality species, CO, NO2 in this case, and you observe those, right? Observe those abundance. But then we added CO2 fluxes from the Fluxes from the posterior fluxes from CarboTracker and from LSC. And then also we added an ensemble of posterior or GCP emissions from methane. And so we have that, there is capability to do online biogenic and biospheric simulations in CAMCAM because it's an earth system model, but we've figured out. But we've figured out we just use the posterior estimates from them. And so I think I have 15 minutes, right? All right. So the starting, sorry. How much time do I have, Dylan? You have about 10 minutes. All right, good. So we kind of revisited. And so we kind of revisited Paul Palmer's work at Alp during Curse AQ similar field campaign in 2001 and Trace P and thought maybe this is a good time for us because we also have radiocarbon samples C14 CO2. So we derive fossil fuel CO2 in this case. So we wanted to actually have comparisons with the trace P. With their trace B. And so, again, naively, we look at it from a Bayesian synthesis inversion with different basis functions across East Asia and also South Korea. And in the left, I'm showing you the tags and the contribution for each of those tags, response functions. And then on the right, you have CO2 response functions. Response functions. You also have tags that you have to build on this. And so just to show you that there is some differences again in the presentation of this response functions and the differences between East Asia and Korea. But if you look at the abundance downwind, then it's very hard to actually see it. But there's also a gradient and a vertical that's in some way. Vertical that in some way you can actually see differences in the vertical contribution and vertical profiles, especially pollution coming from East Asia. On top of that, if you look at the ratios, enhancement ratios of pollution from the response functions from Asia to US, to Korea, then you can actually separate that as well because the ratios in Ratios in East Asia is higher compared to Korea, more efficient. Koreans are more efficient, it seems in terms of that ratio. And so we did a naive synthesis inversion. It's the only thing that I know, but the idea is to augment this with CO. So we have our emissions estimates. Estimates source vector of CO2 and CO as well for these different tags. And so we also augment these response functions. K, in this case, annotations are slightly different than yesterday's, but we augment that. But augmenting that would also require augmenting the Eric Ovarians matrix, the model data mismatch. Model data mismatch errors and SE in this case, and the a priori emissions error covariance as well. And so we have for SE, the off-diagonal terms of this, we can look at it from the innovation, from the OLPS-minus forecast or the MOLS-SI model comparisons. And so we end up with a very small error here or correlation of 0.3. Our correlation of 0.33 compared to Paul Parma's 0.7, I think. But we had an issue with errors in the a priori, is why I asked Nicola, because this is an important thing to actually consider this. That's what we found, in fact, and it's very sensitive to what we specify at the air correlation. What we found is that we did several tests. One is looking at this. One is looking at this inversions just for fossil fuel CO2 data, and then we look at it from just CO2 data, and we look at it from CO and CO2 data, and what is the value of adding CO in terms of getting FFCO2, right, for East Asia, differentiating East Asia and Korea. We found that yes, there is consistency when we look at it from a joint inversion. A joint inversion consistent with the fossil fuel CO2 inversions that we have. But it's very sensitive to the assumptions of our air correlations. So just bear that in mind. We don't know what to do with that. The other thing is an opportunity to actually track this conundrum and assess the features. And assess the feedback of changes in CO to changes in methane, especially in the loss of methane. And so we ended up, this has been Guber's work, we ended up looking at it from over similar field campaign, different ways of different configurations of the model. So you have data simulation. Have data simulation, updating the emissions, prescribing methane, and so on and so forth. What we found is that yes, we need to have emissions update for CO in order to actually match that CO profile, but we also need, in fact, the interactive chemistry is important for methane and also for ozone. This is a recent paper in. This is a recent paper in review by Yvonne, Ortega, and Ben Gobert, where they look at COVID experiments. And again, we see reductions in CO will increase correspondingly OH reduction CO and NOx during the COVID days also as an implication to the lifetime of methane. Last thing I want to kind of look at is. Want to kind of look at is uh yes, we look at methane, look at CO2. Maybe there is also a way to look at water vapor because it's relevant in terms of the production of ox. In terms of the community, we think about water vapor, tomospheric water vapor to be kind of known. We rely on the meteorological forecast for that or the analysis. Cast for that or reanalysis. What I'm saying here is that maybe there is a way we have to assess if it's really uncertain as well. So the idea is to actually think about, look at the sensitivity of water vapor with other species, especially that in terms of an update, a state estimation, you are looking at the looking at the sensitivity of for example water vapor to or of CO to water vapor or OH to water vapor. This is to show you the air covariance from Yiyasake and you see there's a lot of blobs for different species. So what we did was just a simple naive look at regression analysis and just we were looking at the importance Just we were looking at the importance of these interactions, in fact, of water vapor to other species. I'm not going to go through the details of this, but the idea is that that sensitivity is not only a function of water vapor, but also it's a function of other abundance. And so we want to look at that interaction. And just to show you that it's non-Gaussian and it's non-stationary, you'll see again a lot of features of non-Gaussianity here and non-stationarity in terms of HOX, NOx, ozone, formaldehyde. And so these are all drivers of OH. We were looking at the sensitivity of this drivers, observe drivers with OH hogs. We wanted to understand hooks. Just to show you the joint problem. Um, just to show you the joint probabilities of this, and again, uh, what's what's the basic idea here is that it's non-linear, um, especially uh during the winter months. Um, during the summer months, your photochemistry is involved, very active, you end up actually getting this right. So, we did some relative importance or feature importance look at this, looking at the sensitivities. And yes, water vapor is relevant. Water vapor is relevant in terms of sensitivity to OH. Now we look at the joint distribution of this water vapor to other species, drivers of OH, and you can see same thing. It's non-linear, especially during winter months of the northern hemisphere or southern hemisphere. Southern hemisphere. And we see that when you look at feature importance or relative importance, that interaction is actually significant to consider. So we bear in mind, I think the idea is that maybe we should actually look at meth for water view first well. This is just a quick look at the joint distributions of CANCAM relative to Tropomi. There's many things to understand. There's many things to look at this later on, but the bottom line is that CamChem is reasonably capturing that joint PDF structure. There's a bias, obviously, but it's promising for us. Last thing that I want to kind of look at is nerd system modeling. Nicola alluded to this that we're looking at in the future, the idea of coupling this all into one. This is all into one. And we were considering this reanalysis of aerosols over the Himalayas because we wanted to constrain the deposition of lag carbon and dust, light-emitting absorbing particles, over the Himalayas because it affects the soap. And so we wanted to have that interaction, but we thought maybe we could look at it from the interactions point of view and assess whether or not the aerosols really that we observe from the AOD over. From the AOD over the Himalayas, are really, and it's dependence on the dependence on the hydrology on snow, on snow hydrology on this aerosols. There are actually, there's a lot of feedback going on, changes in the elevation, changes in the indirect effect, direct effect, and then there is chemistry, direct radiative forcing in the snow and so on and so forth, changes in the boundary layer, many things in a place where it is very hard to actually do a lot. Where it is very hard to actually do a lot of verification. And so we thought we look at year five, CAMS, AOD reanalysis, MERA2, and a WARF CAM reanalysis, wherein we have more coupling with regards to snow hydrology and black carbon. The question was that there, if you look at the snowfields of remotis, they actually differ. CAMS, ER5, MERI. For CAMS, EarFi, Mira, and WorfCam. So, the question is: what drives this? I think I don't have a lot of time, but I will pause here. I will skip this and just show you that aerosol interactions matter. Very important. That green thing that you see is the aerosolometeology interactions. Again, these are all bulk interactions onto. Onto snow. But then, if you look at it from across models, across your analysis, you actually see its variability, especially in this low snow melt. So we thought it's important if you're looking at it from an emissions point of view and there to address what is the contribution of India black carbon to snowmelt in the Himalayas. Then you have to actually understand interactions and actually assess. Understand interactions and actually assess this quite well. I think I'm going to skip this, but the idea is that there is a new generation, next generation modeling component that can actually go into multi-scale approach and multi-species approach. This is just to show you a fire from California moving from California towards Alaska. Towards Alaska or Canada and then moving back. And so this was Wenfu's motivation that we need this kind of system on top of WARF CAM wherein you don't really see the boundary coming back, right? You cannot really track that coming back fires. I'll end here. Questions? Thank you, Eleanor. Are there questions for Abe? You ended just on time, so it's perfect. We have a few minutes for questions. Questions? Yes, Gordon. That was a very interesting talk. I enjoyed it a lot. I was just wondering, do you find that really CO2 constrains CO rather than CO helping to constrain CO2? Because it just seems like there are so many. Because it just seems like there's so many more prospects that are uncertain that affect CO that I just think would be that way. Can you comment on that? Interesting. We only look at it from the correlations point of view. So I come from the CO field, so I thought that the CO as a tracer for fossil fuels. For fossil fuels, CO2 can help, but it can also complement the other way around, especially for areas where we have natural sources as well of CO. But we have more CO observations than CO2. And so that also is a motivation for looking at it the other way. One thing I can add to that is: in addition to having more observations for CO from a sort of signal-to-noise perspective, you're seeing a much stronger signal of CO variations compared to CO2. And so the hope is that you can take advantage of that and get some information on CO2. But it does complicate things in terms of OH, background sources. But there's still this much larger perturbation. Yeah, what we found is that when we Yeah, what we found is that when we look at just the CO2 inversion, again, this is very naive, we didn't get the CO consistent with the fossil fuel radio carbon sample in Russia. Other questions for Abe? So, Abe, I'm going to ask the question that people always ask during data simulation process, which I hope no one asks this during my talk, but how do you get the But how do you get the covariance between CO and CO2 for your open background? If what your mission for instance like. So as I said, it's very ad hoc. Unlike the mismatch, where you can look at it from observations and model statistics. But the prior, I have no idea but to actually do an ensemble. idea but to actually do an ensemble as you did uh Paul on looking at again three things in a CO emission right activity emission factor and combustion efficiency or control and so if you preserve all those and then you have an ensemble yeah that's how would I look at it the other thought that I had was to look at posterior emissions of Posterior emissions of those two, but I still struggle, and so I kind of abandon it. And I would be happy and looking forward to thoughts on how actually to do this. Yeah, project. So we try to found the coherences. It was hard to get correlations that would mean to be large because of the varying emission ratios across the different sectors. Person so if no one else has a voice, okay. So I have another question about your COVID results. Are you guys finding that the chemistry could drive the entire extraordinarily large growth rate we saw in methane that year? I have to refer you to Ben, wasn't part of the paper. Wasn't part of the paper. They'll have a few minutes or so for any additional questions. I was just hoping that Aave could talk a little bit more about, so everybody talked about using water vapor and methane to constrain OH, the role of stratospheric water vapor. A lot of those reanalyses. A lot of those reanalyses don't have good stress water breakthrough. Yep. I don't know much about stratospheres. That's why I ended up looking at the troposphere, Brad. But CamCam would have that component as well. The idea is actually to just assess the CSCCMI chemistry climate models, whether or not they have good water vapor. Good water vapor. And I've been talking to retrievals of water vapor, PWB, Prazil water vapor, in the anesthetist group, all Mensel. And there is, in fact, intercomparison of this under the GBAP, GWEX water vapor experiment project, I think. And so that's kind of the direction that I'm going. I look at what is the state of water vapor in the retreat. In the retrieval sense, I know operational centers don't do the retrievals simulation, but the radiance, and so that's kind of an after effect of that water vapor assimilation to the water vapor field. But I wanted to look at that. I really wanted to look at assessing what's the state of knowledge with regards to water vapor and the troposphere and what's just how of our certainty. How of how are certain, or how are these chemistic climate models perform with regards to that? I guess what I wonder is more the stratospheric water vapor is a very small signal on top of the troposphere. But I'm guessing that that would actually control OH a lot more than the troposphere. A trophy is a very body. Well, so in the stratosphere, large signals like the volcanic eruption or a fire, right, will give water vapor. But if you look at the profiles, water vapor is really the boundary layer. A lot of impact on OH. So, most of the impact would be in the free troposphere, especially the OH. But a lot of reactions, the action is actually. The action is actually in the surface in the boundary layer. All right, if there are no other questions, let's thank Abe in. Thank you. Thanks, Abe. I am next. I guess I'll share myself.
