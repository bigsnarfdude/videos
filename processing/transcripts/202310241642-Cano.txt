Bilayer graphing in an artificially engineered super lattice. And what I want to show is that these systems, these artificially engineered super lattices, can have some of the same features as Moray super lattices and some different features. And at least from a theoretical perspective, I think there's, it's exciting to me. We can get, it's a different platform by which we could get topological flatbands. From an experimental perspective, obviously there's so much magic in the Moray systems, it's going to be hard to compete. MRA systems, it's going to be hard to compete with that, but also I don't think that should stop us from exploring new platforms. And we don't really know what's going to happen until people work on it more. Okay, so obviously the motivation is from the exciting phenomena that we see in twisted bilayer graphene. But just to be a play devil's advocate, there's also some disadvantages to twisted heterostructures. So, in particular, I think. So, in particular, I think twist angle disorder and strain are some of the difficulties that we have in completely understanding these systems. So maybe that's some motivation to look into alternative platforms to realize super lattice physics. So, if we want to find an alternative platform to twisted bilayer graphene, we should think about what are the features of twisted bilayer graphene that maybe that make it special. Maybe that makes it special. So, what do we have on the coarsest terms? We have two layers of graphene, and together they make a large super lattice. And from this effect, we get dispersionless electrons or flat bands. So, the situation that I found myself in a couple years ago is that my experimental colleague Xu Ju asked me, well, I have another system that has these same features. What if I take Bernal stack bilayer graphene and I artificially impose And I artificially impose a super lattice on that. So, by a super lattice, it's going to be a spatially modulated chemical potential. Those are the defining features of twisted bilayer graphene. So, will this system also have some of the exciting many-body physics? I didn't know the answer to that question. So, this system has different symmetry properties. It actually has a lot of differences as twisted bilayer graphene, but some of the fundamental physics is the same. And so, that sent us down the road of investigating Bernal-staff. Bernal-staffed bilayer graphene with this artificially imposed supralattis potential. I want to say something about how we're thinking about imposing these super lattice potentials. So a few years ago, Corey Dean's group put out this nice paper that I'll say more about later, but they're imposing a super lattice potential on monolayer graphene in the following way. So this is their monolayer graphene. Here they have silicon dioxide, and you can see that they Have silicon dioxide, and you can see that they've etched holes in a very regular array pattern in the silicon dioxide. So then, when you put this gate underneath, what happens is that the potential that the monolayer graphene feels is now spatially modulated, and it's spatially modulated in two dimensions. So you get this artificial lattice, which in this case has a triangular shape. In this case, the scale that they're working with was 35 nanometers. Since then, there's been Then there's been other work getting this length scale down. So, Frank Poppins' group has a paper last year where instead of doing this etched silicon dioxide, they're making a graphite gate. It's a similar principle, and they just punch holes directly in the gate, and there they're getting the periodicity down to 18 nanometers. So that's more on the scale of twisted bilayer graphene. And then more recently, there's an idea: well, maybe if you take a twisted bilayer system like twisted HBN, that will have. Twisted HBN, that will have a spatially varying polarization. So, what if we take twisted HBN and put that on top of bilayer graphene or any other material? That provides yet another route to get a spatially modulated periodic potential. And that would have a tunable length scale, which would depend on the twist angle of the HBF. So, there's at least a few different approaches to impose a super lattice potential with length scales ranging from tens of nanometers, possibly down to the Possibly down to the TBG length scale. From our perspective, since we're studying, as I'll explain, a pretty simple model, we don't really care what the setup is. The point is that there's many different ways to realize super lattices, so let's see what happens when we impose one of them. Okay, before describing our own work, it's important to mention that there's been a lot of previous work going back more than 10 years on graphene in a spatially modulated potential. In a spatially modulated potential. Most of this was focused on monolayer graphene, and some of it, a lot of it, was focused on 1D potentials. And in particular, people weren't looking for flatbands. So our work really goes in a different direction by focusing on the 2D, having a 2D potential on the bilayer system, which I put a little check here to say, yeah, this has been looked at a little bit, but kind of only like one paragraph in one paper as far as I can tell. One of the big differences here is that the previous literature was focused a lot on the satellite Dirac cones. So that's to say, if you impose a super lattice potential on monolayer graphene, you can't gap the Dirac cone. As long as you preserve the C2T symmetry, the Dirac cone will remain gapless. You just fold the band structure a lot. And bilayer graphene is different than that. You can open up gaps, as I'm going to show. So the previous literature is kind of in a very different regime. Literature is kind of in a very different regime, and they're looking for very different physics. So, this is the experimental data from Corey's group. Okay, so this is what I mean about, this is monolayer graphene. So, this is the setup. They have this periodic potential on monolayer graphene, and this is what I mean about folding the band structure. And what you can see is that this is the original Dirac code. There's all these other Dirac codes at corners, but they can never gap. They're all protected by symmetry. They're all protected by symmetry. So you can never really get flat bands if you can't open any gaps. And I want to look at the data a little bit because I'm going to show some more plots like this at the end. So I think it's easiest to start from this plot. So if you look at this band structure plot, you can turn it into a plot of DOS. You can see that there's these kind of dips where you have the, what I call satellite Dirac codes at higher energies, and there's peaks in between them that's coming from Van Hove singularities. What they actually measure. Singularities. What they actually measure in the experiment is transport, not DOS, and so you basically invert this to get resistivity. And so the main feature that you should see is that there's a peak in resistivity at the original Dirac cone, but also you get these kind of side peaks, which are coming from the satellite Dirac cone. So coming from here and here and here, all these other little cones. And that's kind of the feature that they were looking for to show that they successfully imposed the periodic potential on graphene. Monolayer graphene. Monolayer graphene. And this left picture is showing this picture is just the cut of the left picture. So now, if you take a cut like this, you can see that there's a resistance peak in the middle, but you also get these kind of peaks on the sides, which are the satellite Dirac bones. Okay, so the difference between bilayer graphene and monolayer graphene is that bilayer graphene with a super lattice can realize gapped flatbands. So we're not going to be looking for these satellite cones, we want to open up gaps. We want to open up gaps. So, this is the outline for my talk. So, the majority is just explaining what I've kind of just already explained: bilayer graphene in a super lattice potential. We can get topological flat bands. We look at these flat bands, we look at partially filling the flat band. So, there's a spin valley degeneracy, so we can look at integer filling and fractional filling. And then finally, I'll show the experiment that took place at Stony Brook, where they see evidence of the super lattice potential. See evidence of the super lattice potential and maybe some evidence of correlated physics. Okay, so this is our model. Our model has three terms, which I'll explain. Bilayer graphene. We can also add a perpendicular displacement field that's not spatially modulated. And then we have the super lattice displacement. And so we're thinking that there's actually three tuning parameters here. So this is Brunel stat bilayer graphy, and this is, say, the supralattice gate. So if you Super lattice gate. So, if you so there's three different voltages, which is basically top gate, bottom gate, and the super lattice gate. So, we can tune the chemical potential, the spatially varying part of the potential, and the spatially constant potential all separately, at least in principle. So, the first term is just a continuum model of bilayer graphene. It gives us this quadratic band touching point. The second term is this displacement field, so that's a spatially constant. So that's a spatially constant perpendicular electric field. And so the effect of that is to open up a gap in bilayer graphene. And because of the barycurvature in graphene, then this creates a valley churn band. So what that means is that in one valley, these two bands together have a churn number of one. The opposite valley has the opposite churn number. But then finally, we add this super lattice potential. So let me just say what happens in pictures first. Me, just say what happens in pictures first. What the super lattice does is fold the band structure, so I kind of just sketched what would happen. So, you end up getting this is like a very flat part of the bilayer graphene band structure. Now, if you impose the super lattice, you kind of isolate that flat part, so you get a flat mini band. And since the barycurvature is concentrated in this area, these flat mini bands will have a concentration of barycurvature. So that's where we would hope that we might find topological flat bands. might find topological flat bands. I wanted to say what these terms are here. So this is our super lattice potential. So this matrix is sublattice in layer one and then sub lattice in layer two. So because of the asymmetry of this setup, we consider asymmetry, I mean the super lattice is coming from below. It's not above and below. So the two layers of Bernal stack bilayer graphene will feel a different potential because the one layer can screen the other. Because the one layer can screen the other layer. So we incorporated this by this parameter alpha. It's not really essential to the physics, seems to be around 0.7 based on some experimental references. And then finally, how do we implement the super lattice? We just consider the first harmonic. So I'm mostly going to talk about a triangular super lattice. So we have three reciprocal lattice vectors, and we just stop there. So a person could also consider higher harmonics. So this is the model. So, this is the model that we're talking about, that I'm talking about. And we have some intuition for why we might get topological flat bands, which is that bilayer graphing with a displacement field has a flat part of its band. And so if we can tune the superlattice periodicity to isolate just this part, and that's where the bary curvature is concentrated, then we hope that that might give us a flat turn band. And so, this is exactly what our simulations bear out. Simulations bear out. So, this is a plot of the band structure of the Hamiltonian that I just showed on the previous slide. So, we're considering a periodicity of 50 nanometers because this is the scale of the experiment at Stonyborough. And then these are the kind of small voltages that we're considering to get this plot. And so, of course, the most important feature is that we get these isolated, pretty well isolated flat bands, and one of them ends up having. And one of them ends up having a churn number. So, this is kind of the plot that should be compared to twisted bilayer graphene. We get flat bands. The flatbands are naturally split from each other because there's a lot of broken symmetry since the super lattice is imposed on one side. And importantly, we have a topological flap band. Where is charge neutrality? Yes, yeah. So, zero is charge neutrality. Yeah, thank you. Right, and so these bands, the bandwidth of these bands. The bandwidth of these bands is approximately. I mean, we chose optimal parameters to make them as flat as possible. But you can see they're kind of on the order of a few MeV, which is pretty flat. And then the separation here is on the order of, let's just say, 10 MeV, which is something kind of comparable to TVG. It's interestingly, we can also get this higher turn band, which has a turn number of two. It's not very well separated from its nearest band, and I think this is. Band, and I think this is kind of a generic feature of these sorts of band structures. You have lots of band inversions all the time, and so popping out, you're going to have churn bands with different churn numbers. I don't know that that's particularly special. If we turn up these gate voltages, we can, so previously these numbers were on the order of 5 or 10 MeV, now we ramp them up to tens of MeV. Then we get this regime that we call a stack of flat bands. That we call a stack of flatbands. We get many flatbands. They're topologically trivial and they span a very large energy range. We also looked at different lattices. So what I showed so far was the triangular lattice. And the triangular lattice, super lattice, inherently breaks particle whole symmetry because the mins and maxes of the potential say if the maxes form a triangular lattice, then the mins form a honeycomb lattice. Mins form a honeycomb lattice. So there's inherent particle hole symmetry breaking. The square lattice doesn't have this property because the mins and the maxes both form a square lattice. And so the triangular and square lattices have different symmetry. So we looked into the square lattice also. And if you don't have a displacement field, then you have a perfect particle hole symmetry. So what happens is that your would-be flat bands are attached to each other. But once you turn up the displacement field, you can isolate. But once you turn up the displacement field, you can isolate these. And so, kind of different than the triangular lattice, you end up with two churn bands which have opposite churn number. In the triangular lattice case, only one of these had a churn number and the other had churn number zero. So, depending on what your purpose might be, the square triangular lattice might be preferred to you. So, I also wanted to compare this platform to twisted bilayer graphene. Graphene. So, I guess what I want to advertise is that what's the advantage here? We can have really flat churn bands over a wide range of potentials. It doesn't require the same tuning to magic angle. So I think it's more robust. And there's a lot of flexibility. You can choose the geometry of the super lattice, you can choose the size of the super lattice, and you can choose the strength of the potential by tuning knobs in situ. The disadvantage is that the length scales. Disadvantage is that the length scales are a little bit bigger. And so this is going to be more possibly more susceptible to disorder. I think the other disadvantage is that somehow these more heterostructures are really hitting a sweet spot. And I don't think it's, maybe, I don't know, maybe it's obvious to people. It's not clear to me why. The length scale just seems to be right. Yes, there's twist angle disorder. It doesn't really seem to kill anything. And so far, the experimental. And so far, the experimental status of the super lattice systems is that the disorder seems to be creating a problem where we don't quite see as clean of effects. I'll show the experimental data later. So I think there's pros and cons in engineering with an artificially imposed superlattice as compared to the Moray superlattices. Okay, so that's kind of our that's the That's kind of our main platform band structure. Just a question. The second clap band is completely trivial. Yes. Okay, I see. So there's really explicitly broken particle holes symmetry. Yes. Completely broken. Yes, exactly. Right. And that comes from this. So basically, that comes from having this triangular super lattice. So the mins say form a triangular lattice, and the maxes form a honeycomb. And the maxes form a honeycomb. That means, say, electrons are seeing one and holes are seeing the other. And churn bands tend to come from the honeycomb lattice rather than the triangular lattice. So that's kind of where this is coming from. Yeah. That was Yang Shin's insight that he taught me. Right, and in the square lattice, again, since they both see square, there's a lot more symmetry. Okay, good. So that's our platform. That's the band. That's our platform, that's the band structure. And so the next question is: well, we have a spin and valley degeneracy. So we have these valley churn bands. So, in particular, if we look at integer filling, does that mean that we'll fill one of these bands, which would give us quantum anomalous Hall effect? And if we then have that, that gives us some motivation to consider: if we fractionally fill this, can we realize a fractional churn insulator? Okay, so the first of these things that we looked at is the Hartree-Fock phase diagram at integer filling. So this is unpublished work which is done by Yangshin Zhang, who was Alan's student at Austin and an intern at Flatiron Institute and is now a postdoc at Columbia. So Yangshin, right, he looked at a filling of one. So again, what I said in words before is that we have a spin value. Before is that we have a spin-valley degeneracy. So these churn bands can be labeled by k up, k down, k prime up, k prime down. And so we might expect that at filling one that we hopefully break this symmetry, fill one of these, and then can realize quantum anomalous Hall. And so Yongshin looked at two different sizes, two different lattice periodicities. And you can see that this is true for a large region of the phase diagram. This is quantum anomalous Hall. So basically, Anomalous hall. So basically, if your super lattice is small, then you're kind of stuck in this metallic regime. But once you tune the super lattice up, then you get into the quantum anomalous Hall regime. What happens is that if you also turn up, so if you move in the vertical direction, you're turning up your displacement field, then what happens is that the gap between the churn band and the next band becomes The churn band and the next band becomes too small, and so it seems like it's not obvious why, but it seems like that causes a transition to a trivial insulator. So there's a large quantum anomalous Hall regime, but there's also a gate-tunable transition between quantum anomalous Hall and trivial insulator. Comparing these two system sizes kind of shows that if we forget about disorder effects, About disorder effects, which we have, this is our theory calculation, the system size doesn't matter that much. So, from a very clean system perspective, it's not an obstacle that your lattice is too big. It doesn't present any problem. You can just rescale all the voltages involved, and you can realize the same, very similar band structure and very similar phase diagram here. But the problem is going to be. But the problem is going to be that experimentally, I think when your length scale is too big, there's just spatial inhomogeneities that are going, disorder is going to be more important in a negative way for these larger length scales. Okay, and so then the next question is: well, if at integer filling we can get a, potentially get quantum anomalous Hall and isolate one of these chariot bands, what happens when we fractionally fill? What happens when we fractionally fill one of those bands? Can we get a fractional churn insulator? And so, I just wanted to remind you: this has been shown a couple of times: what happens in twisted bilayer graphene. So, this is a plot of magnetic field versus filling fraction. All of these kind of dark regions are showing the different insulating regimes. And from the slope, as was mentioned by several people, the slope of that gives you the Hall conductivity. So, this low. So, this lower plot is kind of tracing out the lines corresponding to the experimental data. And so, what you can see, these red lines, the ones that they've colored red, are the ones that have a fractional slope. So, these are the ones that would correspond to realizing fractional quantum Hall. And if these things trace down to zero field, then we would say that they realize a fractional churn insulator. But in this data, at least, they always kind of end at a few Tesla. So, in TBG. So in TBG, it seems, and I think maybe Patrick or someone else commented on this earlier, it seems like we're very close to realizing the fractional churn in Slater, but it doesn't persist all the way down to zero field. So now, since we're kind of proposing an alternative to TBG, we want to compare properties of our flat churn band to the properties in twisted bilayer graphene and hope that they compare favorably. And then we might argue that the And then we might argue that this is a good platform for looking for fractional choices later. So we have a couple of single particle indicators. So the first one is bandwidth. So as I mentioned before, these bands are really flat, even flatter than the bands in twisted bilayer graphene. So that criterion we have no problem with. But I think the more important criterion, or at least equally important, is looking at the Important is looking at the band geometry. So, as was kind of discussed in Patrick's talk, there's this notion of an ideal band geometry, which is basically comparing the so if you haven't seen this before, then it's not going to be very useful. And if you have seen it, then you know exactly what I'm talking about already. But basically, you can compute this quantum geometric tensor, which has a real part, which is a quantum metric, and an imaginary part that we're And the imaginary part that we're familiar with, more familiar with, which is the bary curvature. And when these things are equal to each other, then that's the criterion for being an ideal Turin band. So chiral TBG meets this condition. Realistic TBG, you can look at deviations from this condition, and it seems like the values that are cited in the literature are around three or four. And for our super lattice system, then we get. system, then we get that the deviation is around two. So we view this as being at least, I don't know how seriously we should take this number of two versus three or four, but at least around the same amount favorable for realizing a fractional turn insulator as twisted bilayer graphene is. And since twisted bilayer graphene seems to come pretty close to realizing the FCI, then we would hope that our super lattice system might also come close to realizing fractional turn in slip. Close to realizing fractional turns later if you looked at the fractionally filled band. So that's exactly what we did numerically. So these are some calculations by Ahmed Abu Khamson. So why do I call them preliminary? What Ahmed did was project the Coulomb interaction just into our churn band. So, you know, there's a, it's not clear that that's the right thing to do, but that's the thing that we did. And so we just look at the one churn band and look at one-third. One churn band and look at one-third filling. And so this is the ED spectrum. And so you can see that there's these three degenerate ground states. And as was kind of mentioned earlier, just having three degenerate ground states can't distinguish the fractional churn insulator from the charge density wave. But actually, the momenta at which these occur for certain system sizes is different. So this system is not a charge density wave. We assume that it would be a fractional. We assume that it would be a fractional churn insulator. And this other plot is doing the flux threading. And so, what this shows is that if you thread flux through one of the holes of the torus, it looks like nothing is happening down here, but this is actually the zoomed in. You can see that these three different ground states move between each other, and that's one of the striking signatures of a fractional churn insulator. So, within this calculation, we fill the churn band to one-third filling, and you see the FCI. So, that's about the best that we can do. So that's about the best that we can do numerically. Yes? How big is the Coulomb interaction relative to that difference of the energy between the two? Yeah, so it's, I mean, I don't remember the number, but it's definitely big enough that you should include both bands. And so that's what we're working on now. Right, that's what we're working on now. And so when you include, so it's a turn one band and a turn zero band. And so kind of what happens when you include both bands is that include both bands is that you can still get FCI over large regions because you're not, you know, it's not like a churn one and a churn minus one band. Yeah, but we're still kind of figuring out that phase diagram. And neglecting it is not completely justified. What if you just lower the coulomb interaction? Is it going to be still larger than the narrow band of Chernobasma? And smaller than the gap to the game. You mean is there a way? So this is Is there a way? So, this is our band structure. So, surely there's this is such a narrow bandwidth that we can surely. I mean, I haven't quantified this, but I feel pretty confident that we can choose a Coulomb interaction that's larger than this bandwidth and smaller than this gap if we wanted to. Yeah, is that your question? Yeah, then you got I think you already showed the chart on chargement. So I guess so. I guess so. I mean, I guess you might want to, if that, you showed that that's a fractional church insulator for that value of Coulomb interaction. Yeah. But if that's not a realistic value, then... Yeah. But your strength of your potential is tunable, right? Yeah. So wouldn't that allow you to tune a gap? You tune a lot of things at once. So you do tune this gap, but you also change the flatness. But if you tune the period, like you have to tune parameters, right? Or an experimental period is not very tunable. It depends on, right? So, certainly in the experiment, I wouldn't consider the period to be a knob. You can make different samples with different periods. But yeah, theory-wise, we could do that. Yeah, exactly. So we could, yes, when you change both of the, say you want to keep length fixed and change both of the voltages. And change both of the voltages, you can definitely just like rescale the whole thing. And so then you could make this gap bigger while keeping this still reasonably flat. So that's a thing that you could do. Yeah. Okay, good. So great. So that's what I want to say about the spontaneous symmetry breaking. We view the take-home message would be we view this as a promising platform to realize a fractional churn slater, assuming that disorder doesn't. Assuming that disorder doesn't kill you. Okay, so then I wanted to show this recent experimental preprint from Shu Du's group at Stony Brook. So they realize this super lattice system in the following way. So they end up, there's a couple approaches that I mentioned at the beginning, but they end up taking this silicon dioxide and punching holes in it. So this approach actually only has two tuning nodes. Approach actually only has two tuning knobs, which means that you're always kind of tuning everything at once. So mapping it to the theoretical model is not always obvious. The periodicity of the super lattice is 50 nanometers. That's why we put that into all of our models before. And so this is what these super lattices look like. And so my understanding is that the The periodicity is extremely regular. That's not the problem. But what you can see is that the size of the holes and their shape is not very regular. And so I think that's the thing that's causing the disorder in these systems. Okay, good. So this is why I wanted to show, if you remember, a little while ago, I showed a plot that kind of looked like this for monolayer graphene. Monolayer graphene in the super lattice potential. So now this is Shudu's data for bilayer graphene, and I believe that this is the first experiment which is imposing the super lattice on bilayer graphene. And so what do we see here? This is the charge neutrality point. So this is kind of the original resistivity peak at the original Dirac cone or this bilayer graphene. So it's the quadratic band touching point. And so if you look down here, you can kind of see. Look down here, you can kind of see that there's these super lattice peaks that are emerging. They're not always very obvious to see, but these lines correspond to cuts on the, or these cuts are plotted on the right. And so you can see that at certain backgate voltages, the backgate is controlling the super lattice potential. You can see that you're getting some peaks at other values of density besides zero. So they're not nearly as sharp as in the monolayer case, but they're definitely present. But they're definitely present. There's a lot of, I think there's a lot of questions that a person can ask about this data, and I think that the major problem is this kind of disorder in the periodicity. But this is meant to show that we can see these side peaks, and so this is evidence that the bilarographene is actually feeling the superlattice, it's doing something. And then finally, the other, so then the other experiment. So, then the other experiment that they do is put in a quantizing magnetic field. And so, when there's no super lattice potential, these are the Lando levels of bilayer graphene. So, you can see these pretty well-defined Lando levels, and they're labeled here. They're labeled in the same scheme that's been discussed before. So, the first number tells you about the Hall conductivity. And basically, the other number in our case will tell us about spontaneous symmetry breaking. So, you can see like these. Breaking. So you can see like these first numbers are all multiples of 4. So if you can't see 4, 8, 12, 16, that's coming from the spin valley degeneracy. So bilayer graphene, the whole connectivity is always jumping by 4. Once you add the super lattice potential, what you see, and again, it's a little bit hard to see here, but if you trace out all these lines, then what you see is that they trace down to different positions along this x-axis. Axis. And so that basically tells us that the bilayer graphene is seeing the super lattice. In other words, you're making a mini band, and each mini band gives rise to its own set of Landau levels, its own Landau fan. So you have the original Landau fan, but then you also have these additional Landau fans that are being traced along the x-axis. And then finally, if you keep turning the superlattice potential up more, then the data is very hard to. Hard to see, but if you trace these lines back, then you can kind of make a similar diagram, and you can also see there's lines going in the other direction. And these lines actually are breaking now this four-fold degeneracy. And so that's what we consider to be the evidence of correlation-driven physics in the Landau levels. We're now getting Landau levels that aren't four-fold degenerate. And so that's evidence of spontaneous symmetry breaking. And we can kind of understand this from our band structures if we, so these are. Band structures, if we so these are kind of the band structures that correspond to the three Landau level plots on the previous slide. And so the last one seems to be in this very flat band regime. And so we think that we're getting these symmetry broken Landau levels because we're in this flat band regime. And that's kind of some evidence of correlation-driven physics. So that's the status of the bilayer graphene experiment. And I think the important thing to get it on the level of you. It on the level of even close to the level of twisted bilayer graphing physics, is we really need to bring the length scale way down from 50 nanometers. And I'm optimistic that if that happens, then that would kind of clean up, basically kind of clean up this kind of data, get sharper Landau fans, see sharper features, and hope that there can be some more exciting physics that comes out of it. Okay, so this is kind of So, this is kind of a summary, and since I have a few minutes, maybe I can give a little bit of a theoretical outlook. And so, basically, what I want to say is that I think this is kind of the beginning of these super lattice platforms. So, we're working on them at Stony Brook. There's also an effort from the experimentalists at Columbia. And so, I think there's some questions going forwards: which is, is our continuum model the right model to use? Is considered Use is considering the first harmonic, the right approximation to use in this potential. You know, what's actually the potential that the bilayer graphene or other 2D system would see from this super lattice. And related to making the model is, well, if you want to, the model that we've made is general enough that it applies to any way to implement a super lattice. But you might want to consider, I showed a few different platforms, and so you might want to consider, well, what's actually And so, you might want to consider: well, what's actually the best platform to impose a super lattice? And once you decide on this platform, then you could go back and try to improve the model. And so, in particular, I think these ways of making, of imposing a super lattice with twisted HPN are particularly interesting because I think that they won't have the same level of disorder that this dielectric patterning has. So, it's basically kind of like bringing more back into this system. Maybe I motivated it. Maybe I motivated it by saying we want to get away from Moray, but it seems like there's something really special about that. So I'd like to understand if we had one of these HBN super lattices, could that get us into the topological regime that I'm most interested in? And these super lattices are pretty interesting because if you change the twist angle of HBN, you could also change the length scale. On the other hand, they're not as tunable because the potential that you get on the graphene underneath it, it is what it is. Graphene underneath it, it is what it is. You can't tune the strength of that potential. So you're operating in a much smaller phase space. I think the other open question is the lattice geometry. So triangular and square are the ones that we considered, but you could also imagine any other 2D lattice, and I think Calgame lattice could be another interesting one. And then finally, we were motivated by thinking of bilayer graphene for the comparison to twisted bilayer graphene. Twisted bilayer graphene. But what are the other 2D materials that you might want to impose a super lattice potential on? I think we should think about is there any other interesting physics that we can look for? So we considered multi-layer graphene systems, which I think is particularly interesting in light of the recent observation of the fractional churn insulator and pentalayer graphene. Sadly, we only studied three and four layers. I think there's some literature on TMDs, and so I think that's another natural place to look. And then finally, I'll just put a plug in for some other work that we did with Daniello also, where we were thinking about manipulating the 2D surface state of a 3D topological insulator. So basically, you have a Dirac code on the top of a 3D TI. Well, that's a 2D surface. So you could consider: what if I impose a super lattice potential on that? A super lattice potential on that, could I then kind of, if I manipulate this Dirac code, maybe I could have a different route to getting quantum as Hall or topological superconductivity, both of which have been desirable goals in this field. So I think these are the open questions that we want to study in the future. Okay, good. So now I'll return to this summary. I hope I've given you some evidence that maybe looking at these super lattice artificially engineered super lattice. These super lattice, artificially engineered super lattices is interesting. Yeah, and I'd be happy to take questions. Thank you. Okay, we have time for a few questions. The twisted ABJ platform, it will generate strain. Because it will generate a strain supervisor. That's another type of supervisor. You mean it generates strain on mobile aircraft? It generates strain on the bilayer graphene. Yeah. Yeah. Different from the scatter potential. Yeah, that's true. And it seems like, yeah, the strained bilayer graphene might, yeah, that's a good point. So where did you say we generate the screen? The HVA. Oh. Like one Mikito Washington was playing. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I was wondering the A-B graphene you're using. I was wondering, the A-B graphene you're using is like a nearest neighbor hopping. Is that correct? Do you know what the effects would be if you include farther-range hoppines to the fanstructure? Yeah, so actually we did include that. I didn't show it. Yeah, so we did include that. It doesn't really change the, it changes the quantitative features. It doesn't really change the qualitative features too much. And yeah, we also considered including the trigonal warping. Yeah, we can still get this pretty flat churn band. Yeah. In the multi-layer. In the multi-layer graphene structures, then those other terms seem to be more important. Maybe I have a question. So you talked about this being able to open up a region of energy where you get a bunch of sort of isolated flat bands. So do you have a picture of what's going on there? No. So I was pretty motivated to study the topological regime, so we kind of just let that be. And that's all not topological. Right. Not all. Right, so I mean, I can't say all, but for the regimes that we looked at, yeah, we checked the churn number of all those bands, and so they seem to be trivial. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so it might be interesting to know if the Vanier centers are moving around, that sort of thing. But yeah, we haven't looked into it at all yet. Okay, so I guess everybody's had a pretty full day, and I just want Full day, and I just want to say it's been wonderful to listen to all these delightful talks. And I want to thank all of you speakers, and thank you again, Jen. Can I say one more thing? Okay, so yesterday we had a discussion, a post-meeting session. And so, what I would like to propose is, again, this I expect maybe only about five or ten. Maybe only about five or ten people who want to hang around as I was going to propose to.
