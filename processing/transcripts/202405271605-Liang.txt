Okay, thank you very much. First, I want to thank the invitation from Professor Ninomiya and Professor Batano. In fact, it's a pity that I cannot go to Canada since I haven't got the visa until now. Another thing is that after I sent this title to Professor Nidomia, I found two years ago. I found two years ago, Wayweight Dean, my collaborator also gave a talk with the same title. So in my talk, maybe I will focus on different points and give some key points about our proof. Okay, what we want to start is. What we want to start is the best stable passing point. And then first, we recall some well-known results about the homogeneous case. This is homogeneous vastable equation. And here I had three state states or three zero points. F non-linear term, F had three. F has three zero points, zero, seat, and one. And zero and one are two stable zero points, and seeter is an unstable one. For such a reaction diffusion equation with a nonlinear term F u, we have a, we can consider its traveling wave. And then this traveling wave is This travel wave is our travel front connecting two stable steady states, one and zero. And in this case, well no results results from Alosung Winberg and Fife and McLaughlin. They showed the existence of the traveling front, and they also show the unique. The uniqueness of the traveling font and the size of the speed of the traveling fonts. And they also show some stability results about the traveling farm. This is for homogeneous case. And now we want to consider the periodic case, especially periodic case. Specially periodic case. In this case, we also suppose that this F nonlinear term and the different rates A, both of them are one period. And then we also show that nonlinear term has a best stable form. We just consider the typical example is like this. X U is equal to U times equal to u times 1 minus u and times u minus zeta x. And here sita x is a smooth and one period function between 0 and 1. And in this case, we also have two stable steady states, 0 and 1. For this case, we also can define the positive wave of such a Laxon diffusion equation. Different equations connecting two stable steady states zero and one. This is the classical definition. A solution urtx equal to phi of the probate of the period of x minus c of l t and x over l. Here, if we have different If we have different periodic air, we have different traveling wave. And this conception, persistent traveling front, was introduced by Shigesada Kawasaki and Tamoto in 1986, and then for more general case by Chick Xin in 1991. And here in this definition, we always suppose the speed CR is not zero. And for the case that CR equals to zero, we have a stationary passing prompt, which is just a stationary solution. In other words, a steady state of the existence of the equation and with independence of t. And after then, for the this batch stable and specially periodic case, we want to consider the existence and the uniqueness and stability of the processing wave for this equation and consider the effects of the spatial heterogeneity. But for But for this case, even for the existent part, it's very difficult since there may be more than one unstable state state and more than one, more than two stable steady states of such an equation. But there were still some results first by Jake Shin in the case where I in the case where f nonlinear term independent of x and a is periodic but we are near to constants they give the existence of the passing traveling wave and by some abstract citing and some some some hypothesis on the Hypothesis on the linear stability. Jianfeng and Sha Chanzhao and Duko and G late and Mata No, they also gave the existence of the positive wave. There are a lot of other works in the past, I think, 20 years. And this, the following result is about result is about the existence of the percenting front in the case where the period error is very small. It's from the wave rating and the front army and the Shai Chanza's work. This showed if for this equation, we can consider it's a homogenization equation like this. We consider the average reaction under the And the harmonic mean of the diffusion, then we get the homogeneous equations. And in this case, if for this equation, it is a homogeneous bi-stable gaux-defined equation. For this equation, if C0 is not to zero, then for very small R, period R, the original equation period Periodic equation has a unique corpusity in front. And they also give some sympathetic behavior of the perceiving wave. That is, if the periodic L goes to zero, then the speed and the profit of the perceiving font also goes to the speed and the profit, respectively, of the homogeneous. Of the homogeneous homogeneous generalized equation, this existed result. And then for the periodic large, they also give some results about the existence of the positive wave. And our problem is how does the air when it is very When it is very large, affect the pacific forms. Here, just the scale of the space version of the MIDI. And for example, how does R affect the width of the positive font? Another thing is about the can we get some asymptotic behavior of a passing font when R goes to infinity. And before we explain. Before we explain our results, we first give some explanation of the concept of rounds. A traveling front is just a transition process from one steady state to another one. This concept also can be found in the definition of the transition wave. For example, from Bertig and Armen's paper in 2000. In 2012. And in this case, we just suppose these two state states are zero and one. And give any fixed data not the zero and the data very small. We consider the dirt front part of positive wave. It's like this. It's the tx, just the u of l t x between dirt and one minus dirt. one minus third and the family of this third front part is what we can observe for this transition process and we consider its space width of the dart from front path and the temporal width of the dart function path. We can give the definition. And then for fixed step we know that Know that these two wise are used to describe the scale of this transition process. And for fake style and any given delta less than zero from the definition of proceeding funds, this tool was finite. But what we want to know is how does this tool was depend on IL? Yes depends on L. In other words, how does the scale of the transition process depend on the scale of the space variation of the MIDI? And if for some dart, one of these two sites, these two wides are not fancy. As how to go to infinity, we see that the packet link. Say that the passing force flatten as R goes to infinity. Then our question is: whether the passing force flatten or are these two wise uniform bounded ER? This is our first equation. And then after we answer this equation, we also have some further questions. For example, the existence of the limit of the sp The limit of the speed. And another question is about a simple prototype behavior of the front and the prophet as the period error goes to infinity. Then we want to answer these three questions. First questions, I will answer. Questions, our answer is the following theorem: that the west, the front west in time and in space are uniform bounded. We can't give a uniform bounded. And in that word, the front does not flatten as R goes to plus infinity. This is our theorem. Now we give some proof of such theorem. Uh, serium, and uh, of course, here we only consider one part: the west in space and the west in time is similar. The proof of waste in time is similar. In fact, a classical method to give a uniform to solve this problem, to answer this problem, to give a uniform gradient estimate of like this. You are. Like this, URL X over URL and the URL R T over U R. But here we use another geometric method. In other words, the zero number arguments to replace the complicated gradient estimates. Here, now I introduce some results. Without some method of us. First, we give the concept of the number of the change of some function w on R. And we use ZW to denote the number of signs of the change of W. Here we do not use the number of zero points since there may be degenerate zero points. For example, points for example let's w x equal to sine x plus one then for this equation in our definition z w is equal to zero since this this w does not change the sign and then we also define the k plus one word of the with the typo epsilon one epsilon two to epsilon k k plus one here k plus one here epsilon one to epsilon k plus one is just consists consisting of plus and minus the sign plus and minus here which describes the sun change of w when here we just suppose the number of sun change of changes of w is equal to k which is less than is equal to k, which is less than infinity. And we also can compare the two different words of the sign change of different functions, like this. And for example, if the sign of changes of W is plus, minus, and plus, and the sign of minus and plus and the sign of the sign changes of V is plus minus plus or plus minus or minus plus or plus or just minus in this case always we hold that the word of the sign changes of V is a sub change sub subword of the sound of changes of W. changing of W. And we have the following lemma. If Wn goes to W locally uniformly, and Zwn is less than infinity, then Zw is less than the limit inf of Zwn. And we also give some results about the sun changes watch of Wn and W. And then from the From the classical standard results about the zero number discussion from Professor Martino and Professor Anderland, we can get the zero sun change number zero will decrease with decreasing as he increase. And then after that, And then after that, we can have the following lemma. One zero are two triple solutions of the following ODE. And that means one zero are two static states of our directly different equation. And for the other solution of this ODE. Solution of this ODE, we can get the cost number of WL and one and WL and zero. We can get a classification of these two classification of the cost number of WL with one and with zero. And then we And then we also can the number, the sign change number of WR minus such a high-site function. And then after that, we can get the positive wave UR is just the omega limit set of the hybrid set function. And then after that, And then after that, we have our main lemma about scroll number. Let's UL be a positive infrastructure. Then UL is a steep-paced intel solution. Especially, let's WL be a steady state of the reaction field increasing. In other words, the solution of such ODE, then the change number of your Of UR minus W L is less than or equal to one. Furthermore, if it's equal to one for some t belong to R, then they must hold that the word of sign change of UR minus W L is equal to plus and minus. And then let's And then let's r go to infinity. Then, by trying a sub-sequence, we can get limit u infinity, which is the intense solution of the limited equation locally uniformly. And this solution is also equation in T. And for this equation, at plus at plus at time time at plus and minus infinity is also a solution of the of such a kind of ODE that means your infinity at when time becomes the plus and minus infinity are the also the steady state of our. Also, the steady state of our limiter limiter Jackson-Field equation. And then such an equation, ODE, is a simple Hamiltonian equation, and the shape of any objects are well known. And in fact, we can compare the Z number of the U. the u infinity t0 with minus w infinity where w infinity is also is another solution of this ode and then after we can get which is larger than zero or which is equal to zero but the sign change in watch is equal to minus and plus but this This property also holds for where large L for URL. And then this conclusion for where large URL is this conclusion, the last conclusion contradicts to our main lemma for cross number. For sorry for the conflicts to For the contricts to contradict to this this lemma. So we found that the u infinity is just the traveling wave and the UR, the length of the width of the front of URL. Font of URL are uniformly bonded. This I will conclude. After that, we also consider the limits of the speed by using the results of the gutted in 1983. And we can get some results about the speed. C L go to some system. C dot is just uh the uh can make harmonica mean of the of the speed at an of the any frozen equation with the frozen coefficients and we also can get some results about the limited behavior or profit sorry i think i have no time so i stop here thank you thank you
