 Hello, can you hear me? I'm so sorry. I think I have been moving. Okay, you missed out. All right. So thank you, organizers, for inviting me to their invitation. And then I appreciate the opportunity to share with you some work on the development of some differential sampling methods for sampling in. Methods for solving info scattering problems from CEDIC meteor. So, this is a joint work with Fiora Bakuni from Roscoe University and Usam Hada. So, actually, this is a cumulation of a couple of papers, and we are still keep working on that. Nice. So, here is the layout. I first talk about I first talk about, mention a little bit about the formulation of the problems, and then sampling methods, classical sampling methods, and then the new methods that we have been developing. And I will end by some numerical results. Objective of our motivation of our work, it is we would like to reconstruct the defects from some from like From some, from like in a couple kinds of materials which have their periodiotic structures. And so, for example, here is some example. So, shock example gives you a view of defects in pedic media. But what we would like to do is a little bit different from that. So, I'm going to verify later. Later. However, we see that in those problems from TV media, so they are motivated, has been motivated by, it has been worked with by many, many authors. And I have listed here some works related to the reconstructions of fully patient domain or reconstruction of defects, but there we use many, many measurements. Many, many measurements are like I'm going to say a lot of data set. So, our work is a little bit different from that, which is, let me see, their objective. It is, we want to reconstruct their defects. So, only the default without any prior knowledge of their PADR declares. So, suppose that we have a Suppose that we have a theory domain in case if there is exist a defect which is included in one component. So with classical sampling method, then what we can reconstruct is the fully domain, which is also show periodic. In that case, then we cannot determine the defects. Determine the defects. So, objective of our work is we want to determine the defects, either only the defect D0 or the components of the PAD domain, but that have connection with D0. So either the defects included in this figure or in this component or had non-empty intersection of the component. And we try to zoom as less data as possible. Then, what we set up for the problem is we use some incident plane wave, stand on the upward side. And here we consider the peric layer, which is penetrable. And then we measure the response, which is a scattered wave, on another side. Another side. So, using this measurement, we want to identify the D space D0, which is inverse problem that we were interested in and we will work on. So, for that, we develop based on the classical sampling method, a new sampling method, and we call it a differential sampling method. So, I have, I give here some Some references for the classical sampling method include linear sampling, general linear sampling, factorization, and so on. All right, so let me describe a bit more detail on Algebra's problem, but here I try to get to do not provide many formula. So, for our problem, in case we have a fully In case we have a fully infinite periodic domain and work with an infinite periodic domain, then it's still an open question for us. However, for technical reason, then what we do is we consider m period. And then the m period here is if m here can be large enough such that m period contains the period. Contain the period where the defect D0 is located in. And because the other period, except the ones contain defects, they are periodic. Therefore, the boundary on the left and the right side is subjected to the periodic condition. And therefore, it's reasonable to assume that we can. That we can extend it M period here to a PADL to be PADSCT. So, what we are interested in, what we will work on, it is only M period. And we try to find the defects within M period here. So we don't care about the period outside, those outside of this M period. And therefore, even if we periodize Deodice, but it did not affect any results for our reconstruction. So, this is a technical thing. So, what we do is once we periodize those layers, then the layers now become ML periodic with a period of the revised domain. It is ML with L either side of the L is the size of the original PD domain. We use ML periodic incident plane wave, which is given by this form. So this actually, it is a linear combination of a couple mode when we take Fourier transform of incident wave generated by point source. However, once we have the same thing, However, once we have the ML periodic incident wave, then the scattered wave also ML periodic because of the ML periodicity of the revised domain. In addition, in order to ensure that the scattering wave is going out, then we impose a radiation condition. Actually, it's right there. Condition. Actually, it's written condition. However, with the periodicity, then the radiation condition is known that as Rayleigh radiation condition, which means the scattering wave outside of the layer, it can be represented by this radar expansion and the blue line here. Blue line here, as you see, is the blue color here. It is right-like coefficient. So, um, I did not mention before that if you consider layers, the layers here mean this support. Well, I should say that the layers here characterized by the N, index N, which we also call refractive index, and here periodic. And we consider the node NP, which is the refractive index of the original periodic domain. And support of N minus 1 and also NP-1 is now located in a layers which is limited by two horizontal lines, which is equal to L i 2 equals to h and to negative h, as you see in the figure. And therefore, we can the outside of these layers, then the n and n p equal to 1. Okay? So the refract, so the scalic wave can be written as this radio expansion outside the layers. Outside the layers, as you can see here, that means with absolute value of i2 greater than h. All right, now because of this representation, then the given of the measure of the scatter wave, so the scatter wave we measure on only on gamma h. So the measurement of scattering wave, it now can be replayed. Replied equivalently by the right leg coefficient with corresponding to I2 here equal to h that we care about up the side, on the top, we don't care about on the bottom. And the in our inverse problem now can be reformulated a little we change a little bit. It is, we given the right line sequence corresponding. Corresponding to the measurement on the top. We don't use the scatter wave, but we use the Rayleigh coefficient. So you can also imagine that Rayleigh coefficient here, exactly the Fourier transform of the measurement. And from that, we want to reconstruct only the defect D0. D0 here is support of N minus N. Part of n minus np, but we don't know n and we don't know np as well. What we know only the size of the period, which is L, and we know that the zero here located in only one period. That is a problem that we will investigate. So I am going to clarify a little bit later why the classical sampling method. Why the classical sampling method cannot do it. And why, so that's why we have to develop a new method. So, however, let me say in advance that the new methods that we will develop based on building an indicative function, let's say capital IC, which allows to characterize or To characterize or to identify if a sampling point Z, as you see the figure, is outside or inside the defects that we want to reconstruct. For example, in here, then there are an indicator function capital I allow to distinguish the red points and the black points. So the red points we keep, and the black points we don't need it. We don't need it. By doing that, then once we can build an indicator function capital I that satisfies this, then by plotting the image of function of the indicator function i, then we have an image of the defects. So that is the principle of the method. So remember that the all right, remember that the All right, remember that our measurement now is the series, radio series u F generated by some incident wave, which is index of the incident wave. And L is index a Rayleigh coefficient. And for that, we build an indicator, sorry, we introduce a measurement operator. Introduce a measurement operator. We call it operator N that maps the identity A, which is a series to a linear combination of the series and the Rayleigh sequence. So now, once we know the measurement, we know the Rayleigh series, that means we know the measurement operator. Then you can interpret the inverse problems either. Interpress the inverse problems easier, like we want to reconstruct the defect D0 when we know the measurement operator. All right, so let me go back to the private question. Why classical sampling methods do not work? So as you see, our measurement, which is a scattering weight, which brings information of the support, of the inclusion. So, or we call the scatter. If you also say schedulers, so scheduler here can be an inhomogeneous medium. That means it can be very complex. Now, because the measurement brings information of the full domain. That's why what we based on the measurement, basically we can reconstruct everything. What is you can recover back? Things, what you can recover back the full domain. Then, by exploding the singularity of the green function, assorted it to X sampling point X, then we using that, then we could try to characterize the range of operator measurement operator and using this. Using this function test. That is, this argument test, capital Phi Z, which is the right layer coefficient of the ML Pedicle functions associated with the function Z, then it belongs to the range of output N if and only if the point Z inside the domain belongs to the domain D. Otherwise, then D is outside. That is outside. However, also, another interesting when we study the uniqueness of the solution, of the image problem, then that requires the frequency k. K is the frequency associated to the incident wave that we send. It cannot be a solution of trans. A solution of transmission eigenvalue problem that gives a link between inverse problem and transmission eigenvalues. In addition, this the solution of transmission eigenvalues also involves in the reconstruction. As you can see in the following theorem, it is if in case the agreement capital phi z belongs the range, then The range, then the solution of this involving alpha edge, sorry, image of this sequence, which is a solution of this equation, also converge to the second component of the pair, which is a solution of the transition eigenvalue problem. So, what is operator H? H is the second, it is the second operator when we It is a second operator when we factorize operator n in terms of g and h. So I just like here to split the idea, but so I try to skip a couple equations and formula, therefore I do not provide operate 8 and G, but it is a basic idea, okay? All right, because of that, as I say, do things the fully, the full measurement, which we construct everything. We reconstruct everything. Therefore, if defects here include it in one component, then basically we cannot see that is that it's defect or not. So for the differential sampling methods that we have developed, based on the key ideas that we extract from the measurement, a new A sub-sequence and they play additional data. What is mean? You can see the figure like if we view the measurement, full measurement at a matrix, a zip matrix given by every point, then the sequence that we extract represents it by only the red. By only the red points, corresponding to the index Q plus Jm of their incident wave and Q plus L M of their Rayleigh sequence. And we use both NQ here, that means the sub-sequence and their original sequence as a measurement. And from that, we deconstruct. We deconstruct B phase. But key point here is NQ here, also no, because we don't need an additional measurement. We can have it from N and therefore only the set of Rayleigh sequence that we have an original, only that is our measurement for the inverse problem. You see in this figure that what That what and Q and what the sub data that we have the extra give. It does not give exactly the period domain, but it gives something. The full period domain with the copies of defaults. That gives us an idea. Idea it is, we want to. Idea it is we want the z from the n and n q to build an indicator function. That helps not only to eliminate every point outside of the background of D, but also eliminate every point of the PD domain, which not which do not have any non-empty intersection with the Section with the defects and study the uniqueness of the solution come up. So, lead to study a new in theory transition problem. We get non-standard because this one involves for the standard transition eigenvalue problem, then this par must be zero. Then here we have this paradigm zero. So, study it a little bit more complicated, not a little bit, more complicated than the original. Complicated than the original standard problem, but let me see, but we are able to do it. And the value k such that the homogeneous problem here does not have non-trivial solution. And then we call it Newton's and eigenvalue problem. So let me see, let me provide the results for the study of the inverse problem. Of the inverse problem, transition eigenvalue problem is under some assumption of the refractive index n, then we are able to prove that the set of new in theory transmission problem as transmission eigenvalue, it is discrete. And it can be empties, but if not empties, then it accumulates only as infinity and also. And also, if k is not a new transmission eigenvalue problem, then the solution of this transmission eigenvalue problem depends continuously on the data. That means phi and psi here. All right, so at the end, due things to sequence or two data. Sequence or two data and q, we are able to build an indicator function given by this point, but um capital I. Well, the formula is a little bit complicated for now, but let me, but based that we use, let me say, involved in the anfa, which the series anfra, which also. Series anta, which associated to the agreement path capital Phi Z and the original measurement operator. Also, a relative sequence of capital phi z q, we q here involves in the subsequence, indexed subsequence that we studied before, and q, which is the neofield. Is the neo-field measurement, also the measurement data, but with the new, with the sub-sequence that we consider, and also another sequence, which is solutions given by the metal operator N, and also the argument associated with the psychiocasi periodic, which is capital physical here. Capital physique here. Using that, we are able to build an indicator function capital I and phi, thus allow to eliminate not only every point outside the p domain, but also every component. We can do not empty intersection with the defects. Okay, and that is main results we have. So, let me show you here some examples in 2D problem. So, you can see. Problem. So you can see that the red points, this is a component defects. Otherwise, periodic domain, even if very complicated domain, but again, we can reconstruct the periodic defects. Some interesting reductions will be in 3D. So, which is the C, this component defects. Defects and the reconstruction give me the defects here, which show also the paper. In case of the defects have a non-empty section with one component, this not show me exactly the shape, but it gives it show me that in which component the defect is located in, and also it had non-empty. And also, it had non-empty intersection because that is some small piece come up. So, we'll see the difference from the second example and the third example. The first example corresponding to the case, the defect completely outside periodomain. And the second example is the defect have non-empty intersection with one component. Here, it missing components, then it gives me also a missing component of the deconstruction. However, the However, the last one is the periodic, certain defect located in the circle, in the ball. And the reconstruction gives me that in which component, the defect located in, and also it shows me that in which period as well. Because if you compare to the different period, Period, then this one is bigger than the other one, which shows me that not only in which component, but also in which period. Yes, I end here, and thank you for the attention. Any questions from the audience? So, do you need a new picture number?
