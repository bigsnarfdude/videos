 University of Northwestern United States in the National Union of Pusan Union. Today, we have a little investigation, but like this is a group that has a much diversity, and people of statistical problems that final questions, and so that has made a artificial intelligence, and there are artificial intelligence that remains in graphics, whereas mathematics, well, if you have. Mathematics, but if you have that, you have a mathematical example that the artificial intelligence does not work, which is the product of the GPT and notes. Mathematica is to work. So, for the tallest, but vidures of type of mathematics that the allows or live in these time. So, voyage explicaries. Voy explicare. Voyages, voyage explicare. Well, it's 101 because in this one cousin basic son, one is like introducing the operas of the population. Yeah, okay. So in this campo, we study the operation of summer operation. But what significance is, so we are saying that they have a conjugate, and other oja, and when the grave is grave, the final vegetable results. So we want utilizing arbole to understand the operation of suma y para que esto tene. And for this ten, please do, here two, three, and if you got it, and if you have two 30, the finale results because I know that the susceptible issue. So, I'll tell you that many things because I want to codify the notion of susceptibility. And the eso is that you can study operations vinyl operations, which is very abstract to the. And here for example, and I want to communicate, well, you are not important that we have resulted. And I think the more important part of the province of agriculture is somewhere because what happens when one has a Here are narrow y loses inheritance. And if you create a species distinct species, if you create, well, here we have the operation of injury, where you are two operations binaries, and in this case, I have a turnaround operation. What do you do? What do you think with a composition of summary, no? Ok. And I think what the second is proprietary important, it has an injury. Well, one. Well, one operate. One operator consistent with their operations in Arias, and when they say here, I think that are the same with where relations of associativity, and how it is. So, in the employer, or in So, in the employer, or consistent all these, and we also inherited, I have here. I want you to find two vinyl operations, and I have a personal option. This aquí corresponding to the great and two operations, and when they have to do it, So this operation is that this statistical definition all actions. There are actions of the voice, and this doesn't operate as a meeting for work of Bormann, Bo, and Peter May, and with the application of Mathematica. No, what do you think is that one can have compositions complicated, and in the meantime, I think it's a good idea. And in the midst, you can apply a permutation of centralized, and that is like others to rival, and there are no mandate that you have, but the promise of it. Well, it's operating, the result that all your terrors with us in that operate. So, everything that I record that operates consistently with operations. Consistency with operations, like the case of arbole, and I have a component operations. So, if you are a porcher, a conjuncture here, and if the internet, or to jump here, exist of endomorphism. My operation scenario are scenarios. And the component in its unarried and satisfaction conditions that are addiction. The other example are the same and associated. They are associated and cumulative associations that principles, and today within them. This is a time that everyone has, and we are very autocarbon, so that today they are a little motivation because we have the possibilities. For the people that consider the space of three points, with a topology of Alexandro that goes to the explicitly, So, in other porous symbols, there are this space. So, not for this symbol, there are this space with points, and the dog is topology. So, their question is the continuous function that will be. There, and by example, the identity continues. Because, with the function that is irregular, and that is here. And that is here. But it is not. So this rotation is not continuous in this space. So we define a nord that means that one can juggle in one place in our cuenta que las functions continuous functions in this space area. They are the functions that preserve in the order. It is deciribal that the function valor of a valor that is better than FDV. So, we know that the nos estásur que naturalment de la topology de l'espace. Well, that is a positive. Imagine if you have three. Juan que esco 8 music nouvea mathéticas, Mario que esco nouveen musico yes en política. Andrea que seven mathematicians contaduria. So, you can compare the performance as Juan Y Mario in the music class, puedes compar how Juan Yandrea en el clasad mathéticas, but uno pemos comparara Mario con Andrea because no tiene en clases in class. So, this is a conjugate with a nordial nord where you can share some elements. Tuesdays compare some elements to it. And that is very like one work with programmas tourists that two programmes are not related and not dependent on one of the other. But the problem is the veg to correct. So that is when veterans can correct. So these northern partials is very programmation and in the bases of data. And in the bases of data, it has completed, so that no puerc elements. So, don't enjoy the part of the abstract, the conjugate, value. But I prefer not to por the topological part. Topological is the entire notamos with this symbol to conjunt that point with a northern line. That more, and what is that the positions are a screen with one topology Alexandro and that the functions that preserve the function are the continuous functions? But it is a pero este quieterme in this part. Now, Ah, because the little thing in the real life is grammar. And that graphic that will be a point is connected with the successor. Well, with some element that this is equivalent to it. So, if I can, this representation information, and this is basically work. So, we work with Jace, and the supreme work of Richard, but for motivos of presentation, this disclaimer of rights. And in this language, if one, for example, this one can see some operation in possible, and going to this position, and going to this positive, and what is the value of the story? But this will go in the first place, the signal segment, and the last thing that is, and now going to the signal relations, two elements here can compare, and it can compare here, and a lot of copies can compare usando the relationship. But comparing usando la relación que teníamos engrande. So, this merise que este amigo es el más pequeño de todos. So, this reveals the most two, and that tradition agreed these two lines, this more, it is more than this, and this is more than this, but here you have this more. So, it's congruent. So, the sum of lexicographic is tiene a positive, and it is entering. Base that entrusts as a point in the positions, substitutes, and convenience relations of order relations, locally, preserving the relationships that have relationships and globally the possible great to indicate how important. So, examples and no, no, the regular spicy, the regla dice and well, the regular explicitly here is the bad. In the point, a new one that two elements compared, if you could compare in one of them, because here this mark is two, then this is to compare because it could compare. Or I could compare two elements, and one copy, and the other copy, and that looks here. I told a I am a point, and so this is in this part, this in this part, and in the greatest men who are queen that there. So, the regular reglafica allows in the possessions as operations. Ah, well, here I have the point, and this has been queer. Here, I see that this point is me that the element of immediately transitivid. Okay, exactly. In principio, it is here that you can have the squitas, figures cuales. Fí este vai para para ya para. That is this. There is good. But the important thing is that to define a operation, if I have, and I have in positions, obtain a new position. So, I had a operation in Area. Okay. Voyages are two families and positions, the positive parallel. The possibility parallel is a positive position of tomorrow, you order linear, and applied the junta. Well, that's it. If I have this, and other possible positions, because here in a relation? Here in a relationship, the copies are not interactive. So, one, no, there are a new relationship, it's union of it. And the operation is the ordinary superior here, because the relationship we are. So, the ordinal What is that evaluated in two possibilities? And I think that everyone who has copied it is a memorandum that all this copy. So in the maximum, of the veteran that the minimum de la directa. So if this point that toddled. So, if you want to lose, this points better than all the people. So, this is the sum of ordinary people, and this is the union, and when it comes to opinions like that. Union of the point with a point, and the other estos memes that we are. What is this and things? So, this is possible for me, and what can describe. Poset y se puer describir de tumarcadenas y appléar la núndiscunta, y la sum ordinal es unier parallelo. Vamos hablara situra vein by standard fund, standard fundo. Who is a positive parallel? Well, usually the grammar is vertical, and when the vertical como leader, but. But horizontal solita que da este. But we cannot produce that this position doesn't describe how combination of agrarian agreements and applied union discussion and their ordinary discussion. So it is not all their positions parallel. The sigma possesses that the family of possibilities wanted. The number provides indigenous groups in the continent of America, and what we are working with with these positions can be separated much to a pulsaritas with no. So, we investigamos do not possibit and provide viral art. So, the viral sense, we are abused or these para. Or this para es uno nor y nor record mucho la velles de culture. So that is controversial. So this is virica, all and applied two operations. The ordinary operations and the value in Power Cu yet. And what is the operating tier 1 possible? And this is the pensamos for the people, topic here as regards a manica. Well, you can see in terms of the grammar of grace the effect for example, here we go to this aquí tengo point of square. And the application operated, to see the minimum, we have a maximum independent application, and this ordinary order, so everything that is, all these, and the application operator, etc. So, voyage obtaining this type of diagram. This is a toddler. And we are afraid in the operations. Voyage tomorrow and Voy tomorrow and miero tin manzanas. So, when the entrails in a peradorate, when you have a porter, what is the ordinal because it is two entrances? So, if we are with the stress here, and we apply the operations, vascular effects. And that has got to be, and I think that for caper, but in affecting many, and with all. And you have here two, and the six of them are gravitated, the positive. So, they are not able to think that these factorization of my positions in terms of compositions of their lexicográficas, for example. When the center are querenas, well, The operation has operations, the conjugate vinyl with the vinyl can have these bifurcations or operations viral. With this definition, I utilize the composition of injury, if you are interested in politics. If they are interested in topology, one can see that the operation of inheritance is a continuum function, all topological spaces, and the inheritance continuum. If you will, and everything to trace all, but the important of the operates are the algebra. So, we have a conjugate or operating if existing function of my abstract operation. Mi opera abstracta to the endomorphism of the confuent. So, if we record this, I have an operation mysterious operation, and the function that will be operational for the function of the enable. So, this is the realizing misfunctions in some conflict. This are definitions of categories where not only a misoperacion is good functions that will enable it. Day in there. We're going to see how it's about the opera of parallel. Here we have parallel. And the seed that has two operations, so there is a concept, only operate, if I have a function that you will see, and another function that you will have in there. Tales that is associated. Associativa commutative and this only associative because the year discussion is not important, so it is mutative. And no queen the year discussion associated. This provides the two care because the two care is associated and port. So I have a junta, and also two operations, the pedo una que es associative association, the other que associative. And don't speak a more. I don't have a other relation between it. That is a serious parallel. And that is what this is an operation in my conjugate operation. Because I don't know the nada. No digits were vectorial. Topology or not. Simple 10, where my operations are realized. So, in circumstances, I work with a lot of more influence of what? This is not a group more elementary group. And the argument about the operating distinct because there are a positive parallel. That significantly there is a operation mysterious and that. Mysterios and that many operations don't see how composition of these two operations vinaries. So, it is a great option to put operations. Because that for a particular problem that this can describe these two. So, if there are higher structure, Well, you can see the operation in Area, and then this doesn't have a factorization in terms of binary terms, a quaternion operation that you can simplify in terms of my operations. The location. And there, we are going to see. But that operations that are one operations news that they can see, if you think about the terminal, their multiplication. There are new vases that provide the topology of the positions. Exacto. Exacto because, for example, is the Union discipline of here as well. That the Union discipline, and this level, in the cadence, the relationships that we have, but in the possessions, no. But in the poses no, no, assuming it is for some algebra we have distributed or in general, not the next generation in some moment, but not this practice, but important in a moment is utilizing the malleable. Well, because I am a serial, and our series, and we are not the serum, so not a platform because the vacuum is a little bit together, ten north. All that has well. So, the digital queue of the operating push. The idea that the arguments of the operating positions are a little more complicated that the arguments were parallel because there are positions that they can exclude. And we will see a simple algebra on the possibilities, and the example is migrable to combinatorial combinations. So, it can lead to the Stanley defined this symbol as the number of maneras of etiquette to the positive numeros of the verse. If I can do their point of 20 managers for etiquette, the number entruno. If my pose is the three, well, for the tiquetas, you can preserve this relationship. If you don't want to go to the tiquet of my. The etiquette of here the etiquette of Grega. So, if you have three points of when they are numerous of the numbers, they treat them, and the mando here to have your stress. And when you see all these, I will say that you can polynomial in this variable, which is the what is it? There are a plateau to finance. A platica to the final platform and if one wants to calculate for example, omega, we don't know with example of three of the three, one can one and wijarce in our possibilities values of the first point, and so the first point is here from one sign. And the signal points, so much of this maso load, and the seroba, well, this ignore maso are not, and so this number total of possible etiquette. So, there we go, a iterada, for the case of integral in the case of these numeros, but. Numerous algae forces, they are topology that will curify their iterators, but not as relations with the platform, but what if it is there for us? So, these are the polynomials of Stanley and not that a little more work consider potential. So, definitely the series order because Stanley defined the possible order, so the series of ordinance. The series of ordinary functions generated from the polynomial of order, during a positive para character the coefficient of the numerous maneras of tiquete to the positive numerous numbers. So if I calculate the coefficient in essimo, then the series that is studying this para point the signal is if the possibility is a three-car and calculated coefficient, and so three care societies. And so three sociamos is potential. So, to be able to have a series of potential and I want the series of orders, order, are not about the operating positions. That is significant, and if you have a positive confidence, and in series of orders, I will directly, and the refinery as the series of lexicographic. Of lexicographic. In our categories, these operates, and so we are working on combinatoria. That significant thing for nature is definitions cortas and that is not. That is with this, how computable, but what we are defining here is a perfect queue unposed to one endomorphism of the series of order. But we can say more explicitly. What passes with the union? So, the number of tickets, the union was produced from the tickets one por el product of the tickets elotro. In esignifica, that the action of the union in series of ordinance is the product of the. The product that we have complex. And with a little like one that action of the ordinal in two positions, in the series of ordinary two possibilities, it is the product of what. This is trivial. This is various veces, but with distinct language in distinct, so in terms of polynomials of order provider here for the name. So, we can distinctly prove, but the first problem here, and I promise first, in good. And, in particular, how the ricochet and operations is operating that tengua calendar. This operation that tenuous, the operation. This operation that has been the operation of the operation can factor in terminal union and the ordinal queue. I have a discussion with a point, and a ordinary minimum, and the maximum ordinal. So, how do I say the action of the sum of terminals? But here products, and here product coach, product coach, I could calculate. And that is, so I think with myself, and how myself, I think the factorization, I think, I mean, the sum ordinary effect, and so I can calculate this, and we have a computer. It's only there. I expand this area and the coefficient of etiquette is positive or numerous. But this part of the combinatorial, this is what people combinatorial gusta. Well, because here, tiene sentiro como de este diagrama. Yego esto? Ok. Usualmente la gententos a computadoras pero siyo en quien este diagrama, lo puedes. Yes, I agree, the puedes enceram, what we say. Now, conform working in these objects, we are queuing away the opera because the actual position with lexicographic, we say in many ways, but the series of orders are also a definition of positions in the series of orders, and no explain much, but we have interest for the political. For the political part, it is decir the action of the union is like the summary, and the action of the two denotes converted convex. This interesting because the people in summarizing products and strategies is a product. But these are things that are broken, and remanufacturing is a mathematical India. The mathematics of a book that has demonstrations. So, how text where people identify and if the person does not explain this because when we go in, there remains a lot, and confess that you have to inglater, the robot, this has been for the. This has been por la interaction inglater and India in that. So, grama proposito is daba ideas, daba historias, suns, y evitabionar sus trucos para que nos peran aquitar. The problem is that they are more like the more and more loss. What is that existence and? And certain numerous rational numbers are the function set of presentations. One of the most important functions in mathematics and for the modern definition is very difficult to work with. And the people know that 3 rationales, but we don't know if it is 5 irrational. So, that is very complicated. And the And what I want to scribe is that the summatory, the sum of the summinita utilized all the sets, well, cases the energy, a sum of infinite. Sum a finita de ma suno de yogua uno estáne ma rational. So this rajan, because here have an infinite, and that can simplify a finite. Well, not the proof, and that strategy, but we have identified the. And if the children of maps of structures that preserve the structure of algebra or the possibility, I have my position here and have a para opera directly, and that with lots where the final porosity values. So, the functions are an argument. Well, the values, the set function in numerous queue, I explain a pronounced, but I also have the. But I also have the structure of archives or deposits. I don't know how to see it, if I have here my political organization, I combinatoria of these elements that is combinatoria now in set. I have the combination, I provide the combinatoria of the valor settings algorithms. I can do that formal. So, everyone is a historian. Hilar the Today, the tomato function set and evaluated. The numbers that are conjugated, we have the values of the function set. Well, when the values of set are irrational, it is the function set, valid, especially if irrational. Ok. So, what combinatorial cues we do not put and in our. And in our language, I want to say that we are the only point, and the polynomials of order. This work of Ramanuja, 1992, is that valente, work with the union of points, associated orders, and there the association with the society. The work of EART is a political society a series of potential, DoCOVIC that one potential value, Stanley who is the society of Orden, reconcile that. Reconciliation that is cardinal where a positive polynomial and a rational and what we do, the society is a polytope una served and we are valor. So, we are clear all these ideas of a manera queue, this more indefinite and preserve the structure of algo, the structure of algorithms, but on the opera deposit, and one of the things that we. One of the things that we explicitly dad finito the golly associated with numero. This valor is tomato suma, están como como oramenya, tomato suma alten mante, but the possibility is what changes the number of maneras in the numeros of lunar numbers and multiplicado por está seta. So Well, the interest is that the equation is real, but we calculate utilizing identities that contramos, so it is a identity of theory of numerous queue proven to be structured combinatoria and more structure because the language of categories allows different champions. So, here where the categories are not information combinatoria y la mandan to enumerate. Combinatoria and numerous. The proves that we are going to combinatoria and numeros. Ah, this identity for the people who have made the artificial intelligence, you are still valued that we do not know. And that for the computer, you have problems, no? And you are all. And I think that one type of distance. So, the possibilities in different software private software, and if they are not an occupation, but everything is working. The part of the children, we made it. The part of the member is to ensure this notion. So, I was at the World Front Technology Conference, a conference of Matemática, and context, we are for the people of programmación, resolving a problem or more difficult to verify a problem. If you want to say, this is a solution, you can verify that the solution for a problem because the So, the two and they verify that they have a good term, and the proof that I programmed, the theoretical project that we say, but I think for me, a live, because I haven't learned this many times, and they have to verify, but I verify that the identity of CIRTA and in particular, utilizing, if I do not. If I do not know the polynomial of Stanley, and the ebinomial, so this number can be explicitly like a finite. This definitely, like a infinite, but if you identify the same coefficients that do it in here, but in the vase ebinomial, you have this number. So, there are many that are also much curious because. Moses will be much curious because the original formula of identity. This original formula that allows the formality. But who have not very useful because I don't know that this is what converges, but not and that combinatorial cortex. So these masks. This more amigable, but it will work that way, but it is more than the directament the relationship with combinatorial relations. Because these numeros provide a triangulation in a political colour, we have a political convaloration. Well, not the push there, but we are the conversation in this direction. When one is the general generation, in case of possession, And there one is the political order. And so if the formula can be two cadena, but a triangular signal. At the case of the signal el 15. Today, topological checks, when defined simplicities, in the order, and the variable in the order, that is one role. There records that the order is part of the structure of the topological structure. And we have here what Stanley, but we are confident generated, we are the series of order and here generated. And here gener, and in this case, in particular, I've elemented and para la casena, but here we do the setas, the functions, and genera for the casodos depending on 3 menos, minos unoberred, and in general to the cake in the manda to set. De la manda a seta de cá masuno, menos uno, menos uno sobredos a la cá masun. That one loses quiver más enci con setas de jurébébécé, but explicitamente. So, I estima table whereías like the operations van pasando y also quietemos como los elements generados vampasando, de uno a loto, preserving the coefficients. What is more here? This coefficient, and yes that will be the coefficients. So, you have the coefficients. And all these and categories that convince different camps with different structures. So, the dichotomy that you can see are the operating basars in the Guyarrico. The races because these operations are very operation. And ten Guyarrico y calculates the series of orders. So, these indices preserve. Indices preserve information topological information. In 2002, and 25 pants and series passes by topos. So, in 1940, well, y topological referral to the grammar of Jace. So, y este y baser estama de la major query maximal en el poset. This is the number of points of the positive point. And this difference is the number of manijas, and I have my positions. Tengo mi poset. This number of eujas, etc. So, titus meadas, tú calculas, la serden pues yo tengu algo de información sobre el poset que origino esceria. Yes, puede eruti, porque bueno. I les digit que poset, the numero explicito, but if this numero, do this number, per tenesa tu conjunto, seera que este un elemento entra. Elementary into the element, so dad is numerous, and I mecho en los indices and what the poses, in which managers who have this number of points. So, you are in between the possibilities and calculating coffee, there is a very popular queue in the topological proposals, which has been and solo queen with PK. So, optimize the use or restrict the use of a positive queue of this element. And for the last time, we have this idea that significant idea, the notion of order with this unpreparer, a preprint, but what we want to do is first. Cono. It is irrational. This is what everyone are irrational, but more aggressive linear combination of the other irrational. No, however, but we will function that from this space of polynomials with interrational to the real estate injectives. No, we are going to do that. But we will equivalently in the future. In the future, these are other managers to attack this problem that is a problem very important in numerous problems. So, well, that is equivalent, but we don't have a good idea. So, mejoras in that idea of the valor set, for a ribal and bowl, to see that there is a number of infinite numbers of valor in Paris. If it is valuable in Paris. Setas se valoras en impares that are independent, but not in cual. Or there are numerous infinitesum of impairments to irrational, but no pornosols. In particular, we are irrational or not. And in this term, I want to say the target is business un object in the composition of it. In the composition, you have to be tubes and the components for the river, but other tubes. Well, there are operations of conceivable concepts, and my market, and if you can, we trust that if certain tubes and some change, a solution operated, it is a conjunto derivative, it is a conjugate derivative of the LIDAR, it is a conjunto differential, or example. So, here study is the same as yes. Studento is with the tenures where we can inherit a word where you have the sum of them and studies the students of this parent. But if you know in case of the possibilities, it is a whole notion of order that is our operations mysterious operations. If you think in the tubes, that is a large tenet differential. So, you know, some geometric queue can. And here when we are with this, I'm interested in the possibilities, and I don't know who combinatorium will be numerous. There are campos. So, yes, one of those are the references. And thanks.  We worked with the function of mobile function because we are y integrated when we continue composed, the function of mobiles is the correct function, and it is a softening result, but if it is important, and the correct man depends on this what species, movies species. And the second result that has particular para cartoons. Ah, what do you say? Well, I algo que well. Had me ordering my city. When you have this series generated. Uno tiene esta series generadoras el polynomio de Stanley es polynomio de jar, pero shifted. So passar is que la series of series of orden se can describe in the basic ER, but there is multiplication, and what multiplar pork. So this relationship between the basis of ERAR and these polynomials. In particular, these coefficients is also a vase. This bases are biejes because the first article of Stanley, but with ours, you have a polynomial that has values with interrational concerns, tires can describe the binomial polyps, and that definitely is based. So, that is a basic bija, but it is different from the basis of the vectors and vectors. So, that's a vase distinct. One can make a other and what this vase is with a triangulation utilizing exclusion. But there are information there. What in our case are we with all marriage because we don't have popular? For the port of order, and if we lose, and that are distinct because well, described that type of information, and I dig this equipment and set it, and this, well, we have to go, that is like it. So, this positive socio. So, this positive society interval, the quadrato, and that is a triangulation of two triangles, but these controls the diagonal, but the diagonal. So, the coefficients will be two and a half. Tengo una triangulation, the number of simplicities maximal yet the number of intersections, and the number of three intersections. So, these coefficients will record topological information of a triangulation.  There are good utilizar how do we. Not set on the CCC. Okay. Are you not figuring out an algebra over the opera? Esteca. But we don't want to sera una este pregunta vierta porque nosoto vemos de categorías y nos a cado este que. But the relation exact significance coefficients precise proven y No, I que los Criben is the opposite version. If no, we will see nothing, but we have to pray. That passes and sets in Paris and that independently set two, for example. All the situation. Here what we say is: maximum simplicity, that you define the majority, and then the double intersections that define, and here that. And here that is made more, and we can carculate the stall, that are the coffee. But they are the interesting things that are covered by the recess, but the significance of these in terms of policy and this location to a significant explicit. When I was mi algebra, I took the. My algebra, I tomorrow the como que shifted for a rational. So, I also have to go to the people with no secret values. But I distributed structure to everything. So, not differential. In particular, the marriage that one independently is, but we are two irrational. And we are apart from a lot of these, but the interests that we have. Well, we are because important. We are because important, that all manera when the Norden simplicity simple enlord. So, if the manera que defines your object, there are northern escondido, we are endomorphisms that are induced. So, how do we do a cremos that definitely depends on ah, for example, that structure. Okay. Most pregnant por parto delidos speaker. No, well, you can terminate the session of the tenos the activity and for all the public.
