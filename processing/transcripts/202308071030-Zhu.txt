Yeah, thanks. So it's my great pleasure to introduce our next speaker, Jonathan Chu from the University of Washington. Is it the right? Yeah, that's the right order, right? And we'll talk about distance comparison for curve shot as well. All right. Thanks, Dean. Thanks, Denny. Good to be here. I guess I only have 40 minutes, so I should just get into it. Get into it. And we'll see how I, yeah, I guess it's abbreviated from what I've given this talk before. So we'll see how that goes. It's all very flexible. Feel free to interrupt and discuss anytime. So yeah, I want to talk about curve shortening for today. So I'll have some standard abbreviations. And I think everything I talk about is going with Matt Langford. Go ahead with Matt Langford, Sophia. Okay, but in any case, so curve shortening flow, for me, I'm only going to consider embedded curves. So let's write the gamma t. Again, they're all curves and And only consider the case where they live in a remoteing surface. Okay, and so what makes it a curve-shortening floor is that they evolve by their curvature. Okay, so this is the standard thing. The velocity is exactly the curvature vector. So for me, that's minus the curvature. So, for me, that's minus the curvature scalar times the unit normal. I guess I usually draw a picture here. So I have my standard potato. And again, so we're moving sort of inwards there, inwards there. Maybe this one is concave up. So it's moving slightly outwards, slightly outwards here, and so on. So hopefully this makes some sort of. This makes some sort of sense. And I guess the propaganda for this flow is that it's the gradient flow of the arc length. So, just easy calculation says that the length evolves is minus the curvature squared. And again, so this is our curvature is really sort of the gradient here. Cool. Okay. Okay, so again, probably, I know there's people who study mean curvature flow and such here, including myself. And so usually we don't do curves because curves were somehow solved at least in R2, right? So the behavior in R2 is known by Gage Hamilton and Grayson. So if you So, if you start with an embedded curve, embedded closed curve, I guess, simple closed curve, and you start in just the plane. Okay, then it's known that you just keep flowing until it doesn't. And you know that at that final time. You know that at that final time, it just looks like a single point and it looks like a round point, right? So just before the final time, it looks very much like a circle. Is that clear to everyone what we mean by a round point? Well, I guess it was probably faster to just tell you. So again, this means that if I rescale. Again, this means that if I rescale this guy by the appropriate scaling factor, this thing genuinely converges to a round. Okay, so that's sort of solved, but I think I've already hinted at what the non-trivial part is, which is to look at the same flow, but for other settings. Okay, so it's always possible to change the ambient manifold to a Change the ambient manifold to a different surface. And I guess the concrete one that I want to tell you about today eventually is instead the free boundary curve shortening flow. So the free boundary. So again, we can keep the same setup if you just remember that the boundary, the ambient boundary is not empty. Okay, and the only thing is. Okay, and the only thing is we're imposing the free boundary condition is that the boundary of the curve intersects the boundary, the ambient boundary at right angles. So, I guess if I draw another standard potato, but I change it up so now. But I change it up. So now this isn't meant to be the curve anymore. This is the domain that I'm living in. Okay, and instead, what I have is a curve here. And again, it's sort of on the interior, it's evolving according to which way its curvature goes. But at the boundary, it always hits that right angle. So hopefully the setting is clear. The setting is clear. Okay, so maybe let me just reuse this one. Okay, so what we're interested in is just the same thing, the long time behavior of the flow. And as far as we knew, it wasn't written down. So we decided to do it. Okay, so we still want to look at an embedded curve. And now it's not a closed curve, but it's, I guess, diffimorphic to an interval. So just like in the picture. And what I want to take is the ambient space to still be flat, but it's a convex domain in R2. So, under this condition, then we can characterize the long-pimmed behavior of this free boundary curve journey. Okay, so what happens is this is still a possibility, right? So, it's possible you flow until some finite time and then you collapse. And the only difference in that case is that you collapse to a point on the boundary. And so. I guess I should be a little less cavalier and say it's around half point. Okay, because it's converging to a semi-sir. Okay, if you're sharp, you know that's not the only case. So again, if the length functional has critical points, and I thought I should sneak that in. So if there is a critical point, which in this case just means it has to be a straight line segment, right? Has to be a straight line segment, right? The straight line segment that meets the boundary orthogonally at both ends, right, will stay fixed under the flow because it's a critical point of the length functional. And so it's also possible that you converge to this guy in infinite time. It exists. For all time and converters to a critical code as t goes to infinity. Okay, so is that clear? The two cases here. Again, this is not so surprising. I mean, this is the same thing. Again, if you have a closed surface M here, you could always have a closed geodesic, and then it's really a theorem of gauge. And it's really a theorem of gauge that you convert, you could possibly converge to this closed GSIC as well. But those are the only two options. The only extra thing here, which is sort of worth saying, I'm not sure if we'll have time to really discuss it too much, is there is some question. So for example, if you're in the round S2, there are lots and lots of closed geodesics. In the free boundary case, if you're in just the regular circle, there are lots and lots of equators, for example. So there's lots of critical. For example, so there's lots of critical pods. There is a question of uniqueness here, which turns out to not be a question, okay, but it is part of a statement. It's actually yeah. How can you converge to something unstable like if you have conveyed boundaries and the your basics part are unstable. That's that's also a good point, Bob. We can come back maybe, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry. Let's go with that, but maybe that one link sounds better. Sure, sure, sure. Yeah, so I mean, ideally, we'd like to remove convex as well, but in any case, these are the examples. But in any case, these are the examples we want. And I also wanted to put this up as a prototype because I do want to eventually talk about S2 or these other surfaces. Sorry, S2 is still complex, but I want to talk about these other surfaces too. So this is the prototype where you could possibly have a geodesic. And if it happens, then you want to say something. Okay, so again, the theorem is really about the long time behavior. I thought I would take you through a quick history of the Euclidean case, just the R2 case, just to see a couple of methods. I might not talk about them as much in this iteration. So, again, this is the R2 case. So, here are a few proofs I know listed in some order, I think, chronological. So, there's the sort of original papers of Gage and Gage Hamilton. So, they showed that a convex curve. Becomes round and then put Brayson tacked on the fact that an embedded curve eventually becomes convex and then by the earlier result eventually also becomes round. And this is like kind of really classical differential geometry, I would say. I would say. Okay. Then there's a there's a proof by Huskin using distance comparison, which I've already given away as the proof method that we want to use. And there's some improvement of that by Ben Andrews and Paul Bryan in 2011. And so their improvement is that they're also able. So, their improvement is that they're not just able to get the long-time behavior, but they can say something about the curvature as you approach the scale. There's a third proof also by Andrews and Brian using the isoparametric profile. Okay, and I don't know if anyone can see that. There's a proof that I think just exists that I think of as a sort of postmodern approach. Okay, but all I mean by that, again, the audience is familiar, it's just the classification of blocks. Okay, so if you can rule out, in particular, the multiplicity to the line. In particular, the multiplicity to the line, then you're pretty much golden. Basically, the only singularity model you can actually have is the circle. Okay, so that's the postmodern approach. Again, your enemy is the multiplicity true line. And really, that's your enemy in all of these settings. Your enemy is always something that's sort of very long and very thin. Okay. Yeah, so sometimes I would say more about this. I think I'm going to skip at the time, but again, the one that we picked. The one that we picked to sort of do is this distance comparison because it's nice and geometric. And again, it tells you maybe a little more than the blowout method does, right? The blow-up method sort of says, let's just take a limit, or maybe we can infer some information just before the singular time. And so I think it's a nice in-between where things are geometric, but you still have some control about the solution as it approaches.  So, I just want to talk about distance comparison then. Again, just introduce it in the R2 case, and then I'll sort of spend whatever time I have left modifying it and trying to hint at exactly what happens in these other settings. Okay, so the distance comparison is a measure of how non-linear the code is. We want to compare the cord distance, that's the extrinsic distance. That's the extrinsic distance, which I'll always write as d to the arc length. So that's the intrinsic distance along the curve. And I'll write that as L. And again, so you could sort of check that the worst case of this ratio is decreasing. That's essentially what Fiskin does. But you can sort of. But you can sort of keep track of more things by looking at the cord eye profile. And so that's just if you fix right for a particular eye plank, you ask what the worst case of the extrinsic distance is. Again, what you're guarding against is something very long and very thin. Right, so for instance, between these two points, the arc length is very large, but the extrinsic distance is very small. So the profile is this thing, sine of s. Again, s is a parameter for the arc length, and you're just taking the worst possible extrinsic distance. And so that's the least possible extrinsic distance. The sort of an important There's sort of an important point here that this thing, so asymptotically when the arc length is small, this thing, okay, to first order it's the same. Okay, but to next order, it depends on the curvature. So it's something like this. Again, this isn't totally precise, but schematically, this is what's happening. The sort of next order expansion of the distance looks like the sum term involving the curvature. And this is also what. Curvature. And this is also why, sort of, if you control this quantity well enough, then you should expect to get a curvature down out in the end. Okay, so not just ruling out the bad case, but also getting some control on the flow. That's my pitch. And I guess it's part of a broader pitch about sort of global quantities that infinitesimally or sort of local that sort of generalize local quantities. Generalized loadable quantities. So some notion that sort of sees the curvature at a small scale, but is nevertheless a global quantity in the same vein as these like ball curvatures that are used in a non-collapsing. Maybe we start by the way. Okay, cool. Okay, so I guess I have time to give you an example. So for example, on a circle, so on a circle, you can calculate how the chord depends on the arc. And it's very precise. So the chord, the length of the chord. The chord length of the chord is like so it's like sine of the arc length. Okay, but then maybe L here. It's like sine of the arc length, but then maybe you have to normalize. So the right normalization is this one. Okay, but anyway, you can do some trig and work out exactly. trick and work out exactly what the this function is on the on any round circle okay and then what you want to do with this is again the same as sort of old differential geometry you want to use just the maximum principle but again you're using the maximum principle with this global quantity and so there's some technical stuff where you know it's maybe not as smooth as you like but again because you're trying to try to use the maximum principle But again, because you're trying to use the maximum principle, it's enough to find a differential inequality in the barrier sense. Okay, so that's just sort of a spiel about global quantities. I'm not going to bother you with the derivation, okay, just for time. I'm just going to tell you what comes out. Okay, but again, the idea is to use the maximum principle and to compute the evolution of this profile guy. Of this profile guide. Okay. So essentially, what we get is that dt of psi is bounded by this thing. I have no idea how legible this is, but okay, there's some second derivative. Okay, there's some second derivative term and then so two of the L. So this is sort of one problem. This is sort of one product, one almost final outcome of using the maximum principle, some evolution equation. Really, this happens at the sort of worst possible points x and y. Okay, and I just wanted to show you this because this is where it's sort of, this is one point where it could potentially start to get hairy in these other sets. Okay, so at some point you get to this guy, and if you're sharp, you notice this isn't quite. This isn't quite an inequality in ψ alone, right? There's all this other junk going on, in particular these curvature integrals. Okay, so then the trick that you use here is that, well, okay, so Cauchy Schwartz says that the length times the total squared curvature. Curvature is bounded below by the total curvature squared. Okay, but this one is just the, at least in R2, this is just the turning angle. There you go. Is that the wrong way? But in any case, you do this estimate, you still get something gnarly, but at least it's manageable. So this one is the turning angle. Again, between these two points, X and Y, the sort of worst possible pair. And if you use the critical point condition as well, then you get something like. Then you get something like ar cosine of the derivative of phi squared. Okay, that you just have to check using the critical point condition. The easier one to understand is that this curvature integral really is the total squared curvature on the curve. Right, and so the turning angle for a closed curve is always 2 pi. Okay, so that one's easier to understand. I can just stick a so it's 4 pi. Ah, so it's four pi squared, I think, over L possibly over. Let's just leave it, and it might be off by a constant. But the point is, you use the turning angle here, and it's really exactly equal to 2 pi on a closed curve in R2. Okay. Are you doing for your curve that's got n? On your curve, it's got ends. Sorry, sorry, this is just a closed curve in R2, and then again, so I wanted to just highlight this step and then sort of come back to it. And then that is exactly one of the problems. So, yeah, maybe let me just finish the R2 case again. So, the sort of maximum principle argument always has two steps. I don't know. Argument always has two steps. I don't know, they sound in varying degrees of triviality. So, on the one hand, you actually have to calculate the evolution. And again, I will claim that's somewhat non-trivial when it's this sort of global quantity and not exactly smooth. And then you still need to come up with a good barrier. Right, so you still need to come up with a good barrier function. And so roughly, what Hriskin did is to just take the circle. To just take the circle and use its profile function as a barrier, but just scale it down a bit. Okay, so you just take this one over pi sine pi of s and stick an epsilon in front. And if epsilon is small enough, then at least you fit under the initial curve. And that stops you at least from degenerating to that really long, really thin curve. That really long, really thin. Okay. What it doesn't do is it doesn't give you a curvature estimate. Because I've mucked up the gradient. The derivative of this guy at zero is now epsilon. And so I can't see anything from the second order term. What I really want is a barrier function that at least matches the Least matches the expansion of d or psi up to first order. I really want something that has gradient one at the origin, right? And then I would be able to get a curvature estimate. So again, this guy sort of prevents the bad guy, but doesn't give anything more. And sort of the minor miracle of Andrews and Brian is that you can take the following barrier. So you still start with the circle, but now you scale it and hit it with an arctangent and scale it back. Okay, and you also evolve this thing appropriately in time. So e to the minus 4 pi squared tau here. Okay, turns out. Okay, it turns out that this thing does actually satisfy the right inequality. It just happens to work. And so the properties you need here are that as A goes to infinity, this thing goes to zero. So again, it fits under any initial profile. On the other hand, as A goes to zero, which is really equivalent of tau. Really, equivalent of tau going to infinity, then this thing converges to the circle profile, which again will say in a strong sense that you converge to the circle. And again, the derivative at zero is actually equal to one. Okay, so you can get a curvature estimate out of this. So this is the minor mirror. So, this is the minor miracle that Andrews and Brian found. I think it's fun to show sort of everything gets wrapped up fairly neatly. Okay, the maximum principle really works. Okay, so in the time I have left, I just want to talk about the free boundary setting. Good. So, that's the one we wrote down. Okay, so there's one problem that Ben mentioned, and maybe I'll just get it out of the way: is that sort of even if you can get to this stage, then you have an issue if you try and do the same thing because it's not clear the turning age could really be zero. Right? So, again, if you're close to the The if you're close to an equator, for instance, then you're turning angle of zero and you get nothing effective out of this. And even if you're in a regime where you sort of know that you're going to a semicircle, if the domain is convex and the turning angle is just less than, right, it's less than half of what it's supposed to be. It's actually strictly less than pi. Okay, so somehow things don't necessarily work even if you get to that. Don't necessarily work even if you get to that stage. But the point I want to make is that it's actually not that easy to get to this inequality either. So, again, you want to use the maximum principle, but now you have a code with endpoints. And so you need to deal with the boundary behavior of this function. Really, you want to check that the maximum doesn't occur at a boundary point. Okay, and so you can calculate the first derivative, you can calculate the normal derivative boundary, and I'll just give it away for you that it doesn't look like it has a sign. Okay, it's extremely not obvious to me that it has a sign. I believe this is the same problem with the non-collapsing. It's just, yeah, I don't see any reason to expect that this thing has a sign. Okay, and so my pitch to you is that when you get to And so, my pitch to you is that when you get to this situation, you should think really hard about whether you're actually working with the right geometric quantity. And so my sort of motivating example to show you that it's, you know, the naive thing, just writing down literally the same expression doesn't work is the following. So let's just look at R2 plus, so just a half space of R2. And take a curve. Well, okay, so I'm only going to look at, right, if I write down the quadrat profile in the naive way, then I only get to see the pairs of points on this curve. But in R2, I have a reflection. So the behavior of this guy really should behave like, you know, essentially like. Like, you know, essentially, like half of this reflected curve. And what I'm not seeing is pairs of points that start on the upper side and connect the lower side. But in particular, I'm also missing this pair. So I'm sort of, I'm not sort of naively, we don't see opposite pairs. Pairs points. So, like this one, I think in the picture I drew that's the best one, but you also don't see pairs of points like this. And so, somehow you're missing something. Okay, so my fix is to just reflect it back. Okay, so you should, in addition to considering just the distance, you should also consider a reflected distance. Distance. Do you need to also consider a reflected profile? And so here, D reflected. Well, okay, how do you generate the best reflected distance? You should use like Snell's law or something, or I should really. Something, or I should really just minimize over points on the boundary. So, this is the infemum of dxz plus dzy, the z in the barrier, in the ambient barrier. And again, this is a definition that makes sense, right, without reflection. I don't actually need to be in R2 plus to make sense of this reflective distance. Reflective distance. Yeah, I'm just taking the best one bounce billion orbit on the barrier. So this thing. And now I can curve it and take something like that. Okay, so you can define the arc length similarly. So I can define a reflected arc length similarly just by either taking this. Reflection, right, going to a boundary point or by the other one, right? Going to this one and then reflecting back, whichever is smaller. So I claim to you that this is a reasonable definition and it works. Okay, so you do actually, you can actually use the maximum principle. It solves the boundary point problem of the maximum principle. Again, well enough to get into this situation. Okay, and then there is this problem that we mentioned before with the Problem that we mentioned before with the curvature integral, and the effect of that is we can sort of get an uh, we can get the result in a Huskiness manner, right, where we give up on the gradient estimate and we just slide some barrier underneath. Right, so we definitely get some positive barrier function that stops the sort of degenerate case, but we don't know how to get a barrier with a good gradient and therefore the curvature estimate. Okay, so that's again, this might still be not the correct geometric quantity, right? It's sort of, it's definitely not perfectly symmetric between, you know, unreflected and reflected. Okay, so there may be some improvement there. And I still have five minutes, right? No, yeah, okay. Um, okay, so yeah, I think maybe I'll. Yeah, I think maybe I'll that's essentially what happens for the for the free boundary setting. So, and if you if you sort of cook up the right quantity, then you can get into the maximum principle situation. It's not as sharp as we would like, but nevertheless still rules out the bad setting. And so you get the long-time behavior that you expect. Okay, so then I'll mention a couple of words about S2. Okay, so that's the other. Okay, so that's the other, that's sort of the other case we had in mind where you might be able to do something. And so again, the result, the result, the long-time behavior is known. So either you converge to a round point or you converge to a geodesic. Sorry, Bob, I haven't answered your question now. So in S2, you have the guide that splits, you have curves that split the sphere into equal area, and that's a preserved condition under the flow. And so you have to. Under the flow. And so you have to converge to an equator. And so that's known by gauge. Although, again, it's also known that the equator you converge to is unique, but it's again sort of slightly more torturous than we claim it needs to be. So we claim that if you, if you do, we claim that if you try this sort of core dark stuff, you can also get a good cord arc estimate in S2. Estimate in S2, and that should also give you a sort of more efficient proof of the long time behavior in the sphere. And again, in the sphere, the sort of the key is to come up with the right geometric quantity. Okay, so you can, the naive thing to do is again, write down the Kodak profile. But again, that was SciMS is. Again, that was psi of s is sort of the optimal distance given that the arc length is equal to s. Okay, now again, just to be totally clear about the setting, I've switched modes to closed cards nest two. Okay, and there's a little bit of a question. Okay, and there's a little bit of a question. So this one is the arc length and is unambiguous. This one, naively, you would just do the geodesic distance, I hope. Okay, but it turns out that's, you know, it's equivalent and it's doable and you get something, but it's much easier to see if you actually continue to take this to be the R3 distance. Okay, and that seems like a trick, but it actually turns out that if you use the R3 distance, we somehow get exactly the same inequality as the Euclidean case. Okay, so there's a couple of modifications that happen for the total curvature. You can't just use the turning angle, but it's still It's no longer the turning angle, but this one is still bigger than 4 pi squared by Fenchel's theorem. And for this other one, there's a little trick that, well, this is so it's the space curvature squared minus the integral. Minus the integral of one, so just minus the length. And the space curvature is the derivative of the Gauss map. So this one really is related to sort of arc cosine of the angle between normal vectors. Okay, and then you do a bunch of work, and again, using the critical point condition, it just turns out that you get exactly the same inequality. The same inequality, which is very mysterious to us. All right, I should put some caveats. So, sort of algebraically, you get exactly the same. So it's the same inequality, at least for L for length less than or equal to 2 pi. And it seems that when L is greater than 2 pi, then we get a new case. Then we get a new case. But I believe you can finesse it and get back to the old case and get the same inequality again if you use the right barriers. So I think it works out, but we haven't written it up fully yet. But it's somehow old and nice in that you get the same inequality, but also different in that there are these different regimes where something different happens. Regimes where something different happens. Okay, so I think it's kind of interesting behavior. And then I guess the remark I want to end on is: of course, we sort of like this technique and we like thinking about it in different settings. So, you know, one natural question is, well, what about hyperbolic space? Especially given that you get the same equation, right? Somehow, there were curvature terms that we found, but they seem to all have cancelled. And so you might suspect. And so you might suspect that, well, maybe it's not actually sensitive to the sign of the curvature or anything. Maybe it's something to do with the symmetry. But I don't know, it seems to fail in hyperbolic space. So at least one thing I found is that it seems that if you minimize the total square curvature of a curve in hyperbolic space, you don't actually always get the circle. Maybe everyone knew that already, but I didn't. And that seems to be at least one wrench in the works if you try and go to a different space again. So maybe I've rambled enough. Please ask questions or whatever. All right, thanks a lot. Questions? I think if it's if you've got mean coverage blow in a sphere, then you can shrink the sphere with a you know on the mean curvature blow essentially. And I think that gives you a higher dimensional curve shortening flow. So I was just thinking about the link between like the Euclidean case and the sphere case there. Maybe something like this exists in higher codimension. It's just it's more a comment on what you've uh what you think. On what you said, what you're going to say, yeah, I guess that well, yeah, one natural thought. Of course, it's somehow it can't quite exactly be true because I think if you have a caught outbound, then you also sneakly prove that embeddedness is preserved. But yeah, it does also beg the question, you know, especially if you believe that the trick of looking at the R3 distance is somehow really seeing what's going on, then it's natural to think, well, maybe the Natural to think, well, maybe there's something you can say about more general curve shortening flows in R3. But I don't know how to do it. No, thanks for your comment. Does the Andrew, the alms of the minus one formula with that correspond to a particular curve? No, which I think makes it more surprising. Yeah, so it actually, as far as we know, it doesn't correspond to the Kordak program. It doesn't correspond to the Kordak profile of a particular code. So it's sort of, it's not, I guess, the method isn't optimal in that sense. If you actually look at their isoparametric profile, then it is. What they show is that the is, so here, what's shown is that the chord arc profile improves to that of the circle, but it goes through these other barriers potentially. And what they show using this other method, using the isoparimetric profile, is that the isoperimetry improves to that of circle. isoperimetry improves to that of circle but it improves through the anglen ovals and and so exactly the the profile of the anger and oval is a is a good barrier in that method um yeah so uh sort of sneakily i think uh as is possibly typical for the sphere and hyperbolic space i think the isoparametric method is possibly a better one to use for hyperbolic space and probably bails in the sphere Probably bails in the sphere, but I haven't checked it out yet. So, as far as I know, one advantage of the cursion block embedded case is that if it converges in an ambient manifold, then you have still embeddedness of the geodesic in the minute, right? That's one of the advantages. So, are there applications in this boundary case that you can think of for geodesic theory somehow? I guess maybe we would need to move out of domains and in literally R2, but yeah, maybe even for maybe even for a flat surface or a yeah, if we could do, for example, if we could combine it and do like reboundry in a, in S2, then maybe positively curved surface or something, maybe, yeah. But I don't know. But I don't know. Thank you. For other questions, so for the first theorem, you said which at the end, like things could go to arc, right? Like if you have something that is rotationally symmetric, like 90 degrees, and your domain is 90 degrees, rotation metric, then it would have to go to a, even like a ray is, right? In so a diameter, right? In the case of a circle. Yeah, I think so. But but the written. But but there isn't but do you would you have like a condition that you would say like oh this would always have to go to a point uh I think there aren't I mean there are conditions I mean there are silly conditions like if you if you lie on one side but we don't know like a we don't know like a strict dichotomy. So even the one even the one for S2 doesn't work in the ball as far as I know. Fall as far as I know. So for S2, again, it's pretty much just whether the curve splits it into equal areas. But like that, that condition is not preserved by the free boundary flow in a disk. Like the area on either side. So as you say, under a suitable symmetry, then I think it forces your hand, but I don't know like a complete dichotomy, I guess. Not a good one. Yeah, I don't know why. Sorry, I mean, it depends on your application, but I wish there were more. I wish I knew more things. Another question? Have you got the marketing from the file that you said that we need to use some sort of beat of length? So we actually finessed it a bit. Sort of roughly what happens is that you do need to consider both. So you can allow the cordiac profile to have a non-zero normal derivative. It turns out that the reflective profile just had the opposite. The reflective profile just has the opposite, exactly the opposite normal derivative. Okay, so yeah, already you can see how to, yeah, that basically fixes your problem. One of these two should have, should violate the lever. I don't know. We sort of in the paper, we packaged it together kind of sneakily. We said, well, you can double the curve. And then this defines like, you know, a C1 at least function on the double curve. And then there's no, there's sort of no boundary in that sense. Then there's no sort of no boundary in that sense, but that I think that's just a sneaky way of packaging it. Yeah, okay. Questions? Thanks for speakers.
