Two seconds left. Four. That's what happened to you. Let's talk about Venus Objects in two single sets in a simple technical catalog. Thank you so much for the introduction and thank you for the organizers for this beautiful workshop and for bringing people from different areas to talk about things. To talk about things like people. My daughter, she's 11 years old, she's also here in Banff, and she thought that we were talking about signals, the birds. So this is joint work with Rashmett and Walker Stern, so they are here in the audience as well. And this is based on a series of papers. The first two papers are more on the one category. Papers are more on the one category picture, like one single, and I will tell you more about it. And then, this is a recent preprint a couple of months ago that is all things two signal about this story. And what is the big picture of this talk or of this series of papers is that two-sigal sets or two single objects will help us to classify things. And if you have, for example, two-dimensional. For example, two-dimensional TQFTs, you know that there's a very classical theorem that tells you that there are as many two-dimensional TQFTs as Frobenius algebras. And then you can say, well, what if we do what Matt told us in terms of whole algebras? What if I don't want to talk about algebras, but like whole objects in other categories? And the answer is yes, you can do that. And so the first thing that I want to do today is to tell you that. Today is to tell you that we should study for Benius objects if we want to understand some of the things that, so thank you, Hiro, for telling us a little bit about symplectic geometry. So how the symplectic category looks like. So I'm already lying here, the symplectic category is not really a category if you consider all Lagrangians, because there's some composition issues, but you can do some replacement. So, but anyways, we should think of Provenius type. Think of provenius type optics to understand it in terms of the two-dimensional TQFT. And there's a very interesting model for this symplectic category, actually inspired by Flower theory, that is basically they wanted to make Flower theory functorial. So, what Hero told us is you have a particular simple manifold, and then you look at Lagrangians. And these Lagrangians have very peculiar properties. But what if you consider But what if you consider all simplecting manifolds and all possible Lagrangians and how functorial this construction could look like? So they propose a method that they call the, well now it's called the Berheim-Woodberg construction, that the input is a category, for example the category in which you have issues with compositions, and then the output is a true category in which composition things work fine in terms of composition. So I will explain a little bit what the WW construction is. What the ww construction is, and then you start seeing things that look like single spaces. And then, well, finally, we will just discuss a little bit the content of this last preprint. That is, if in the in regular PQFTs, we classify them by commutative provenance. So, what if we have a higher categorical version of this result? Categorical version of this result. So, we would like to know what Frobenius and what commutative mean in the two siblings. And the result is that Frobenius and commutative are equivalent to what is called paracyclic and gamma structures on two siblings. So, I'm not assuming that all of you are familiar with what paracyclic and gamma structures mean, so I'm going to tell you during the talk. So, please stop me if there are any questions. But that's the picture. But that's the picture. And so I think Rash and I have a similar background, so we come from Poisson geometry. That is, I think, is far from classical. But you can do physics with Poisson geometry, classical physics, Hamiltonian mechanics and so on. You can also describe with the Poisson bracket observables, these classical theories. But the Poisson, if you think that the symplectic category is bad, because it's not a category, the Poisson category is the category. The Poisson category is even worse. So, what are the morphisms? It's complicated. You can think about quisotropic, sub-manifolds, and so on. So, people have studied connections between Poisson and symplectic. So, earlier today, Sophiro gave us very nice examples of symplectic manifolds and Lagrangian correspondences. There's a very particular symplectic manifold that we like that is a symplectic group of so it's a symplectic manifold that also has a group point. That also has a group-point structure of these race-morphisms, has been studied extensively. And there's a connection with things that look more to sigma, that is, topological free theory. There are lots of arrows between these three areas. But today, I think we are going to start with something very classical: that is, two-dimensional TQFTs are totally classified by commutative provenance IGs. And the thing that we are interested at this. And the thing that we are interested in, that we started discussing with Rice many, many years ago, is: well, TQFTs have a Q in the definition of TQFTs, quantum. So you land in something that looks like Hilbert spaces, vector spaces. How about if you do a pit stop in something that is classical, semi-classical? So you have simplectic manifolds, you have the phase space, you have Lagrangian. So what is actually the classification of TQ of Ts if you remove the Q? So this lands here. So if we know that Provenius is here. So, if we know that Frobenius is here, and then you have a symmetric monoclonal function here, so it makes sense to start thinking about Frobenius objects in the symmetric character. And that was the starting point of the project. This is, I think, something that Hero might have mentioned with examples. I will go quickly with this slide. The objects of the symplectic category are symplectic matrix. And we like the nice, so let's say without singularities, without corners, just think about your, you know, like the cotangent bundle. You know, the cotangent bundle of Rn if you want. The morphisms are Lagrangian correspondences, but as I said, this on its own is not a category. You have issues with compositions. You need transversality to define compositions. So a solution is proposed by Werham and Woodward, studying topology. What they said is: let's keep the objects, the objects stay the same, but then you do something to the amorphous things. And what do you do to the morphomorphic? The morphisms. And what do you do to the morphisms? You take, you make it happen. It's like the same way that if you have a group that is not abelian, you do a quotient and becomes abelian. So you do something very formal. So you just take those sequences of things that may not compose, and then you make an equivalence relation until you get the actual composition. So you make it formal. Well, that was proposed in the paper by Werhen and Woodward. By Berhan and Woodward. Again, I try to make floor theory functorial. But I will tell you what is the WW in a very recognizable category. So let's forget about topology for a second. Let's think about the category rel in which the objects are sets and the morphisms are just relations. And then you define, you can define what is transversality. What is transversality then? And let's say transversality for me would be monic compositions. You want the composition to be monic. So if you do that, you can check. That was also described in more generality in a paper by Alan Weinson and David Liebland, that if you apply the WW to RHEL, to this type of construction, this category with this nice version of composition, you get something that we have seen this week many times. You get the category of spans, which is a nice. Of spans, which is a nice category. You just have object sets and then you have morphisms that are iso classes of span, and you can compose them via pullback. So this is a very nice replacement. And this actually suggested, and that was the original intention of this paper, instead of dealing with these weird issues of transversal compositions in the symplectic category, why don't we do the W-W construction? So that means that span is a good sectoretic model for. Is a good set-theoretic model for sync. Like, if you forget for a second the topology, just and well, in physics, we like to study TGFTs. So, how about TQFTs with values instead of like vects? We just study TQFTs with values in that category. Please let me know if there are any questions there. Span is the same as the category of relations? So, the WW construction. So, the WW construction for rel, that is the category of relations, sets and relations, then if you apply this formal construction, you end up getting spans. So the morphisms are spanse. That's a yes. That's a yes, yes. No, it's not the same as the category of relations. It's the thing that's on the right. So, ww applied to the left? If you're looking in algebra, take In algebra, you take sets and relations, and so the relation is a subset of the product. Yeah. And you compose them, and that's exactly the composition on the right. The image from A into X cross Y doesn't have to be an injection span. So this is more jump, yes. Illustrate two non-composable modding relations. Monic relations? Can you do it to non-composable monic relations? Like, where I would word is about, there's one way to find things that you can't even compose, right? Right, so you could imagine that you have two monic relations. So, monic in here means that you have kind of a way to go to count like trajectories from one set to another. So, you could imagine that you have something that is bigger. So, like multi-valued kind of thing. But there's confusion because there is a good composition anyway. A good composition in a well. Yes. But it's just not that the one. It's not the one that, like, one would like to add an adjective to the composition. And you can say, like, it's monic. This starts looking at like at monos and epis that we heard also earlier today. I think in this paper they call it reductions and corredactions. So you just want nice compositions. Good. So then we just, the same way that we talked about. We just, the same way that we talked that we heard earlier this week about whole algebras, and we can just talk about whole objects in general, we can also talk about Frobenius objects in a monoidal category. So you have, well, the usual axioms describing a Frobenius algebra. So you have unit, you have multiplication, you have a co-unit, so you have nice diagrams that describe them. So you can describe unitality and associativity. And the interesting aspect And the interesting aspect of Frobenius, what makes Frobenius algebra relevant, is the existence of a trace. So, this maybe you have seen it like the cap diagram in which what we want is some non-degeneracy for the trace. And this is what people in Frobenius algebra language call it the snake diagram or the snake action. And out of all the possible Frobenius algebras or Frobenius objects that you can Algebras or for Venus objects that you can define, there are some of them that we call special. So, specialists, if you compose multiplication and co-multiplication, you get the identity. This doesn't happen in general for an arbitrary forbidius, but some of our examples will satisfy this special condition. Some of the things that one can prove about forbiddenness objects in absolute generality, not just forbidden algebras, is that if there exists a beta, like a cap, There exists a bit like a cup, or a trace is unique up ISO. It really looks like this. Co-multiplication can be derived from the axioms that I gave you. And you also have co-unitality and co-association. So you can choose your axioms and derive the other properties that maybe you have seen before. Sure. So it's all this, but you can imagine associative algebra, you have a unit, but you also have a trace. You have a unit, but you also have a trace. So, trace will allow you kind of to flip the diagrams. And then you have natural associativity, co-associity. But I think the important one is the existence of these non-degenerate traits. Can you look at it like a graph with certain properties? Because I'm seeing that there are like going graphs. Right. So this is just the diagrammatics of the axioms that makes it more general for any category. That makes it more general for any category. But if you want a very specific example of a for Benius algebra, it's like the group algebra. That kind of gives you a very specific example when you have a convolution, for example. The cohomology of a real finite-dimensional smooth manifold is also connected to the momentum. Yeah, this is connected to, for example, quantum cohomology. And people have studied for Renus manifolds. And for us, well, we just wanted full generality, but these are. But these are the axes, the diagram. Good. So, why people cared about Frobenius? A very classical result by physicists. Well, Dijgraph in 1989, Avrams in 96, there's a one-to-one correspondence between commutative provenance objects in C, in a monoidal category, and C-valued two-dimensional TQFTs. And by T. And by TQFTs, here we heard it also yesterday, we mean just symmetry monoidal functors. Here we are not doing any like dualizability, like a fully extended version. This is just like the usual version of TPFT, but one can wonder what happens if you kind of fully extend. So, this, well, many years ago when I was doing my PhD, we were studying this kind of special Frobenius condition. Frobenius condition, the one that you just compose and recompose, get identity, it turns out that that's in correspondence with groupoids. So if you take group voice and you play this game, in a group way you have multiplication, you have unit, you have trace given by the inverse, so you can kind of pair things, and you have also this kind of special condition. And you can see that there's a correspondence there. And rel here, one of the ingredients. One of the ingredients in this correspondence is that it's a dagger symmetric monoidal pattern. What is a dagger category? That there's a way to flip morphisms here. So if you have a relation, you can take the dagger and you just read it instead of from left to right, right to left. But again, for physicists, so they love this kind of, well, I don't know if everyone loves this kind of abstract setup, but one thing that physicists like is numbers, like invariance, things that you can associate to, let's say, manifolds. To say manifolds. So there's a way to get invariance out of these TQFTs by considering the home space. And then you can just start, well, because it's a two-dimensional TQFT surfaces, you can start seeing things related to the genes. So we will make it a bit more explicit in a. Didn't you just say that you make this equal to the right. So in the special case, you don't get anything interesting, but then if you just interesting but then if you just leave the realm of special then you will start getting actually numbers and i will i will show that means that you you can start twisting your frobeni structure by like picking an interesting co-unit so if you if the unit and the co-unit are both let's say you have a group and you have the identity you get nothing but if you take another element with certain properties you start getting nothing the category REL wasn't a category. WW. WWE. Like for sorry. This is an occult relative way. Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry. So, so before doing WW, you can actually compute just things. And I will show you examples of non-special Robinius algebras in which you can compute a number without doing the WW yet, so there are no spans. And then when we do the WW construction, we will start seeing things connected to two signals. So there's the one. Though. So there's the one categorical picture on the left, and you can kind of compute just numbers. And then we can just try to see what happens when you have. I just want to make sure I understand. So the definition of Frobenius involves composing certain morphisms. For you, is a Frobenius object in RHEL arising when those maps compositions exist in RHEL? In this, yeah, like in this particular one, yes. So this is when we are in. Without going to the WW, when just they make sense in RHEL. But in RHEL, yeah, without adding any specific adjective on the composition. It's just the usual category of RHEL. Composition exists always. It's just not the span composition. Correct. You take the span composition and then you take epimonofactualization. So you have a different definition of the WW construction in mind. Like, what I know of the WW construction. Like what I know the WW construction is like you have some thing that looks like okay, well, what's that? What are you talking about? Okay. So let's go to span. This is just picking your category and then you can take RHEL or you can take span, like seen as a WW model for RHEL. And then you just have the monoidal structure, the monoidal unit, and then you also can see what is the home, the home space there. And it turns out that the home space is just Cardinal. out that the home space is just cardinalities. You're getting numbers, but those numbers are just, you know, like the number of elements of a set if you have finite sets. And something that we did a couple of years ago is to study what is the condition of being proven, there, probinous objects in Spanning, the same spirit of connecting provenius in RHEL with groupoids. So we get some simplicial sets with some conditions. And we have to be, I have to be honest, there, we were unaware of the two signal. Honest, there, we were unaware of the two single technology, so we were just doing it by hand and just saying, well, you have a simplic set, and you're tracing the forbidden structures. And then, well, later Walker made us aware that this description of unitality or associativity can be described in the, for example, the unitality. For example, the unitality in the lower two sibl conditions. And well, before that, we just had to do it by hand. And we just kind of gave some conditions on phase and degeneracy maps for unitality to work at the level of spat. And then we also studied associativity, so you just have the span that represents the associativity condition, and again, that looks at the full. And again, that looks at pullback diagrams, and we use the description of tackles. So that was when we introduced these conditions in terms of simplices. And this was what Walker told us the first day of the workshop. And then you can just write what associativity means in terms of bijections between these factors. That happens to be a That happens to be a slightly weaker version of the two-sigl condition for associativity. So let's recap a little bit. So I don't know if that might help with Hiro's comment. So here we have just diagrammatically what forminius means. And then you can just describe this in terms of this implicit sex. You just kind of determine how spans look like. And we just translate. And we just translate what unitality, co-unitality, associativity means. And it turns out that what we ended up having is a truncated simplicial set, so you don't have to go to higher levels here, with an automorphism, that is this Nakayama automorphism for Forbinius. And the observation that was, you know, Walker sent us an email right after this was on the archive, that definitely this can be written in. That definitely this can be written in terms of two sigmo. And then let's move to the actual two siggles. And we've learned a lot from Oper and also this week about how to describe the things that happen in the one category level to the two category level. And the first thing to observe is a theorem by Walker, actually, out of his PhD thesis in His PhD thesis in 2019, and this is the published version of the paper: there's a correspondence between pseudomonoids in the category of spans and two-sigl sets. And there's also something that looks like a categorified version of Robinians and cyclic two-sigl sets. So there's some notion of cyclicity associated with two-sigl. So we were aware of this result. So then we started thinking together: how can we translate these ideas of just Frobenius objects in the category of span or rel in the one category level to make it higher categorical? See what we get. So, are you going to say what the difference is between these notions of permitting this? You mean it's different. You mean it's different from yours? It's not just what you call province? Oh, clavial is the yeah, there's gonna be a difference. So there's the difference between cyclic and something called paracyclic. We also learned it from Walker. So there's a more generalized notion that if things kind of close, then it's cyclic. That's the only difference. Sorry. That's the only difference. That's the only difference. Yes, yes. But then we also explore. Yes. But then we also explore what commutative means, because when you classify two-dimensional TKFTs, you need for bin is a commutative. And commutative happens to be related to something called gamma structures. So, which was very interesting. So I think we have seen this before, I think, maybe in Toby's lecture, how we can kind of construct a higher version of this category of span. So you have objects will be sets, morphisms will be set. Objects will be sets, morphisms will be spans, and two morphisms will be like spans between spans. And then we can define something in this biocategory, something that looks like the monoidal category. So if you don't want to read this definition, let's look at this example. That is kind of a guiding example of what a pseudo-monoid is. If you take a pseudo-monoid in the bicategory of categories, that is exactly a monoidal category. So then what are the kind of guiding axioms there? Of guiding axioms there. So you have an object, x, you have a morphism that looks like the unit, you have multiplication, and then you also have invertible two morphisms that will give us the coherence. So you have an associator, you have a left unitor, and then you have a right unitor with some compatibility coefficients. But so a homotopy theorem, a pseudomonoic is just a monoic? Is that right? That's right. Like if you choose exact yeah, if you choose the associators and the unitors from homotopy. And the uniters from all of B. Theory should do this. And I think this kind of relates to what. So associativity can be just written diagrammatically. And the coherence that makes sense for us is, well, the pentagon equation that I think appears naturally in different scenarios. But this is just what we are asking the associator to satisfy. And then, well, back to tacos. So we just have these kind of building blocks. We can also describe by the lowest two-signal condition that for these pseudo domonoids, we just want these two maps to be isomorphisms. And there's a very explicit associator attached to this tackle picture. And these maps just geometrically correspond to like. Geometrically correspond to like pattern moves in DQFT. So this is related to the 2-2 pattern. So maybe just to announce something that we would like to do in the future, we would like to do state sums associated to these two-dimensional TTFTs with values in the pipe category of spans. So this kind of comes for free, but there are other partner moves that are more complicated. Good. Good. So then we can add Frobenius to the picture. So now we have pseudomonoids that are like monological categories. Then Frobenius is what you expect to be. It's the data of a co-unit, then you have a pairing that is non-degenerate, and then it's actually isomorphic to this particular span. When you have now an automorphism T. So this is related to Toby's question, what what are we getting when we talk about provenings? We talk about provenings. And what we get is something that is called paracyclic. There are different ways to understand paracyclic. I was aware that Walker is going to give a talk maybe tomorrow, and he's going to talk about Calabiao, is that right? So you will see some paracyclic structures, paracyclic structures floating around. But it's basically a property for this automorphism T. And let me just, that can be made very precise in terms. That can be made very precise in terms of simplicity sets. So you can consider this automorphism T and have some nice relations with the phase maps and the degeneracy maps. And things become cyclic if you have this Tn map and if it closes power of n plus one, you get the identity. So this is what is that is the usual cyclic. That is the usual cyclic that appeared in the Calabriao picture. But you can think of paracyclic to be a more general technique. And the result in the paper is that we can classify for Benius pseudomonoids with this paracyclic tusin. Can we go back to the previous slide real quick? Sure. So I think I have a few. How much time do I have? Sorry. Okay, so. In the general definition of Frobenius, there's only invertible two morphisms involved. All of those can be taken into one. Um do you have an analog for infinity categories that are not sets? So the Calabi-Halo classification works for any infinity category that's enough limits. And while a proof is not written up, there's a much more general correspondence which should include the two under similar conditions. So I think, yeah, so Walker's version of this classification of Calabiao and cyclic paracyclic was for infinity categories, but we can think of this as some sort of true case. Just examples, group points and bisections are examples of this for being a steamonoid. Partial addition, so following the BOORS expression, so this is one of the examples of this. Paracyclic and cyclic structures. I will just leave this slide there. That you can also do the same thing of Frobenius with commutative. So commutative and Frobenius together classify two-dimensional PKFPs. You can also do this with commutativity, but then we have to talk about gamma structures. So it's some sort of replace this kind of Z action by a symmetric group action. Action. And the result is that there is a correspondence between gamma structures and uncommutative structures for pseudo-monomes. So these two combined should give us the classification of two-dimensional TKFTs with values in two size. So I will leave it there. So thank you. Other questions? When you say commutative, that's truly strictly commutative, or is it like E infinity. So it's a set so far as if I ask if you now also have the verbatim structure on this, is there some compatibility between the gamma structure and the Paris that we are working. We are working on it, and I don't know if Walker or Rush have some. Yes, yeah. It's not as easy, yeah. So, in the usual case, Frobenis and commutative are totally, you know, you just have Frobenis and you have commutative, and they are separate. And then we are kind of thinking of under which conditions, or under, yeah, so if there's a way to compare them both, or if there are some instances in which one part Are some instances in which one partially implies the other. But for the moment, we don't. Two quick questions. So, your definition of non-degenerate pairing is much more restrictive than the linear algebra notion in the sense that you're actually specifying a dual basis. Is that your yeah, so inspired by the linear case in which you can kind of just the the pairing help you to go the other direction and you have multiplication, you can just the pairing and you can just go. You can just the pairing and you can just go backwards. That will kind of inspire us to do it in full generality for provenance. And that will help you to dualize in the sense of just reading the, like if you have multiplication and you have the snake action, you can also talk about commodiplication or quasi-titi. That the projection looked like identity, comma, some automorphism. Does that just follow from Solo Suela from non-degeneracy? It's directly from the SNAC relation. So, what you end up showing more explicitly is that the two projections have to be isomorphisms, but any such span where both of those projections are isomorphisms is going to be isomorphic to one of that form, because you take one of those isomorphisms, get rid of it through a two-isomorphism, and the other one you can't get rid of. So, yes, our construction of a stable kind of Yes, our construction of a stable category is parasymbic. Um what what is the pairing for that? So the co-unit, or the trace if you like, is going to be the extra degeneracy induced by the paracyclic structure. I have not worked out what the the area is, but it wouldn't be harder to write down. You're you're going to compose with uh like the square of tau one. The square of tau one composed one leg of the multiplication of the square of tau1. Is it just a shift? If I get it, call a shift by one? Uh either shift by one or shift by two. I'd have to double-check, but yes, shift by one. Because what you want is that the Nachya model works on the square of tau so that you can decense to cyclic states. So are there any new examples you can produce of activities which like a physicist would be excited about? I mean there are things that start looking like die craft within theory, like when you have a the example of the finite group, for example, that was given in the one kind of category level starts resembling to To a version of Chern signal when you have a finite group there. And then one could imagine that physicists might be interested in some variations of this kind of finite group, for example, when you have a finite group of it. And of course, the invariant that we got in the one categorical level is just things related to the genus. But I think physicists would be interested in seeing the state sum kind of construction out of this. Construction out of this. And I feel like, you know, if we just develop the 3-1 partner move and try to understand it better, then we should be able to obtain something that physicists might benefit from. So for the moment, it resembles these kind of finite age examples. Any more questions? We have ten minutes? We have ten minutes. Thank you. The Nakiano morphism is in any sound yet, basically. Get basically automorphisms, the order of the pairing, get different pose. Then, yeah, it's the same thing. I mean you can twist it by said but it's easy to square. Oh, the square is not going to be so there's a big plastic. I see so there's structure on the other side. Exactly. So what's the specific instructor on that spot? We don't have that example. No, it's not a set. That's like it's more complicated group with your space at. I think, of course, if you And there's of course the staircase diagram picture of the house. Yeah, I do. People stop staircase when they drive. Let's say it's a direct, let's say it's a stable. I do want to teach you top rooms, but that makes sense. We could just teach more like a state-sized. So here's it turns out that this stick is becomes kind of guardians. Once I know your initial row is like a zero and five objects and a zero again. If you look ten checks down, you get the exact same number. Oh, oh, this is an exercise. Yeah, trying to get a calendar. So You started with like just a sequence of groups. Robus Piol, after that, you get the original concentrated two. And so actually, like these patient maps, forget the ICA colour, they come with a symmetry. You could have just shifted. Come with the symmetry, we could have just shifted by two to go down ten rows, and then that would be without my claim then on the cyclic structure on these tools. Oh, so that's neat because probably that shift by two at least to match the algorithm. Exactly, exactly.
