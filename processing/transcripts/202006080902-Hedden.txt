Have really played a special role in my mathematical development. And so, while this virtual venue may lack the inspiration of the mountains, I'm still very happy to have this opportunity to connect with you all through mathematics. And for that, I want to thank John and John, Liam, and Hans and Burz for their efforts in making this happen. Yeah, in light of all that. Yeah, in light of all that's going on in the world right now, though, and since I'm the first speaker, I thought it might be appropriate to take a moment to quietly reflect on and honor all the many people who have lost so much to systemic racism and to the pandemic. So let's just take a moment. Okay, so now turning our minds to mathematics. The recording has stopped. So turning our minds to mathematics, I'd like to share with you some joint work with you. This meeting is being recorded with Catherine Rayox. So, do you guys hear that? Those voices speaking to me? Or is it just yes, we hear them? Okay. All right, I just want to make sure it wasn't in my head. So, this is joint work with Catherine Reacts, and the main question that we're focused on is the so-called minimal genus problem. And so this says: so, given a manifold X, and a homology class, a second homology class, and this may be, I mean, a second relative homology class, as I will for much of the talk today. The question is to determine the following quantity. The genus of the class, which is by definition the minimum genus over all surfaces embedded in my manifold whose associated homology class equals the given one. And so I'm going to focus today on this question in the case of smooth four-dimensional manifolds, and where the surfaces are always going to be smoothly embedded. Going to be smoothly embedded. If you relax the regularity to say topologically, locally flat, the problem becomes very different. And of course, if you change the dimension of the manifold, the problem will also have different flavors. So in this context, though, in the four-dimensional case, a quintessential special case of this problem is the Tom conjecture. And this asserts that smooth algebraic curves in the complex projective plane solve the minimal genus. Solve the minimal genus problem, or they minimize genus in their respective homology classes. And so the Tom conjecture was first proved by Kronheim Amrufka using cyber-Witten theory. And Olishvatzabo later proved a vast generalization of this that asserts that symplectically embedded surfaces enclose symplectic four manifolds, minimize genus, and their homology classes. And the key tool for these results. And the key tool for these results is a so-called adjunction inequality. So let me state a version of this. So let's let X four be a smooth closed four manifold. Four manifold. Maybe I didn't orient it. And T, a spin C structure whose associated Cyber-Witten invariant is non-zero. I could replace this with the Jose-Vatzabo four-manifold invariant if I wish. Then The evaluation of the turn class of that spin C structure on a homology class of a smoothly embedded surface sigma satisfies the following bound. sigma and x is a smoothly embedded surface and let's say with non-negative self-intersections so that I can state it cleanly although it has various generalizations to the case of surfaces with negative squared. So this is the key tool for proving these types of beautiful results like the Tom conjecture and its symplectic analog. And today I want to talk about And today I want to talk about a relative version of this problem, where I consider four manifolds with boundary, and I want to understand the minimal genus of surfaces in such four manifolds whose boundary is a fixed knot type in a given three manifold. And maybe towards the end, I'll also indicate how we might be able. Then also indicate how we might be able to address the problem for relative homology classes and four manifolds. So there's sort of two different things I could mean by relative. I could mean relative in the sense of a relative homology class where this is a knot and the boundary of X, or I could mean classes relative models. Relative homology classes where this is the boundary. So I have. And so what I'll focus on primarily is the first, and for the latter, we have some more recent results that I think have something to say about that. And the key tool that we're going to use here is not fluorohomology. And what we'd like to do is to come up. And what we'd like to do is to come up with relative versions of the adjunction inequality that incorporate information provided by Nauflur homology. So, let me just briefly recap this setup. So, if I have a closed-oriented three-manifold, then Osfa and Sabo describe a process to produce an invariant to this three-manifold, which first you Which first you represent the three-manifold by a Hagar diagram, sigma alpha beta W. So this is a pointed Hagar diagram. So we have a closed surface embedded in a three-manifold together with collection of circles bounding disks or specifying disks and handlebodies. Bodies that the surface separates the three-manifold into, and then a base point and their complement. And from that information, they pass to an associated 2G-dimensional symplectic manifold, the symmetric product of the surface. This is the configuration space of unordered G-tuples of points on the surface. And sitting inside of that, Of that manifold, there are two half-dimensional manifolds coming from the set of G-tuples of points that lie on the alpha-attaching circles and beta-attaching circles, respectively. And then we'd like to remove a distinguished codimension two submanifold, which I'll denote Bw. This is the G-tuples of points, at least one of which is the base point W. And so from this setup, we can. And so, from this setup, we can invoke a tool from symplectic geometry called Lagrangian Fleur homology, and we can produce a chain complex for that symplectic manifold relative to these two tori, it's generated by intersection points as a Z2 vector space. It's generated by intersection points of the two. It's generated by intersection points of the two submanifolds. And this, and so the differential on this, this is a chain complex. The differential on this chain complex counts pseudo-holomorphic disks connecting intersection points in this symplectic manifold. And this chain complex is what I'll call CF hat of Y, or more precisely, it's chain homotopy type. And so, a key feature of this, which And so, a key feature of this, which comes from the existence of this space point, is a direct sum splitting of the complex according to spin C structures on your three manifold, which if you're new to it, I would just take as you know, think of them as second cohomology classes, since they are in a non-canonical bijection with such classes. Okay, so. Okay, so this is a Hagard Fleur homology in a nutshell for closed three manifolds. And now the sort of next ingredient is when you have a knot sitting inside of your three manifold, then we can encode that knot with the addition of another base point. Another base point. Ah, sounds sort of new to technology, clearly. With an additional base point, so what you can think of this is as this is, you know, for maybe a more three-manifold-minded person, this is a one-bridge presentation of the knot with respect to this Hagar splitting. And so this gives rise to a filtration of the chain complex. But for us, let's see the thing that For us, the thing that is most salient here is that we get a further direct sum splitting of our complex along so-called relative spin C structures. So the complex splits further. C structure. So the complex splits further to what I'll call relative spin C structures. And these also have a cohomological interpretation. They're relative cohomology classes, relative second cohomology classes. And so we can use these relative spin C structures to endow our original complex with an extra grading. So we'd like to get a So, we'd like to get another sort of Z grading instead of a grading by cohomology classes. And the way we can do that is: so, pick a ciphered surface for our knot. And all we really need from the Seifert surface is its second relative homology class. And this group splits as H2 of y plus z if k is null homologous, which is again necessary in order to have such a ciphert surface. And from this data, now we can get an additional grading on our complex called the Alexander grading. Called the Alexander grading, which takes given a generator for my complex x, so this is an intersection point of these two tori, it has an associated relative spin C structure. I can take its turn class and evaluate it on the relative homology class of the Seifert surface and add the intersection product of the Ciphered surface with the meridian. Meridian. So if this is a no homologous not, that's going to be one. And the addition of this one is so that together those two terms become an even number, and I can divide by two. So this is now an integer. It's called the Alexander grading. And in terms of this Alexander grading, I can define a numerical invariant of a knot in the presence. Not in the presence of a non-zero fluoridomology class for y. I can define tau alpha of yk to be the minimum of the Alexander grading of any vector. Of any vector whose associated homology class, any chain or cycle whose associated homology class in this complex agrees with my given class alpha. So this is some number. Okay, so the question is, so what does this number do for us? And that's the, it gives us this refinement or Or a collection of inequalities bounding the genera of cobordizance between two knots. So the adjunction inequality that we have in this relative setting says if I have a four-manifold with a spin C structure. And let me draw a picture of, so that's the setup. Of so that's the setup looks something like this. So I have a four-manifold. Now suppose I have knots in the boundary. So this four-manifold is a coborism between two three manifolds, y1 and y2, and I have knots k1 and k2 and their boundary. And suppose I have a And suppose I have a surface smoothly embedded in the four-manifold whose boundary maps to k1 and k2, respectively. And so now I need some kind of floor homological assumption similar to the non-vanishing cyber-Witten invariant and the traditional absolute adjunction inequality. And so my assumption is that so spin C4 manifolds. Spin C4 manifolds induce maps on Fleur homology. And I'm going to assume that I have classes alpha and beta in the Fleur homology of Y1 and Y2, respectively, such that alpha is mapped to beta via this particular spin C structure on this particular. structure on this particular via this particular four manifolds map on HF hat. So given this setup, then we have something very similar to the adjunction inequality. So these are the terms you had in the initial adjunction inequality. But what we get is we get some additional information coming from these tau invariants that I just defined, these numbers. Invariance that I just define these numbers associated to the knots on the boundary. And again, the term on the right, the bound that we have is for the negative Euler characteristic of these cobordisms, just as it was for the adjunction inequality. So this is for any smooth sigma. Sigma cobordism from K1 to K2. Okay, and so maybe I should remark, I mean, if you're thinking clearly about this, you'll notice that this term and this term don't really make any sense because they involve a rel that what it looks like is this. What it looks like is this involves a relative homology class evaluated in an absolute cohomology class in the self-intersection of a relative homology class. And those don't make sense as stated. So, what I have to do to make sense of these is that notice, so let's let sigma hat be that surface, but I'm going to cap it off with ciphered surfaces. Surfaces. So these are ciphered surfaces for K1 and K2. So, and this is a good thing to do because you notice that my definition of tau of these knots, I mean, it involved the Alexander grading, which itself used a relative homology class. Used a relative homology class. And so these tau invariants depend on that relative homology class, but only up to an overall shift coming from the evaluation of the turn class of spin C structures on the difference of relative homology classes. Those are absolute homology classes. And similarly, these numbers will also depend on the choice of relative homology class, but those two dependencies will cancel each other out, and you'll get the same information for the total inequality. So you want this dependence. Want this dependence. And so, for that reason, I'll cap off these surfaces right there. But on the right-hand side, this is actually the genus of sigma. It's not the capped off surface. So, you know, we don't lose any information by taking sort of different ciphered surfaces. They're just there, they're along for the ride, just for their homology class. Okay. So, let me just very briefly sketch the proof or give you the main idea. Of how you prove a result like this. So it goes in line with Ospat and Sabo's proof of the corresponding result for the case of the three-sphere. For which the corresponding invariant is just simply denoted tau. And so, what we do is we thicken up the ends or we attach cylindrical ends to our cobordism. And then from there, we attach four-dimensional two handles. So we have, let's So we have, let's call this two handle x negative n k2. And this one will be xm k1. So xm k1 is the two-handle attachment along k1 with framing positive m. But now I reverse its orientation and regard it as a cobordism from m surgery k1 to K1 to Y1, and this is the boundary of this is Y2 K2. Oh, this is negative in surgery. So now inside this manifold, I have a natural surface that comes from capping off my extended surface sigma with the two handles of those of those, or with the cores of the two handles of those two handle comports. The cores of the two handles of those two handle cobordisms. Okay. And so now the key, the key here is that tau alpha K one controls when the The Kabordism map associated to Xm maps onto alpha and tau beta of K2 controls when the Kabordism map associated to the two handle at the other end maps. Maps beta non-trivially. And what I mean by controls is it controls in terms of we understand very well in terms of the algebraic topology here what the spin C structures on these on these two handle cobordisms look like. And tau determines for which spin C structures, which spin C structures on those cobordisms in terms of this numerology. This numerology map onto alpha and map beta non-trivially, respectively. Can I ask a question, Matt? Yes. So these tau alpha you're defining, I mean, what are their behaviors under concordance under connective? Yeah, I'll get to that. Yeah. Okay. Was that the only question? They are all concordance invariants. Okay. So that's the answer. Yeah. Yeah. So that. So what we use. So, what we use is we use this control that tau alpha and tau beta force on us to sort of put ourselves in a situation where the composed combordism, like W with these two handles attached to the boundary, map, we get a non-trivial map on fluoro homology. We pick some class alpha, oops, alpha tilde maps to alpha. By assumption, alpha. Alpha by assumption alpha maps to beta here and then we pick uh you know we use our knowledge of tau beta to guarantee that beta maps non-trivially so we get a non-trivial cobordism map for this extended cobordism and now i factor that cobordism in a different way so i look at a little neighborhood of the incoming boundary union a neighborhood of the surface that i have this capped off surface so this is a new surface or this is this is a this is a different This is a different way of looking at this extended four-manifold. And now we use. So let's call that manifold in this thickened up. So this is a neighborhood of the Kappa surface together with the neighborhood of the ends, the incoming N, and use an adjunction inequality. But this Kappedoff surface is not the one that you wrote originally with the ciphered surfaces. It's not the one with the ciphered surfaces. No, in fact, this one has the same genus as the surface that I started with because I'm just attaching disk at the ends. So we use a junction inequality for n, this neighborhood, to obtain the stated inequality. The stated inequality. Okay, and so somehow it boils down to sort of understanding all of these term class evaluations and writing them in different ways. So that's the kind of key idea. And I won't say too much more about it for fear of losing all my time. So, are there any questions? Any other questions about this? Okay. Okay. So let's come back to some examples now. And the first one that we should think of, well, maybe not the first one, but since John brought it up, I'll think the first one we'll state is that the trivial cobordism, y cross an interval, induces the identity map on fluir homology. Which is wonderful for us because that means that every fluorhomology class that you get that you have on y will produce an adjunction inequality. So you'll get bounds for the genus of surfaces in y cross I from every non-trivial fluorhomology class on y. And so this implies that every tau alpha is a concordance invariant, right? In the sense that if you have a smooth In the sense that if you have a smoothly embedded cylinder interpolating between k1 and k2 inside y i, the tau alpha will agree for every class alpha. And you should sort of think about this as like saying, well, kind of, of course, that's true, right? Because, you know, if the cabordism were more interesting, if it had more topology, then you would expect that topology maybe to allow for simpler surfaces to exist. Y cross I is kind of the minimal four manifold that exists that sort of, you know. That's sort of, you know, coming from Y, or the minimal four-manifold that has Y as its boundary. Okay, so another example is the case of the three-sphere. This was the case considered by Oswat and Sabo and Ras Newsen. And there, the fluorohomology of the three-sphere is particularly simple. It's just a vector space of rank one. And so we don't really only have a lot of. Space of rank one, and so we don't really only have one choice of fluoromology class to consider, and so we just denote that tau k. And this tau invariant has been very useful in the study of not concordance. It's a concordance homomorphism. It bounds the four genus, as you can see from the inequality that I wrote above, and it proves the Miller conjecture for the four genus of torus knots. As another example, As another example, let's look at the case of the three-manifold S1 cross S2. The fluor homology of S1 cross S2 is also very simple. We have a generator in dimension negative 1 half or Maslow in grading negative 12 and a generator in grading 1/2. So we have a two-dimensional vector space and we have two natural four-manifolds bounded by S1 cross S2. By S1 cross S2, we have S1 cross D3 minus a 4 ball, and we have S2 cross D2 minus a 4 ball. And so these give us cobordisms from the 3-sphere to S1 cross S2. And the first one sends One sends the generator here to what I'll call theta one-half, the top generator, and S2 cross D2 sends the generator of the fluorhomology of S3 to the bottom generator. And so if I denote by tau plus of A knot in S1 cross S2, the tau corresponding to the top generator, then this is a bound for the S1 cross B3 genus of K. The minimal genus of smoothly embedded surface is an S1 cross B3 bounded by the not K and tau minus Is a bound for the S2 plus D2 genus of K. And there's a, these invariants satisfy a type of monotonicity with respect to the H1 action on fluoro homology. And that gives rise to an inequality of this form because the top generator, there's an action by the by a non-torsion. By a non-torsion homology class on a three-manifold. So I had this action by, say, the circle inside S1 cross S2. It maps the top generator surjectively onto the space spanned by the bottom generator. And if you have elements that are related by the action in this way, then the thing in the image of the action has lower tau invariance. And so that produces this inequality that I have here. And that also shouldn't be surprising or Also, it shouldn't be surprising, or should at least be comforting because we know that there's an inequality. Oh, wait, sorry. I have my inequality the wrong place here. I have an inequality of this form between the tau invariants because the bottom generator is in the image at the top under the action. And that shouldn't be as come as a surprise because I have a clear inequality between these notions of four genera. Since if I have a surface, If I have a surface sigma in S1 cross B3, I can isotop it so that it misses the generator of pi, and then I can surger that generator to get S2 cross D2 and get a surface in the complement. So I have this inequality coming from topology. I have this inequality coming from properties of fluorohomology that reflects it. And maybe as one example, a concrete example. One example, a concrete example, I can look at say this not in S1 cross S2. It's like do zero surgery on one component of the white head length. Then the knot floor homology of this knot is in the different in the three in three distinct Alexander gratings. In three distinct Alexander gradings, one, zero, and minus one, I have a vector space of rank one, two, and one, respectively, living in Maslow gradings half, minus a half, and minus three halves, respectively. So this tells us that tau plus of k is equal to one, tau minus of k is equal to zero, because those are the only Alexander gradings where any fluor homology in the And gradings of half and minus half live. And indeed, the S1 cross B3 genus of this knot is equal to 1. And you can construct for yourself if you're interested surfaces that realize these. And the S2 cross D2 genus of K is equal to zero. So this bounds a disk in S2 cross D2. Can I ask another question? Yes. Another question. Yes. So if you have a two-component link, you can notify it, turn it into a knot in S1 times S2. Yes. And I mean, this example you've drawn is the notification of the Hoflink. Right. For alternating knots, we know that the tau invariant is minus signature over two. Yes. Can you, is there a similar result for link? Yeah, I'll state it in just a moment. Okay. So, yeah, so this, you know, S1 cross S2 and its connected sums of itself. Sums of itself play a very nice role, not just as some nice manifold that we understand, but because of its ability to give rise to link concordance and variance. So if I have a link in S3, or more generally, or any manifold with L components, then I can produce from this using a trick called notification a knot inside the connected sum. Inside the connected sum of L minus one copies of S1 cross S2. Or, you know, if you had a general three manifold, L minus one copies of S1 cross S2 connect some with that three manifold. And so you can take links in a three manifold and produce knots and no homologous knots in another three manifold. And so Miriam Koosberry and I had been studying this procedure for producing a group structure on linked concordance classes. On linked concordance classes. And part of what we had to do was establish that this procedure, while it associates a well-defined isotopy class of not in S1 to a link in the three-sphere or some other manifold, that procedure is also descends to concordance. And so what we get from this then, so given any Fleur class, theta, say in the Fleur Hamawachi of S1 cross. Of S1 cross S2 connected sum with itself, L minus one time, L minus one time. So this is just the vector space that we had prior, tensor itself, L minus one times. And so, given any class, what we have, we get We get an invariant, tau theta val, satisfying a bunch of nice things, which two of which you asked about. So they are concordance invariants. So for any class you choose in the So, for any class you choose in the floor homology of S1 cross S2, this vector space, you get a concordance invariant. Any one of them bounds the slice genus or the slice or other characteristics. So, this is the for this is for any surface sigma in the four ball with boundary the given length. We have a corresponding. We have a corresponding statement for surfaces embedded in negative definite four-manifolds with boundary the three-sphere, which I won't state. We have crossing change inequalities satisfied by them. And these crossing change inequalities, of course, apply to all the tau invariants in addition to the ones that I'm defining for links right now. We have a monotonicity result that says that the sort of top and bottom taus are Are related by an inequality. So you have the top and bottom mean, top and bottom graded floor homology classes for S1 cross S2. And we have this inequality of this form. So this allows us to produce actually concordance classes in S1 cross S2 or connected sums thereof that aren't in the image of nodification of links. And then finally, to coming back to your question. And then finally, to coming back to your question, if L is alternating, then tau theta of L is equal to the grading of theta minus the signature of L over 2. So that's the analog of the result for knots. And then if tau L bound is sharp, let's say tau tau. Is sharp, let's say top bound is sharp for links bounding complex curves. So we get the analog of the Miller conjecture for Taurus links. And if L is fibered, Then tau top of L equals the three genus of L equals the four genus of L if and only if L bounds a cipher if if the fiber let me say it this way if the fiber is isotopic Isotopic to a piece of complex curve, but he spelled correctly. So, this is an analog of a result I proved about tau for knots. And I should say that some of these results have been proved for almost certainly the same tau invariance in the special case of the three-sphere by Alberto Cavelo. He was using. Sphere by Alberto Cavelo. He was using grid diagrams. And so there's a little something to do to check that what we're doing is the same as his, although I don't have any suspicion that it won't be. And so he proved some of these results using different techniques. Okay, so that's all I want to say about links for the moment. I want to now say just a couple applications to contact geometry, which I found to be quite interesting. So there's this interpretation of tight contact structures, or maybe the definition, if you like, of tight contact structures. So given by the Elyashberg-Binnekin inequality. And what they show is that a contact structure on a three-manifold is tight if and only if the Thurston. And only if the Thurston-Binnekin inequality is satisfied. So Tb plus the rotation is less than or equal to negative Euler characteristic of sigma for all sigma in our three-manifold with Legendre and boundary. And tightness, as it initially was defined, I guess. It initially was defined, I guess, as you know, with respect to disks, but it's equivalent then to this more general thing about an adjunction type inequality for surfaces with Legendrean boundary. And so there was this special case and some other special cases as well, but the first one I think was due to Lee Rudolph that said that you have an analog of this inequality for surfaces. For surfaces in the four-ball with boundary, a Legendre knot and the tight contacts three-sphere. So, this is called the slice-Binnekin inequality, which itself is, you know, if you had it in your hand using other methods, would allow you to prove the Miller conjecture on a genus of Taurus knots, although he used the affirmative solution to that to prove it initially. And so, what Catherine and I have observed using our relative adjunction inequality. Our relative adjunction equality and an analog of this Thurston-Binnekin result for a tau invariant is maybe some indication that perhaps tightness is really a four-dimensional phenomenon. So, our conjecture says that a contact three-manifold is tight if and only if. Is tight if and only if you have an analog of the slice-binnekin inequality for surfaces embedded in y. And what led us to this, and perhaps as evidence for it, is that the conjecture is true for those contact three manifolds with non-vanishing contact invariant. Vanishing contact invariant. And so, as I mentioned, if you have the sliceman inequality inequality for the three-sphere, that allows you to prove the Miller conjecture. And more generally, it allows you to show that if you have, say, an open book decomposition for the three-sphere or for the tight context three-sphere, then a page of that open book minimizes genus for its boundary inside the four-ball. For its boundary inside the four ball. And so we'll conjecture an analog of this type of Milner conjecture, of this Milner, this genus minimizing property of tight open books. So suppose you have a fiber link, an open book induces Tight C, then the conjecture is that the fiber minimizes genus or Euler characteristic and Y cross I. And again, as evidence, you know, what we can prove is that we can prove this. Is true for those contact structures with non-vanishing contact invariants. If you have a fiber knot that induces a that gives rise to a contact structure with non-vanishing Ozvatzabo contact invariant, then the page of that open book or its fiber minimizes genus and Y cross I. Okay, so maybe just to conclude. So, maybe just to conclude, I want to talk about some more recent work, although all of this is still imminently to appear on the archive. But I want to just conclude with some applications to the rational Thurston norm and a slice analog of it. So, if you have a knot in a three-manifold, A three-manifold, which might not be null-homologous, I can define the rational genus of it to be the minimum of the negative Euler characteristic of all surfaces where this surface is embedded in y minus k with the boundary of s. The boundary of s equal to q times k. Say, so suppose that the, you know, if this is just the, if this is a null homologous knot, then q is equal to one. This is in this surface s, the cipher surface. If the knot isn't null homologous, but its associated first homology element is torsion of order q, then I might, then I'll have a surface embedded in the complement whose boundary is some q. Complement whose boundary is some q-cable of the knot k. I'll call this a rational ciphered surface, and I can define this analog of the genus of the knot. Okay, and but I can also do something slightly different. So now this is an idea first due to Turayev. So, given a first homology element in my manifold, Y, I can consider. Why, I can consider what you might call the rational Thurston norm. And what it does is it's asked us to minimize over all knots representing that homology class their genus. So, this is the minimum over all knots in the three-manifold whose associated homology class. Equals this fancy looking k that I've and so this is sometimes called the rational Thurston norm. It's an analog of the Thurston norm on second homology classes, but for torsion first homology classes And so I want to so there's this definition of what it means for a knot to be floor simple so I have this sequence of inequalities for not floor to modity so if I have a knot in a three manifold If I have a not in a three-manifold, I have the rank of the not fluor homology groups is bounded below by the rank of the floor homology groups, the total rank, and those in turn are bounded below by the order of the first homology of the three manifolds. So suppose this is a rational homology sphere. And we have equality if y is an L-space. That's the definition of an L-space. And we have equality here. We have equality here if k is what's called floor simple. Means that the chain complex, so the filtered chain complex has E2 page equal to E infinity page for its associated spectral sequence. And so Ni and Wu proved this really, I think, just beautiful result. They showed that if They show that if K is a flurry simple knot in an L space, then the rational Thurston norm of its associated homology class is equal to. Homology class is equal to the genus of that particular knot. So what this is saying is that if you have a flur-simple knot, so this is a knot with the simplest kind of knot-flur homology you could expect to have in terms of rank, then it's also simple from this geometric perspective that if you look at all knots in its associated homology class, this is going to be the simplest with regard to the genus of rational cipher surfaces. Rational cipher surfaces. So I thought this was really surprising when they first announced this. Note that there's clearly an inequality of this form just by its definition. And so what Catherine and I recently proved is that in fact, with the same hypotheses as above, these knots are even sort of These knots are even sort of more tightly constrained. So, in the sense that we can define the analog of the slice Thurston, the slice rational Thurston norm of this homology class, and that we also have fleur-simple knots minimized slice genus in this way as well. So, all this seems to point that fleur-simple knots are kind of very special. That flur-simple knots are kind of very special from a number of perspectives. These knots first came up in the study of the Berge conjecture and lined space surgeries. And so that's, you know, you'll see Fleur-simple knots arising as the knots that come from the cores of the solid tori in a lens space or L-space surgery. And so I think there's some more work to be done in this direction. We can use this to study, say, for L-spaces bounding rational balls, for instance, and probably in many other situations, the minimal genus problem, not for classes inside of a four-manifold relative, a knot, but relative. But relative a three-manifold. So, this is, you know, for instance, the classes that, you know, you can look at the first homology classes in a three-manifold that bound or that are in the kernel of the inclusion map to a four-manifold. We can start to analyze the minimal genus problem for the associated second homology classes that arise. And so, so, this theorem, this last theorem, was kind of the most technically involved, and we had to extend a lot of And we had to extend a lot of the sort of straightforward things for non-homologous knots to this case of rational settings. So there's a lot of numerology, and there are some kind of interesting ideas that have shown up at other places in the literature, but made an appearance here as well in terms of, you know, sort of analyzing the behavior of non-flow homology under cabling and the associated effect on tau invariance and what have you. So anyway, I'll stop there. So why don't we all unmute and clap? Unmute and clap. Okay, now you can mute back up unless you have a question for Matt. Can I ask a question? Yes. Matt, on the last theorem, which especially maybe in the sort of rational case about Case about that minimizing rational genus or genus in white cross I. Can you recover or reprove the results that I guess Adam Levine and Sasha and I did about non-orientable surfaces and like one space cross-sell. Yeah, we fall out of this as well. Yeah, we thought about that, yeah. But we haven't thought about it in the last couple months. Couple months. And we didn't do it the last time, although I don't think we ruled it out from being a possibility. But there were some sort of details to check. So it's not, I don't know the answer, I guess. Although at some point in my life, I sort of understood it better than I currently do. There was this picture, I guess, in some sense, you know. Some sense, you know, unorientable surface is really more like a, you should think of it as kind of like a orientable surface. You have the, you know, and if you had sort of higher multiple, you know, if you had a sort of the orientation reversing circle is kind of a circle that such that twice it bounds or something, bounds something orientable, where you could, you know, replace instead of having no. Replace instead of having non-orientable genus, you could have some kind of two-complex where you had a circle that and kind of the four-dimensional picture of a non-orientable cipher surface. In any case, it seems like there's some generalization of that, of our result that should be available by year. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think you're right. And I mean, yeah, hopefully, we'll get to that at some point. Okay, thanks. So it looks like there's a question from Yin Yi in the chat. He says, For the last question, can you prove it for a homology product with Y being a boundary component than Y times I? Oh, yes. Yeah, good question. Thanks. Are there any tricks or have you thought about the scenarios where you're not torsion? Yeah, you know, thanks to you, we thought about it. Yeah, so I appreciate it. Yeah, we you asked me a little bit about this last summer. And yeah, I mean, we thought about it. I think like there's there's things to say. In fact, there's a whole sort of other story here, which we haven't written down yet. Here, which we haven't written down yet, but which I think has proved to bear about like the when does a knot in a boundary of a symplectic manifold, you know, or maybe even just an almost complex manifold, when does an almost complex curve in an almost complex manifold minimize genus in its relative homology class? So, if you look at like over-twisted contact structures, you can produce, you know, you know, curves, you know, knots and over-twisted contact structures will typically. Will typically, you can produce lots of examples where they bound a complex curve and say the simpletization, but that complex curve is not genus minimizing. So tightness, but what we know right now is that if you bound, say, a strong symplectic filling, then bounding an almost complex curve in the strong symplectic filling, then that'll be genus minimizing in the relative homology class. But there's some kind of intermediary of which I think tight. Of which I think tight is included, and maybe even beyond that to some extent, where almost complex curves and almost complex four-manifolds will minimize genus in their homology class. That's something we're talking about. I think we understand what there's kind of an interesting theorem there. We don't, and I have in my mind to sort of try to make sense of the non-torsion. Sense of the non-torsion case regarding this because of precisely the examples that I think you're interested in. You know, S1 cross B3 with this sort of over-twisted contact structure on its boundary that's in the same homotopy class as the tight one. And so that's the key. If you have an over-twisted contact structure in the same homotopy class as the tight one, then I think you can get similar types of like relative Tom conjectures. In the null homologous case, I think we know how to prove it. And in the non-tor. Prove it. And in the non-torsion case, like you're after, that's something that is going to require a little bit more development on the not-fluorhomology side. And it's not totally clear to me that it's all going to work. So that's good to hear. Anyway, thank you. Yeah. So maybe let's save remaining questions for the discussion period after Robert's talk and thank Matt once more.
