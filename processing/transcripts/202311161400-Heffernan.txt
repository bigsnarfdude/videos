All the talks that I've been listening to have been like, Oh, I should say that or I should say that or I should remember to say that and I'm not going to remember everything, but it might also mean that I put too much in here. And so hopefully everything runs smoothly and we can go to a good question period. So thanks, Jonathan, for the introduction on immunology and immunity and my interest. So I'm really interested in anything, any research questions that are related. Any research questions that are related to how immunity is built up in the individual and how maybe that will decay over time, and the building up and the decays related to their natural history of vaccination and infection, and even what types of vaccines they get, and what types of variants of strains they're exposed to and get infected with, and how much immunity they even had at the time that they are exposed to something and then get a boost in their immunity. And then get a boost in their immunity, what's the boost look like? So, at the population level, we're also interested in trying to quantify what the distributions of immunity look like over time and how they change. And this is going to differ by age, maybe just geographic distribution, ethnicity can be just even looking at different cities, these distributions can change. This is going to also depend on, I mean, not only just. But it also depends on, I mean, not only just what we're circulating, even if we have the same childhood vaccination program, the two cities can be different in terms of what their distribution of immunity is like today, but our immigrant status is also going to modify the distribution of immunity that we have. And so there are lots of things that we need to think about. But what I really like to look at too is that not just these two things separately, but in combination, because the exposures The exposures you get, or the history of vaccination and infection that you have as an individual, depends on what's circulating at the population level. And the individuals that are infected and vaccinated also determine what is going to be circulating at the population level. And so we really need to understand this feedback loop where your immune systems, your initial condition, that's going to determine what your outcome of immunity is going to be after infection or vaccination. Is going to be after infection or vaccination. That then, if we're looking at infection, is going to then determine how transmissible you will be and how sick you will feel. You also need to think about your immune system as your initial conditions that are going to determine whether you get infected or what kind of boost you will get. And that's also going to be largely determined by stochastic models of your innate immune system in the avenues of the body. The avenues of the body that you are exposed to it the most. So we're looking at the immune system in the mucosa as well. So all this then leads to really trying to quantify the distributions of immunity in the population. Now immunity we know is dynamic. You can be boosted many times from infection or vaccination on this conveyor belt and effectively your immunity can Your immunity can decay over time as well. That decay can be related to probability of infection or probability, if infected, of severe disease. And that decay is related to not only maybe just the decay of antibodies or the change in your memory T cells or B cells in your body over time, but is also affected by the distance that the viruses or bacteria, whatever we're looking at. Viruses or bacteria, whatever we're looking at, evolve away from the immune system status that you have. And so we need to think about effective immunity as being related to your body, your immune system, but also what you're going to be challenged with or exposed to later. And so when we think about all of these things in terms of history of vaccination and infection, then we can get like cool models of distributions of immunity by age group and by status. By age group and by status over time. And that's what I'm going to talk about today: a model where we generate a graph like this that provide information of models that look at infection vaccination. Okay, so we're going to look a little bit at models of vaccination and infection in the body from COVID-19 vaccines and COVID-19 infection from different variants. From different variants. We're also going to look at a model of stratified by age, of different susceptibilities and different infections in the population by age, but also looking at the first and second and booster doses and infections in the vaccinated individuals in the population. But when we're really thinking about all of this, too, we need to be thinking about how our behaviors change. How our behavior is changing, how non-pharmaceutical interventions are also changing over time. And so we also have models on behavior in my group. And then we need to be also thinking about circulating strains. And so we've done some modeling on looking at the evolution or mutations that are occurring in the body and how that can, or looking at the probability of the transmission of new mutations in the body. Of new mutations in the body and what they affect in terms of what in-host components they're going to affect in terms of the viral replication and then transmissibility. We also have some statistical models where we're looking at real-time signaling of new variants of concern to see if using our statistical models and the sequencing data, can we flag the emergence of a variant of concerns? Of a very variant of concern earlier than what we experienced in the past week. So, lots of things to think about. Okay. So, in terms of COVID-19 immunity, what we're going to look at is tracking infections and vaccination by age. We want to get these distributions of immunity in the population. We've mainly focused on Edenavirus vaccination. On Adena virus vaccines, like AstraZeneca, an mRNA, Pfizer and Moderna, looking at how they affect the in-host immunity, looking at decay, the generation of immunity, and then looking at protective capacity. But we also have to track public health interventions and behavior. And so we've also compiled a database of all of the non-pharmaceutical interventions that have been enacted on by province and territory in Canada. By province and territory in Canada. And it's kind of similar to the Oxford database and the Oxford Stringency Index, but ours is different in terms of the number of categories. And we differ in some of our decision making versus the Oxford one. And we have this on a GitHub and it's publicly available. And we just had a paper accepted on it. So if you're interested in looking at our database in your models, then let me know. Then let me know. So, we're interested in looking at how all these things affect contact structure in the population, and then overall, looking at how all of these affect the effective susceptibility and effective transmissibility in terms of virus. When we're looking at immunity, we really think about, I mean, everybody thinks about antibodies. We also need to be thinking about the We also need to be thinking about the protective capacity of T cells, which are, sometimes you think about antibodies as being that first, I mean, the first line of defense is your innate immune system. It's in your mucosa and it's going to maybe get rid of pathogen before you even need to worry about your adaptive immune response. If things get through the mucosa and start to activate your adaptive immune response, the antibodies are usually thought of the next line of defense. Thought of the next line of defense. They're going to attach on to the virus, they're going to neutralize it, and that's going to determine whether you're going to get infected. The T cells are usually thought about the second line of defense, such that if you get infected, if the antibodies aren't good enough at stopping infection from happening, then the T cells are there that will modify the severity of infection that you're going to have. That you're going to have. Now, during COVID, there's been some evidence to show that T cell memory can also stop you from being infected. And if that's true, then that's going to affect the boost that you get in your immunity when it gets rid of it. So is there some activation of the T cells? Is there some proliferation? Is there some generation of new memory? These are things that we need to think about. So we think about protection against. So we think about protection against infection, protection against severe disease. The waning of these different components of the immune response can differ. So we look at waning rate of antibodies can be different from the waning rate of memory T cells. And the efficacy of all of these different things is also going to vary by variant of concern, especially when we're looking at immune escape mechanisms, which was a big question that we looked at during the Omicron infections. Omicron infections. So, in terms of our in-host models, we have developed in-host models for vaccination and for infection. On the left-hand side, we have an in-host model that we developed for mRNA vaccines, but this is very similar in structure to what we've looked at for AstraZeneca, as well as another model that we looked at for subprotein unit vaccines. Unit vaccines. And so, what we have here, though, for our mRNA vaccines, is we have our mRNA lipid nanoparticles get injected into the body. They then are absorbed into cells. So we then think that we have vaccinated cells. Those vaccinated cells then help activate the CD4 T cells. They also help activate the CDH T cells. The CD4 T cells then help activate the B cells to make plasma cells. Activate the B cells to make plasma cells, then start making antibody. There are different measurements that you can make in the body to get some indication of how these B cells and T cells are being activated and working. And usually what we get from clinical trial studies as well as our immunology collaborators is that we get some measure of interfering gamma, which gives us some sort of signal of CB4 and CB8 activity. We get some measure of interleukin, which is related. Measure of interleukin, which is related to CD4 and B cell, depending on what interleukin we're looking at. So, just generally, I'll just say interleukins, but there are many different kinds. And then we also get some measurement of antibodies. On the right-hand side, we have a similar looking diagram. This is for infection. And so, what we have is our virus. You have some virus in the body. It then infects target cells. The target cell. Cells. The target cells then go through what's called an eclipse phase, where they're infected, and then there's some time between the target cell being infected and then becoming a factory of new virus particles, which then it buds over time. Or it could also, for some diseases, it bursts and just releases new particles into the body. So the eclipse phase, when it's done, it becomes a productively infected cell, which starts letting new body. Which starts butting new virus particles into the body, and you can see then the butting right arrow gets pointed back to the viral load. The productively infected cells, they change their receptors on the cell surface. And then even you can also think that as virus particles are being butted out of the cell, then you can see the virus particles being butted and they can be recognized. Being budded and they can be recognized by the immune system. And so there's going to be some activation of the immune response. So the CD4T cells can recognize that there are now antigen-presenting cells in the body. There are other antigen-presenting cells that we're not going to model, but we're going to assume that the priming of the CD4T cells is proportional to these productively infected cells. And then these CD4T cells are related. These CD4T cells are related to some other measures that we get from immunology studies of people who are infected. So, we get some measurement again of an interleukin, measurement of interferon gamma. We could get some measure of antibodies, and then sometimes we also get this measurement of something called granzyme P, which depending on what disease you're looking at has different mechanisms of action. So, we take the data that we get from our immunology. From our immunology collaborators or studies from the literature that publish their data. And then we fit mathematical models like this to the data, also with information about what we also know about the infections that we're not so much worried about identifiability analysis. And then we can see what things come out of these models in terms of looking at antibody generation and decay over time and memory T cell occurrence. Memory T cell accrual and decay over time as well. So, this is just some examples of what we can get from our models. We're not going to talk about a ton what we did, but like this here is just looking at AstraZeneca. We were looking at what happens to the antibodies and the T cells if we separate our doses by longer periods of time and maybe also half or quarter the second dose to see what the effects of the immune response would be in terms of generating. Would be in terms of generating immunity because we were interested at the time in looking at conservation of being able to spread vaccine doses out to a wider population with lower levels of dose to see how effective that could be overall. These other graphs here are from a publication that we have in Scientific Reports, where we're looking at when we fit this model to clinical trial data for Pfizer and Moderna. For Pfizer and Moderna, when we're looking at dose one and dose two, so let's look at this graph here. We look at the peak level of antibody, and then we're interested in seeing what happens in terms of the decay of our antibody over time. And then we see, so this isn't predicted immunity remaining. So we look at, well, what, how many days post-peak, or no, post-dose one? Or no, post-dose one, do we have 75% loss of our peak level of antibody? And so on. And so, what we see here is that by day 190, we've lost 99% of peak from our Pfizer vaccine. And from Moderna, by day 238, we've lost 99% of peak. And so, while we were looking at this study, we were really trying to understand. This study, we were really trying to understand what the timeline should be post-dose one, and this is looking at 21 days and 28 days between the two doses. For Canadian data, we'll have to change. This is from data that went with the actual vaccine schedule. But we were looking at, well, when would we recommend the third dose? And so while we were doing this work, we were then recommending that it should be between 190 to 200. Between 190 to 238 days post-dose one, if you went by the original schedule for the vaccines for Pfizer and Hitter. And when we were doing this work, the CDC modified their recommendations to be in line with what we were actually finding with our in-house model. This is now also looking at infection. And so, what we did is we gathered data sets from Gathered data sets from the literature to look at different infection profiles. And so we have records of data sets from these different references that are from different time spans of the pandemic. And we fit our mathematical model to this data. Important to note that if you really want to understand the mathematical model and get good estimates for your pre-member values, you need some data that gives you that peak. If you don't have the peak, That peak. If you don't have the peak, just you don't know a lot. You don't have lots of certainty in your information. So we did, we fit that mathematical model to these data sets. At the same time, we have a, Mario Stroski is an immunologist at the University of Toronto, and he gave us a data set where we're looking at mild infections. So mild here means symptomatic. Moderate means went to a ward bed in hospital, and severe means going to an Hospital and severe means going to an ICU bed. So we fit our mathematical model to these data sets, all these different patients. And so we are looking at what type of information can we gain from this. What we see is that mild infections are shorter in duration than moderate, and moderate are shorter in duration than severe. We also see that these, if you look at interleukin 2, the peak values differ by mild, moderate, and severe. By mild, moderate, and severe infection. And when we comb into the literature, we also see studies that have similar observations. So, when we look at all of our vaccine studies, our infection studies, and the literature, these are some important observations that we need to take with us when we want to look at how to parameterize an EPI model so that we can look at generating distributions of immunity to get an idea of what the distribution. To get an idea of what the distribution of immunity looks like over age, that can then inform non-pharmaceutical intervention programs as well as vaccination programs by age. So through our model fitting, we see that immunity gained after infection correlates with the severity of infection, and immunity gained from infection and vaccination, they can wane over similar periods of time. We also see that mild infections are shorter in duration than moderate, moderate, In duration than moderate, moderate are shorter in duration than severe, and that your viral load correlates with your severity of infection and thus will affect transmissibility. So the more severe your infection, the more viral load you have. But we also need to consider that the higher the viral load you have, the more sick you will feel, the higher the probability you'll stay home or you'll go to hospital where then you're contained and you'll be less effectively, you're less transmissive. So, all the information then gets put into this EPI model of immunity and infection status. So, here we have our model that's by five-year age groups. We have in S1, we have our susceptibles that are totally susceptible to infection. S2 are people that had a mild infection, S3 are people that have a moderate infection, and S4 are severe. And S4 are severe. And here I'm changing the definition to be mild is asymptomatic, S3 is symptomatic, and so there's some probability that that type of infection will be reported. S2 will only be reported through contact tracing, or if you've gone to get tested because you're going to go visit grandma and you want to make sure that you're not going to spread infection to grandma or grandpa. And S4 is from a severe infection. And S4, we assume. And S4, we assume, go to healthcare, for sure. Some fraction of them go to hospital, and some fraction of those people go to IC. So the different shades of purple here give us an indication of what our assumptions are going to be on immunity. The darkest shade of purple means you're totally protected from infection. The next lowest shade is you have a high protection from infection. Protection from infection, but if you are infected, you have a high protection also against severe disease. For S2, you have a lower, like in between, so S1 is totally susceptible to infection, and then S2 here is in between S1 and S3, where you have some protection against infection. And if you're infected, then you also have some protection against severe disease. Now, the probabilities that you have mild, moderate, or severe infection are Mild, moderate, or severe infection are going to depend on your age, which depend on your comorbidity status. And we have the distributions of comorbidity status by age that affect the severity of infection that you will have. And that is published by Clark et al. And they publish these distributions for every country in the world. So we have a distribution specific for Canada. We're also interested in the beginning of the pandemic, understanding what Pandemic, understanding what our transmission parameter would be, or like our force of infection in those very early days. So, we chose a reproduction number that's in the middle of the range that Night and Mishra published in their study of, I think it was Toronto or Ontario. Do you remember? Doesn't matter. So, somewhere in the middle here, so we picked about 2.6. The waning rates of our immunity between these different shades of purple. Shades of purple originally were from some assumptions that we knew about other coronaviruses, but through our infection studies in immunology, we then were able to inform those a little bit better and actually found that our initial assumptions were in line with what we were thinking before. We also have to then, when vaccination came in, we have to look at first dose, second dose, booster doses. Booster doses. The shade of purple in the vaccinated class aligns with the same assumptions that we put on our similar shade of purple, this exact same shade of purple in the susceptibles, really to just minimize the number of new parameters and assumptions we'd have to put into the model. But we do a sensitivity analysis on them. And then down here, we just have the same diagram as up above, but now we can also keep track of all the infections that are in vaccinated individuals as well. Individuals as well. So, when we're looking at this model, this is the same model for five-year age groups, and we need to incorporate contact structure. We use the synthetic mixing matrices published by PREM Cooking JIT. And then we modify those synthetic mixing matrices depending on what non-pharmaceutical interventions are being implemented at during different Implemented at during different timeframes. And we had lots of meetings with the Atlanta CDC to determine how we would adjust home, work, school, and other for these different timeframes. And we really tried to simplify it down to four different mixing matrices. And this is what we get. So here's no mitigation. Here's phase zero is total lockdown. This is with work from home and some school closure. This is from Some school closure, this is from my schools being reopened and some work from home. But what we see overall, if we're just looking at contact rates, this age group, the 15 to 19 year olds in all of these mixing matrices, are going to have the highest level of contact. And when we were looking at vaccination programs, we did find, you know, we want to prevent severe infection and deaths and disease. So the rollouts of vaccine to healthcare workers and the elderly first. Vaccine to healthcare workers and the elderly first. In our model, also made sense. Those were the first things that we should do. But we also found that the earliest possible date that you could roll out a vaccine to the 15 to 19 year olds would be important because they indirectly protect all the other age groups with a high level compared to the other age groups. So, when we were looking at the non-pharmaceutical interventions, we had undergrads in the lab. We had undergrads in the lab that were gathering all the data, trying to understand how the non-pharmaceutical interventions are going to affect the contact mixing matrices and do some calculations. And so we also have a stringency index from our database where we also generate nice pictures in terms of timelines and looking at the different provinces and territories over time. So if you're interested in using this data, we're happy for other people to use it. It's free to use. For other people to use it, it's free to use. Just let me know if you're interested. Okay, so, but when we were looking at this model, we really needed to also understand how to calibrate this model to data. And so we use this parameter called kappa that we calibrate to either case reports or hospitalizations or deaths. You can calibrate it using whatever wit you want. And we assume that our kappa. Want, and we assume that our kappa parameter is linearly multiplied over the force of infection for simplicity. But this kappa parameter can incorporate lots of different things in it. And so it's going to incorporate PPE compliance and relaxation, social distancing compliance, testing rates changes, contact tracing rate change, changes in virus transmissibility, and the effect of weather. And these are different things that we've planned for future work to tease apart. Future work to tease apart so that we can really get an understanding we have of what K1 and K2 look like, so we can get a better idea of vaccine hesitancy as well as just behavior leaning. So what we do is we calibrate our Kappa to data. We choose some subset of data. And then after we do our calibration, we compare our outputs of our model to other data sets to see if they're in some agreement. And that helps us determine what our calibration is. Helps us determine what our calibration of parameters look like for Kevin. So, here's an example of our calibration where we're calibrating to hospitalization data. And here we're assuming that 15% of our severe infections go to hospital. This is our daily incidence. And so here is the data. Here's our 15% of I4 incidents. And then we looked at the incidence of I3 plus I4. Here, here's I4, I3. Here, here's I4, I3 plus I4, and then I2 plus I3 plus I4 is just so big that you just don't see it. And that gives us our daily incidence of cases. We also don't forget that we have by age groups, so we know what our daily incidence is by age and our severity of infection. So, this is what our Kappa parameter looks like. I mean, some of these things are intuitive. I'll just going to point out that right after Point out that right after delta comes in or Omicron, you can see this big increase in what kappa is, and that's because it's capturing the change in the transmissibility or the reproduction number of those variants. But those are things that we could tease out when we start using the data to tease those things out. And then, after we do our calibrations, we're then able to look at scenarios for projecting forward, like what-if scenarios that will give us ideas of what the way. Give us ideas of what the wave of infection will look like in the next few months, depending on what our population will be exposed to. So I know I'm running out of time. This is one thing that we did look at. So this was summer 2021. We were interested in trying to understand what was going to happen in fall and winter 2021. And so what we could see here, so red are our five-year age group. So, red are five-year age groups that are totally susceptible to infection. And we can see that there's a lot of individuals that are aged 0 to 30, where we don't have a lot of immunity. And so we recommended that there be some targeted vaccination program to 12 to 29 units. We can also see there's an increase in the blue and the yellow. That means that most of the infections that we're going to see are mild. Most of the infections that we're going to see are mild and moderate. When we look at the green, these are the people that are going to have severe infection. And we see a dip, but there's still severe infections that occur. But what happens is just the weighting out of that compartment is bigger than the number of infections that are going in. But when we look at the severe infections, we can see that 50% of severe infections are in age groups, 50 plus. And so we use that to recommend. And so we use that to recommend a vaccination program like a booster dose in those age groups, or at least to people who have high comorbidity stems. I didn't point out the white here. Those are our waves of infections, or infections are in the white. So depending on what assumptions we're looking at, we can get different distributions. Here, this big slope, and the green, the yellow, and the blue is sliding people down in a mute. The blue is sliding people down in immune class when Omicron comes in because Omicron has immune escape mechanisms. And we let people slide down in immune class over a month because it took a month for Omicron to dominate the system. Here are the outputs of the waves. So this is daily incidence arranged by severity and then age, where the lightest shades are the younger age groups, the darker are the older ones. And you can see severe, moderate, and mild. Moderate and mild infections. And you can see that we get quite a bit of infection in the younger age groups early on. And that actually aligns with the seroprevalence studies that were done and then we only more recently got the data from to show what level of infection was actually happening in children. So we can arrange it by severity and then age, or by age and then severity. We can compare our seroprevalence outputs to actual seroprevalence studies. To actual seroprevalence studies. And we do see that our model gives us really things that do align quite well when comparing to the outcome from CBS, so Canada Blood Services, as well as the ABC study, where they're looking at infections in people with different status of infection and vaccination over time. Just two more slides to say that we're also looking at clinical trials. We're also looking at clinical trials and looking at the inverse problem. So, if you give people a vaccine and you look at a clinical trial over three months and then you have so many people that got infected, well, what was the force of infection like over that period? What's the probability that they're going to get infected over that time? So we're looking at that inverse problem and trying to generate what the distribution of immunity looks like from the vaccine at the time of vaccination. We also generate We also generate mutations in individuals and look at what's the probability that a mutation is going to be able to be, or at least one instance of that mutation can be transmitted to another individual. And we find that when we're looking at the fitness of these mutations and how they affect the in-host infection probabilities or fitness, replication, like different parameters instead of in terms of clearance. Instead of in terms of clearance of a virus and death of cells and changing to that eclipse phase, if we're looking at the range that is observed in the literature, in household studies, we see that if we change the eclipse phase, we can really get a huge increase in the probability of transmitting at least one unit, one mutant to someone else. Doesn't mean that it infects that other person, though, it's just the transmitting. Person, though. It's just the transmitting. And so we're really looking at these population bottlenecks and trying to understand if a mutation just changes the death rate of infected cells, we don't see a huge change in the probability of transmitting at least one mutant. But if the mutation changes the clearance rate of the virus by the antibodies, then we see a higher level or a higher probability of transmission. So we're trying to understand how the in-host information. How the in-host information can be transmitted to transmissibility, and tried then to understand the different SNPs that we see in the different variants and what those SNPs do to provide immuniscape against this model. The last thing is over the pandemic with my colleague Matt Betty, we took lots of projections from other people here, like David and Carolyn's groups, as well as projections. Carolin's groups, as well as projections for the waves forward. And we worked with Ellen Diener at Health Canada to get an understanding of what healthcare demand would look like, as well as trying to quantify the change in the length of stay by individuals over time and ward and ICADs. So I'm going to skip this, but just put this up during the questioning period. This is a figure that Carolyn drew for. That Carolyn drew for a grant that we just put in to look at all these different phases or different stages of where modeling can help in biopharmaceutical development. I'm just going to say that this work is funded by a lot of different agencies. We also have behavior modeling with EM. We have statistical modeling trying to understand the different signaling of new variants of concern arising. And thank you for listening. I know there was a lot of stuff in this presentation. Hopefully, we have some time for a couple questions. Hopefully we have some time for a couple questions. So there are some
