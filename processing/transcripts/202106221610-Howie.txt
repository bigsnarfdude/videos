So, we're going to be looking at spanning surfaces for knots today. And just to avoid some exceptional cases, we're not talking about the unknot. Every other knot's fine. Just forget that unknot exists. And X is going to be the exterior, the not exterior. So, compact three manifold with torus boundary. And just for motivation. And just for motivation, I'd like to remind you of this open conjecture called the Neuworth conjecture, or at least the geometric version of that conjecture is still open. And this says that for any knot, there exists some closed orientable surface in F3, in S3, which contains the knot, such that the complementary part of the surface is both connected and essential. Okay, and this is connected to spanning surfaces because there's this, well, there was this conjecture of Ozawa and Rubenstein, which said that if you have a knot that's not a torus knot, then there exists an algebraically essential one-sided spanning surface for that knot. Now, this would imply the Neuworth conjecture because we could just take the boundary of a regular neighborhood of this knot, sort of join the boundary components up by a little annulus containing the knot, and that would. Annulus containing the knot, and that would give us a Neuworth surface. And so this seemed like this has sort of been sort of one of the main approaches to try to prove the Neuworth conjecture for various classes. Unfortunately, it's not true. So a few years after that, Nathan Dunfield found some counterexamples. So in particular, he found five knots, four of which are twisted torus knots. And I found this quite surprising. And I found this quite surprising when this happened, but they do not bound algebraically essential one-sided spanning surfaces. Okay, I think this came out like the week I was trying to submit my thesis, and like the day before I had to go back and like add this in a whole heap of places. It was interesting and timely result. And so let me just remind you what I mean by essential. So there's two notions, especially when we're talking about. There's two notions, especially when we're talking about one-sided surface, there are two distinct notions of what essential means. So, for a spanning surface, we say it's algebraically essential if the embedding of the surface induces an injection on the fundamental groups. Okay, and there's also a geometric notion, geometrically essential, and so this is what we mean when we say the knot is the surface is incompressible and boundary incompressible. Boundary incompressible. So this means that the surface cannot be simplified by surgery along a disk. Okay, so for two-sided surfaces, these two notions are equivalent, but for one-sided surfaces, they are not the same. So algebraically essential implies geometrically essential, but the other direction is not true. And so here's an example, this knot down here. So first, I mean, This knot down here, so first, I mean, here's a spanning surface, it's just some surface in S3 whose boundary is the knot. This one here, the shaded one, happens to be a once-punctured Klein bottle, and that's geometrically essential, but it's not algebraically essential. There exists some sort of like singular compressing disc for this surface. Okay, and the reason these two notions are different for one-sided surfaces. Two notions are different for one-sided surfaces is because the loop theorem just fails for one-sided surfaces. Okay, and this is sort of an indication of an example of where it fails. The other interesting thing to keep in mind with one-sided surfaces, if you're not used to thinking about them, is that usually with two-sided surfaces, if we have an incompressible surface, then it will automatically be boundary incompressible. But that's not true for one-sided surfaces. So there do exist ones which are geometrically incompressible. Geometrically incompressible, but also admit boundary compressions. Okay, so once we've established these two notions are different, there's also another conjecture we can make. This one is still open, and that says for any non-trivial knot, there exists a geometrically essential one-sided sphinx surface. Okay, so this was asked by a question by Ichihara Otugi and Otugi and Terugaido, and then Ozawa and Rubinstein stated this as a conjecture. And this is still open. Those counterexamples of Dunfield don't apply to this case. It's unclear whether they satisfy this or don't. And this has been proven for a lot of knots, a lot of classes of knots. So, in particular, alternating knots, Taurus knots, Montesinus knots. Montesinos not. There's a whole heap of more classes, and I haven't written down the names of all the people who proved these things. I mean, I think many of them are registered for this conference, but there's a lot of knots where this conjecture has been proven. But one particular case where it's still open is in particular for positive knots. Okay, so it's not known if a positive knot satisfies this conjecture. This conjecture. Okay. But there's another thing sort of to keep in mind here is that a boundary compression of a spanning surface is not necessarily going to produce you another spanning surface. If your compressing disk sort of like winds around the knot a lot, you might find that when you do the boundary compression, you end up with a surface with a non-integral slope. Okay, so maybe just. Okay, so maybe just this notion of geometric being geometrically essential is not quite the right notion if we're just trying to understand spanning surfaces. So we're going to make sort of a modified sort of specialized definition that's going to work better for spanning surfaces. And this is going to be the notion of a meridional boundary compression. So what we do is we imagine we have a boundary compressing disk here for the surface. For the surface, and so what that means is that the boundary of that disk splits into two arcs. One of them, alpha, lies in the interior of the surface, the other arc, beta, lies on the boundary of the three-manifold. And so, if we think of how this maps into the not complement, beta is going to lie on this boundary torus somehow. We're also going to see the boundary. The boundary of our spanning surface sigma, and together they're going to form this little sort of theta graph. We get something like this abstractly. And we're going to say if one of the two cycles in that theta graph is actually isotopic to a meridian on the boundary, then we're going to call that a meridional boundary compressing disk. And the advantage of this is if you only allow meridional boundary. If you only allow meridional boundary compressions, then whenever you apply it to a spanning surface, you can only get another spanning surface back. Okay, so compressions and meridional boundary compressions will keep us within this class of spanning surfaces. And then the sort of the natural definitions to make, we say it's a spanning surface is meridionally boundary incompressible if there are no meridionally boundary compressing disks. Boundary compressing disks. And similarly, a spanning surface will be meridionally essential if it is incompressible and meridionally boundary incompressible. Okay, and so I read this quote the other day of, well, I'm not sure if it's an actual quote, but Conway's introduction to Pollya's book, How to Solve It. And it's either a typo or a misquote, or maybe Conway's making some sort of deeper comment. Making some sort of deeper comment, but he said, if we have a problem that we cannot solve, there is always an easier problem that we also cannot solve. So in the spirit of that, I'm not sure if it's a real quote, but that's what is printed in the introduction. So we make the following conjecture. And today we're going to call it a conjecture star. This is a little bit weaker again. It says that there exists a meridionally essential one-sided spanning surface. A one-sided spanning surface for any non-trivial NOT. Okay, so this is now getting pretty far away from the Neuworth conjecture. This is neither going to imply nor be implied by that conjecture we mentioned at the start, but this is still sort of interesting just to study like what sort of surfaces, vanish surfaces that are out here for and not. Okay, so for now, let's just stop thinking about essential surfaces for a little bit and let's try and understand. Bit and let's try and understand all spanning surfaces for a knot. And this leads to what's called what I call the geography problem for spanning surfaces. And so this is asking, given any pair of integers here, one of them which represents the slope of the surface and the other one its first battery number, which ones can be realized by spanning surfaces for a given knob? Okay, and so there's so Okay, and so there's similar geography problems. There's a few in four-manifold topology. In fact, there's one, Samantha Allen, has some nice recent work on a similar problem, but where you allow your surfaces to live in the four-ball. But this is sort of an easier version of that. We want to understand all the surfaces in the three-sphere which span a given knob. Not up to isotopy, just up to this discrete data of slope and first B number. Betty number. Okay, so let me just remind you what those are. So the first Betty number is just the rank of the first homology. In this case, it's one minus the Euler characteristic of the surface. For the slope of a surface, so not even a spanning surface, any properly embedded surface, we can think of the homology class of the boundary of that surface. We can write it as an integral combination of the canonical meridian and longitude. And then these coefficients, these p and q, they give you. These p and q, they give you some fraction or infinity, which we call the slope of a surface with boundary. And if our surface is a spanning surface, well then actually the slope has to live in, it has to be an even integer. So it has to be an integer because we're just wrapping once around the knot, that means q is one, and it has to be even because this boundary, this homology class has to be zero in z mod 2, z. In Z mod 2Z homology of the knot exterior, that's generated by the meridian. So we need to see an even number of meridians, and hence P here is even. There's some bigger theory that applies here. This is really coming from the four manifold world, Steuffel-Whitney classes, and so on. Whitney proved, I guess this is 80 years ago now, if we apply it to our situation, it says if we have a spanning surface, then Have a spanning surface, then the first Betty number must have the same parity as half the slope. Okay, so this is this had a four-dimensional proof. I put my initial there, I probably shouldn't, but anyway, I can give a sort of a three-dimensional proof of this result just using spanning surfaces, how they intersect, and applying our Banchov's theorem. So it's nice that it's more down-to-earth for us three-manifold people. The other Uh, people. The other big result that applies here and really narrows down the space that these surfaces can live in is this result of Gordon and Litherland. Well, maybe this is sort of a corollary of their main result. But if we have a spanning surface for a knot and little sigma here, so maybe bad notation, but little sigma is the signature of the knot, well, then the first Betty number of the surface has to be at least the absolute value of half the square. The absolute value of half the slope plus the signature. So if we start plotting all these points in the plane, which points are possible, well, this tells us that we find this point which is negative two times the signature that sits down on the s-axis. And then all the surfaces must live in this sort of cone, this what I call the Gordon-Litherland cone above that point. Above that point. Okay, and then Whitney's parity condition is telling you that these all these other missing points can't exist. So, this is a good start. This is like any spanning surface has to live in this space. And what's really going to happen in general is that some of these ones down the bottom won't exist. But studying meridianly essential surfaces will be able to understand which ones can exist. Okay, there's another invariant here I'm not going to say too much about today, which is also sort of narrows down the space. It's called the spanning surface defect. It's something I was thinking about in my thesis, but actually the name is due to Ito from a couple years ago. And this gives some measurement of how far your knot is from being alternating. So this defect is going to be zero if and only if the knot is alternating. And only if the knot is alternating. And then, as it increases, it takes on positive integer values that is giving some measurement of how far you are from being alternating. So it's a sum, you take any two spanning surfaces, add up their first betty numbers, subtract half the difference in their slopes, and then we minimize over all pairs of spanning surfaces, divide that thing by two, and this is this invariant. Okay, I'll show you in a few slides. Okay, I'll show you in a few slides how this sort of affects the picture view. But a couple other things that help us understand the space is to think about if we have a spanning surface, what happens if we apply compressions or meridional boundary compressions to it? Well, a compression decreases the first Betty number by two. It doesn't do anything to the slope because it's happening away away from the boundary. Whereas a boundary compression is going to a meridian or Compression is going to a meridian or boundary compression is going to decrease the first Betty number by one and it's going to change the slope by either plus or minus two. So that tells us if we start with a spanning surface, we should just compress and meridionally boundary compress until we can no longer do that. We'll end up with some spanning surface and it will be meridionally essential. So if we can understand the meridionally essential surfaces, we'll understand this entire geography problem. Entire geography problem. And sort of going in the other direction, there's this easy trick. If we have a surface sigma here, and we go ahead and do this sort of, I guess it's a Reidemeister one move, there's two ways you can do that. We think about what's happening here. The surface sigma prime is just an isotopy. But for sigma, its topology changes. It becomes sigma prime. B1's increased. We've got this extra loop here. This extra loop here, and the slope is changing by plus or minus two. So that's saying whenever you have some point in this space, you can sort of build everything in the cone above it just by repetitively applying these moves. So here's an example. This is a concrete example. This is like the actual numbers, the actual space for this knot. I usually just draw cartoons, but this one I sat down and worked it out. And so here's the knot 16. And so here's the knot 6-2. It's an alternating knot. So the first thing we look at is we've got this Gordon-Lutherlin cone. Everything must lie inside there. Since it's alternating, we do see surfaces on the extreme rays. These two are the checkerboard surfaces in the reduced alternating diagram. There's also a Seifert surface, which is meridionally essential. It's a two-sided one. And then there happens to be one other meridionally essential. One other meridionally essential surface. Okay, there's a, I guess Hatcher and Thurston can tell you this, or Adams and Kindred have an algorithm for alternating knots that will tell you what this space is. Okay, so that's one example. Let me do another quick example. So here's a Taurus knot, T53. We did see this knot earlier. Again, you start with this Gordon-Litherland cone, but now the defect is one. This is an Is the defect one? This is a non-alternating knot, but it does have alternating diagrams on the torus. And so, what this means is this extreme ray here actually gets moved in by one. And you have this defect cone, which is now at height one, and all the surfaces must live in this sort of defect cone. And then it turns out there's only, well, for torus knots, there's only two meridianly essential surfaces, which I proved recently. Which I proved recently, you always get a siphon surface, and you always get this other surface, which I have started calling the pterygoido surface. That's the unique surface that realizes the cross-cap number of a torus knot. Okay, so this is the one we saw earlier. It's not algebraically essential, but it is meridionally essential. And it turns out it's actually even geometrically essential. Okay. And so this geography problem, well, it's been solved. I'm not quite sure what I mean by solved, but maybe like there's some sort of algorithm to compute this space of the possible pairs that can be realized by spanning surfaces. So for two-bridge knots, this follows from the paper of Hatcher and Thurston. They understood all surfaces in a two-bridge knot complement. Then Hatcher and Etel did something similar for Montesinos knots. Did something similar for Montesinos knots. Maybe not quite everything to solve this geography problem is in that paper, but subsequently, other people have done things in the literature on Montesinos knots. And there's enough there that you can sort of put it together to answer this problem. Then Adams and Kindred, and I guess this is really the paper that sort of inspired me a few years ago to think about things this way. They solved this problem for alternating knots. Alternating knots. And basically, you just have to look at you take your reduced alternating diagram and you look at all the state surfaces or what they call basic layered surfaces. And that will be enough to find at least if a slope contains a marinely essential surface, it will find the one with smallest V1. Okay, and then also recently I can prove the solve this problem for torus knots. But anyway, this problem is sort of in some sense, it's actually completely solvable. So I can prove that there is a normal surface algorithm to solve this problem. You have to, you know, your surfaces aren't necessarily geometrically essential, so there's a little bit of work to show that they can actually be put into normal position. But if you choose an appropriate triangulation, there is a triangulation you can choose where this will work, and then applying results. Work and then applying results of Jayco and Sedgwick to one-vertex triangulations, you get an algorithm. There's enough surfaces that you're interested in will be found amongst the fundamental ones. Okay, and hence there's also an algorithm to compute this defect. Okay, so that's the geography problem. Let's try and apply this to conjecture star and see what it tells us about that. Well, this conjecture. Well, this conjecture about the existence of meridionally essential surfaces, the only way it can fail is if every one-sided surface compresses and meridionally boundary compresses to a two-sided surface, to a two-sided spanning surface. So that gives us this lemma that says that if our first Betty number, if we can find some surface whose first Betty number is small compared to its genus, then the knot will satisfy this condition. Then the knot will satisfy this conjecture, okay? Because there's sort of this cone of surfaces above the surface. If we can find anything outside that cone, then we're done. That thing can never compress to something two-sided. And so then we get the following theorem, which is, I guess it's really two theorems, but put it in one. And what this is saying, well, if the defect is less than twice the genus, what this is saying is saying if the knot is close to being altered. Saying if the knot is close to being alternating with respect to its genus, then it will satisfy the conjecture. And also, if the knot is close to being positive relative to its genus, then it also satisfies the conjecture. So, m almost positive here means all the there's some diagram where all the crossings are positive, except up to m of them are negative. Okay, so in particular, this proves conjecture star for positive knots, okay, which was. Of knots, okay, which was unknown for the geometrically essential version. And sort of the proof of those statements: well, the first one: if the defect is less than the genus, it means there must be some surface sitting out here on this defect cone that's not inside the cipher cone. And so then that's going to give us a one-sided meridionally essential thing. In the positive case, well, you take your M almost positive diagram. Almost positive diagram and look at its checkerboard surfaces. There's two of them, and on average, they're going to lie on this purple line. But that's on average. But what happens if one of them moves off this way, the other one has to move off by an equal amount in the other direction. And it turns out there's always going to be at least one surface that's not in this cipher cone, so must satisfy conjecture stuff and then conjecture. And in conjecture one, that I mean, I just mentioned that it includes all the almost alternating knots, derived low-terive genus knots, knots with low alternating genus, so on. And in particular, this is enough to establish this conjecture for all knots with at most 12 crossings. Okay, and maybe this 12 can be made higher, but I just don't have the data to check. But not the news is not all good. The news is not all good. Not everything can satisfy conjecture star by these check tricks. At some point, someone is going to have to get their hands dirty if we really want to prove this thing. So a particular class where this is unknown would be knots which have genus one, but their free genus, meaning the cipher surface whose complement is a handle body, that free genus is larger than one. We expect many of these knots to have a defect. Many of these knots to have a defect too, and so they are not going to succumb to this full cheat trick. All the knots are going to all the surfaces are going to be contained in the siphon pan. Okay, and then one more example. Let's apply this theorem to Dunfield's knots, which don't bound algebraically essential ones. So, four of them were positive, three of those are twisted torus knots. So, they So, they the previous theorem applies. The fifth one is this twisted torus knot, which is a lot of strands twisting negative one way, and then a lot of strands twisting in the other direction. So it's very far from being positive. But the good news is I played around and I found a better diagram of it. So instead of 262 crossings, now it only has 111. And if we look at this shaded surface, it has slope of 100. It has slope 110, it has first bedding number 53, and it turns out that's enough to satisfy the previous lemma. So it's going to sneak in, it's going to have a meridianly essential one-sided surface. And in fact, you can see here there's like many compressing disks for this gray surface, right? It's compressing disks everywhere. So really, you can compress and meridionally compress a lot to get a simpler surface in this case. Okay, I'm pretty much running out of time. Let me just quickly mention another application of this geography problem. So there's this theorem of Ichihara, Otugi, and Teragaido, which say if you have a knot which bounds punctured plein bottles at different slopes, then the distance between those slopes is at most eight. If it is eight, then the knot has to be a figure eight knot, and otherwise, the difference between these slopes is at most. The difference between these slopes is at most four, and it's well understood when there's, I mean, I think it's only the negative two, three, seven pretzel also has two prime bottles at two different slopes. But we can prove this theorem. So now let's suppose we have two one-sided spanning surfaces whose first Betty number is equal to the cross-cap number. And if these surfaces, the distance between them is the maximum possible, four times the cross-cap number. Possible, four times the cross-cat number, well, then the knot must be alternating, and in fact, its crossing number must be twice the cross-cat number. So, this is a finite list of such knots that have these surfaces. And in particular, we can run through the case if the cross-cat numbers three, the maximal distance between those surfaces is 12, only the knot 6, 3 has this property. For cross-cat number 4, we can say something similar. There's only a list of four knots here. There's only a list of four knots here which have the maximal difference between their boundary slopes. I'm conscious of just the fact that I'm like probably going over time, so let me not say too much about those. And let me just mention quickly that this has all been about spanning surfaces, but really a lot of these results in some sense can be extended to just once-punctured surfaces that are not complement. Is in a not complement, so even allowing for a non-integral slope. Often slopes are sort of you want to look at the fairy graph. So now before we had this geometry, a geography problem and all the slopes just lay in a line, but now the slopes are not really linear. What we do is we take this fairy graph, we delete all the points which have even denominator, throw away those vertical. Throw away those vertices, throw away all the edges. We get this thing called the Merbierspan tree. And this can be used to study possible slopes of once punctured surfaces in a knot complement at a fixed first Betty number. Okay, so now you're going to see this is going to be this graph, this tree gives sort of this infinite tree, all the vertices are infinite degree. That tells you sort of whether sort of. That tells you, sort of, where the sort of as a way of representing where the slopes are, and then above those slopes, you'd have some minimal first B1 that is sort of the minimal possible above each slope. And again, you'll get this finite sort of collection of cones over these vertices. Okay, so let me stop here. Thank you. Okay, thank you very much. Are there any quick questions? Just a quick question. What's the motivation for Question: What's the motivation for this terminology? The Mobius Band tree? Oh, so that's what Loretta called it. So she has this on as it's on the archive, but it never doesn't seem to have been published. But she was trying to understand one-sided Higard spillings of like filling the figure eight knot. Yeah. Right, okay. And it's really because, like, as you move, you have some point, and say, there's like a punctured climb bottle here. A punctured climb bottle here, then everything that's distance one is going to have some surface where B1 is three. So you're sort of adding on a Mervius band each time you move along one edge in this tree. Okay, thank you again. Let's reconvene in about five minutes, which would be 2.45.
