   Yeah, right because two pi d was the volume was the volume of the of the d torus okay and so uh something that will didn't say that explicitly was essentially the he explained the iteration scheme uh for the second moment but essentially it works as long as we bound the As long as we bound the quantity, we only need to bound the quantity L1, which I'll write down again. Sorry, not, I skipped, I went ahead too early. Oops. So P T is our heat kernel. Wait, hold on. This is. And then the same thing for the same quantities in X naught prime, Z prime, and X. x0 prime, z prime, and x, and x prime, as above, multiply by the correlation function. Sorry, he's going to try to keep on top with his notation. f alpha rho z z prime. Of course, we can't write x minus z and stuff anymore because we don't assume group structure on general compact manifold. And the idea is so first. So, first, I will write down two results from this paper by Brosamler in 83, where there's an exponential type bound for the heat kernel. Okay, and this absolute value xy is the Riemannian distance function between the two points x and y and also Also, F alpha rho, I should sorry. F alpha rho is comparable to one for alpha grave and D or two. One plus this somewhat strange function. For alpha equals the over two. This is not going to matter that much because, sorry, this is this should be. And then finally, for alpha less than d over two, we have this Ries kernel type singularity on the diagonal. This is trivial. For this is trivial when we apply it into the bound. So, and this is worse. The third one is worse than the second one. So, we only need to worry about this because this is the worst case. And then also, because of the roles of because of the symmetry of T minus S and S in the heat kernel. S and S in the heat kernel, we only really need to worry about one of them. So from this point forward, essentially, I'm going to just have the same integral up here copied, except with D over 2. Okay, and now for, and the other one can be dealt with in the same way. And the other one can be dealt with in the same way. And I'm going to apply this upper bound here. Sorry, I shouldn't times here. And then what happens is, so in large time, so if you fix epsilon and for Epsilon and for t greater than epsilon sorry I'm I'm going to write in blue for t greater than epsilon because there's not going to be very long uh this quantity is this quantity is is less than or equal to uh a constant in epsilon and and then And and then this is concentrated near near x naught. And the same thing with the other variables. So this becomes a pretty easy calculation to do to show that, in fact, for all compact manifolds, we would get a bound in large time. This result was, I believe, first suggested by a paper written by Suggested by a paper written by Sammy and Frederick. I don't know if Frederick's online right now. The issue is in, okay, so now, okay, so if we place an arbitrary positive lower bound on time, then there's no issue with this. The issue is, okay, what happens in small time? In small time, so a minor deviation from the A minor deviation from Will's thing earlier. We're not going to divide by the heat kernel. We're going to divide by this upper bound. Which maybe Maybe now I'm going to call this whoops. I'm now going to call this capital G. So the right-hand side. And then, of course, multiply by it also. And then we're going to. And then we're going to apply the and we're going to apply the upper bound to both of the we're going to apply the upper bound to both of the heat kernels above. And essentially, we're going to be dealing with this quantity where And inside the exponential, we would have one over two s times t minus s over t again. So we're trying to, essentially, we're trying to make this a single Gaussian because that is possible on Rd. And if I let A equals to S over T, then what comes inside after dividing is inside after dividing is a times one minus a x not x squared minus one minus a times x not z squared minus a times z squared. So this I should use red now. This here I will This here I will call negative negative f of z x naught x and essentially we're trying to study this term so on R D F Z X Y would be equal to would be equal to Would be equal to the square of Zw where W is essentially W satisfies that satisfies this identity. So imagine W so it would be this length. But and the issue is Uh, the issue is we can't get some inequality like this not possible. This is not possible globally because on closed manifolds, geodesics might not be unique. Actually, there will you will always have points where geodesics are not unique, so you're not going to have a unique W to work with. And so, how do we so how so what exactly do we do? So which there well there's a very special scenario I'm going to draw. So if you have a this is where non-positive curvature comes in. So this is as an example a non-positive triangle. A triangle in non-positive curved space. Again, I will call these points X, Y, and Z. And suppose you have, so this is on M. And suppose you have a triangle of the same, with the same side length in Rd, which I will call X prime, Z prime, and Y prime. And then take any two points, V and W. V and W and take their comparison points V prime and W prime. We say that the triangle XYZ satisfies the cat zero inequality if for all V and W, the distance between V and W is less than or equal to. between V and W is less than or equal to the distance between V prime and W prime. And it is, and we say that M is cat zero if all triangles in M satisfy M satisfy the cat zero inequality. And a cat, by the way, is short for Kartan Alexandrov and Toponogov, no relation to our furry friends that some of us may have at home. Yeah, this is very well-known terminology in the metric geometry community. And it's very well known that locally, cat K. Locally, cat K. So actually, M has non-positive, the sectional curvature of M is non-positive, is the same as M being locally cat zero. And there's also a pretty short proof that tells you locally cat zero implies that the set of The set of geodesics connecting X and Y is finite. So, what we try to do is: okay, can we, so on this, for any given geodesic, can we construct can we construct some neighborhood where this inequality holds? Oh, so obviously, So obviously, if you apply, so if you apply this to this, I should say, okay. No, I share. Yeah, so given gamma i and gamma, given small gamma i, can we construct some neighborhood? So that in which the gap, in which the cat zero inequality holds. Because if possible, because cat zero inequality, if you apply it to apply it to Z and W. Z and W gives Fzxy greater than or equal to Zw squared. Or I should, I guess I should, I should say Wi, where Wi is defined by gamma i in the obvious way. And the construction. And the construction is quite simple. We just define this neighborhood as the union of all union for all points P in gamma I of their geodesic delta balls, where delta is the injectivity radius of the manifold divided by three. I chose this constant so that you're not going to have. So, that you're not going to have points away, points on the side, so to speak, that are not connected by unique geodesic. And this way we can ensure essentially that the Chung called this the sausage center at gamma. This would be geodesically convex after you lift it to a universal cover. Lifting George Universe covers how you apply the inequality. There's various geometric theorems that use this, that are used to prove this. Some of the stuff here that I'm not going to mention for the sake of time. And so essentially, after this, we can say the is we can say the integral m cross m is less than or equal to the integral over gamma xy cross, well, integral is less than or equal to the sum for where, okay, suppose suppose suppose n is the number of Suppose n is the number of geodesics that connect X and Y. Well, X non-X. Sorry about that. And then plus a bunch of terms where these are integrals involving the complement of all the sausages. Of all the sausages. But on this set, but on this set, F is uniformly bounded from below. This is because F can only be zero if you're on a geodesic, but being outside this set makes it so that you have to be a certain, you cannot be so close to the geode. You cannot be so close to the geodesic. And from this, we can somewhat see that if we any arguments, sorry, any integrals that involve, that aren't directly on the sausages, we can basically throw away because they're not going to make it simpler. And then for all of these, for integrals involved. For integrals involving the sausages, they oh, sorry, I didn't mention that we first started off with the case of x naught and x naught prime and x and x prime are equal. But moving on to the general cases is also just some pretty Pretty trivial but tedious calculus that I'm not going to write down. So these intervals will converge if 2 alpha minus d is greater than negative 2, which is our Dalance condition. And that's essentially it. This is how we obtain the moment bounce for the this is how we obtain the moment bounce for the for the solutions to the multiplicative stochastic heat equation for in in long time and in short time for manifolds of non-positive curvature. We still believe that it is true for positive curvature, but we're going to, we can't use this method. Interval, we can't use this method as it stands because really strange things happen in positive curvature. Yeah, okay. And that's it for now. And apologies if the notes are kind of messy. Right. Any questions? Just something quickly. Sorry for the basic question, but the sphere. Basic question for the sphere or yeah the oh yeah that's right uh in terms of examples uh yeah the sphere is very well known to not admit anything        Yeah, the sphere is probably, it's still, we think it's still true for if you want positive curvature, but different methods will have to be used.
