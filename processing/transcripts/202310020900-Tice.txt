Rebound congratulations. Thank you very much. And thank you for all of the organizers. This is my first time here in Van, but it's absolutely fantastic. So really, thank you very much for inviting me. Yeah, and I want to emphasize that everything I'm going to talk about today is joint work with Noah Stevenson, who is a graduate student at Princeton. Shameless promotion. He will be on the market not too long from now. Okay, so let me start off by talking about the general geometric. Talking about the general geometric configuration we're going to study. We're going to describe a free boundary problem in fluid mechanics in a very simple configuration that is meant as a sort of cheap model of the ocean. And what I mean by that is that we're going to assume that the bottom of the fluid is completely flat. This is like an idealized, extremely flat ocean. But we will assume that the cross-section is infinite. So we'll be working in a fluid domain omega of t, which will be changing in time. Changing in time. In Rn, obviously the physical dimensions are 2 and 3, but as it turns out, this analysis will work in any n bigger than or equal to 2. And to describe this domain, we're going to work in the extremely simple setting where the free surface, which is the top of the fluid, is just given by the graph of a function. And we will describe this as a perturbation from equilibrium under the assumption that the equilibrium depth of the fluid is just a constant parameter b. So that is to say, Constant parameter b. So that is to say that when the fluid is at equilibrium, the fluid is just a boring flat slab that does nothing and is a depth b. And when you perturb the fluid, something acts on it so that interesting things are happening. You get a perturbation of that given by a graph, the graph of a function theta, which is a function of the horizontal variable in a bit of time. And so then the fluid domain itself is the stuff sitting between this. So omega of t here is the set of points such that the vertical variable xn lies between 0, which is at the bottom. lies between 0, which is at the bottom, and b plus zeta. And then I will label the bottom sigma 0, and I'll label the unknown free surface here, which is just the graph of this function b plus zeta, as sigma b plus zeta. Let me emphasize here that zeta itself is one of the unknowns in this problem. It's not something that's given, it's something that we're going to be trying to actually solve for. So this is a talk about incompressible Navi-Stokes. So we're assuming that the fluid is incompressible, viscous, and for simplicity, Viscous and for simplicity, you need this density. The unknowns then are the free surface function zeta, which actually gives us the domain in which the fluid lives. We will also have the usual fluid variables, which I will label as v and q for the moment, and they are defined on the unknown domain here, which is of course what makes this a free graphic problem. The domain itself is part of the problem, and then we have to find the solutions to the fluid equations on the unknown domain. Equations on the unknown domain. On this slide, the most important part is really the enumeration of the forces and stresses that will be acting on the fluid. We will assume that there is a constant gravitational field minus GEN, which means that it's just a field coming down perpendicular to the flat bottom and with gravitational strength G, which is just a constant. For the purposes of this talk, the most important actors are these two things here. We will assume that there is an external bulk force, F external. Bulk force, F external, and an external surface stress. So the bulk force is defined in the bulk, as I get from the name here, and the surface stress is defined on the free surface login. And the difference is that the bulk force is a vector field we take style using Rn, and the surface stress is assumed to be a symmetric stress tensor. The symmetry is unimportant, but this is usually what you assume in continuum mechanics, and we'll posit it here as well. I will say a lot more about this in a few minutes. Lot more about this in a few minutes, so I'll come back to these. But we will also typically have surface tension in play at the free interface, and this will be modeled in the absolutely standard way via some non-negative constant sigma called the coefficient of surface tension, times the mean curvature operator associated to our surface, which is just the first variation of the area functional, or a sort of non-linear version of the Laplace curvature. Okay, so everyone here, I assume, is familiar with the Navi-Stokes equation. Familiar with the Navi-Stokes equation, so I won't say too much about this first pair of equations here. The one thing that I will emphasize is that these are posed in the unknown domain omega of t. I should also point out that the bolt force is acting on the right here. You might be a little bit confused. I claimed that there was going to be gravity, and it appears nowhere here. It's because what's actually happened here is the gravity term has been shifted into this gradient of G, which is the gravitational. Of G, which is the gravitational constant, times the free surface function, which is sitting inside here. This is, in some sense, a sort of renormalization of the standard pressure. So the standard pressure variable, what I've essentially done is tracked off the hydrostatic pressure plus G times the vertical variable. This is done for technical convenience and what happens going forward. And of course, you can go back and forth. This is an invertible transformation. So this is for technical. Utility going forward here. But so the point is that the first two equations here are vanilla and obvious with an external force. The next two equations are perhaps not so ubiquitously known. These are the standard equations that you impose on a free surface when you are working with the viscous problem. And it tells us that this object on the left, which is called the viscous stress tensor, On the left, which is called the viscous stress tensor. It's the pressure times the identity matrix minus the viscosity coefficient times the symmetrized gradient, which is just dv plus its own transpose. This object, which is a symmetric tensor hitting the outward pointing unit normal, has to be balanced by the surface tension stress plus this external stress tensor. So the point is that the two things that are sort of external data that are acting on the fluid are this F external and this T external. This F external and this T external, and you can see their roles right here. This fourth equation is the so-called kinematic equation that tells us how the free surface function updates in time as a result of the velocity field. And as you might guess, the time derivative of the free surface function is proportional to the normal component of the velocity, with proportionality coefficient given by the area form Boch. This I will rewrite in a more I will rewrite in a more familiar way going forward. This is actually just a sort of transport equation. And on the bottom of the fluid, this is at the sort of the ocean floor interface. We will posit that we have a standard noose-like condition. This is completely vanilla modeling. Okay, so this is the dynamic problem, is not really the focus of this talk, so I'm immediately going to get rid of this. We're going to impose a traveling wave or A traveling wave, or also stationary onsats. And what I mean by that is we're going to assume that these externally applied forces and stresses are stationary and mean of time-independent when viewed in a coordinate system that's moving parallel to the bottom with a velocity, some real parameter gamma, which I'll call the traveling wave speed, times E1. And of course, this is a loss of generality because if it's traveling parallel to the bottom, you can always change coordinates and just label that as E1. Okay? So So let me emphasize that the actual fully stationary problem occurs when you take the traveling speed to be zero. That means nothing is actually traveling, you're just sitting there and nothing is happening. And why one should be interested in that is, well, such configuration should, in principle, play a role in long-term asymptotics for the dynamic problem, provided that you look at the dynamic problem with sources of external force and stress that have parts that are sort of Parts that are sort of non-time dependent. Okay, so what is this meant to model? You should think about this as a model that allows for a force-stress combo that's translating uniformly across the interface, or sorry, across the fluid. And there are various things that you can think of here. My favorite is thinking about this as a tube of air blowing on the fluid. I'll show you a cartoon of this in a moment. And in fact, this is how I came to think about this problem through some actual physical experiments. Problem through some actual physical experience, some actual experiments that were done by practitioners at a wave tank. But you can also think about this, if you prefer, as a sort of way of modeling a ship sitting on top of the ocean and sort of moving at a constant speed. If you prefer, it's also an extremely simplistic model of wind moving over the surface of the ocean. Or actually, another one that I like in terms of justifying the external force part is this is a way that you can think about a model of tides due to having Due to having local variations in the gravitational field that are sort of moving over the interface. So, you know, if the moon were sort of just translating uniformly over the surface of an infinitely flat ocean, it would be modeled by something like this. So it's a little bit of a hack, but this is the idea. Okay, so then the point is that in order to implement this traveling onsats, we're going to assume that the t external is given by some fixed vector field. By some fixed vector field t, sorry, some fixed symmetric tensor field t evaluated x minus gamma t e1. And for simplicity, I'm going to assume that t is defined all in the entire ambient space so that I don't have to just define this on the free surface. And I will also play a similar game with the external stress, sorry, the external force. I'll assume that it's some fixed vector field from Rn to Rn, and that. From Rn to Rn, and that it is just evaluated within the moving frame. Then I'm going to make a change of unknowns in all of the variables, the dynamic variables as well. So I'm going to call the traveling free surface eta rather than zeta. I'm going to call the traveling velocity field U instead of V. And I'm going to call the traveling pressure P instead of Q. Okay, so once I switch into this new system, we'll be working with eta as the free surface function. With eta as the free surface function, u as the velocity field, and p as the pressure. The fact that we're switching into this traveling coordinate system doesn't mean that I'm outside of the context of the free boundary problem. The free surface eta is still unknown, and so the fluid domain is still unknown, and is given by the time-independent set now omega b plus eta, which is just a set of points where the vertical variable lies between zero and b plus our new perturbation, eta. Okay, so here is the Okay, so here is the little cartoon that I promised earlier, and this was actually something that was studied in a wave tank. They set up a little tube that was blowing air on a viscous fluid, and then they translated it uniformly over the fluid, and they mounted a high-speed camera in the same frame as the tube and took pictures of it. And they observed that in certain parameter regimes, there were stationary configurations, or traveling wave configurations. Okay, so obviously. Okay, so obviously when you make this change of variables, the only thing that happens is everywhere where you had a time derivative before, it becomes a minus gamma e1, or sorry, minus gamma partial one of u, which I will write in this form. So this is exactly the same system of equations that I wrote before. It's just that the time derivatives have become derivatives in one direction, and they're weighted by this traveling speed, gamma. Let me mention, I said earlier that I would rewrite the kinematic equation in a nicer form. Kinematic equation in a nicer form. Here you can kind of see that if I look at the non-unit normal, then you can see that the right-hand side here is u dotted with the non-unit normal, and the non-unit normal is minus grad eta, 1. So this is really a sort of transport-type equation for the free surface being sort of advected by the horizontal components of the velocity and forced by the vertical components. Okay, so let me emphasize again: if you set gamma to be equal to zero, this is the fully stationary problem. Okay, so let's now make some sort of completely trivial observations here. For any gamma, so for any traveling speed, if I set f to be 0 and t to be 0, then the way that I've normalized the problem, I get a trivial solution. I can set u to be 0, p to be 0, and eta to be 0. This is one of the benefits of removing the hydrostatic pressure that I've done. Static pressure and things that I've done. Okay, this is by no means a deep observation, but in fact, if you make some standard Sololev inclusion hypotheses on the solution, then you can actually prove that if T is zero and F is zero, then in fact the velocity, the pressure, and the free surface are zero. This is not surprising from a modeling perspective because this is a viscous problem. If you don't have something driving it, you shouldn't expect a traveling wave solution to exist. You shouldn't expect persistent structures to exist. If you don't supply a source, To exist, if you don't supply a source of power to overcome the dissipative effects. And so, what the point of this is, is you need these sources of external stress and force in order to actually hope to produce such a solution. Of course, I hedge and say here in solo spaces. So, I make no claims about whether such solutions exist or not within, for instance, older classes or more complicated function spaces. Function spaces. Okay, let me tell you a brief history of this problem, and I mean an extremely brief history. This type of problem, at least without viscosity, is over 150 years old, and in fact, even older. The 2D irrotational periodic problem has literally hundreds of papers devoted to it, culminating in the 1980s, 1990s with the sort of resolution of the Stokes conjecture. There was a sort of Renaissance. Sort of renaissance in this area about 20 years ago with the work of Constantine and Strauss, where they were finally able to incorporate rotational effects. And this has been greatly developed in the subsequent 20 years by a number of people who eventually were able to include lots of things, including surface forces. Comparatively little is known in the Envisit literature for the 3D problem, but there are some results in this direction. Incidentally, this is by no means Incidentally, this is by no means a complete or exhaustive list. If I forgot someone, I apologize. However, I should say that much, much less is known about the viscous problem. And in fact, when I started working on this, I was able to find absolutely nothing in the literature about the construction of viscous traveling waves. I should mention, though, that if you look at the fully stationary problem, but not in the domain that I'm talking about in variations of it, there are a few results in the literature. Of it. There are a few results in the literature, but I will emphasize not in the infinite flat domain that we're describing. Usually these are in different types of domains. And let me re-emphasize that for the traveling problem, there's actually experimental evidence that was taken, as I mentioned earlier, on wave tank analysis with this tube mounted over a wavetank. Okay, so all of this culminates in a result from a few years ago that has only recently appeared in CPAM. Appeared at CPAM. This work is with Giovanni Leone, my colleague at CMU. And the result says that in dimension two, with surface tension either on or off, or dimension three, or higher if you care about four-dimensional fluids, with surface tension strictly turned on, so if you go to higher dimensions, we need surface tension, then there exists a regularity parameter which is bigger than n over 2, such that we can produce an open set, w. We can produce an open set, WS, contained in the reals delete the origin, crossed with these standard Sobolev spaces. This is a standard Sobolev space for the T, the applied stress, and this is the space where our externals force is going to live. And in addition to this open set, we have a Sobolev-type Banach space, Squeakly XS, which is where the solution UP eta is going to live. And I'm being purposefully vague about what this space is. I'll say more about it. About what this space is. I'll say more about this. Such that the following hold. So the first observation is that this open set contains all non-zero gamma as well as the point t equals 0 and f equals 0. And what this means is that our trivial family of solutions live in this open set. The second thing is that this unnamed Binox space XS enjoys a certain supercritical embedding, which is to say that if you give me a triple UP eta in If you give me a triple UP in this space, then at the very least, it actually depends on S, but I don't care about enumerating it. But at the very least, our velocity field will be C2 and bounded, with derivatives bounded as well. The pressure will be C1 with bounded derivative, and the free surface will actually be C3 and will decay in E30. So that is to say that the solution space here is really the classical setting. So, the crucial point here is that for every triple gamma Tf in this open set, there exists a traveling solution, UP eta, in the container space XS, that solves a flattened and equivalent version of the problem that I've shown you that I'm not going to enumerate, that I'm not going to tell you specifically for technical, for time reasons. But there's an equivalent reformulation where you rewrite the problem in the equilibrium domain, and it makes the nonlinearities much worse, but it makes the analysis somehow. But it makes the analysis somehow easier. These solutions are classical, meaning they're understood to be satisfied point-wise. They're locally unique within these open sets, and they satisfy various estimates, including things like nice bounds on the free surface function. And of course, if you don't like the flattened reformulation, that's fine. You can undo the flattening and return to the Eulerian framework, and the solutions are just as nice there as they are in the flattened coordinate system. What's also nice about What's also nice about this setup is that the map that takes a pair, a data triple rather, gamma TF, and maps it to the solution that we produce, the solution triple UP eta, is continuous with respect to this topology. So you can think about this not only as well-posiness with respect to the stress-force data, but also with respect to the traveling wave length. If you don't like this sort of global perspective, let me say you could also just say fix gamma, fix the speed, then what our results say. Fix a speed, then what our result says is there exists an open set of data, T and F, for which we can solve the problem, and we can do so in a well-posed way, in the sense that the solution depends continuously and is locally. All right, so as you might have guessed, based on the formulation of the previous theorem, the proof of this is based on the implicit function theorem. One of the features also is that our solutions all decay as you go out to horizontal and As you go out to horizontal infinity. In the parlance of traveling waves, this means that what we're constructing are solitary waves. There's no periodicity or anything like that. I should also mention that I haven't put this in the theorem here, but with a little bit of extra work, you can also prove continuous dependence on both the gravitational parameter and on the viscosity parameter. You get all of this for free. This is also just the beginning of the story and recent work with. Story and recent work with Noah Stevenson and Junichi Kogunamaru, we have extended this to multiple layers of fluids, of course, subject to the Rayleigh-Taylor condition. We've added the effects of periodicity and incline for the fluid. Things are more complicated if you have incline because instead of perturbing around the zero state, you have to perturb around the shear flow, but it still works. We've also been able to incorporate the Navi slip boundary conditions on the bottom and establish a vanishing slip length. Establish a vanishing slip length result. Also, in joint work with Hui Win, we were able to adapt this Navi-Stokes framework into the context of Muscat problem. And so we were able to construct traveling wave solutions to Muscat. And in that context, we were also able to prove certain stability results for those things dynamically. We were also able to push this into the compressible setting with NOAA, but there, unfortunately, the problem experiences derivative loss and becomes an absolute nightmare. And it becomes an absolute nightmare. And so, rather than using a vanilla implicit function theorem, we had to build a Mashmoser version to carry this out. Let me emphasize here: our technique absolutely 100% does not work with gammas equal to zero. So this is one of the weird things about this result. We were able to construct traveling wave solutions, but we were absolutely unable to construct solutions of the stationary problem. And the reason for this is this parameter gamma plays an absolutely essential role in defining. Central role in defining the topology of the container space squiggly XS where we construct our solutions. And the reason is there's going to be a new weird Sobolev type space that's going to show up that's anisotropic and has very strange properties. I'll get to this in a second. But let me tell you where this thing comes from. So as I said, the strategy is to use the implicit function theorem to construct the solutions in terms of the data. So if you linearize around the trivial solution, after reposing the After reposing the problem in an equilibrium domain, you end up with a linear system that looks like a linear Stokes problem, very similar to the nonlinear problem I showed you earlier. The only thing I want to emphasize here is that eta shows up in three places in this formulation. Here in the bulk with a gradient hitting it, here on the boundary with a gamma d1, and then here also on the boundary with the linearized mean curvature hitting it. Okay, so in this setup, we have three different different Setup, we have three differential operators hitting the free surface function. So, if we formally think about the type of estimates that we can get, it turns out that really the best that we can get for the free surface function in standard Sobolette spaces, so let's say in a functional framework where this right-hand side is, let's say, in standard HS, in which you expect the velocity field to be in HS plus 2, the pressure to be in HS plus 1, et cetera. So, in that derivative counting scheme, what you expect, again, What you expect, and again, this is just what you expect, is that the gradient of eta will be in hs, the derivative in the e1 direction is going to be an hs plus 3 over 2, and there's a bonus estimate that you get where it's in the space h dot minus 1. And moreover, the Laplacian of this thing is going to be an hs plus 1 half. Now, I say that this is hand-waving and rough counting. Making this inclusion actually rigorous is extremely delicate and requires having a very And requires having a very precise understanding of the symbol of a pseudo-differential operator that took months of work to actually compute by shint. But the upshot of this, if you just believe me that this is the best that you can get, is when you look at, when you sort of synthesize these things and look at it on the Fourier side, you get the following control. So if sigma is positive and you're at dimension 3 or higher, at high frequencies, you get exactly what you would expect. You get exactly what you would expect. You get something that looks like an HS plus 5 over 2 solar. However, at low frequencies, something completely bizarre happens. You get something that has the traveling velocity, gamma, times C1 squared. There's no coincidence here. This is the direction of propagation of the wave. Plus the gravity terms times C to the fourth, and then divided by C squared. So for instance, if we were in three dimensions, so that this thing is Three dimensions, so that this thing is really in two dimensions. This can be thought of in very simple polar coordinate form as r squared plus cosine squared theta. Okay, so this is a weird low frequency syllable of multiplier. However, if you're in dimension two for the ambient dimension, which means that in the cross-section you're in one dimension, well, you have the benefit of having C1 be equal to X C, right? And so that means then that at low frequencies, you actually get standard solar lift control. Get standard solo lift control. Okay, so what that means is that if you're in two dimensions, you get a standard HS plus 5 over 2 estimate, but when you're in three dimensions, this weird thing shows up. Okay, so this is certainly not a standard Sobolev space. You will probably not find this in a standard book. Giovanni Leone and I were certainly not able to find this. And so what you do is you say, all right, well, let's just work with what the problem gives us. So we're going to define this new space Xs. This new space xs via this norm. So here I'm going to just throw away all the physical parameters, but there should be a gamma here. Okay, so I'm going to define the norm on the Fourier side via this. So at high frequencies, it's standard HS, and at low frequencies, it's got this strange multiplier on it. And one can prove then that this is a Hilbert space. It's going to be strictly larger than the standard HS space when the ambient dimension, or sorry, here I'm reformulating. Sorry, here I'm reformulating so that this is on general cross-section, which I'm calling Rd. So if the cross-section here is, or if this D is bigger than or equal to 2, then the space is strictly bigger than HS. If D is equal to 1, then these spaces agree with what occurred. Now, the technical miracle that occurs here is that this wave that we see at low frequencies has an integrable reciprocal. And what that means, crucially, is that we actually get functions out of this. Actually, get functions out of this space. And notice that if I didn't have control of this thing, and I'll say more about this in a minute, but if I didn't have this term here, I would not be getting functions. Because at low frequencies, this would be essentially h dot one in 2d, in which we're dead. You don't get functions. And so the key thing that happens is this special multiplier kicks in and makes it so that if I split my function f hat into two parts, the high frequency part and the low frequency part. Parts, the high frequency part and the low frequency part, then the high frequency part is in standard Sobolev, and the low frequency part is in L1, which means, and it's band limited, so it's smooth and all of its derivatives go to zero. So in fact, we basically end up in HS plus something that's very, very nice. We're sort of sandwiched between HS and HS plus C infinity. However, so one of the things that makes this space just ridiculous to work with is that it is not closed under composition and with rotation. Is not closed under composition with rotation. So that is to say, you can take profiles that are in this space, compose them with a rotation operator, rotating by theta for theta arbitrary, and leave the function space. And so this is the strong anisotropic form of this space. So the estimates are being given to you somehow by the direction that you're moving, and somehow the space then is not particularly happy with you sort of trying to shift outside of that direction. That direction. Okay? But in order to apply the implicit function theorem, of course, you need to know good nonlinear functional analytic properties as well. You need to know things like good embedding properties and be able to understand products and composition results. And we had to prove all of this stuff from scratch. And of course, they satisfy these, or this wouldn't work. But the upshot of this is: once you realize this problem is there, or this function space is there, and you realize how to use it, can you get the isomorphism? How to use it, then you get the isomorphism that you want for this linearized problem. And once you have your hands on the isomorphism, you then just do a bunch of horrible nonlinear work and then you can apply the implicit function theorem. And that's how we produce truth. Okay, so let me now explain what happens when we set gamma to be zero. In this case, the best that you can hope for is that the gradient of eta is in the space hs plus 3 over 2. s plus 3 over 2. This means that we're losing control of things at low frequency and the reason for that essentially is that the best that you can extract from this at low frequencies is that eta is an h dot 1 and you should think about this as being in two dimensions. So this space isn't even closed. If you take its completion you're going to get a temper distribution modulo essentially a constant. And this is an absolute disaster because we need the free surface function to be a bounded function, not a temper distribution modulo constant. Tempered distribution modulo constants, or polynomials. And so the upshot is we have no linear isomorphism and we can't close the nonlinear analysis without point-wise estimates. So it seems that we're dead in the water the second that we set gamma. Unless you are optimistic and say, okay, well, let's focus on the case when the ambient dimension is 3, so that the cross-section is 2. If we could somehow retool our functional somehow retool our functional framework to be in LR-based spaces where R is less than 2, then in principle we can avoid the problem that I'm describing. So for instance, if we were able to prove that the gradient of eta is an HSR and the Laplacian of eta is an HS plus 1R, where HSR is the standard Bessel space of order R, then we could appeal to a very nice result of Heisenlars and Kamalaischke from 95. From 95, that would allow us to have a homogeneous subcritical embedding. And in fact, then all of our problems would go away. And we would not only get a function in a standard symbol of space, we would get that as a byproduct. It would be continuous, provided that S is large enough. Okay, so this would solve the problems. Now, there are plenty of results in the literature that attack Stokes-type problems in infinite domains like we're studying in an LR. Studying in an LR framework, mostly due to Abe and Abels and their co-workers, or collaborators. These, however, are heavily based on pseudo-differential or Fourier multiplier techniques, and most of them exploit explicit knowledge of the symbol. You have to be able to write it down in order to make this analysis work. And as a result of that, none of them incorporate the free surface, because as soon as you incorporate the free surface, you lose the ability to write down the symbol and everything breaks. Down the symbol, and everything breaks. This was one of the problems that we encountered in the traveling wave analysis. The other point here is that a full LR framework is, in some sense, overkill because we only need this LR hack in the horizontal directions. Everything vertically is perfectly fine in an L2 setting. So what we're going to do is we're going to introduce a weird new functional framework that works in a minimal fashion here. So given some finite dimensional vector space V, we're going to define a mixed-type Sobolev space. Define a mixed-type Sobolev space on our domain omega as follows. So I'll write LR2 to basically be LR in the horizontal direction with values in L2 vertically. Okay? And R here is meant to be less than 2, but of course this works generally. And then we're going to define a scale of simple F spaces based on these in the usual way. So H S R over 2 will just be all distributional derivatives of the order S live in this strange anisotropic space. Strange in anisotropic space. We will also define h tilde sr to be the space I was talking about previously. So that is to say, this will be the set of functions that are in the sort of subcritical embedding space for which the gradient is in hs minus 1r. This is going to be the space where eta lives. And as I mentioned on the previous slide, the thing that's nice about this is at least when r is subcritical with respect to the dimension, you will have embeddings into. Embeddings into standard Sobolev spaces, which can then be super critical with respect to Sobolev embedding and give you embeddings into standard. Okay, so with these observations, we were able to prove the following theorem with NOAA. This only works in dimension 3, and we require that r is between 1 and 2, and that s is a regularity parameter that's large enough in terms of r. And what we're able to do is to produce a pair of open sets, just like before, WSR. sets just like before, WSR and VSR. So WSR is the data space. This is where gamma, t, and f are going to live. And VSR is the solution space. This is where u, p, and eta are going to live. And these things contain the trivial solutions with gamma equal to zero here. And our theorem says something similar to what the theorem before said. So for every gamma, t, and f in this open set, there exists a traveling or stationary if gamma is equal to zero solution up eta. To zero, solution up in the container space VSR, solving again a flattened version of the problem. And these things are locally unique, satisfy various estimates, and can be unflattened to go back into the Eulerian coordinate system. And on top of this, we also have continuous dependence of the solutions with respect to the data and the traveling overseas. Okay, so somehow this sort of strange shift in the functional framework to r less than 2 does. R less than 2 does the job. Here are some remarks about this. So I haven't attempted to write this down because it's a big mess, but we can also prove continuity with respect to the various physical parameters. What's most interesting about this from my perspective is that, so we can definitely solve the stationary problem here. So this is the key point. We can solve the gamma equals zero problem. And moreover, what we show is that every stationary solution that we can obtain from this lies along a continuous one-parameter. Lies along a continuous one-parameter family of traveling solutions. So you can kind of think about this as, you know, you have your tube blowing on the fluid and it kind of slows down and then it comes to a stop. And when it comes to a stop, it gives you the stationary solution. I should also mention that we're able to solve the gamma equals zero problem, the fully stationary problem, but when gamma is not zero, we actually get some bonus estimates. And in fact, what we can show is that gamma times the Fact, what we can show is that gamma times the Ries operator in the D1 direction lives in LR. And this is analogous to the estimates that we were seeing in the previous L2 framework, where we had that gamma times D1 was an H dot minus 1, which is exactly equivalent to gamma times the Ries operator in the E1 direction being an L2. So it's like we just switch from an L2 framework to an LR framework. Okay, and so what's happening then is as gamma goes to zero, you can essentially think about this as a kind of singular limit where we have Singular limit where we have a sort of a big function space which handles all solutions, be it gamma equals zero or gamma naught. But as soon as you turn on gamma, you go into a subspace. And as you send gamma to zero, the estimates necessary to live in the subspace degenerate and the solution pops up into the bigger space. I should also mention here that unfortunately our technique fails when n is equal to 2. And the reason for this is because we're going to employ some heavy machinery from harmonic analysis, which is From harmonic analysis, which is not going to play well with respect to r is equal to 1, which is precisely the number that you would need to use in one dimension in order to pull off the same subcritical string. So the n equals 2 case remains open. So let me give you briefly a sketch of how to prove this. So the first step is to say, well, look, eta is an annoyance. It behaves badly at low frequencies. So let's just forget it exists. And replace the gradient of eta with And replace the gradient of eta with the generic vector field x prime. And with that observation, we notice that the Laplacian of eta is the divergence of that vector field. So what we're going to do is just replace that in the equations and then augment the system with an applied curl equation. So it's like we're taking the original problem and sticking it inside an applied div curl problem with the understanding that eventually we want the curl to be zero so that we recover that x prime is the gradient or something. Prime is the gradient of something. This gives us a linear problem that we can solve using techniques that we already understood, and we can solve it in an L2-based framework and get a very lovely well-posedness theory and a corresponding isomorphism. So this is absolutely a well-posed problem and behaves super, super well. Okay, so we've got our foot in the door at the L2 level. What's the next step? Well, the next step is to try to appeal to some sort of harmonic analysis techniques, but in order to make that work, Techniques, but in order to make that work, we need to get into the context of R2 rather than R2 crossed with 0B. So to pull that off, we're going to notice that the standard Sobolev spaces that we use over here factor. So Hs omega can be written as Hs of the cross-section with values in L2 intersect L2 of the cross-section with values in Hs. And you can rewrite this as Hs with values in a Hilbert space H1 intersect L2 with values in a different intersect L2 with values in a different Hilbert space H2 that embed nicely, you can think about these as sort of being the vertical Hilbert spaces that describe the vertical behavior of the fluid. So now we arrive at the fundamental observation. This linear vector field formulation of the problem, it commutes with horizontal translations. And what that means then is that its solution operator, which we know exists from the L2 theory, is going to be Given by m of d for an operator-valued Fourier multiplier defined on R2. And what I mean by operator valued is it's going to be operator-valued with these Hilbert spaces in the vertical factors here. So once we have this observation, the goal is then to use this M, together with a version of the vector-value version of the Nikkm-Hermander multiplier theorem, in order to produce solutions in our LR-based. In our LR-based functional framework. And it turns out that the framework that I previously described is exactly what you get when you take this factorization and replace the L2 spaces in the horizontal direction with LR based spaces, which makes them Bessel spaces in the horizontal direction with Hilbert spaces in the, taking values in Hilbert spaces. There is a huge literature devoted to vector-valued versions of Niklin-Hammander going back 30 or 40 years. Unfortunately, none of the things that we Unfortunately, none of the things that we found off the shelf did the job, so we had to build our own version of this. This could be its own talk on its own, so I'm just going to completely bore all the details about it. There's a decent amount of work that needs to go into proving this new version of Nikli-Herrmander. But once we have this in hand, the task then becomes to show that the hypotheses of Nikli-Merrimander are satisfied, and these are essentially the same as what you encounter for scalar Nikli-Hermander. Namely, you need to prove that the symbol is sufficient. Need to prove that the symbol is sufficiently regular and satisfies some sort of quantitative estimates on the full side for the derivatives. Now, when you're forced to do something like this, it looks like we've gone in a big loop and it comes back to the problem of explicitly computing m, which we can't do. So we ran into a problem. But now an incredible trick kicks in. And the observation is that if I want to compute the derivatives of m, well, in some sense, it suffices to have a good understanding of the. To have a good understanding of the translations of M. And the translations of M, it turns out, behave very, very beautifully if I pull them back and think about them on the operator side. So if I look at translations of my operator, they correspond precisely to conjugations by complex exponentials of my original solution operator. And what this means then is I can then try to compute the derivatives of the symbol on the Fourier side by getting estimates for the difference quotients on the Estimates for the difference quotients on the spatial or on the operator side, and using the correspondence between the operator norm of t and the essentially L infinity type estimates for the symbol on the Fourier side. And remarkably, this works. And there's a beautiful iterative structure, actually, that allows you not only to show that m is differentiable, but that it's twice differentiable, third differentiable, et cetera. And we can push it all the way, in fact, up to getting that M is analytic away from the origin. That M is analytic away from the orator. And the crucial point is we do this without ever explicitly computing M. It's all entirely implicit and based entirely on the L2 PDP estimates. So we somehow get the smoothness of M that we need just from the L2 framework that we developed previously. When we encountered this, I sort of thought this has to be known. If you know of a reference for this or some previous use, I would love to know it. But as far as I know, we couldn't find this anywhere. We couldn't find this anywhere, but we expect this type of technique should be useful in a much more general setting whenever your domain has either translational symmetry or a partial translational symmetry. So the final slide here, and then I'll be quiet, is that once we have this result, we then use Niklin-Hanamander to show that this vector field linear problem that I showed over here can sort of be undone. So you can sort of establish, you can just force. Of establish, you can just force the curl to be zero to recover the free surface function, but now you're in a subcritical setting with respect to the sub-leth embedding. So the gradient of eta belonging to these spaces tells you that eta belongs to nice spaces, and you have a nice function. The final task, so basically everything I just talked about in this sketch is meant to handle the stationary problem. So the final task is to figure out how to encode the traveling problem in this functional framework. And this is done with yet another appeal to. And this is done with yet another appeal to Fourier multiplier theory. And it turns out that this one works best at the non-linear level, so this is why I haven't talked about this in the linear analysis. But roughly speaking, if you stare at this operator for a second, this is exactly the reciprocal of that low frequency term that appeared in the anisotropic spaces. And this operator you can then use to sort of take solutions to the traveling problem and sort of stick them inside the non-traveling framework in a nice Framework in a nice bounded and invertible way. And if you stare at this as an operator, you realize, unfortunately, it's not of Niklan-Hermander type. So we have to bust out yet more multiplier theory. And fortunately, this is of Marcin-Kayowitz type. And so this ends up inducing a nice operator, bounded operator on our functional spaces using Marcin-Kayvitz multiplier. This is all essentially the story for the linear analysis. Then you have to say. For the linear analysis, then you have to sit down and fight through some non-linear analysis, meaning you need certain product estimates and composition estimates and a bunch of other things. I will not attempt to describe this, but it all fits together nicely and allows us to invoke the complex function theorem to prove the theorem. I just want to emphasize that what you should essentially think of is what's going on here is that we're able to solve the stationary problem, the gamma equals zero problem, and the solutions for small gamma are then sort of achieved. Gamma are then sort of achieved, achieved perturbatively. And so in the previous work with Giovanni, we were able to solve the problem for all gamma, but here we're really only solving the problem for small gamma near zero, and it's because we're working perturbatively. In principle, I think if you worked a bit harder, you could probably continue these curves of solutions to large gamma, but this is a matter of future work. Okay, well, with that, I'm out of time, and I'm going to say thank you very much for your. Time, and I'm going to say thank you very much for your attention this morning. I don't know what the question is. For which part? Which part? If you sign COIL, did you say that you can do the 2D case? Oh, oh, yes, yes. And the point is that what breaks there is, you know, okay, Miklan Hermann. Is, you know, okay, Niklin-Hermander is going to say your operator remains bounded on LR for R strictly between 1 and infinity. We would need that result with R is equal to 1. That's the real problem. I mean, it's the typical interpolation or, I mean, fundamentally, it's interpolation marks and caveats interpolation type problems. You prove weak type estimates at the end points and you get everything in the middle, but at the ends you're kind of But at the end, you're kind of somewhat. Okay, maybe this is a dumb question, but when you talk about the LR theory of stokes, it's another approach which is via layer potentials. Because you can write down the fundamental solution explicitly for stokes. Now it's true, it works best at LR, not some spaces based on LR. But in principle, if But in principle, if you don't need fractional exponents, meaning you get fractional exponent by interpolation, you should attempt to just apply the Laplacian to the larynx tension representation. Have you thought about that? We have definitely not thought about that. The difficulty with, I mean, I'm not saying it won't work. The difficulty is when, so we tried something like that without layer. So we tried something like that without layer potentials, but with sort of other pseudo-differential operators fitting together in some way. The thing that makes this annoying, let's see if I can find this fast enough, is that eta appears in multiple boundary conditions at the same time. And so actually, this is what made it quite tricky, even in the pseudo-differential framework, and I imagine it would also be in the millions in this context as well. Again, I'm not saying it can't work, I'm saying a priori, I wouldn't know how to immediately do it. Know how to immediately do it. But maybe it would work. I think that's a really nice suggestion. Thank you. Ah, it doesn't work at all. Nothing works. So all of this is absolutely... So, okay, is this essential? No, you can replace it with something else, but you have to have some sort of coercivity because, I mean, there's no velocity control on its own here, right? So if you want control of the velocity, Here. So, if you want control of the velocity field on its own, you have to have some sort of corn-type inequality. And you're only going to get corn if you have some sort of vanishing condition on the bottom or something like that. I mean, is this just a technical issue? Oh, I have no idea if they exist in infinite depth. I would not even venture to conjecture. But I can tell you. Conjecture. But I can tell you that everything that we do, all of the functional framework is going to collapse. It's going to fail the second that you put in. It's much trickier. That was done. Yeah, it's much simpler. Yeah, yeah. In fact, if you're fully periodic, it's actually kind of subtle. If you're fully periodic, there's no subtlety, and everything works exactly as it would want. If you want periodicity, As you would want. If you want periodicity in one direction, but not in the others, then it starts to become quite tricky. And in fact, what's kind of interesting is that if you have, let me try to remember, if you have periodicity in the direction of propagation, but not periodicity in the other direction, so in the transverse directions, then we can't produce solutions. But we can produce solutions if you have an infinite cross-section in the direction of propagation and periodicity in the transverse directions. So the reason. So, the reason is basically you need to take advantage of this low-frequency gain, and somehow, if you have that only in a periodic framework in that direction, you lose control of it. But yeah, this is all essentially low frequency annoyances. So, if you do something to try to get rid of low frequencies, then yeah, you can do better. Together. I think we have a break.
