All right. Okay, take it away. Thank you. Can everyone see my slides? I'm just going to check the visual. Yep. Okay. All right. Great. Right, great. Okay, so thanks everyone. So I'm going to actually talk about some work that has really been the work of a big consortium that got together here in Quebec called the COVSEC Consortium. And a lot of the work that I'm showing is preliminary work that we've done. And I'd be very interested to hear some of your suggestions on how to. Some of your suggestions on how to improve some of our analysis methods. So, for those of you who might not know, Quebec is the second largest province in Canada in terms of population. And we actually ended up having the biggest outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in Canada, which was a little bit surprising given that. Little bit surprising given that other provinces had the arrival of the virus much sooner than we did. So BC and Ontario started showing cases several weeks before us. So we, even though we started a bit later, we really sort of took off and plateaued at around a thousand cases, just under a thousand cases a day. Cases, just under a thousand cases a day. We're currently just over that, and we've plateaued, but we are having a proper second wave. So, this study, oh, the other point is that we had the highest death rate as well, and that's mostly because we had a lot of entry into long-term care facilities. So, there was unfortunately a lot of deaths. So, this study, what we're going to talk about, is just the beginning. Study: What we're going to talk about is just the beginning part of the epidemic, so the growth phase of the epidemic. And a key thing to know about Quebec is that we actually had our spring break because we had spring break before the rest of Canada. So, our spring break happened at the end of February, beginning of March. And then the actual public health emergency, the closing of schools, and then finally the closing of the border happened afterwards. So, that's important to the So that's important to the dynamics, really. So in April, in the middle of the lockdown, several people started to volunteer and created this consortium that was managed mostly by Sandrine Morea from the Public Health Authority, the research wing, working with the epidemiologists on the ground. Epidemiologists on the ground, and they're collecting the data, as well as the genome center. And there are several teams from different organizations doing the bioinformatics, generating the sequences. And I'm part of Jesse Shapiro's lab doing the phylogenetics. There's also a national funding group that was set up in April, and it's starting to coordinate. In April, and it's starting to coordinate the sequencing across Canada. And so, our group, what we've done is used the NextDrain tools to set up a website where you can interact with the Quebec sequences as we're releasing it and putting it into Gisade. But you can actually interact with just the Quebec sequences here, and you can kind of see where we're going and how much we're putting out. And the goal is to really put out. And the goal is to really put out as much data as possible. And it was really a lot of work trying to get this kind of up and running to get good quality sequences available to everyone. So in this first batch that we got out, we got 734 sequences of about 5,000 cases up to April 1st. So you can really see our sampling sort of drops. Sort of drops, our sampling coverage really drops as the epidemic takes off. And you can kind of see this sort of summary plot that I found on Twitter by this PhD student who sort of shows, you know, even though Quebec had put out as more sequences than most, because our epidemic was so large, you know, the sequence rate, the percentage of how much we've actually put out is quite low. So, what we're trying to do is up. So, what we're trying to do is up that, and we're currently about to release much more sequences from first from the first wave. But it's also important to be creating sequences for the use of public health currently. So Eric Fournier from the Public Health Authority, the LSPQ, he set up the next screen. The next grain tool and use it to generate a giant, the biggest tree that we could make, which was about 22,000 global sequences with our Quebec sequences embedded. We were having trouble getting our trees any bigger than this. And we tried to limit the amount of identical sequences per sequence per country so that we could try to really capture as much diversity. As much diversity across the globe over this period of time. And what you're seeing here is these red, sorry, these blue dots as the Quebec sequences embedded in the global tree. And what you can, just from inspection, you can kind of see that, you know, our Quebec sequences aren't really appearing from in the clades of the deeper branches that we're. Branches that were related to China, but rather they're much more scattered throughout the whole tree, you know, sort of suggestive that there were probably multiple introductions, not just one monophyletic or a couple of very large monophyletic introductions. So because there's so much data from Europe, we try to kind of cut down how much we have because the UK really swamps out the rest. Really swamps out the rest of the world. But we wanted to better quantify that. So we did some maximum likelihood ancestral state reconstruction, which Olivier explained much better than I could. And we started pretty basic using a function from APE designed by Emuel PÃ©radis and Ben Balker, which uses a discrete character two states. A discrete character, two states. So basically, you're using the tips, which are Quebec tips and non-Quebec tips, where you have two states, and you're reconstructing the ancestral nodes to see where we get a switch from an ancestor that is majority non-Quebec to a majority Quebec. Then I've been writing code to be able to find these transitions. Able to find these transition nodes as well as assign the origin to the clade. So we have the travel history for these Quebec sequences. So we can use the travel history for the basal Quebec sequences, but also we cross-check it with the out groups. And then, of course, And then, of course, the goal of this is to identify Quebec transmission lineages. So, this is just a toy example. So, the idea is to sort of see where we had these big clusters of transmission lineages and see if we can better characterize what happened there. So, with this particular data set up to April 1st, we found about just under 250 introductions, which is, of course, going to be conservative because some of these sequences. Because some of these sequences are identical, so they're going to, and they're in the same clade, so they're going to be collapsed into one introduction. What we find is that most of the introductions are from Europe, which is, I guess, not surprising given the time in which we had most of our introductions, which I'll show you in a minute, but also our travel and connections. Travel and connections that Quebec has. We had a lot from the Caribbean and the US, which is also kind of indicative of our travel patterns in spring break. A lot of Quebecers escape to warmer weather. So I'm just going to focus on this plot here on the left. This is actually Epidata from a modeling paper. A modeling paper done by a local team here where they actually, in this shaded area, show the arrival time of all the cases that reported having traveled recently. And there's about 1,500 in total. So we really did only sample, I think we had a total of 350 or a bit more than that that had trial. So ours is a sub-sample of this. But what you can really But what you can really see is there are two peaks. One is the spring break, and the other is a repatriation that happened right around the border closed. We had people flying back from all over the world. In particular, we had many, many Quebecers being brought in from the U.S. We sent down buses and everything because we have a lot of snowbirds, which are retirees that, you know, Are retirees that live in the winter? They go to Florida and other warm parts of the U.S. So, what we have here on the right is what we got from the sequences. So the lighter points are the inferred introductions, and the darker points are the cases that represented that had travel history. And so you Travel history. And so you kind of see that there are two generally two bumps similar to, or two peaks, similar to what we have in the EPI data. We have some inferred introductions that we felt we didn't have a lot of confidence in because of the problem that everyone is finding, especially in the earlier parts of the tree, you have these very large. Of the tree, you have these very large polytomies, and so we are not confident in these. There was really only one that we felt confidence in. The rest we didn't think that we'd report them, but we're not really sure that that's where they would actually fall if we had more sampling from that time. So, when it comes to the actual COVID lineages, I think it pretty much overlaps with what we had expected. We used the two We used the two different nomenclatures that are being used in the literature: the Next Strain and the Pangolin nomenclatures. With the Nextstrain one, we found that most of our Quebec sequences are from, you know, originated from 2020. So these are here, and they're again mostly European originating lineages. And then the penguin, which is a more fine-grained. And then the pangolin, which is a more fine-grained version of that, it's the same kind of setup. We get the same thing, but you can get a bit more fine-grained where you can see, for example, that like China and Iran, we get these little blips, these little few cases that come in earlier on, but they don't take off. What's also interesting is that some of the UK and US specific clades don't seem to be Don't seem to be very meaningful in terms of how many there were during this time. And I think that sort of shows that a lot of European clades at the time were being moved from Europe through the Americas and then to us. So that was kind of interesting. We're starting now, so this is particularly preliminary stuff. Particularly preliminary stuff. We're starting now to zoom in onto the different regions. And so, this is an example. This was our biggest outbreak, which is Montreal. We had almost 24,000 cases in the first wave. And as you can see, our sampling is quite low, but it's evenly, fairly evenly, temporally. Poorly useful because we can use it for phylodynamics. So, doing some first runs with BEAST and a birth-death skyline model, we've been getting some parameter estimates such as the RT over time. And it's fairly reasonable. I'm in the process of getting the actual RT values from Montreal. RT values for Montreal from those who were calculating it, the modelers who are calculating using EPI data. And I'd be kind of interested to compare the two. It's sort of something that I'd like to move forward with is to better compare how good our estimates are using genomics versus using sort of the standard modeling and EPIDA methods. The trees are, you know, show very clearly that, you know, our Very clearly, that you know, our travel-related histories are early on in the tree, and then you know, the effect of lockdown is that you really just have local transmission. But what I'm going to do next is start annotating these trees by adding in more information, what we know about the larger Quebec clade analysis, the introductions, and see how those spread locally. And then another region that we looked at is Urue, which is. We looked at is Utawe, which is our best sampled region. Udawe, for those of you who might not know, is a region that's just on the border with Ontario, where Ottawa is basically split into cities, Ottawa and Gatineau. And this is a big cottage country area, both for Ottawa and Montreal. And this region. And this region actually shut down their border really quickly to Ontario, and travel from Montreal was restricted as a way to sort of prevent these more hotspots from bringing in cases. But in any case, our coverage is quite high, but they also struggled a bit with long-term care facilities. So we have a bit of, we can see that they are was also having trouble getting down below one. Getting down below one. But again, I'd like to compare this with the EPI estimates. So, overall, then what we've seen so far, which is that most of the lineages that came into Quebec were European as opposed to ones from Asia. And the larger outbreak is probably due to the spring break. Spring break. And that's something that I'm in the process of quantifying, better quantifying how well those earlier Quebec transmission lineages did in terms of spreading, not just in the first wave, but hopefully as we get more sequences into the summer and into the second wave, see how well they're doing. And so some other things that we're doing is we're trying to, with a student, I'm working with her to Working with her to take the code I've written and sort of improve its performance and see if we can put out something that's open source and R based. And of course, continue doing phylodynamic work. And I'm just going to thank this gigantic team of people who've done all the hard work of sequencing and bioinformatics. I'm going to start with Jesse, who's my boss. With Jesse, who's my boss, and Sandrine and Eric from the INSPQ. Others I've worked with is Pierre Olivier and Hector, but really it's been a big team effort to try to get this up and running in the middle of a pandemic. So I'm going to just stop there. Great. Thanks, Carvin. Yep. Let me see if I can. We've got questions coming in already. So let me ask one from the chat here: How even were the tests? From the chat here, how even were the testing numbers day to day early in the epidemic? It seems that due to reagent shortages, many jurisdictions had big peaks and dips in testing. Is any unevenness accounted for in the RD calculations? So I'm not the most qualified person to answer that question. However, I do feel that a lot of our sampling was sort of curated based on. Sort of curated based on what was kind of needed for hospitals and others in the public health authority, as well as trying to get, we would sort of do backlog because we weren't doing it. We started really sequencing a bit after that. So while reagents is definitely an issue, I don't think it's like the main, it was the main thing that was affecting our. Our ability to sequence in terms of evenness. Great. Okay. Any other questions? Probably time for one more quick one if anybody has something they'd like to ask. Can you please explain why collection dates for Quebec sequences in GSAD are much less variable, concentrated in two-week intervals than what you're showing? Um I'm not really sure because we've we've put out like I'm basically showing what's what's on there, so I'm a little confused by that question. Okay, well, so that was from Art Poon, so maybe you guys can chat about it.
