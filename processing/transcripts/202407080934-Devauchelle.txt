Thank you, Nick. So, of course, it's a great pleasure to be here. It's a great honor to talk first. It's also somewhat of an embarrassment. I'll tell you why. So, the scale of river networks, this is work by Likat, who was a former undergrad student in our group, Frederick Popovich, who's around in Broom here and now at the University of Belgrade, and Erik Lajelessi, my dear colleagues at IPTP. So, it's a bit of an embarrassment because this Grasp because these are the rivers, the networks I'm interested in. This is a river network, this is the Loire River in France. And as you see, it's a beautiful ramified network. It's a dynamic tree, like this. And there is one thing that loose networks don't do. This is loops. Of course, over the last years, I've been told many times, including by Stefan first, that rivers are making huge systems. Rivers are making loops, especially in deltas. This is the Niger delta in Nigeria. And you see loops. So they do make loops sometimes. It's okay. And then I think probably John and Matsei will even tell us why these rivers are making loops. But I felt that I had to talk about those, you know, river deltas, much flats and things like that. But I didn't know what to say about them, because I don't know much about them. And so I was staring blankly at those pictures. Blankly at those pictures, and all of a sudden it struck me. So, you see, what's the difference between this and this? Don't tell me looks, because this is a detail. You don't really see the look first. First, you see, well, you could say colours, for instance, colour is different. But also, really, the colour is different because this is a map, so it's a drawing, and this is actually a picture, a satellite image. And if I were to show you a satellite image, Show you a satellite image of the Loire drainage basin, like this, you would barely see the Loire River here, maybe a little bit, but you wouldn't see it. Because rivers are very thin objects in the landscape. Which is not true on deltas. Here you can see a whole vanite network like this. It's complete, and still you can see the width of the width. So they are very broad, wide, or fat if you want. And there is a lot of water on this picture, which is absolutely unlike. Picture, which is absolutely unlike a regular river network. That was the question. So, why is it so? And the way to answer is, I think I took inspiration from a famous paper in quantum mechanics, Ed Fursel, who tells us about the scallop theorem, that the scallop could not swim by flipping its shell in a viscous form. And the paper is nice because the tone of the paper is interesting. And Purcell writes the following: He insists on following. He insists on following Vicky's program. Vicky is, I think it's Victor Weishop, another physicist. So Vicky's program of explaining everything, including the heights of mountains, with the elementary constants. So why don't we do that for rivers or try to do this? Because at least if we do this, it's going to be an easy talk. There'll be no differential equations, only ratios of quantities. And we try to see what we can say about this. So we say off. We begin. We begin with the very classical stuff. So, this is a river. Brown is sediment, blue is water. It has a width, W, it has a depth, D, and we're going to say that this is roughly the same thing, you know, the aspect ratio is about constant, so it just has a size. And the bed, as we've been told by ANAMIC, the bed is made of sediment in most cases, most cases, like the Bow River. Species like the bow river flowing here, you have big gravels, which are tens of centimeters in size. So there are grains cases. And the basic idea, which is known since a long time, is that in most cases, the flow is transporting the sediment, so it has to exert a force that's enough to move the grain. But it does not transport it like crazy, otherwise, it will not maintain a river. So basically, you are what we say, we call it, we are the What we say, we call it, we are the threshold of sediment motion, which means that the force on the grain here exerted by water, which scales like it's a turbulent force, so it scales like the velocity squared, is just enough to oppose the weight of the grain, so to move it around. So the weight of the grain is gravity times the grain size q. Here there is a grain size squared. So u is the velocity of water, g is gravity, ds is the grain size. And I've removed all annoying constraints. And I've removed all annoying constants, like friction factors, also density ratios, because they're always about one, so we don't care about them. And I'll keep doing those things in a very, you could call it a rough way. So the velocity of a river scales, the square of the velocity scales like the grain size. You can check. If you calculate that for cents, or one millimeter, you find that the velocity is about 0.3 meters per cent. Is about 0.3 meters per second, plus or minus a factor of 10. And you can check for the bow river if you wish. It's bigger pebbles and it flows at something like a few meters per second. Okay, so the grain size sets the velocity of the water in the river because of this equilibrium. Now, if the velocity is set and you have a certain water discharge, Q, so the number of cubic meters per second, that means the velocity is set. That means the velocity is set, so you have to adjust the size of the pipe. And so you find that the width or the size of the river was like the square root of this discharge divided by this velocity, which gives you the quantities. This is classical, and this you can check. And one way to check it is to plot the width of rivers as a function of discharges, this for centi rivers. And the top point over there is the Amazon, and these are laboratory rivers, so thirteen orders of magnitude in discharge. Orders of magnitude in discharge, you see that the red line, which is the theory, sort of works more or less. There is a lot of noise, as always, with no sense. But you know, it's... I think, so this is well done, but I think it also tells us more things about the shape of the network itself, or at least some aspectations in the network. And one way to illustrate this is to use this piece of art by Zenaila Melo-Landi. Naina Melo-Landi, and what this lady does for a living is she takes ropes and she uncoils them. So she separates the threads, and then from the threads she separates the yarns, and then you put it in 2D, and that produces a beautiful branching network. Like this looks like a river network, at least to me. To some people, it looks organic, I don't know. And there's a reason why it looks like a river network. It's not just because it's a branching tree. It's a bit more than that. If you look at the junction, If you look at a junction, right, there is one quantity that's considered of the junction, which is the number of threads. The number of threads in the motor branch is the sum of the number of threads in the two daughter branches. And of course, if you take a picture of the rope, the number of threads is proportional to the square of the width. So when you take a picture, you find that the concept quantity is proportional to the square of the width that you see, which is exactly what's happening for a river, the analogy being that the number of. The analogy being that the number of threads is the water discharge of the river. Does that make sense? More or less? I don't know. You tell me, it doesn't. So you can do that with actual rivers, and that's what Likais did. You take pictures of rivers, and this is in the Ganga estuary. But there are hundreds of junctions like this. And you take three branches junction. You can see that this is the biggest, this is the motor branch. Water is flowing that way, most likely, and you have two delta branches. And you can measure the water. And you can measure the widths of all those branches. And if things are right, because you preserve discharge is Q, the big discharge is the sum of the two small discharges, right? And so the square of the width is the sum of the two square of the two widths. So it's just like Pythagoras' theorem. You can build a square triangle out of this. And indeed, you can do this. If you take the two ratios, you normalize all those widths by. You normalize all those widths by the widths of the weather branch, and you do that for many junctions. You find that the data sort of gathers around this dashed line, which is a circle. So there is some noise, I mean I agree. So the work of Li was mostly to show that this dispersion matches the dispersion that you find in uh in the widths of rivers, which is pretty simple. So I could see people smiling when they saw the this data. And one person that was not smiling was John Shaw. One person that was not spinning was John Sho, because he knows that if you want to fill data, it's always like this. It's all over the place. So you have to convince people that it makes sense nonetheless. That's true. Thank you. So, okay, so that gives you a sense of this aspect ratio, but it tells you nothing about the distance between rivers, right? It's just subtractions. And it tells you nothing about this distance, and that's what we are asking. This distance, and that's what we asked. We wanted to know what the distance between rivers and how it relates to their size. So, we now consider a catchment. So, a catchment is this thing. So, these lines are rivers, they are branching rivers. And the catchment is the area that collects all the rainwater that will flow through this river. So, it's an area. And of course, catchments are nested into each other. The smaller catchments. Into each other. The smaller attachments belong to the bigger attachments, and so on and so forth. It's a fractal structure down to some scale. Very easy thing to write is that the discharge of the river, it goes mostly like the redfall rate times the area of the catchment, so L squared. Now remember, the discharge is proportional to the size, the width of the river squared, which means that the ratio of the catchment size of the river width to the catchment size. The catchment size of the river, which to the catchment size, is a constant for all scales through a network. And this constant scales like the square root of the red road, divided by this characteristic velocity, which is again the grain size. If you calculate this for a normal river, what is a normal river? But a normal river is a grain flow rate of one meter per year. It's probably something around this here. And the grain size you can take sand as a reference. And you find As a reference. And you find a ratio of something like 10 to the minus 4. So indeed, the width of the river is 10,000 times smaller than the size of the catchment it drains. So there are really thin lines in the landscape, and you can calculate this ratio. That's why, if you take an iodial picture of a catchment, you don't see the rivers, or maybe with a good resolution, you see the biggest one, but not the small ones. Right? So you're here with me? So, why is it not true in So why is it not true in river deltas or in mud flats? And Stefan knows something. At least you should. Well, you told it many times. So it's because, of course, the tidal flats, as their name implies, they're tidal. So it's not rainfall that feeds the river, it's the tides. So to look at this, we can go to a place that's closer to Paris than Nigeria. This is the Somme estuary in France. Estuary in France. So it's not a big river, but it has a huge estuary like this, and there are lots of mud flats you can see. It's a bit small, but you can see small telemetic networks that are draining mud flats around the big estuary. So to give you a sense of scale, these basins here are about 100 meters in size. It's a it's a beautiful place. And so if you zoom into onto one of those One of those networks, like this, what they did last week. Just zoom on that, take a picture, and you can draw what your drainage network is. Or it's a guess game, really, because you don't exactly know where the drainage, what the catchment is, but you know that if you fall very close to that river, you'll probably flow into this river. So you play this game and you draw it by hand, and what's nice on Deltas is that you can measure on the same picture the size of the catchment. The size of the hatchment and the width of the river, which you couldn't do in a normal case. How do you draw these backgrounds? Like what is guiding you to draw this? Guesswork. So you just draw it. In fact, if you... Well, the thing is hard to. So the first thing is you're right right to be worried, because I don't know. I mean, you can't really know. But it's you know, if if if your water if you is here, it will probably then flow to the further storm. Probably then flow to the further score, not to this one. So it's very approximate. But in fact, you'll find that if you play that game, which I encourage you to do, you'll find that you don't have that much choice. And that won't change much the area, the catchment. There are more professional ways to do this. But I just did it quickly. You're fine with our metals. It's good. I feel much better then. So you do that and you collect the cat. That and you collect the catchment areas and their widths, and you can plot one as a function of the other. So that's the square root of the catchment area, so it's the drainage length, or maybe it's the drainage length, as a function of the width, and it's more or less proportional. The line is a theory for a grain size of 0.7 millimeter, which was adjusted to this, basically sand, which is exactly what the sum estuary is made of. You can check by going there. Going there. And so the thing that you had to guess was the reinforcement. And the rainfall rate, in fact, is the tidal amplitude. So in the summit, it's very large. It's about 10 meters for the big tides. And so 10 meters in 12 hours is about 1 meter per hour. So if you stick that in the formula, you get this line. So I think in a way this explains why they're so fat in entire areas, but it's just because they are like any other river, they are. Because they are like any other river, they are just at the threshold. But again, you see, this is just an aspect ratio. So we know nothing about the minimal size of the catchments. So the typical distance between rivers. It can be true for any catchments. It would be a fractal relationship, so it wouldn't stop. Yes? So the fact that the water comes from the ground or come from the sea doesn't change anything? Doesn't change anything. Doesn't change anything. I mean, we'll hear the whole week, I think, we'll hear talks that say that it matters a lot that it flips directions. So I won't say it doesn't change anything. But it doesn't change the basic scaling for size. I think a fair answer. So now we would like to know what's the distance between rivers, or it's also called, it could be called drainage density if you invert it. Drainage density, if you invert it. And to do that, you need to know why the network stops growing and branching. So that means a river needs to feel that there is a neighboring river. So there needs to be some way of communicating. So what is the physical quantity that mediates this connection between rivers, which clearly is a non-local process. Sorry. But no, no, no, it's fine. It's fine. So there are two schools about this. So there are two schools about this. I think there are two schools of thought. One that I would call Smith and Butterton. So this is how you produce landscapes. So there is a hill, rainfalls, there is surface warmer, so it's like there is a sheet of water flowing down. If there is a place where you have a bit more water, you erode more, so you create even more water, and so this is unstable and generic useless. From the top, so rivers in size into the landscape. That's the dominant school by far in geomorphology. But there's another school, which I would call Dunn's School, which says, ah, no, no, it's all about groundwater. It's all about groundwater. This drawing, you see, this is a baby river growing into a plateau like this. Those dashed lines are groundwater levels and these are flow lines. So the river changes the groundwater level and attracts more and more water and it grows like the root of a tree into the plateau, collecting more and more crown. Platform collecting more and more crown. This is Tenseview. You know, it's like politics, you know, there are two camps, you have to make a decision, choose which camp is yours, so you do it based on purely rational facts. And so this is a 3D diagram, this is a 2D diagram, 2D is probably better than 3D. So we probably would choose this. But if you disagree, you can also look at the offsprings of the two theories. And I take only the best of both. So, this is the work of Taylor Perron some years ago. And so, he coded the first version, I won't go into the details, and then he adjusted, or they adjusted some different coefficients for the topography around the rivers and all the things. And they run the code and they find that you have a finite length for the values. You see those little red rivers? So, rivers are red, yeah, I think rivers are red in this box. It's strange, but so you have a minimal distance between values. So, that's the scale of the landscape. It's all set by. Scale of the landscape is all set by diffusion order. Nice? This is a bit harder to code because now there are rivers lines growing into a diffusive field which is groundwater. And those lines sometimes can bifurcate and they change direction following where the groundwater is. So it's a bit more complicated, but if you do that, you can produce beautiful trees like this. This is the work of Erstein Slovakzkovsky, Hans Jorg, and Pchott has. Hans Jorg and Chot as well. So, which one is better is not for me to judge, really. I think we should vote. And since half of the authors are in the room here, I think we can safely proceed with groundwater. So, it's all about it. So, how does it work in groundwater tech? So, this is the work of Adrienne Guerin. This is Field Data. This is a small stream in tropical rainforests in Wednesday Island. And Wednesday Island in the Caribbean, and so you can dig hole in the grounds and you stick pressure sensor in there. You have those gray lines are the boreholes where you measure the water elevation. The brown is the surface of the ground. The stream is flowing towards you. That's an indication for the other plots, right? And the stream is perpendicular to the screen. And this is groundwater. So this is filled with water. So the rain falls in, goes to water. So the rain falls in, goes to the water table. The water table is inclined towards the river. So there is a pressure gradient, so the water goes from here to here as a Darcy flow through a progress method. In terms of scale, you get a relationship out of Darcy's law, which says you how fast the water goes in the progress flow. It's pretty straightforward, so I then introduced the K, which is the hydraulic conductivity of the Conductivity of the ground. And k times the h is the elevation of the groundwater, L is the size of the system, so this is the gradient of elevation, so that gives you the velocity of the water, times the height of the groundwater, that gives you the flux of groundwater that's entering the river. And this must match however much water you got from rainfall. So rainfall times the length of the catchment. So that's one relationship between per permeability, elevation and length. Elevation and length. Okay? Again, you can do that keenly. I just do it very roughly. So you keep that in mind. And then, so the river is like that now. So this is parameters is a river. Now you do this. You open the system like this. And that brings up this experiment by Marie Mouier, who's working with Eric Lechmes and Jordan Effeld. This is a very recent work. The experiment is like that: you see it from the side, you have two glasses. You have two glass walls on the side, it's a pale-show system. You fill it with glass beads, which you see here. Here is mostly dry, and what's light color here is filled with water, and there is a flux of water that way. And the red lines are dye, so it's the flow lines. The water emerges here, and then it flows on along the surface. And when you run the experiment, the water entrains the glass bits, so it erodes its way. So it erodes its way and it cuts into the landscape like this until it stops. This would be the spring and this is the river. Okay, so in the real world of course the river would be in that direction. But it's easier to see this direction. What's important that always stops at some point. And the reason why it stops, in fact, the details are not so clear yet. If you want to do it carefully, it's a bit fishy. I don't know exactly. But what seems to happen is. But what seems to happen is that the river has a slope, you know. Water follows the slope. They have a slope, so if they grow into the landscape, they also go up. And they can't go above the water table, which feeds them with water. They collect the water from the ground. So they stop when they're as high as the water table. And so if you assume that the elevation of the along the river is the same as the elevation or the change in elevation in the water table, Kill the water table, you get this relationship: that the river slope is a bit like the water table slope around it, and this ratio is 8 over 1. So we keep the first relation, we keep this one, we add the third one, and we are done. So this, I think, is the least certain part of all this. We're not completely sure about this. But if you assume so, you just need to add So, you just need to add one piece. This one piece is again the threshold theory. Now, you see, this is the river seen from the side, so there is a slope in that direction, water is flowing on top of the sediment, and water is barely able to move the sediment. So, the force exerted by water on the sediment is the slope of S, the slope of the river, times its depth, times gravity, density, and all of that. And this must match exactly the weight of a grain. So, again, you would have the TSQ, the density of the grain, all that is gone. Density of the grain, all that is gone. So you end up with an interesting relationship, which is the slope of a river is the ratio of the grain size, which is small, to the size of the river, the depth, which is large. So typically the slope of rivers is small. You can check this relation, and it works pretty well. Combine it with the discharge relation that we had before. You find that the discharge goes, it inverse squared slope of the river. So big rivers with large discharge have very small slopes. 10 to the minus 5 for the MS. 10 to the minus 5 for the Amazon, for instance. Small rivers in mountains, they are very steep. Yes? We put all that together. I spare you the details, you end up with only one possible size. So L is the size now of the smallest catchments. What they're called in the Strahler ordering, the zeroth order or first order streams. This is then the distance between rivers, sort of the shortest distance. Sort of the shortest distance between this. Am I being too long? Yeah, you have two? Oh, that's horrible. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. So you end up having a length that scales like one over the rainfall rate. Okay, so the more rainfall you have, the shorter this length. Because we're so close to the coffee break, I'll skip through a few things, but you can say that the permeability is also dependent on the grain. Is also dependent on the grain size and on viscosity because it's a Darcy flow, so it's like a Poissi flow, it's a viscous flow in the ground. If you do that, you find that the size of the catchment is just a question of rainfall, grain size, gravity, and viscosity. And you can try to compare that with actual drainage systems. This is the Sun River. This is the size of the catchment path. The size of the catchment compared to the sediment size. And this is rainfall that has been made dimensionless by viscosity, gravity, grand size, all that's necessary. This is the sunriver, this is the blue point, this is the orange point, this is some random network in Florida. And of course you could, I mean, it's a complete disaster. You have two points, and the line doesn't even go through any of the. On the other hand, we've been very deft to On the other hand, we've been very dirty with the dimensions, we've got all the factors and all that, and there is no fit for me. This line is just for sand, just the grand side of sand. So in a way, I'm not sure, but I would suspect that the screenings are more or less correct. Okay, so I'll conclude. I will not tell you this. Maybe you will ask, I don't know. But you can even reduce the problem by saying that the size of the sun growth. That the size of the sun grain is selected by the viscosity of the flow itself. It's the particle that settles at Reynolds number one. If you say that, then the size of a catchment is just viscosity of a rainfall, which is a few tens of meters, maybe a few hundreds of meters if you keep the constant. So yeah, it basically rules the world. Thank you very much for your attention. I'm sorry for time. So we have time for a few questions. Thank you, Linda, for very much meeting this. So if there are no questions, the young people first. The young people first, yes. I don't know if I'm young or not, but I don't know. And I just want the slide where they are at the beginning. At the beginning, where you show the relationship between the sediment p-star essentially the conservation of flow mass that you impose at each other. Don't you think that the scatter that you have in the blood that you have shown is due to the fact that you are imposing the water conservation but not the cellular mass conservation? Yes, so this is true, this is true. It's a very very fair point from you know what you're asking, right? There are two, but then we will learn about this this week, I think, because we talk about this: the influence of the sediment discharge on the width of river. I think the first order control is the water discharge, but then the sediment discharge also adds something to the width. So in fact, the relation is probably more complicated, and you could explain the scatter. But you also find that the scatter is just exactly the scatter that you find on the width itself, which varies along the path of the river. So I'm not sure. Flash review. So I'm not sure, but I think you have to ask sand and beaches. There is sand which is almost flat. So when you tie it twice a day, you have millions of rivers of sand which form away, and so you have billions. And so you have willows that grow, which are about several meters in size or 100 meters in size, twice a day by the median. So I guess this kind of knowledge should be like. My question is, on the relationship between this tidal rivers and the rain, is that at some point you have a uniform field of water, which is equivalent to the fact that rain falls everywhere. Falls everywhere. The rain falls more or less uniformly. So, when you see your images, and the scene is under the tide, at some point there is a transition between the tip of a river and some place where the liquid flows uniformly and there is no water. So, this is an observation, or this is the fact that the river ends at some point. That's the whole point. It does end up. Yes, there is a transition between. There is a transition which is a smooth layer of water and a smooth layer of water, which is an iron. So I think how do you treat that signal? This one I don't treat really because I think you don't really have a sheet of water that's flowing on top of the sand. What feeds typically, I mean I haven't seen new rivers but do small rivers on the beach, is the fact that water that has been brought into the sand by the tide is now flowing through the sand. Flowing through the sand to the sea, and so the river is collecting this groundwater around it. And then you're right, you're right. It becomes singular. In fact, it diverges as the square root of the distance from the tip if you consider a porous flow. So of course the the whole model breaks down as the size of this Lieman grain. That's absolutely true. The new images, does it go all the way down to the silicon green? Go all the way down to the sequel grid, the wire? I mean, we would need to have an incredible satellite to show the some grains. I mean, on the slide. You went in the island to measure the river. Yes. So is it one grain or is it something more? The end of the river? It becomes muddy, you know, and so but clearly it's it's more than one grain, I mean a few meters where it seeps all over and then there are leaves and stuff. And then there are leaves and stuff growing. It's hard to say, yeah. Post not find a way. Sorry. No, I think we sorry. We take the coffee break and we have more time to discuss after the session. So I would rather have the coffee break now that everybody has coffee and can discuss with Olivia in person. It's very important, uh it's particularly the same as the
