Okay, so we will try not to get confused here. Okay, so yeah, so thanks very much to the organizers for letting me speak here. And yeah, well, as clearly it's a pity we can't speak. It's a pity we can't be in Oaxaca at this Casa Mexicana, but still it's nice to see everyone around. Okay, so what I will talk today is about inflation, in particular when more than one scalar field is around. I will focus on more than one scalar field, although in the question, in the discussion, if anyone wants to know a bit more when gauge fields are around, I will also. When gauge fields are around, I will also talk about that or just discuss. Okay, now we try this. Yes. Okay, so since I know there are some students around, let me just put the context here and start by saying, introducing inflation in the very in one slide or two and just say that well inflation is this That, well, inflation is this mechanism that gave us a quasi-deceter expansion in the very early universe, which was caused by some form of energy density in the early universe, which gave rise to a Hubble parameter of expansion that accelerated in the early universe. Okay, now this inflation in the early universe nicely Nicely helps understand why the universe looks so homogeneous and essentially flat today. But also, more remarkable, it also provided the seeds, the origin for the fluctuations that eventually we see today in the CMB, in the cosmic microwave background radiation. And in order to, of course, address these two issues. Address these two issues, there has to be an accelerated expansion, but it has to last long enough. And long enough can be quantified, and it can be quantified always in terms of this scale factor, the lowering of the scale factor, how much the universe has expanded. And okay, in the simplest, simplest implementation of the inflationary paradigm. Inflationary paradigm, you can drive this accelerated expansion in the early universe using a scalar field that has a potential that has the required properties to precisely accelerate for long enough. And you can encode those conditions that the universe accelerates and does it for a sufficiently long time in terms of derivatives of the Hubble parameter. Derivatives of the Hubble parameter that we just introduced here. But when you look at the simplest scenario, this Vanilla model, this can be nicely encoded in, first of all, in terms of the derivatives of the scalar and moreover, in terms of the derivatives of the scalar potential itself. And the idea is that you have a potential, so this condition. Have a potential, so these conditions at the end of the day can be translated into conditions. So, the potential that has to be sufficiently flat, otherwise, the universe won't accelerate. But it has to be also sufficiently flat for sufficiently long time, otherwise, you won't be able to address the issues that I mentioned at the beginning. And that is encoded in this second parameter, which is called the eta-v parameters, lower role parameter, which is associated to the second. Which is associated with the second derivative of the scalar potential. And you can see here also, and so one can easily realize that this condition means that the mass of this scalar field has to be very light, much lighter than the Hubble parameter itself. Now, this vanilla model is in perfect agreement. The predictions of this model, particular for the density perturbations. The density perturbations match very well. In particular, this is encoded in terms of the cosmological parameters, the spectral index, NS, and R, which encodes, it tells us something about the amplitude of the gravitational tensor perturbations, while this tells us something about the scalar perturbations. And this is always nicely encoded in. Always nicely encoded in this plot where we can see the latest results from Planck, and more recently we have the results from Bicep and Keck, which are putting stronger constraints on this tensor-to-scale L ratio R, which encodes, tells us something about the amplitude of the tensor perturbations, which are a generic prediction of inflation, but the amplitude depends. But the amplitude depends on the model, as we can see here. Several models around, and I'm going to try and move this somewhere. Okay, so this seems to be working very nicely. And one may wonder, well, that's it. We don't need any more. However, there has always been, of course, motivations, and you may have your prefere Your preferred motivation to go beyond that. And so, some reasons, maybe because inflation may have happened, probably, likely, may have occurred in the very early universe where the energy densities will be very high and where we will expect something else to be going on around. So, one will be interested to know what is the energy density content. What is the energy density content? What is the field content in the very early universe? And we may get information out of that precisely studying inflation. And these parameters are also precisely can be related to the energy scale when inflation happened, essentially the V to the one-quarter, but it also nicely can be related to how much the field traveled during inflation. And in the simplest And in the simplest scenarios, if there's no only one scalar for sure, but even more scalars, you can always relate them in this way via the light band. So this tells you something about the separation between these displacements being subplankian or superplankian. And since, well, data are coming and are coming soon. Coming and are coming soon, and they are telling us, giving us better constraints, prospects on what people will be able to measure for R. It's important to understand indeed what would be the energy scale of inflation, for example. So again, this motivates being around at very high energy scales. You will expect theories such as supergravity or string theory to be. Supergravity or string theory to be relevant there. And then we may use this inflationary scenario to learn about these theories. And one of the biggest motivations that I will be having in mind in the rest of the talk will be the observational consequences that thinking about just beyond the single-field vanilla model of inflation may have for observations that are coming and are coming very soon. What kind of motivations? Where motivations come in many ways, and these, of course, are start from sourced gravitational waves. I'll comment on that if I have time. Formation of primordial black holes. Now that we are seeing so many events coming from black holes, some of us, the idea that they may have a primordial origin is actually becoming more and more strong with time. With time. Also, non-Gaussianities, etc. So, all these may be a strong, very strong motivation for looking beyond the single vanilla model of inflation. And so, there are also quantum gravity constraints about which we heard on Monday. I won't talk much about that, but I will make some connections and they will seem to constrain. And they will seem to constrain, for example, the field range of inflation or what kind of inflationary models we can have. I'll say that I'd like to mention that from the phenomenological point of view, people have been considering sort of T-sides, so the people doing more inflation from the phenomenological point of view, looking at observational consequences. So there's a lot of work there, and one question is whether those models have some theoretically strong support or not. So that's also motivation. So to get into this, I would like to take, so going to string inflation and supergravity inflation, I will take a step back and will first of all start by revisiting the idea of multi-field inflation. The idea of multi-field inflation. So, what does it mean to have inflation when you have more than one scalar field? This will allow me to introduce the idea of fat inflation. This also very, very fashionable nowadays called lash tons. And then I will relate them to the so-called data problem for those who have heard of that. And then, of course, so this here they're having a lot of They're having a lot of interest, particularly having large tons because of the phenomenological applications. So, the question: the first question one may ask is: if we want to have or look at these features in more complete theory, so the first step will be to, well, let's see how this looks in supergravity. And then I will show you a model in stream. In string theory, a debrain model of inflation, where these features will appear. And originally, I plan to discuss a bit this idea of having source gravitational waves via the presence of spectator gauge fields. This is a very interesting possibility from the phenological point of view, it's very popular. Point of view is very popular. So, the question is: can we actually have this? What are the challenges that string model of inflation, such as scalar inflation, which is a very good sort of model in which we can explore these questions? What will be the challenges and what will be the features that we need? So I won't talk about this. This I can discuss in the discussion session if anyone would like to know a bit more what are the processes. More, what are the prospects? Okay, so then I'll start with multi-field, what I call for the moment light slow roll inflation. So let me just start by saying that it has been usually the standard law to believe that in order to have inflation, whether it is with a single scalar field or a multi-several scalar fields, you need the fields, the scalar fields. Fields, the scalar fields to be light, and whenever I say light or heavy, it's always with respect to the Hubble scale, H. And this is simple to understand because we know that in single field inflation, we have, I already mentioned the slow roll eta V parameter, which in single field inflation is related to the second derivative of the scalar potential, and V is essentially in order for inflation to happen. To for inflation to happen is given by h square. Essentially, you can call this h square. And so, this condition immediately imposes that your scalar field is light, otherwise you don't inflate for sufficiently long time, so you don't have sustained inflation. So, this immediately sets the stage that well the inflatons here have to be light, and notice, of course, there's the absolute value. Course, there's the absolute values. So, for example, if for people who know a bit more of cosmology, maybe more familiar with, say, Starbuckski-like inflationary models, they do have tachyonic masses for the inflation during inflation, but is a tachyonic mass that is smaller than h. So, this is satisfied also for the, well, really for the absolute value in single field inflation. And the problem is that when that is not. And the problem is that when that is not the case, you run into the problem that this, if there are higher-order corrections, they may contribute precisely, I mean this you can see easily, they will spoil this sustained slow roll inflation that you want in order to solve the horizon flatness problem, and so on. Now, if we think about Now, if we think about string theory models, we also need a certain hierarchy of scales. This has also been talked about a lot. So, you need to compactify and you need to make sure that when you are doing inflation, you are dealing with 4D, for example, 4D, low-energy effective theory, where everything else, all the scales that should not be relevant, are higher than the Hubble parameter. Hubble parameter. So the mass of your inflaton has to be sufficiently light. And usually to keep the mass of this field light, well, people usually have to call for some symmetries or some fine-tuning. But this is not the case in what I call fat slow roll inflation. Or it's really more generally if you look at what it means for slow roll to in multi-field inflation. In multi-feed inflation. So, as I will show in a moment, once you have more than one scalar, sort of a new direction opens up, and then there's a new attractor, there's a new inflationary attractor that appears that occurs at sort of in a different direction, which is precisely when this terming rate I was, last terms I was talking around about. I was talking around about appear, or simply you can also have these strongly non-geodesic trajectories. And slow roll is perfectly fine, nothing wrong happens, even when you have all of your scalars present being heavier than the Hubble parameter. So this is completely opposite to what we always thought, but this appears because precisely now you are more than Because precisely now you are more than one scalar, so a new direction opens, and in fact, something like a new slow-roll parameter arises. So, for people that maybe are familiar with TBI inflation, they will remember that there was a new slow-oral parameter that appeared there, which is the speed of sound CS. So, you also have to make sure that the change in CS was small. So, that introduced. Small, so that introduces so DBI introduces DBI inflation introduces also a new slower parameter. So here we will see that there's a kind of a new slower parameter we have to consider. And just to say also, of course, this can also happen when the absolute value of the inflatons is large, larger than h. So inflation is perfectly happy in this case, even when this is not the case. When this is not the case, yeah, when this is inverted. Okay, so in what follows, I will take you through the questions why this is the case. So if yeah, maybe this is a good moment to stop for questions if there are. Okay, I think there are no questions. So let me then take you through the argument, through the throat. So let's just consider a situation where we have several scalars with coupled gravity which have some potential and And which are not economically normalized in the sense that the field space metric GAB is a function of the fields and it may be curved, I mean have negative, positive, or zero curvature. But it's non-trivial. So at this stage, the equations are general, but after this slide, I will concentrate on two fields because then it makes things clearer, but of course. Clearer, but of course, this will also be possible to just extend to more than one field, two fields. So, again, we are talking about FRW as our space-time metric. And the questions of motion, well, simply take this form, where as the first thing I have defined the velocity of the fields all together in this way, in this Carly Phi that I also call Carly. That I also call Carlify at the beginning for a reason. And these Christoffel symbols are associated precisely to this field space metric. Okay, so these are the questions. But in order to take you and to understand what it means to slow roll in multi-field inflation, it is useful to consider, to use the so-called kinematic basis, which was used, has been used on this. Uh, has been used on this, what is used mostly in the when people analyze the perturbations. So, this uh in this basis, you simply project all of your equations into the tangent and normal to the inflationary trajectory. So, this is very, very standard. But things become much clearer in these bases when we look at the background equations, which is what I would do. And when you do that, the equations take this very simple The equations take this very simple form. So, this looks as if it was a single field, except that now we have instead of the derivative of V with respect to a single of the scalars, this is the projection along the tangent direction of Vt. So, this equation is the tangent projection, and then from the normal projection, you get this equation, which is where we introduce this new parameter, this tamming rate that I mentioned. That I mentioned, which is associated to the normal projection of the derivatives of the potential weighted by phi dot. And so let me immediately introduce also this omega, which is simply the dimensionless turning rate parameter, which is going to be also important because whenever this omega rate is large, you have what is called turning rates, but also. Rates, but also this equivalently means that your trajectories are non-geodesic, so strongly non-geodesic if it is bigger than one. So, okay, nothing I've done here of special, but I'm going to take one more step and I'm going to also rewrite, use the equations to write the projections of the second derivatives of the potential along the normal and tangent normal directions. Tangent normal directions in terms of these parameters, which at this point I haven't done any slow roll approximation. So these expressions are exact. There's no slow roll approximation. But of course, I'm looking towards slow roll. So what we know is that in slow roll, these parameters have to be small. In fact, I introduced at the very beginning precisely these two parameters, which holds also in the multi. Which holds also in the multifield case. But we will also have this third derivative being small. And moreover, this is the new parameter I was talking about, which is this new, which is the change in the atomic rate on the departure of the geodesic, which also will have to be small to have a sustained inflation. So, let me just take you very quickly through the steps. You very quickly through the steps what it means to have slower inflation, meaning these parameters are small, and then you can check that indeed h square is mostly driven by the potential, this never changed potential energy, it doesn't change. But now we see that we have that the tangent projection of the slow-roll epsilon parameter, which will be the derivative of the potential, but projected along. The potential that projected along the tangent direction has to be small. But the normal projection, in principle, doesn't have to be small, and remember, it's related to this turning rate or non-geodesic motion. On the other hand, the epsilon V itself can be related to these parameters and to my new parameter, omega over H, in this way. And in fact, it was shown some time ago. Shown some time ago and also more recently in the context of the Swamp Land conjectures that precisely because of this relation, if you have a model in multi-field inflation, remember this is arising because we have more than one scalar, if this parameter is very large, then there may be a possibility where epsilon v becomes of order one and you have inflation without any problem. But we want to take a step further and do the following. We also had these equations. Remember, I talk about the equations which are the equation of motion for VTT and Vtm. In slow roll, the equation of motion becomes this and also this. In order for the two equations to be satisfied, I need to have, well, this has to be equals to the Vtt over V has to be. The Vtt over V has to be equal roughly of the order of omega over H. But also, from the other equation, what I get is that this new parameter that I introduced before also has to be very small, as was introduced in it by Sonia in this paper. But also, this condition has to be satisfied. So, the first thing I want you to realize is that so far I have. Is that so far? I haven't made use at all of the minimal eigenvalue of the Hessian, in other words, the masses of the inflatons, which was usually called eta-V parameter in multi- it's it is called it's related to eta-v parameter in multi-feed inflation. But at this point, we haven't made any constraint, given any constraint on this. Now, next thing to Next thing to notice is that, well, several models, you can take a model randomly, multi-field model, and you may check these parameters and you will find that they will have small omega over h and consequently, in order for the equation of motion to be satisfied, you will check that vtt over v is also small. This is just the equation of motion, so nothing funny happening there. However, of course, again, However, of course, again, a new interesting possibility can arise whenever this omega rh is large, because this can also be very large. And what does it mean if this projection is large? What does it mean for the minimal eigenvalue of the inflatons? So, here I'm just going to remind you a general relation between the minimal eigenvalue of a matrix and the projection along a And the projection along a unit vector. Any unit vector, by the way, the tangent and normal vectors are unit vectors. So for any given matrix that you have, the minimal eigenvalue satisfies this condition for any projection along a unit vector. And therefore, if we take the unit vector to be precisely our tangent vector, the minimal eigenvalue is less or equal than. Value is less or equal than dtt. So, what's going to happen if suppose the minimal eigenvalue is much bigger than h squared? In other words, all the scalar fields that you have around are heavier than the Hobble parameter. That means that, well, from this inequality, Vtt over H square is going to be much bigger than one. Than one, and through the equation of motion, that means that omega over h squared is much bigger than one. So, this is giving you a possibility where you may have indeed heavy fields, fat fields, as we call them, and inflation happening without any problem. And of course, these kind of models of these kind of trajectories immediately have large or simply larger than one. Or simply larger than one, turning rates or simply the trajectories are deviating from a geodesic and they may deviate. So it's enough that it's bigger than one, of course, doesn't have to be super, super large. And of course, the same can be done. The same is true for negative eigenvalues. Okay, so okay, so I'm going. Okay, so I'm going to give you a couple of examples, but if there are any questions, I'll say this is a good moment to stop for questions. If there are anything else. So, I don't think there are questions. So, I'm going to give you two examples because what's better than just look at examples and see with your own eyes what I'm saying. And also to illustrate a couple of things. So, first, this is so there are no strings here, no supergravity. This is just a filter example where I have. Where I have two scalar fields, rho and theta, I'm using this is a flat field space metric, but I'm using polar coordinates. And I'm going to give a potential that is just the sum of two potentials, rho square and mass term for rho, and the cosine-like potential for theta. And well, you can check easily. So, of course, the sphere space curvature is. Space curvature is zero, so it is flat. And you can check that you can have inflation without any issues, even if the two eigenvalues of the Hessian are larger than H. So, this is what I'm plotting here. Inflation is happening, no problem. This is eta H, not eta V. And the turbine rate in this. And the turbine rate in this particular example, the departure from geodesic, is relatively large, is 12-ish. So here I think I'm plotting only a few, 20 evolves before the end of inflation. So this is first example. Of course, it's just a filter example, but then it shows you exactly what I'm saying. Just as a comparison, remember I was telling you, well, maybe epsilon B. Telling you well, maybe epsilon v can be a further one if you have large turning rates. So, in this case, just for comparison, epsilon v is much bigger than epsilon, but still is not, well, depends whether you want to call this other one or not, but it's much bigger than epsilon for sure. And here I just plotted the eigenvalues themselves rather than the squares. So it's again much bigger than h. Much bigger than age. A question, uh, Yvonne? Can I ask a question? Yeah, yes, can you more or less see it? Because usually, in the standard way you saw, you have a row will be the inflatone and it will be like a chaotic inflation. And then you will be running around in the theta direction, but then you spiral and go very fast to the minimum. But this is not what is happening. Can you more or less tell us into the intuition how the field is rolling? Intuition how the film is rolling? So that's yeah, that's if you can actually plot, but it's misleading and I will maybe I can tell you at the end at the end. It may be misling, but in this particular case, you can indeed plot what would be the raw cos and raw sign together, and you will see it spirally. So, but if you plot the trajectories of the field themselves, then Of the field themselves, the one, the field that is inflating is cost, and the predictions will be more like natural inflation rather than this. So, this field is sort of following along, it's just being dragged by theta, but the two are evolving. Okay, but I would have said that the robot will roll very, very fast. I would prefer to come down to the minimum. To the minimum no, no, that's this okay. This case is very, very simple, and that's not in fact, you can shift. Let me see in this example. I think it's no, in this case, you can shift raw in these examples, you need to move row a little bit away of the minimum, but not much. It away of the minimum, but not much, not much. And it will not go just to its minimum. It's following a kind of adiabatic minimum, if you want, which is driven by theta. Okay, thank you. So, but it does depend a little bit on the metric and the potential. Okay, okay, interesting. Thank you. Okay. Okay, uh are there any other questions? I'm going to show you now a slides. Maybe you will remain more shocked at the following example. So this is again a field theory example and it's supergravity inspired by the alpha tractors. This model as well as the stability. The stability of these models and how to understand how you change from the, I'm going to call this the light inflation attractor to the fat inflation attractor, how it happens. So all this stability has been studied by Diederik and collaborators. So I just refer to their papers. But this example is very nice because it shows precisely the change in attractors. Change in attractors. So I was mentioning the CU attractor, and we see it here very clearly. Same, this is similar, but not exactly the same, as something which is called sidetrack inflation by Sebastian and collaborators, where a similar thing is happening. So, but I'm going to discuss this example. So, this is an example where now we do have a negative curvature. Have a negative curvature in the field space. Potential is again relatively simple, is the sum of two phi squared, chi squared. And here I have plotted the evolution of phi and chi just to show exactly what's happening. So at the very beginning, you have apparently the two fields not moving much. They are moving, but it's very tiny. But after the change to this other attractor, the trajectory really. Attractor, they the trajectory really is changing, and again, here they reach their minimum. So, in terms of what's happening to the slow roll parameters and to omega over H, this is what happens. So, epsilon stars very small, it changes still smaller than one, otherwise you don't inflate, but it's much bigger than in this light inflation sort of attractor. And during this first stage, omega rh is less than one. A omega rh is less than one, and uh, but more interestingly, what happens to the masses? The masses of the inflatons. Well, this is what happens. So, in the first stage is light inflation, indeed, the absolute value of the masses, both of them, the minimal eigenvalue, they are all smaller than h. But what happens once you cross to this large turning rate or non-geodesic attractor, the masses become very, very large. Masses become very, very large, as you can see. So, okay, so here, yes, just regarding Fernando's question, here you can see that there is some evolution. There's no field falling into its minimum, if you want. So, I want to sort of make a few points here, which are important, like messages to take from what I said so far. So, the most important is that in multi-feed inflation, you don't need light fields. Second thing is that you can have highly non-geodesic trajectories or these large turning rates with relatively simple potentials. And you don't need a negative curvature. So, I show you the example with the flat. So, I show you the example with the flat curvature. And something that I can just discuss in the discussion, if you want, is that there's also this also gives rise to a very natural way to generate large terminal rates out of large transient violations of slow roll. But I can say more in the discussion if anyone is. Discussion: if anyone is interested, okay, so just to finish, I want to make a connection to these recent constraints on the Citer, the Citer conjectures, as they are called, which simply are telling us that sine of quantum gravity, quantum theory of gravity, we can, if you look at the scalar potential, it has to satisfy either this or this. Either this or this condition. Okay, so well, what happens if we look at inflation in the case of multi-feed inflation? Well, first of all, if we think about fat inflation itself, where all the fields have positive masses and that are larger than age, clearly, this condition is not satisfied, and this first condition. And this first condition may or may not be satisfied. And I show this will correspond to the first example I show you, where this is barely satisfied. But more interestingly, what happens is that if the films are fat and tachyonic, this condition is always satisfied. And whether this condition is satisfied, I don't know, depends how large omega over H is, but omega over H doesn't have to be super large in order for the Have to be super large in order for the first condition to be satisfied. This guy is bigger than one and nothing special happens. So, okay, so this is the connection I wanted to make. I will come back to this in the second part. So, this is maybe it's not super clear at this point. So, let me just say these stamming rates have attracted a lot of. Have attracted a lot of interest because they may have very interesting implications for observations. And all the two examples I mentioned are a field theory, but the question is, so if we want to explore super gravity or string theory, do this actually arise naturally, or is it, yeah, so what will be, what's the status, if you want? Status, if you want, so this is what I want to discuss next. And sorry, I see there are some things. Okay, some so before I discuss what happens in supergravity, maybe I can stop again for questions if there are. Is there an issue with large non-Gaussianities in multi-field inflation models? Not necessarily. Not necessarily. Actually, it may be better than not having large turning red. I will maybe I'll show you in a concrete example in the deep brain model that I will do. The brain model that I will do, but that's uh, that's uh certainly a good question, and you will think it may be that, but it seems to happen the opposite. So, I'll I'll show you okay. Okay, so let me let me then start. Okay, so this is all very good, and then we were wondering with what I mentioned in a moment, so this is very interesting. So, this slide. So, this is very interesting. So, these last toning rates may have a lot of interesting phenomenology. So, the question is: if you open the literature of supergravity inflation with multi-field, there are not many, well, whenever there's something, and then you start checking those models, well, it seems that Lashton is right just are not there. So, we were wondering. We were wondering what happens in supergravity. So, what we have here is when you go to supergravity, of course, the Lagrangian is more constrained, you have to follow the rules of supergravity, and in particular, the field space metric in this case is dictated by the Keller potential. The Scheller potential is built out of the Keller potential and the super potential. So, it has a very So, it has a very very specific form, and moreover, here all the scalars are complex scalars. So, I will probably interchange scalar by superfield. So, for students, you just have to imagine that here the scalars become complex scalars. So, the very first thing you may imagine, well, if I want to do You may imagine. Well, if I want to do a two-field model, maybe I consider one of single of these scalars or superfields. That doesn't work very well. It's called school steam inflation, but people have shown that it's actually rather difficult to inflate in that case. So what we did, so first of all, we were looking at the literature and then The literature and the large scan of models, and well, this large toning dresses never seem to appear with a single example that I will mention later. So, what we did is to say, okay, let's consider two superfields or simply two scalar, two complex scalar fields, where one of these superfields is the so-called Evolstino superfield, which we are going to set to be milpotent. Said to be milpotent, something that was introduced by Kalos and collaborators. And this essentially will allow us to simply get rid of the scalars that we don't want. So in other words, at the end of the day, we can have an effective two-field model, two real-field model, and this is going to eliminate the other two scalars that we don't want. So this can be done either by imposing this constraint on one of the superfields. On one of the superfields, or simply by writing a Kerr potential where you can set parameters such that the mass of these fields that are not going to be the inflaton are sufficiently heavy. But we will use this. So we wanted to consider this large class of models which can have a symmetry along S, but you on also S is nil potent, but also there's a shift symmetry. But also, there's a shift symmetry in the complex scalar that's going to be the inflaton superfield or field, complex field. And then the care potential can have an arbitrary form as a function of these combinations. Then, if you consider because s square is supposed to be zero, ah, yes, yes, yes. No, this is, yeah, no, indeed, indeed. So, this is. Indeed. So this is the case if you have, for example, when you don't want to do this for whatever reason. Yeah, I was a bit general on what the very first papers I did. So if you don't impose this condition, then you can assume this and then give sufficient, write a kernel potential for S such that it is indeed. But indeed, if you impose this, then you can just forget about this. Very good. Very good, yeah. So you just you just yeah, you just have SS bar. Yeah, thanks, yeah, that's um good clarification. And then the superpotential is just s times any function you want of phi, which is going to be our complex input. So, if for this class of models, the scalar potential has a very simple form, which is this one and And then you can see that it thinks about simpler to do. So we look at this kind of situation and we wanted to use the knowledge that we learned from this attractor in the field theory case to actually try to understand, first of all, why of all of the models that we explored in the literature, none of them seem Literature, none of them seem to allow for non-jodestic trajectories. And what we did was to find out that in this, at least in this class of models, we can write down epsilon t. Remember, this is the one that has to be small. We can write epsilon t as well as omega over h purely in terms of f, this arbitrary function, the superpotential. And derivatives of the Keller potential. In particular, omega rh can be written in terms of epsilon itself, which has to be small. But there's this combination of the derivatives of the killer potential, in particular a third derivative here. So it's from these expressions, it's clear that what you can do is to Can do is to fine-tune your F if you want, fine to choose F such that you have slow roll, and next, you need to make sure that what you have to tune if you wish your killer potential in order to increase omega range. So, we did this test for a very simple model. Oops, and so here. Sorry. I don't know what was the question. I think. Can you repeat the question, Jomasmu? Sorry, it was my mistake. I didn't want to ask anything. Sorry. Okay, okay. So, so, right, so. So, so, right, so we use this knowledge and then we say, okay, let's test our claim. So, we use, we wrote a non-scale inspired model. I will tell you in a moment why it is inspired. So, we wrote this scalar potential, which is perfectly fine. You have seen it probably many times, and a very simple F, a superpotential of this one. So the scale. So, the scalar potential takes this very simple form. And what we can see is that omega over h indeed depends on epsilon t, so there's nothing you can do. This is going to be small. So, you can see that the only thing freedom you have is alpha, as I was saying. You only can you can tune F to inflate, but then you need to tune a K in order to achieve. In order to achieve or reach this attractive, now notice for this model, the curvature of the scalar manifold is negative. And well, then you see what you have to do. So you need u1 is large, you need alpha to be very small, as small as we wish. So at this point, we're not wondering whether this is coming from a particular scenario or anything. Scenario or anything, let's just make it have or reach this large omega-rich attractor and we manage. We manage by increasing alpha, sorry, decreasing alpha, increasing R. So, here I'm just showing omega over h. So, for all of these values of alpha, we manage to inflate. That's not a problem. That depends mostly on this. Mostly on this. We also explore other functions and nothing changes really. But the point is that crucially, having a nominal h which is bigger than one does depend indeed on alpha, as we inferred before. So here I just show how much you can increase omega over H if you decrease alpha. Whether this alphas is Alphas, these alphas can be achieved in a model theoretically sound is a different question. So, how about the masses? Well, they are fat antachionic. So, here I'm showing the example with alpha 10 to minus 2. And in this case, well, we see that indeed the We see that indeed the masses are large and tachyonic. So, for these alphas, alpha 10 to minus 2, and for all the other smaller ones, the swampland is the Citer conjecture is satisfied because the second condition is satisfied. Now, what we call the ECNO model, which is this model, this is the only model where we were just looking at supergravity models. This is the only model that we found that by itself as presented in this. By itself, as presented in this paper, has these funny trajectories. And but we understood why. And so we introduced also this alpha to continue checking our what I was saying about tuning the Keller potential. So the model they introduced had alpha equals one, this particular superpotential, and this is the scalar potential. This is the scalar potential. So, we already know the recipe for this class of models. We just need to. So, this we know that inflates already, we don't have to do anything. But if we want to increase omega over h, we just need to change c and alpha accordingly, right? So, remember, omega over h depends on the third derivatives of k. So, this is just a form of the potential. One thing I would like to notice here, so here the curvature is a complicated function of all this, so I'm not going to write it down, but it's enough to say that it has this funny form. Now, here is not visible, but it's positive here, and then it goes to the negative value at infinity. The negative value at infinity. This is plotted for these concrete values. And here I'm showing the EGMA model itself with the parameters they took. So they took c equals 10 to the 3, alpha was 1, as I was saying. And well, these are the trajectories of the fields. And omega over h is of order 1.3, something like that. So bigger than one indeed. So here again, Indeed, so here again, I want to stress that contrary to some beliefs, you can have large omega subarage with a positive curvature for the field space. So during inflation, which by the way occurs along a very restricted region in R, the curvature of the field space is possible. Now the eigenvalue, the minimalization The eigenvalue, the minimal eigenvalue here is I don't plot it because it was not Mathematica wasn't doing a great job, but our collaborators did. And what we know is that the masses, the minimal eigenvalue is large and ichionic, so we take the conjecture. Now, following again our procedure, our recipe, we can Recipe, we can change C and alpha. So, this is equivalent to changing the kernel potential to change omega over h. So, for example, here I'm showing omega over h. You can inflate, no problem. Again, the masses are the eigenvalues, the lightest is bigger than h. And in this case, you can increase omega over h by decreasing alpha and increasing c. And increasing C. At the same time, you can see that if you decrease C and increase alpha, then omega H is going to go down. So we now understand why in all of the models we were looking at, we were not finding that they had omega. So we have a recipe to understand this, whether these numbers are theoretically sound or not. Theoretically sound or not, it's a different question. So I have five minutes, so hopefully, I'll just answer Shanta's question. So here I just want to discuss an example in de-brain inflation of fat inflation. So one example where you can have this attractor precisely with heavy fields, but this model actually. This model actually allows also for light inflation. So you can have either depending on where in the parameter space you move. And I will show also the story of the non-functionalities. So I'll go relatively quickly here. So the idea is very much what we used to do, let's say, in the old times. We have a prof, in this case, prof-defy brain. Case probe DeFi brain moving along the radial and the angular direction, only two directions, in a work resolve conifant. So, DeFi brains were used already long ago in 2007. And in particular, in this paper, we took essentially the same model that was considered here. They didn't explore much. The idea was to rather understand whether a potential like natural inflation. Like natural inflation-looking potential was possible or not. So we took that and we said, Well, let's see what happens if we allow the brain to go moving in these two directions. What are the new trajectories? And can we have anything that looks similar to this new attractive new fat inflation? So, okay, so this is just the data: what we use. Just the data. What we used as a background metric is the 10-dimensional metric, is as I said, this world resolve metric, CONIFOL. And we, well, we just took the potential. The potential was computed in Kenton Atomas, which was computed using following all the work, all the previous work on debrain inflation, where there was contribution that comes essentially from the fact that. That comes essentially from the fact that these two actions don't cancel each other, plus corrections due to the fact that you are cutting the throat at some point. Now, parameter-wise, what do we need or what is needed here, which parameters we have free? So there's one, there's three parameters we use. So one is the number of D3 brains that source the geometry, N, and then we also use the wrapping number. And then we also use the wrapping numbers, which by the way was also used originally in this Baker defiberry model, wrapping number. But we also use, or what Kenton and Thomas tried to use, was this charge some flux on the brain itself, Q. So as parameters, there's phi, there's Q, and some and N. And then, of course, there are some other constants that arise. Are some other constants that arise in the potential? So, since I have little time, so I have all the terms that arise. The punchline is that you have an action with a field space metric that actually has a negative curvature, okay, it's some function, and a potential that depends on r and theta. But the punchline at the end of the day is that the metric depends only on r. Of the day is that the metric depends only on R, on the radial light direction, while the potential can be written down in this way on the end of the day. And in a plot, it looks very nice and simple. So we wanted to take into account all the constraints that will arise due to the fact that precisely we need a certain hierarchy of scales in order to realize either light inflation Either light inflation or fat inflation, and that's making trying to making sure that everything is consistent. And again, so another issue here to take into account is the back reaction of a DeFi brain, a probe-defy brain that is moving. This was considered in these two papers before, so we just sort of follow it. And for every choice of parameter, we just made sure that we were satisfied. Made sure that we were satisfying these constraints. So let me just show you the punchline because I'm almost at the end. The punchline, as I was saying, we can fix n as we do and q. We also choose a number for this u, which is telling us the length of the throat and these three other parameters, which sorry. Which these three parameters actually set fixed such that the amplitude of the LC perturbation matches the CM. And we choose the parameters also such that these scales were consistent. So let me just show you the final results. Okay, so there's one thing which is that. So, there's one thing which is that here, because there is a kind of instantaneous decay constant that you can define in this way. And we choose P. The P, remember, is a wrapping number. Different values of P is going to give us this instantaneous decay constants of this order, and we expect to have a natural inflation-like model. Model. Indeed, that is the case. So, the point that I want to make here is that this is a fat inflation model where lambda h is over 10, is square. Inflation happens, no problem. And here is where we see that indeed this is a model with omega over h is bigger than not super big, but it's of order 10. This is a particular model for this. Model for this decay constant. And what we see more interestingly is that the predictions for the NSNR differ slightly from what will be the light field inflation. In fact, as I was saying, oh, here is the Navajentis for Shanta. So, one thing. So one question we ask is whether we can distinguish this kind of inflation from omega over H or light inflation models. And the only way the way, so in order to do this, we computed the non-Gaussianity, which is bigger than, well, I'm computing it here and showing it here. So it's a further one, but still. Further one, but still, I think it's still consistent. It was still consistent. And what I want to say is that there is also light inflation. So let me just go to the point where I show the two cases. So within the same model, depending on the choices you make for the wrapping number, this gives you a fat natural inflation for a wrapping number for the one. And instead, if you choose the wrapping number much bigger, which I would say is slightly less appealing, then you have a light inflation model with predictions that are exactly the same as a single field natural inflation model. And the other parameter that changes here is Q is the flux charge on the brain. Charge on the brain. So it's much bigger here, and here is just one. So this model seems much more appealing from this point of view. And just to answer Shanta's question, when we compute the non-gaussiantis for this light inflation model, they are much bigger and in fact are out of what they should be according to observations. Okay, so I'm just So I'm just going to finish here by well, maybe just leaving the final comments here and then if people want, there can be questions or discussion. So I'll finish here. Okay, thank you everyone. Thank you, everyone, for a very nice talk. So, are there any questions? I have a question? Wait, Fran. Yes. So, it's interesting. Yes, I have not appreciated these developments in the past. So, I was wondering, so which conditions you may have to satisfy? Because not every single To satisfy because not every single combination of multi-field inflation would work. Because I was thinking, I remember that there's this paper, probably you remember the Kaufman and so they were talking, they were following all the ZLS, all the trajectories, and so on, starting from Starting from Kerry model inflation and using the action partner. Did you consider that model, or did they miss something? No, no, no, no, because that will enter the supergravity example. And as we showed, you need to tune the Keller potential, but for the roulette, you just have the Keller, let's say Keller inflation, Keller potential. No, so there's no parameter you can tune. So I'll tell you how you could, right? So basically, you will have something like this with a one. Yeah, well, with the volume and the volumes, etc. So the problem is that for that roulette is just the Keller standard Keller potential that you get in your Keller inflation model. Keller inflation model. And there's nothing, there's nothing here. So, suppose you put a parameter in the Keller and make it very small such that the curvature is very negative, you may increase. But that's the problem. That is a problem in supergravity, if you want. Funnily enough, if you do that, if you say tune this guy to be small, which you may say how, well, you will satisfy this swampland. Will satisfy this swamp land disease. Right, but yes, that's the paradigm. First of all this model, I would say, even though it looks similar to a string, I can see the two things. Alpha being very small is very rare. I don't see how. But also the 5 plus 5 bar to the 4 is also very unnatural because this is supposed to be valid for large phi. For large phi, and the phi plus phi bar is the leading order. So, any corrections you want to find is to be suppressed, not increased. Yeah, so he is Ellie. So, these guys, they have an old, much older paper where they motivate this, but it's like really much older. And also, they choose C for this, their model itself. They choose C for the 10 to the 3, which I also don't. Three, which I also don't. Yes, that's too much. I couldn't, yes, I couldn't see at all this. I mean, I will say, I will bet anything that this model will be in the swamp land, even though I'm not a big fan. Even if it satisfies the swamp land constraint. Yes. But I mean, I think there is this issue. As you know very well, I mean, tuning the super potential is a technical fine-tuning. I mean, I could not put a different. Tuning, I mean, up to no perturbative correction. But if you tune the Kela potential, this is unstable under perturbative corrections. So, how can you preserve any particular part? I mean, this may not apply just to this model, but I think all this whole class of models that you're discussing, I mean, how it seemed to me that you choose particular forms for the calipotential. In the case of, for instance, fiber inflation, one can argue that these That is stable under perturbative corrections. Can you make the same arguments for this class of models that you have discussed? So, I mean, this one and also when you put the SS bar in class, I mean, if alpha is one, I have no problem, but no, I agree. So, we were just trying to see how you make get to this new attractor. And the only way seems to be if you constrain, if you are restrained. You constrain if you are restricted, no, as you are saying, and the only way we found is tune alpha. Whether it's clearly, we were not saying this is realistic, it's just this is how you can do it, but then you are completely, yeah, I mean, I agree with you. Funnily, for me, funny is that it satisfies this. And by the way, the other thing in the supergravity seems to be that. That okay, suppose you find two, you do this, which already you are saying is not even consistent, fine. But when you do it, and nominal over H happens to be bigger than one, the mass is tachyonic, so you always seem to be satisfying this constraint. I don't know what that means, but I just say. But I agree, I agree. This class with alpha less than one-third. Than one-third, I yeah, I don't know why you should do that. I agree, and even as I'm saying, just the EGNO model itself, I already, I mean, any other questions, comments?
