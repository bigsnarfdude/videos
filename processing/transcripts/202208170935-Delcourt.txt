Postal at the University of Waterloo. So, I'd like to begin with a sort of general question. So, in general, when can we find a matching in a hypergraph that avoids certain forbidden submatchings? And here, by a matching, I mean a large one, a perfect matching, or an almost perfect matching. This is a very general question. Question. To this end, I will introduce a key definition. So, if we have a hypergraph G, then we will define H as a configuration hypergraph for G as the following hypergraph. So the vertex set of H is going to be the edge set of G, and an edge of H will consist of sets of matchings of G. And we're thinking of these as the forbidden. And we're thinking of these as the forbidden sub-matchings, the ones that we want to avoid. And matching of G is said to be H-avoiding if it doesn't span any edge of H. And just as a review, there's this notion also, right, of a line graph. So it's just the standard definition. So we take our hypergraph G and we are defining the graph. And we are defining the graph L of G, where the vertex set is the edges of G, and the edges are encoding adjacencies. So if two edges share at least a vertex in the original hypergraph, then we'll throw it in as an edge in this line graph. So really, we're kind of interested in finding independent sets and large independent sets. sets and large independent sets in LOG union H in this language. So we're going to think about matchings or independent sets in line graphs and configuration hypergraphs. So a more ambitious question is can we find not only one, but perhaps something a bit stronger? Could we almost decompose the edge set? Almost decompose the edge set into a number of age-avoiding matchings that are large. So, this might seem a bit ambitious, but here instead of thinking about the independence number, then we would be interested in the chromatic number. So, the two questions that sort of want to reiterate are what general conditions What general conditions would the line graph union, this configuration hypergraph, have independent number, independence number around the minimum of the independence numbers of the original line graph and configuration hypergraph, and vice versa. What about for the chromatic number? So these are. So, these are very general questions, very natural questions. And I'll state our main result that implies a lot of things just to make sure that we're on the same page of notation. Let's just define a couple things quickly, and then I'll get to our main result. So, the notion of codegree in a hypergraph is the usual notion. If you have two vertices, it's the number. Two vertices, it's the number of edges that these vertices jointly extend to. And the girth of a hypergraph is the smallest g for which you actually have a g verge cycle. And I'm also going to refer to the i degree of a vertex as the number of edges containing that vertex of size precisely y. Okay, so now that we have these concepts, let's state. Concepts. Let's state a main result. So we have our original hypergraph, G, and it has a couple of mild assumptions on it. So we're going to live in the R-uniform world. We're going to have bounded maximum degree, and we are going to have codegree upper bounded by d to the one minus some beta. So we're going to have bounded codegrees. Furthermore, Furthermore, let's have our configuration hypergraph with some restrictions. So, say graph at least five. Each edge containing a bounded number of vertices, say g, and over all the vertices, the i degrees bounded for each i by big O of d to the i minus 1 log d. Well, in this case, we can say something about both. We can say something about both the chromatic number and even the list chromatic number of the union of the line graph and the configuration hypergraph for our original hypergraph G. So this is a bit dense and a bit technical, maybe for first thing in the morning. So maybe let's back up and think about what this is actually saying. About what this is actually saying. So let's think about two simpler cases. And then maybe I'll explain a lot of interesting results that actually follow as corollaries from this very general result. Okay, so we have this hypergraph G, we have this configuration hypergraph H. So let's think about two simple cases. Namely, let's think for a moment. What if H actually had no edges? What if we are not forbidding anything? Well, then morally, it is very similar to Pippinger's theorem, Pippinger-Spencer. We have a bit different code degree assumptions. However, instead of thinking about obtaining large matchings, you could be Obtaining large matchings, you could be thinking about the chromatic number of the line graph. So our statement implies something a little different, but morally it's very similar to a Pippinger-Spencer type result, which of course was generalizing Rodel's nibble from designs. And I mentioned that we also end up showing that the list formatic number is bounded. Is bounded. And that is related to a very important result of Jeff Kahn when he was looking at the list coloring conjecture and proving it asymptotically. So these in spirit are very, very similar if we're thinking about H just having no edges. Conversely, what if Conversely, what if our line graph has no edges? So, what's the situation there? So, if our line graph has no edges, well, we said that we were encoding adjacencies. I mean, fundamentally, that means that we don't have edges in our original hypergraph that were overlapping. So, we're dealing with a matching fundamentally. And then in this case, And then in this case, we get, we imply the canonical theorem of Ai Tai, Kamanosh, and Spencer Sammoretti. And we get a bit more as well. So originally, they're dealing with R uniform hypergraphs, Gerf at least five, bounded maximum degree, and they get an isolo or bound on the independence number of the hypergerph. Independence number of the hypergraph. So there are a number of follow-up results, and our main proof gives these as well, a new proof of these. So Duke Leff and Rodel showed this with Gerf at least three. Three is move by. Have the corresponding thing for coloring. Coloring with bounded codegree. Cooper move by. Degree Cooper Mubai did, and quite recently, Lena Li and Luke Peistel instead of dealing with our uniform hypergraphs, do it for mixed uniformity hypergraphs. And we actually get all of these results as corollaries from our main theorem. So there's sort of these two different streams, both originating from the 80s and traditional. The 80s and traditionally, they've sort of maybe been thought of a bit independently, but we are simultaneously sort of proving both at the same time. So there was a really lovely survey paper on the noble, the rotal nibble method, and there was this nice quote: these two threads of research, edge coloring and vertex coloring, but the nibble method. And vertex coloring with the nibble method have developed somewhat in parallel, but sometimes intertwining. So I really like that quote, and I think it's nice that we are able to sort of simultaneously prove a number of really, really interesting results. And time permitting, I'll get to some of our applications as well. So I just wanted to touch on some of our key On some of our key ideas, I should mention that all the details are available. We have a preprint on archive of all of the details. So you also can go and look there. But we are doing, because of the way we're defining H, it very well could have mixed uniformities. So we have to be a bit careful and we end up introducing this. We end up introducing this notion of a weighted degree to sort of handle that. It's a bit technical. And we're sort of our fundamental, our proof fundamentally is this iterated procedure. We're doing nibble sort of on G and nibble on H, and it just works perfectly together. It's a bit surprising that it does work, but they sort of work together. They sort of work together. And I should also mention because this might be of independent interest, and we have a nice little appendix on it where you introduce a version of Tallagrant's inequality, a linear version of Tallagrant's inequality, instead of using more of the Friedman inequality stuff that a lot of other papers do in the area. And then finish with the Loivas look. Finish with the Loavas local lemma. So, I wanted to mention a couple of applications, time permitting. And the first one is really the one that we were looking at first, the one that sort of this work arose from. So, we were thinking about Steiner systems. So, I'm sure this is a review to many of you in the audience, but I thought. Many of you in the audience, but I thought I'd just go through it quickly. So, a partial NQR Steiner system is a collection of Q element subsets of some ground set with N elements where every R element subset of the ground set lives in at most one of these sets. And a full NQR Steiner system is a partial system where we have. where we have n choose r over q choose r q element subsets in our collection, meaning that every r element subset of the ground set lives in one and exactly one q element subset. So just a quick example, this the fano plank is an example of a 732 Steiner system. So every line with with three points. Every two vertices of the ground set live in exactly one line with these three points. And there's this really famous conjecture in design theory, the existence conjecture. So for n sufficiently large, we can find an NQR Steiner system whenever the necessary divisibility Necessary divisibility conditions hold when it is admissible. And there's been a lot of work on this conjecture. So namely, the approximate version was where the nimble method arose first. And then solving the full conjecture, there's even a purely combinatorial proof of the full conjecture now. So I'm sure this is not news to. I'm sure this is not news to anyone in the audience, but now that the existence conjecture is settled and settled in several different ways, what's next? Well, let's think a bit about the structure of these systems. So, in a partial NQR Steiner system, we have what we call a JI configuration. So, that's going to be a set of IQ elements. Set of IQ element subsets that span at most J elements. So Erdős and others observed that in N32 Steiner systems, you will have an I plus 3i configuration for every fixed i that makes sense. So this is sometimes called triple systems when q is equal to 3 and r is equal to 2. So for triple systems, To two. So for triple systems, we know about I plus three i configurations, but you could ask, what about i plus two i configurations? And Erdős said, well, this is just the question. So he conjectured in the 70s that for every integer g for n sufficiently large, there should be a Steiner triple system. Steiner triple system with no I plus 2i configuration for I all the way up to G. A bit of a mouthful. Maybe let's phrase it in a slightly different way. So we have now this notion of Gerf for a Steiner triple system, namely it's the smallest G where we have a G plus 2G configuration. 2G configuration. So, in this language, what he's actually saying is for n sufficiently large, we would like to be able to find a Steiner triple system with arbitrarily high gerf in this sense when n is admissible. So, this is a really, really lovely conjecture. It's stronger than the existence conjecture, would imply the existence conjecture for triple. Existence conjecture for triples, anyway, right? And of course, there's been some recent progress. So, in particular, I wanted to mention Bowman and Warrenke and Glock, Kunbo, and Hostas independently show an approximate version for triples using a random greedy process. And very recently, in January, announced on archive. Mary announced on archive was a really, really lovely, dense paper by Kwan, Saw, Swani, and Simkin, proving in full the conjecture for triples. And it's really a tour de force, and it was really what got us to start thinking about this whole area of high girth combinatorics and high girth designs. So, well, what's next if this is settled? Next, if this is settled? Well, the obvious question is: well, what about generalizing the existence conjecture using NQR Steiner systems in general? So the analogous result, the analogous observation holds for NQR systems. If you fiddle with the numbers a bit, instead of I plus 3i configurations, here's the correct numbers. The correct numbers, which leads to the correct notion of Gerf. So in an QR Steiner system, Gerf is the smallest G for which it has a G times Q minus R plus R G configuration. So we can ask the analogous question. And actually, Glock Kumlo and Austis did. And this was reiterated by Kivash and Long that for n sufficiently large, For and sufficiently large, can we find center systems with arbitrarily high girth? So, well, we show the approximate version. So, namely that you can find partial ones of size at least one minus n to the minus beta and choose r over q choose r that have no configuration. No configurations between with I between 2 and G. So I do want to say a couple words I should mention independently. Just after our result, Glock, Kuhn, Kim, a different Kuhn, and Leisha proved the same result. And both of us have a polynomial error term here, which would Which would be what you would need if you wanted to hope to be able to prove the conjecture in full, prove the exact version. So I should say a couple words about their proof. So their proof also is doing some sort of random greedy process, where ours is doing a nibble process. So in some senses, ours is a different take, a different direction on. Direction on the results of Bowman and Warrenke and the other group. Also, they did theirs in the language I mentioned before. Their result is about independent sets, whereas we do the coloring version and even the list coloring version. So we do get some results, especially for rainbow matchings and sparse graphs and things that they do not. So I'll sort of So I'll sort of show some of those results a bit later. But for Steiner systems, we do morally prove the same thing. So, well, if you're familiar with Steiner systems, it's clear sort of the relationship of matchings. And if you're not, maybe I'll just take a minute to show this really lovely construction. So this is the original sort of The original sort of construction auxiliary hypergraph. So for your vertex set, we're going to take all our element subsets of the ground set. And for each q set, we are going to throw in an edge. Namely, we are going to take all our element subsets that lie inside of that q set. And in this language, And in this language, now it becomes more clear why we care about matchings or perfect matchings or almost perfect matchings. Large matchings correspond to large partial Steiner systems in this language. And we have a uniform graph. It's not too hard to see that it's regular with bounded codegree. The real question is: well, how does this help us or what to configure it? This help us, or what do configurate forbidden, what are forbidden configurations, forbidden submatch names in this language? If we want to, instead of looking at steiner systems, look at high girth ones. Well, let's think about this for a moment. So a vertex in H is an edge in G and a cube set of the ground. Q set of the ground set. And so, for instance, we can check about how many edges of size exactly it lives in. Well, we know which ones were forbidding, so we can count that. And we can check the other sort of conditions that we need to apply our main technical theorem. And so. And so basically, at the end of the day, we get that L of G union H has a chromatic number equal to one plus little over one times D. And so actually our theorem, because we're doing it for coloring and not just independent sets, gives something kind of fun. Not only do we have one approximate high group-Steiner system, we have a D. System, we have a decomposition into them, which is kind of fun. So I wanted to double check time, I wanted to mention a little bit more. So these are also sort of results that don't appear in the other group's work. And I sort of saved a treat for the end. So I wasn't sure if we'd make it this far, but this is kind of This far, but this is kind of the magic that allows us to do a lot of the applications, the other applications that we care about. So, I want to talk a bit about matchings in bipartite hypergraphs. So, again, a hypergraph we're going to say is bipartite with parts A and B if every edge contains exactly one vertex from set A. Vertex from set A. And we are going to have this concept of an aperfect matching if we contain every vertex of A, for a matching that contains every vertex of A. So we prove, and to my knowledge, this is the first time something like this has appeared in the literature, but there is a lot of literature out there about bipartite math. There about bipartite matchings and also about rainbow matchings. So we'll get to that in a second. But namely, we're in the round of our uniform or our bounded hypergraphs with bounded codegrees, where we have certain conditions on the degrees of the vertices in these two sets. So A has degree at least one plus D to negative alpha D, and vertices in B. And vertices in B have degree at most D, then we claim that there exists an A-perfect matching. And so this is a surprisingly powerful theorem, and I'll talk a little bit about some of its applications shortly. So we prove this with configuration hypergraph subject to the conditions of our main result to find an A. Of our main result to find an a perfect h avoiding matching. And actually, this bipartite version fundamentally implies our non-bipartite result, which is kind of nice. So G is a hypergraph, and we have a list assignment. And let's look at this auxiliary hypergraph. So for one of our sides, we're going to have We're going to have vertices being edges of G. For one of our parts, we are going to do these kind of color pairs. So for each vertex and each color that appears in, I should say that each color that appears in the edge of the list. Sorry, each color that appears in the list of Color that appears in the list of the edge that that vertex lives in, we are going to form a pair. And then we are going to sort of combine the edge with its color pairs. So we're going to throw in the edge and we're going to throw in these pairs of vertices and color. So for each fixed color, we're going to each fixed color in the list of E. Color in the list of E, we're going to throw in E and we're going to throw in VC as a fair for each of the vertices in this edge. And why are we bothering with this? Well, in this language, aperfect matchings are something that we care about. Namely, we are going to get that they are L colorings of the edge set of G. So, this is actually what we'll need to get our results on rainbow matchings. So, I wanted to just reiterate that a matching is rainbow if every edge is colored differently, and it's full if we use every color on some edge of our matching. So, here's a picture of a full rainbow matching. Full rainbow matching, for instance. And so, a typical example: if we have a bipartite graph here that is properly edge colored with Q colors, where every color appears at least Q plus one times, then we have a full rainbow matching. But for non-bipartite graphs, we could ask a similar thing, but instead Q colors, but each color appears at least Q plus. But each color appears at least ke plus two times, then we would like a full rainbow matching. So these are two examples of typical conjectures about rainbow matchings. And these are pretty difficult, pretty hard. So we want to weaken them in various ways. And there are at least three sort of obvious ways to weaken them. We could demand a slightly smaller rainbow matching. Rainbow matching. So we call this the weak asymptotic. We could assume that the colors could appear more times. We call this the strong asymptotic. Or we could use slightly more colors. And fundamentally, there's sort of two different settings. There's what I'm going to call the dense setting and what I'm going to call the sparse setting. And dense is where the number of colors and the desired size of random matching. Desired size random matching are on order of number of times a color appears, whereas the sparse setting is going to be, the number can be much larger than the number of times a color appears. And the number of times a color appears is related to the degree of the graph. So just to give you a concrete example, we can rewrite the previous conjectures in sort of this sparse setting. Here with delta plus one times, here we. Delta plus one times, hero delta plus two times. So see that I'm almost out of time. So I just wanted to mention fundamentally there's this equivalence between aperfect matchings in bipartite hypergraphs and raindro matchings in hypergraphs. So maybe I'll just show you the auxiliary hypergraph. So we have on one side the set of colors and on one side the set of vertices. And on one side, the set of vertices, and we're essentially extending the edges to include their color. And here, this is our auxiliary hypergraph. It's kind of similar morally to the one that we saw earlier. So we could rewrite our bipartite theorem. We even get something stronger. We have those disjoint rainbow matchings. And I just wanted to mention we can do sparse versions of things like. Can do sparse versions of things like Ausbosch or Grimblot. But let me just leave you here. We sort of have these two different classical results from the 80s, and really we can see them morally as special cases of one larger theorem. And any sort of setting where you could do an approximate decomposition using a nibble type. Composition using a nibble-type technique, you could hope to do these high-girth versions, this sort of high-girth paradigm. So, in our paper, these are sort of four of the things that we explore, but I'm sure there are many others out there. Thank you for your attention. Thank you, Michelle. Are there any questions for us here? Are there any questions for our speaker? You might have to go there. Let me try. So, we had trouble, Michelle, with the questions earlier. So, I'll try. Can you hear me? Yes, hi. Hi. So, can you just say a little bit about this version of Talibrant's inequality that you're using? Could I say a little bit about the version of Talibrant's inequality? You mentioned at the beginning that there's some. Yeah, so we have a instead of using like our Friedman type inequality morally, which is sort of what Bowman and Warnke and the other group do, and even the more recent group, the exact, we introduce and we do a linear Tallagrand's inequalities, like the Lipschitz constant in it is linear. And I should mention that Lena and Luke also use it. Also, use it in their mixed uniformity version for hypergraphs. That's the version that they use as well. And the paper is online, and there's sort of a nice appendix talking about it in great detail. So the main difference is just in the lip chips. Condition. The Lipschitz condition, yes, that's where the name linear is coming from. Well, if not, let's thank our speaker again. And we'll have a 20-minute coffee break and resume at 10:30. Well, thank you very much, Michelle. I'm not sure which way the cameras are facing. Yes, hi. Hi. Yeah, thank you for a wonderful talk. Well, thank you for inviting me. I'm sorry I wasn't able to come in person. To come in person, and that I was traveling on Monday, so I unfortunately missed a few of the talks. But I've enjoyed the conference so far. Oh, great! Well, hopefully, next time in person. Yes, definitely. Definitely. Thank you very much for the talk, Michelle. Thank you, Drew. Thank you again for inviting me. Razor is almost so I like it very much, as you said. So I'm sure. So I'm not sure.  I will go through this both action first. Achieving power over here. I guess so I have to make sure that it's matching this one. Point is matching here. Right, but I mean you have all the pairs here, right? Oh, yeah, right, with these votes, yeah. Why are the bears involved in? I mean, I think bears might be able to hear, I'm not sure. So we've got a disk bottle, maybe this bottom other matching.
