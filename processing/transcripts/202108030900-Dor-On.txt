I'm sorry. Oh, I'm being recorded. Okay, that's good to know. I agree to this. So, first of all, let me share with everybody the link to the Jamboard so that you can enter and flip through the pages if need be. Yeah, so this is the first time that I'm doing something like this, giving a talk on something that I Giving a talk on something that I am completely sort of not an expert on, let's say. So yes, so this is this paper of Juri, Martin, and Shamovich on this Blashki singular outer factorization. So to motivate the result, let me first tell you about First, tell you about the classical situation. Okay, so there is a theorem of Herglotz and Rees that says the following. So if I have a function on the Hardy algebra of the unit disk, then Disk, then there's a factorization. You can write H as B times S times F, where B is a Blaschke product. This is what I call inner B. Is what I call inner D 2 S is pointwise non-zero on the unit circle almost everywhere. This is inner S. And finally, you have this sort of strange form. This sort of strange form of f, you can write it as alpha times the exponent of one over two pi integral from zero to two pi of EIT plus z over EIT minus z k eit d t this is for z in the unit disk and And k real valued integrable and alpha a scalar of modulus one. Okay, so this is sort of a classical result. And there are operator theoretic interpretations of these properties. Okay, considered as considering H infinity as Considering H infinity as an operator algebra acting on H2 of the disk. Okay, um, actually, I'd like to say a little more. In fact, zeros of H coincide with zeros of B with With including multiplicities, right? And this is important. So, you know, you sort of take out all the information on the zero set of these holomorphic functions into the factor that is the b, and the rest is somehow sort of zero. So here are some operator theoretic. So, here are some operator theoretic interpretations of these properties. So, if you do one or two, that sort of happens if the Blaschki part is just constant. This happens if and only if M of H is an isometry. Okay, and Okay, and property three, which you would say the Blaschki part and the singular part are constant, this happens if and only if mH has dense range. Okay, and so what Juri Martin and Shamovich tried to do, they tried. Tried to do. They tried to come up with such a factorization for NC holomorphic functions on the NC unit ball. Okay, so, but I'm not really done yet because, you know, I still need to tell you what it means for something to be a Blashki factor in sort of an operator theoretic way. Right? Way right, so I need to sort of think of this as something to do with maybe subspaces, right? So, what is one or two in this case? So, for H, H infinity of D, we define the singularity space of H. It's those functions in H2D. H2D such that they are divisible by H. This is still holomorphic in D. Okay, and then you have one, again, if and only if the singular and the sort of outer portion are constant, if and only if the singularity space is actually H. space is actually h times h2 plus m of h being isometry inner right so that just means it's an isometry and two happens if and only if again these sort of factors b and f are constant which happens if and only if s of h is actually the whole space so you sort of get no singularities this is plus m h This is plus and h inner. I shouldn't do it like this. Okay. All right. So this is the classical situation, and we're sort of wondering if we can get something, some kind of non-commutative Blaschke singular outer factorization. And so if you think about If you think about what it means to be inner, that's sort of clear. You know, in an operate algebra, we can sort of say, at least spatially, we can say what it means to be an isometry and what it means to have a dense range for a concrete operator algebra, right? But then we would have to think a little bit what it means to be Blaschki and what it means to be singular in it. Okay, so let me tell you a little bit about NC functions. Okay, so Or and Mike Jury already sort of gave many interesting examples. The first is in the situation of affine NC functions, and the second in the situation of NC polynomials. My NC functions are also going to include. My NC functions are also going to include NC polynomials. But let us first say what the domain of all these functions is going to be. So let b n d this is sort of this graded domain with n nth levels z one up to z d Z D, these are the so-called straight row contractions. Strictly less than one. Okay, and these are the non-commutative points. Okay? And this is sometimes called the NC unit ball. And we think of H2 of Think of H2 of BND as power series, really, in D non-commuting variables with L2 coefficients. So, what does that mean? It means that if I have a function in H2 BND, V and D, we can write this function as follows. So this is F of Z is equal to the sum of alpha in the Free monoid with degenerators of F alpha hat. These are the sort of Fourier coefficients Z alpha where these coefficients are square sum of them. Okay, and these are NC functions in the sense that they respect the grading, they respect similarities when the similarity preserves the domain, and they respect compressions to common invariant subspaces. Okay, so that is the definition of an NC function as far as I understand. Okay, all right, so Alright, so this is sort of the space. So what is the algebra then? The analog of H infinity of the disk. This is the NC Hardy algebra H infinity of B and D is the unit of Bonnock algebraic D. Uh of uniformly bounded NC functions on B and D. Okay, so as far as I understand this restriction to a common, respecting of restrictions to common invariant subspaces, this is something that encodes the N. Encodes the analyticity of an NC holomorphic function. Okay? All right. So, but I know this algebra somehow from a very different context. Well, at least it's different to me. I'm sure that people who have thought about this have also thought about it in terms of NC functions somehow, at least implicitly. So, what is the way that I know about this algebra? So, alternatively, I know about this algebra, so alternatively, if we denote by Lk the left multiplication by the variable Zk then H infinity of B and D is just the The weak operator topology closed subalgebra generated by the identity together with this L1 up to L D. And this is sometimes called the left regular free semi-group algebra, okay, acting on full Fox space. In fact, full Fox space is somehow unitarily equivalent to H2B and D in a way that preserves this copy. Preserves this copy of this algebra. Okay. So these have been studied by Arias and Popescu, Davidson and Pitts, and Popescu, and they came up with this theorem that I already knew about. This is the so-called non-commutative analog of the inner-outer factorization. And this is their theorem. So let So let H be in H infinity with B and D then we can factor, we can write H as theta times F, where theta is an isometry Henceforth inner and B F has dense range and sport outer. Okay, and so this was already known and now we sort of have to make sense of what it means to know Have to make sense of what it means to be a singularity, or what is the right notion of a singularity. And so Mike gave a really nice talk yesterday explaining various notions of singularities for NC polynomials. And one of which, the so-called detailed zeros, is the right one to take here. So let me define. So suppose So suppose H infinity BND is some NC uniformly bounded function, the left variety or the left detailed zero zeros of H is the set saying Is the set sing of H. This is going to be somewhat of an NC set in this sense, but it also includes a level at infinity where sing n H is just Z Y so this is in B N D B and D cross C N such that y star h z is equal to zero. And so whenever you have a singularity, sorry, a variety of such a function, you can define the left singularity space or all these functions that sort of vanish on these points, right? So this is the singularity space. So this is the singularity space or the left singularity space. This is S of H. It's all little H's in H2 of B and D that have the same zeros as H with at least the same multiplicity in. With at least the same multiplicity in the sense, right? So y star little h of z is equal to zero for all zy in sing h. Okay? All right, so what do we already, what can we already say at this point? It's sort of clear that the range of the multiplication operator Of the multiplication operator by h, left multiplication, is a subspace of the singularity space of h. Right? You can sort of write little h as a product, right, of big h times something. So, of course, it's going to remain in that space. And so we sort of want to find a factor of big H for which this is an equality somehow. Somehow. We want to get rid, we want to include all the zeros. This is, I think, what one would try to do if you want to get the sort of Blaschke factor in a non-commutative way. Right, so we say, so this is exactly what you would define as an NC Blasch key. So we say that H is NC. H is NC Lashki, if the range of multiplication, left multiplication by H, is equal to the singularity space of H. And you will say that H is so sorry, here I want to assume something, right? So my H is, if I want to say that they're Blanschki, they always have to be inner, right? So here I'm going to assume. So here I'm going to assume H is inner. Okay? So we say, as I already did, that it's NC Blaschke if the range is equal to the singularity space of H. And I'll say that it is NC singular if the range is sort of everything. Of everything. Okay, so if the range is everything, then you know there are no detailed zeros. Right? But perhaps you would say this is a little too strong. And so later on, they actually show in their paper that this is equivalent to having no detailed zeros. Okay? All right. All right. That's fine. So now the theorem. What is the Blaschki singular outer factorization in this context? So this is their theorem. So for every non-zero H infinity NC function, there is a factorization H is equal to B times S times F where all of these guys Where all of these guys are essentially bounded NC functions such that B is NC Blaschke S is NC singular and F is F is outer. Okay? Moreover, the Blaschki portion maintains the information on the detailed zeros. So moreover, the singularities of H or the variety of H is equal to the variety, the detailed variety maybe of B and the And the above decomposition is unique up to multiplication by unimodular scalars. Okay, so now I want to sort of talk a little bit in a hand-wavy way about some ideas that come into the proof of this result. So, some ideas from the proof. So one for inner theta in H infinity of BND they show, we can write theta not as Blaschke times a singular, but rather Singular, but rather as a blush q row times a singular column. Okay, so but this n can be 1 to infinity with b i Lashki And the singularity is sort of preserved. So the singularity of theta is equal to the singularity of b. Okay, so maybe I should say that they also have this defined or this theorem stated for vector-valued NC functions. Okay, so this also makes sense, even though B is a row now. Okay? And so And so what do you have to show essentially need to show that n is equal to 1. Okay, and that's what they do. They show that n is equal to 1, and it goes through a series of approximations. Okay, and so one of these approximations is another idea of the proof, and this is really the nice thing about And this is really the nice thing about having this point of view of NC functions is that you can rescale the variables. And that's still in there somehow. So now since f in H2 of B and D are NC functions, we may consider f of little r l with little r that is between 0 and 1 and study the behavior of factorizations as r goes to 1 okay Okay? And so one of the key results is actually to show that when f is outer, then these rescaled variables over there, these FRLs, are actually invertible. So it's not like they take the singular outer factorization and just work with the singular part, sorry, the inner outer factorization and work with the inner part. That's not what they do. They actually have in their proofs, they actually have to. They actually have in their proofs, they actually have to consider the outer part. Okay, so it's not just applying the theorems as they are, right? It's more complicated than that somehow. Okay, and so now I'd like to spend some time on discussing when are there even singular inners. Okay, I should also say before I continue that if you restrict to the case where d is equal to one, You restrict to the case where d is equal to one, you obtain this classical result of Herglots and Ries. Okay? This is essentially, it essentially comes down to showing that this detailed variety coincides with the collection of zeros in the one variable situation. Okay? All right, or at least that the singularity spaces do. Okay, so yes. Um yes. So what about singular inners? When are there singular inners? Okay, so already in their first paper together they show that if you somehow have somebody in the non-commutative Somebody in the non-commutative disk algebra. So, if H is in AD, which is the norm-closed algebra generated by I and the tuple L, and it has closed range, then actually its inner factor is Blashki. Uh inner part of H is blashke. Okay. But in fact, you can say a lot more in this situation of NC rational functions. Okay, so I want to say sort of in this particular In this particular context, what it means to be an NC rational function. Okay? So we say that R, an NC function, is sorry, I want to say R in H infinity of B and D is an N C function. I want to. An NC function, I want to say that it is rational. Right, so first of all, it's defined on B and D, right? So I want to say that it's rational if locally, if around any point it can be written. As a formal expression with the variables and plus multiplication, plus minus multiplication and inversion with parentheses. Okay, so maybe I can write z. So maybe I can write Z1 Z2 minus Z2 inverse Z1 inverse. That's a formal expression. And sometimes it's well defined and sometimes it's not. And I want there to be a formal expression around every point. Okay, that's well defined. And so then I will call it. And of course, because the function is sort of defined everywhere, these possibly different... These possibly different formal expressions will give me the same value because the function is well defined. Okay? And so that's my rational functions here. And Mike mentioned yesterday this realization theory for NC rational functions. And what you can do, you can actually write every such NC rational function in H infinity. function in H infinity as something that has to do with linear pencils. Okay? So realization theory gives us a linear pencil L of A of Z given by I given by I minus the sum of AI tensor ZI where A is some tuple A1 up to AD and B and C are some vectors such that this rational function is B star L A Z inverse C. This is for any This is for any Z in B and D. Okay? And already Mike sort of mentioned to my happiness somehow that if these variables are somehow, if the point is somehow jointly nilpotent, then you already know that it's an NC polynomial. Polynomial. So this includes actually all NC polynomials. Okay, so here's their theorem with regards to, again, the non-existence of singular inners in this case. So suppose that you have a rational function like so. Oops. Then the inner part of this rational function is Blaschki. Okay? And so one might ask: are there even any functions with singular iners? Singular inners, and so let me give you an example. So let B be an H infinity of BND, which is a contraction. So, here is something that I understand follows from some results in this book of Nash, Voyash, and Bukovichi. We can take an inverse Cayley transform of this function. H B Z like so and then that actually gives you then H B is locally bounded bounded NC function with real with positive real part right this is for any Z in B and D and so if that happens we can take the exponent of its of its minus right so we can take Take C to be the exponent of minus HB. This is again going to be some NC function. Actually, it sort of comes from something more complicated. It comes from a generator of some C0 semigroup, and you sort of get this parametrized over T, and that's somehow. And that's somehow how you know that you can do this. But this is a contraction. And it turns out that this is a semi-group of contraction. So this in particular, at t equals one, is going to be a contraction. And you get a contraction. Okay, so now if we assume that B is a barrier. Now, if we assume that B is inner, then C is also inner. This is a result from this book of Nashville and Berkovici. But C is clearly singular, right? But. Singular, right? But because it has an inverse, right? Right? All right, so you have some examples of singular inners, and so I. And so I'd like to talk a little bit about some possible questions that sort of arise from the paper itself, as well as one question of my own that I think is interesting. Again, I'm not an expert, so I don't know if this is easy or not, but I think it's interesting. So some questions. So one in the previous example did we get all singular inners? This is something that jury Something that Jury Martin and Shamovich ask in their paper. Another question that they ask: so if you noticed, when I introduced the variety, I sort of tacked on a level at infinity, right? I mean, this is not something that I did, this is something that's just in their paper, right? But they ask. So in the definition. Of variety is the level at infinity really necessary? So, you could do everything in terms of finite levels, right? Without the level at infinity, Can you make this factorization work without having to do the level at infinity? And I think that for polynomials, they can. They can do this. And I think this question might actually be related to some finite dimensional approximation properties for operator algebras. That's a feeling. I mean, not just my own, but that's a feeling. And it would be interesting if that were the case. And another question that's sort of from my own area of comfort. So let me define to you what a free semi-group algebra is. So suppose I have S1 up to SD, a row contraction, sorry, a row isometry, a free. A free semigroup algebra is the analog of H infinity for that particular row isometry. So this is fractor S. This is W T closure of I S1 to S D. Okay? So it can be shown. So if if fracture S is isomorphic to H infinity of B and D, you can show that this isomorphism preserves isometries. Okay? This is something you can show. Preserves. So automatically preserves isometry. Isometries. So, you know, you can ask: do you have a Blaschke inner factorization for these isometries for any free semi-group algebra that's isomorphic to this? Right? So, so this particular such free semi-group algebras are Algebras are sometimes called analytic. Okay, and Davidson, Katsulis, and Pitts, they've studied free semi-group algebras in great generality, and they have a nice structure theorem for them. They are actually of the form two by two block matrix, where the one, one corner is a phoneme algebra, the two, two corner is an analytic free semi-group. An analytic free semi-group algebra, which is the one that has this isomorphism, and the one-two corner is just another sort of one-two corner of some phenomenal. Okay, so the really non-self-adjoint part comes from the two-two corner, which is already kind of analytic, okay, in the sense that it has such an isomorphism to. This h infinity of b and d. Okay, so it's really interesting if you can sort of push or maybe make some kind of an NC function perspective for these more general kind of non-self adjoint operator algebras that are called free semi-group algebras. Okay. Okay, and so I guess I have some more to say, but perhaps it is a good time to stop here. So thank you for your attention. Let's give Adam a round of applause. So we have plenty of time for questions and comments. Comments on this very nice talk. Thank you.
