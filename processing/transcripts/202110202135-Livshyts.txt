Okay, so well, I guess Galena Liefs doesn't need any introduction. She will talk on the dimensional Romikovsky Naqua. Thank you so much, Elena. Thanks, organizers, for this very nice conference. Are you sure there is no echo? If there is an echo, I can remove it. I don't think there is an echo. No, it should be fine. Okay, it's all fine. Okay, I could hear it a little bit, but I guess it's fine. Perfect. Okay, so let me first of all remind you about the usual Bruninkovsky inequality. That says that whenever you have a private section of the city, you can have a very good idea That says that whenever you have some number lambda between zero and one, and you have sets K and L, just one second, I remind you in a second. Okay, now I'm back, and I will remind you about the Brimikowski inequality. Sorry about this. So, if you have a lambda between zero and one, so that's K and L. Between zero and one sets K and L, then the volume of the Minkowski combination of the sets raised to the power one over n can be lower bounded by the convex combination of the volumes. Here this is the debug measure. And yes, K and L arbitrary measurable sets. So for the Minkowski combination, the notation is just a collection of points lambda x plus 1 minus lambda y, where x is in k and y is in L. So this is something that hopefully most of you know. Let me remind. Hopefully, most of you know. Let me remind you also the notion of lock and cave measures. Please tell me if you hear the echo, because I do hear myself on the phone, which is quite frustrating. No, it's fine. It's fine. It is. Can you see my video? Now we can. It was pointing toward the ceiling, but now we can see it. Okay, because I cannot for some reason, but okay. Now, you know what? I'm annoyed with it, actually. What I'm annoyed with it actually, I'm gonna switch it off because it's okay. I'm gonna switch it off. Good, because I mean, I can hear the okay, now everything's fine. So, local cave measures are defined to be the measures that do satisfy the Brun-Minkowski inequality. So, mu on Rn is log concave. If again, for any lambda between zero and one, and for any pair. zero and one and for any pair of let's say measurable sets k rho uh we have mu of lambda k plus one minus lambda rho is bigger than or equal to mu of k to the power lambda times mu of l to the power one minus lambda so um let me make a few comments about that so um first of all note something important that Something important that this Bruminkovsky inequalities that I wrote above here, as many of you I'm sure, know, implies the log concavity. So star implies that the volume lambda k plus one minus lambda L is bigger than or equal to volume of k to the power lambda, volume of L to the power one minus lambda. Right. Um next more the converse implication works as well, right? Thanks to the homogeneity. To the homogeneity of the Lebesgue measure, so because the Lebesgue measure is homogeneous, homogeneity of the Lebesgue measure. So because the Lebesgue measure is homogeneous, you can deduce the one over n concavity from this. I'm going to call it double star property. Via some classical argument. So, in particular, we conclude that the Lebesgue measure is from Lebesgue measure is log concave. Let me recall something that's more general. More general than the Brunkowski theorem, inequality at the theorem of Borel. Later, it was reproved by Prukopa and Landler, and it shows that if mu, let's say, just let's say something simple here. If mu has a density f which is a local cave function. Is a local concave function such that it satisfies pointwise this property, meaning that f is a log concave function, then u is a log concave measure. So this means that there is more examples. So another example, another classical example of Logan Cave measure is the Gaussian measure that is base density. 1 over square root of 2 pi e to the power minus x squared over 2. Okay. Because this function, this density is, of course, log concave. And in principle, there is a very rich theory of the geometry of log-concave measures. There is many, many such examples. However, let me note that. However, let me note that in the absence of homogeneity of Lebesgue measure, we cannot get this deduction that a double star implies star. So the inequality star for local gave measures in general is not expected to hold. However, there was a conjecture. Let me mention the conjecture. Initially, it was brought forward by Garner and Zwavich. Brought forward by Garner and Zwavich. And then, in the general form, in principle, it was formulated in our paper. And the conjecture is if mu is even, meaning that it has even density and And log con k for a rand and k and l are convex and symmetric sets. Then we can have this additive form of the Bruneminkowski inequality. For any lambda between zero and one, we can have mu of lambda k plus one minus. mu of lambda k plus one minus lambda l to the power one over n is bigger than or equal to lambda mu of k to the power one over n plus one minus lambda mu of l to the power one over n. So this is what was conjectured. Let me make a pause here. Actually, I'm sorry, I'm going to have to run away for just five seconds. I'm very sorry about that. I'll be right back. Okay, now I'm back. Okay, now I'm back. Are there any questions about this conjecture? Any questions at all? Let me open Zoom just in case to check that. Okay. I can let you, if there are questions, I can let you know. Yeah, yeah. Sounds good. Sounds good. Okay. So, yeah, this is a conjecture of Garnet and Zwavich. Let me make a few comments about it. Make a few comments about it. First of all, let me note that the power, let me call it rhombus. The power in this rhombus cannot be bigger, cannot be expected to be bigger than one over n. One over n okay, why is that? Well, because otherwise, if we look at the very small sets near the origin, the measure, if it has even density, it becomes almost flat and it becomes almost very close to the back measure. And therefore, if we were to hope that the power is bigger than one or n, we would. That the power is bigger than one over n, we would have to expect the power to be better than one over n in the Lebesgue case. But if we were to be dealing with say homogeneous balls, it cannot be better than one over n. So one over n is the absolute largest power we can hope for in this generality for this inequality. Also, let me point out that we cannot have arbitrary. Sets, even convex. The assumption, even of the assumption of convexity, would not suffice for this conjecture. Indeed, if we consider, let's say, mu to be the Gaussian measure and k to be, let's say, just for very strict example, to be the unit ball, and L to be the unit ball plus, let's say, R. Let's say R E1, where R tends to infinity. In other words, if you consider K to be a fixed ball and L to be a ball that flies away very far, then of course Rhombus would have to fail because the convex combination of K and L, it would also have to be, it would have to fly away as well. Would have to fly away as well. And the measure of a set that's very far from the Gaussian measure of the set that's very far from the origin will tend to zero. So there is no chance. However, let me mention that Gardner's Varich in fact asked if it's possible that the assumption that the sets contain the origin would be sufficient. And Nayar and Koch. Showed that it is not enough to assume that the origin is contained in the sets, even for convex sets. In fact, their example looked roughly like this. It was a pair of corners in the plane, kind of containing the origin, and it failed. Again, Rhombus fails for this particular example. Next result that I want to mention was due to myself, Marci Glietti. Nayaran Zwavich, where among other things we showed that Rhombus would follow the conjecture, so the conjecture would follow if the famous Logbon-Minkowski conjecture of Broadsky, Ludwig, Yank and Jan was proven. If the Borotsky-Lutvakian junk Pruninkovsky conjecture was shown to be true. And as a consequence, and in combination with some of the results of Christa Sargo, Of Christa-Sargo. We conclude, I'm not going to mention stuff about Logo-Vikovsky conjecture, but let me just explain that we can conclude that Rombus is true for unconditional convex sets. I remind you that convex sets. I remind you that convex sets are called unconditional if they are symmetric with respect to every coordinate hyperplane. And also, another thing, rhombus is true when the dimension is two. So on the plane, indeed, rhombus is true for every pair of symmetric conduct sets and every even local concave measure. Okay, let me know. So, so look, if you don't believe that this rhombus should be true somehow, right? Because, you know, why would something like a Gaussian measure, some arbitrary Lokenkev measure, satisfy such a natural editorial inequality? It's tempting to say that that's probably false, and why would say symmetry have to have anything to do with it, right? With it, right? But generally, I think people do believe in this Logber Minkowski conjecture that I'm not talking about in this talk. So, because of this result, we have to believe in this rhombus as well. Okay, that's one evidence to believe in the robust. I will mention another evidence, of course. Let me now mention a result of Kolesnikov and myself. And myself, I will mention a pair of results. Actually, first, we showed that if gamma is Gaussian and K and L are convex and contain the origin, then instead of the rhombus, we have something very similar, we have the inequality with the power one over two n. It was a ball 1 over 2 and so we did not assume symmetry for this and interestingly enough this result falls even for sets containing the origin. I remind you that Nayaran Port showed that it's not enough to assume the containment of the origin for 1 over n power in this inequality, but it turns out for 1 over n. But it turns out for 1 over 2n, it is enough. And one may examine the example of Nairn Koch to see that there is some particular constant. I don't exactly remember pi over something. It's something like, it's something between one half and one that one cannot go above. But yeah, what is the exact constant here? I don't know. Another thing that we showed at that time with Sasha was that for Besasha was that for any μ with low concave measure with density of the form e to the power minus v such that the Hessian of V is bounded from above and below by something of order identity. There exists a power P that depends on K1 and K2. And k2 such that indeed we have this additive inequality. I will, so this is something that we showed at the time. Let me mention also that there was a work with John. With John Kossel, where we showed some more results for the pre-edition, that I again will not go into. And let me finally mention very strong results recently of Eskinasis and Mosquitoes. Who did verify that the rhombus is true for the Gaussian measure? So, indeed, if the measure is Gaussian, then for any parasymmetric convex sets, it's true that one can put the power one over. One can put the power one over n here. And I would like to mention again, and this is not the subject of the talk, but let me mention that in one of the papers that in the papers that I'm not talking about here, in fact, I showed that moreover for any number A between zero and a number of A and A and A. Number A between zero and one, there exists a power p of a such that in the Gaussian case for the Gaussian measure, one can have P of A here and not only is the speech of A is big or recalled. only the sp of a is bigger equal than one over n, but also importantly it tends to plus infinity. So in fact, if the measure of the set scan L is very, very large, if it gets larger and larger and larger, this inequality, this Briminkovsky inequality actually improves. It's interesting to note. Did somebody say something? There is a question. Yes, please. Oh, please. I'm very happy about it. I think the I think the Oliva asked a question. Say, is V even? A K and L? Yes. Where? B, part B. In part B, yes. Thank you so much. We even K and L symmetric. Thank you, Olivia. I'm sorry. Yeah. Yes. Any other questions? Any other questions? Yes, you mentioned early that gamma of K and gamma of L should have measure larger than A, but you didn't write it. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. Thank you. If gamma of K and gamma of L is bigger or equal to A. Thank you so much. Yes. Okay. Thanks. Yeah. Slow me down. Slow me down. Okay. Ah, now it's correctly written. And any other questions? And any other questions? Yeah, let me mention, by the way, that interestingly enough, so in our paper, we started here with the result about containment origin, the power gets actually, I think, worse and worse if you go to if K and L go to infinity. So 1 over 2 is the case at infinity. And interestingly enough, in the schemasis must. And interestingly enough, in Askinasis Mosquito's work, the power can be better at infinity, but up to something like 2 over n, I think. So, actually, it's nice to note that, in fact, it tends to plus infinity. And now let me finally switch to. So, this was, let's say, part one, history. Let's say now let me switch to part two, which I will state the result. Any other questions before I start taking some results? By the way, you can go into Scribble link that I sent in the chat and you can scroll up and you can see everything I wrote before. That way, if you're lost in what is written on the board right now, you don't have to remember the notation. You can always scroll up on the internet. Okay, so in my recent paper, I showed the Paper, I showed the following. I showed that this additive inequality holds actually for all concave measures and for all symmetric convex sets with some power that can be bounded in absolute terms in terms of the dimensions. So for each n, there exists some constant c n bigger than zero, such that for any log conc. Any log concave even measure mu on a rn and for all symmetric convex sets K and L and for any lambda between zero and one one has Specifically, here this constant here is something of order n to the power minus 4, and there is some all small of 1 that. There is some all small of ones that tends to zero and the dimension tends to infinity, which of course comes from the recent result of Chen. So I don't know how to get one over n here for all symmetric one sets and for all local K-1 measures, but at least there is some specific number that does not depend on the measures that we can always put here, that only depends on the dimension. In a slightly worse In a slightly worse, in a worse way than we expect. By the way, I don't know if I commented on it, but basically, this inequality, of course, is stronger if the power at the top there is bigger. Okay, so this is one result that I wanted to mention. Let me mention now in some particular cases, in some particular In some particular cases, one can improve it on the value of the CN. So for instance, let me know. So this was, let's say, theorem A. Let me now say theorem one. If we specifically consider the measure. The measure with the density, appropriately normalized density e to the power minus the p norm divided by p to the raised to the power p where the p norm. Is just this thingy, then one can have this inequality for any symmetric convex sets K and L with a slightly better power with almost with something that's almost of what I want. Of what the one over n of the logarithmic error. So there is one situation when we can have kind of something pretty close to 1 over n. Also, this m to the power minus 4 can be improved in the case the measure is assumed rotation invariant. Let me mention theorem 2. If the mu of x The mu of x is no, if the mu of x, if sorry, if mu is log concave and rotation invariant, then let me just say, let me call this, I don't know. Let me call this, I don't know, double rhombus. Then Cn in this double rhombus can be of order n to the pi minus two, minus or small of one, rather than minus four. And moreover, let me say theorem three perhaps, if. But if um the mu of X is of order C and P e to the power minus X to the power P over P and P is between one and two then see Cn in the rhombus can be almost one over n is of order n to the power minus one minus so small again actually I'm sorry let me if mu in the above theorem I actually also want it to be of this form To be of this form if μ has density e to the power minus x to the power p over p normalized. And here I'm allowed to have p bigger than one. And lastly, let me mention one last result that concerns something that I mentioned earlier. So let me scroll up. I mentioned Let me scroll up. I mentioned that it's possible in the case of the Gaussian measure to have the power of the concave in this inequality to actually tend to infinity when the measure of K and L tends to infinity. So one might wonder if this is a uniquely Gaussian phenomenon or if it's extendable to other measures. Let me actually mention, by the way, that of course If we don't want the sp of a to be bigger than one over n, but we just want to conclude that we can have this inequality with p of a tending to infinity when k and alpha measure a that tends to one, it's automatically follows from Erhard inequality. So basically, I can say that it's like it's a small homework, one can derive this fact from Erhard inequality. So, of course, it's the right behavior for the Gaussian measure. But when we don't have Erhard inequality and we never have a head inequality unless we have. And we never have a head inequality, unless we have a Gaussian measure. It's not very clear if this is still true. So, let me mention, however, that there is a class of measures. So, if mu why are you not writing? Okay, if mu on a RAN has density e to the power minus v, where The power minus v, where v is even, and the Hessian of V is uniformly bounded by something of order identity. We can say it's uniformly strictly local and cave, then let's say CN in the rhombus. Tense two. Then, okay, let me let me let me state it properly. Then, for any A between 0 and 1, for any K and L with mu of K and mu of L bigger than A, we have that mu of lambda K plus one minus lambda L to the power P of A is bigger than lambda mu of k. is bigger than lambda mu of k to the power p of a plus one minus lambda mu of L to the power p of a for some p of a that tends to plus infinity. This is true for any lambda. And so these are the results that I wanted to state. Are there any questions? So far, I guess I'm almost done with my time. So let me just very quickly, very briefly, mention that the proofs are based on the general so-called L2 approach, combined with some estimates for log concave measures. Let me just write a few names for the L2 approach. There's been a group of people working on this. There is some notable works by Kolesnikov and Milman in this regard, particularly the proof of the Brumlinkovsky inequality, whereas the L2 method is very notable. There are some notable works by Polisanti. Well, I mentioned some works of myself in this regard. They also Daniel Hagg. Daniel Hag, Eugenia Sorry and Gomez worked on that. I mentioned some other works in this approach in general. In terms of the estimates for local concave measures, well, it's not possible to give, let me just say there is a long list of names, long, long, long list of names, which is responsible for developing the beautiful theory of local gift measures. There is a very neat A very neat, tiny lemma from a paper of Clartek and Milman that was nicely used somehow that I slightly extended and used in the proof of this theorem. A it's uh it's kind of it's things that are slightly less heavy than the LDO approach in itself, but um it was. It was, yeah. I guess I don't have much time to talk about proofs outside of that. So let me just finish right there. Let me scroll back to the main theorem. Are there any questions? Let me go to Zoom. Hi, Manel. Garina, hi, thank you. Can I ask a question? Definitely. If we have time, just um. We have time. So, you mentioned your old result. I think that if log Bruminkovsky is true, then also the dimensional Bruminkovsky is true. So is it quantitative in a sense? Okay, so we do know that the L P Brumikovsky is true for P slightly smaller than one. Can you translate this into a quantitative estimate? Very good question. Like, like, very good question. So, so, actually, we elaborated on that in our paper with Kolesnikov and Hussel that I also mentioned. Uh, so the chief issue here is the result of Christosaroglo that tells you that if the Logob-Mikovsky conjecture is true for the Debye measure, it's true for any measure, right? You cannot translate that result for any measure with P because. With P because you have so basically use pre-cop. Do you see what I'm saying? Use pre-copa. So you can only translate the multiplicative result from the Lebesgue to any measure. And then it's of no use in order to get, so you can get the editive result, the Bruninkovsky editive result from the editive result of LP. But do you see what I'm saying? You cannot go into that. I kind of see, but still, you would expect to have some kind of continuous interpolation, right? Of continuous interpolation, right? I mean, that one should imply the other. I see what you mean. It doesn't work, but you would expect that it would work. I thought quite a bit about it and I've come to the conclusion that it actually really doesn't. So, I mean, I see what you're saying, but yeah, I mean, I did think quite a bit about it. We did write some remarks on this, I think, with Kresnikov and Khosho. Okay, thanks. Thanks. And I think I chatted with Christos about it at some point, and we've come to the conclusion that it just doesn't really work. Okay, thank you. Thanks for the question. Other questions? We can say maybe a couple of minutes about a couple of words about the proofs. We said you don't have time. Is there some idea that gets Is there some idea that's a general? Yeah, so sure, sure. So let me, I finished early. Indeed, let me just say, okay, so, oop, what am I doing? Okay, here. This is where I should be. This is my board. Okay, let me. So, more on proofs. Of course, there is this idea of Minkowski interpolation that I mentioned quite a bit. Quite a bit, let me just say. So, because I've said it so many times in so many talks, and I'm saying it in one minute, it's not going to be possible to comprehend. Let me just say for experts. So, it's basically we can reduce it to the estimate integral over k, average integral of k. There's a lower estimate of this form. I actually have not thought about it for such an extended period of time that I don't remember how to write it. So, but it's estimated like this, where This is where we need to show that there exists a U on K such that this holds and normal derivative of U is arbitrary, roughly speaking. And N is what? Who is who? A normal vector. A normal vector outer unit normal. No, no, the L L in the integral, it's an L is this. Yeah, okay. So, and the key proposition that we show is that the integral on k of this guy with respect to a measure. A measure is of order. Let me just, I will write other words in a second. Let me just finish it here. Yes, where so this is if K is a symmetric convex set in Rn and U on K is any even function W to let's say W. W to let's say W to two and continuous. Then for any symmetric and convex A inside K, this thing holds. So, and from this proposition, we deduce this part. Okay. Thank you very much, Carlina. I'm sorry, we're a bit down. Very much, Carina. I'm sorry we're a bit out of time, but let's thank you again for the nice talk.
