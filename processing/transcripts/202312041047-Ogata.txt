So, it's my pleasure to introduce our next speaker today. Ishika Agata will tell us about battery states, the bulk gap to ground state and 2D quantum spin systems. Thank you very much. My topic is about penis and And throughout this talk, I will demonstrate on two-dimensional quantum spin system, which is just an infinite tensor product of the matrices and three-dimensional matrix. And on this quantum or two-dimensional quantum state system, I would like to think about jet-ground state. So today I don't give you the definition of jet-ground state. Give you the definition of the actual ground state, but it's a kind of state field that I'm interested in. And for two-dimensional ground state models, the following thing is not. So for two-dimensional jet-ground state models, there are models where particle-like low-energy excitation given by string operator with braiding structure called anion are observed. Any ones are observed, such as it is observed in very nice, exactly sovable models. And it is said, and it is easy to say, that this Nion is an invariant of the classification problem of Japan state fields. So again, I cannot ha I don't have time to tell you what is this classification problem exactly, but there is some classification c problem which we are interested in. We are interested in. And we say that this anion described here is some invariant of this class here. But looking at this description, this is just as a physical intuition based on analysis of exactly solvable models. And it is not mathematically finished. Mathematical definition. But once we start to talk about classification problem, then we have to this this enion. We have to if we start to talk about classification problem and to think that enion as an invariant of this classification, of course this enion things have to be defined everywhere of the object from the phase. Then we encounter some problem that is what is anything. What is any in general Japan state? How can we formulate? And one answer can be super selection sector. So anyone can be formulated in terms of super selection sector. And this talk is about such enions formulated from super selection sectors. So I would like to talk about I would like to talk about formulate Barkenion, Bark means two-dimensional space, Bark Enion as rated schista tensor category derived from supersirection sector and I'd like to talk about undai enion as schista tensor category derived from supersetion sector at the bundle and then I'd like to discuss about dejection with video. So that is the my front the front of my doc. So let me start from this aim. So I write first to specify what I mean by what specter in the bulk in this our study. So throughout my talk, when I say con, it means this kind of area or its complement. Its complement. And here is the definition of superselection sector. So let us take some gap to ground state omega, which we are interested in, and consider that H5 is a GNS representation of that. And here is a definition of a superscription criterion. So a representation law of two-dimensional quantum spin system is set. Condom spin system is said to satisfy superselection criterion for this Japanese with omega if this condition is satisfied. So what we are saying here, take any column of you like, any area of this form, then we restrict this representation row and GNS representation pi to the complement of that. And the requirement is there. Requirement is they are equivalent, unitarily equivalent. And so, this is a persection criterion, mathematical description. Physically, you can regard it as we are trying to put the excitation of this presentation row to this con area. So, sorry, when I write a language, it won't probably. Probably we can regard naturally as some argument at all to the most important system. So, this is the superselection criterion. And this unitary equivalence class of such representations are called supersection sectors. That is, the supersection sector I was talking about. And so, this supersection sector a little bit different combination, but how Different formulation, but it's some of course studied well in algebraic control series from a long, long time ago. But it was Nakins who introduced this supersection sector to control spin system for the study of Tori code model and updated quantum the whole process. So, in this object quantum field theory, as we and the half-GOLD, which is as Georgie, which is a basic assumption of them, it is well known that we can derive ready shister tensor category out of superselectron sector. The question can be, is it the case for our system as well? So our setting, although there is quite a bit of similarity, mathematically to the AQFP. AQFP, mathematically they are different. So asking if this kind of derivation of great shift category holds or not is mathematically non-trivial question. But it turns out to be true, namely following several holes. Under approximate HACO duality, which is some deduction of HACO duality, we can derive radius shister tensor. We can derive radio system tensor categories out of simple sector of junk currents. So the same thing holds. An important thing for me is that it is an invariant of the classification. So if there is one system and one another system, if they are equivalent, there is a model equivalence between these corresponding creativities. So recall that there are this physical intuition. This physical intuitive description of particle electroenergy excitation given by the structure. This property, more or less, we can regard it including to this predicate tensor category and by the definition of super section sector. I don't go to detail, but more or less we can apply it in this way. And from this point of view, And from this point of view, this theorem, we can regard it as under certain conditions, unfortunately, but we can consider it as a mathematical generalization of the following statement that is anyon is an invariant of the classification of the optimum state phases. What do you mean by ultimate habituality? So, the habituality is some property, and I deduct. Property and I did have try to deduct it. Do you want to more precise definition? Like, maybe just say that it's like suppressed by each of the products. So, what you mean is that the commitment of this is called So if we have this is how the derivative is trivial inclusion, but so the question is if this cause or not. But yeah, the approximate hygiene is true if we increase Increase a little bit here, like this, with some unitary agent. This is kind of a relaxation. And the reason why I introduce is that I know this property is stable under perturbation, which is more convincing for us. Okay, so that is to measure theory. And briefly, let me briefly tell you what is the content of this table. This is the category, say something, the object are representation satisfying superfaction sector and more things are intertwined, namely, or the some bounded operator on the H space intertwining this. So, maybe for the time I. So this is Bulgar theory and now I'd like to think move to boundary theory and I'd like to think about boundary states or bulk job constants. So here is a motivation. So there is a that is a famous point conjecture. First conjecture. So Derry handed the conjectured and physically proved the following. First, Berkeley theory is a modular data category and boundary theory is a fusion category. And the exciting conjecture says that for a gap boundary, Bulgar theory should be the dream term center of boundary theory. Having such an exciting Having such an exciting conjecture and having our framework of a superselection sector, we would like to formulate it in terms of superselection sector and to formulate such conjecture, such close structure in terms of superselection sector. And in fact, the student formulated it for Tori Code model. So he did that. Yeah, so he did that for Craig and that Vilistok is trying to ask his idea. So let me specify here. First, I think about boundary, which means I consider upper half plane, which I denoted by HU here, and consider the associated. Consider the associated quantum species. And I'm talking about boundary state of some jumped ground state on two dimensions. And then I want to talk about boundary theory. But then I encounter again some problem. That is, I don't know what is the boundary of this omega. So maybe we can just say. And I agree, maybe we can just put some boundary condition to the hamilina or the two-dimensional system. But boundary condition is usually very subtle to issue and it can change the boundary system drastically. And on the other hand, I have the following feeling. When people talk about boundary state of ecological orders. State of the state or capital state. What they have in mind is the following. When they say boundary state of omega, boundary state of omega are macroscopically the same as the bulk state omega away from the boundary. Here, what I mean by away from the boundary is depicted by this picture. So, here I'm considering the intersection with. The intersection with such core with the upper half frame. Important thing is that this angle here and there are strictly positive. That is the kind of reason why I say away from the boundary. And I have a feeling that when people talk about boundary state, such a state on this upper half-brain condensation system, Boundary of omega. What people have in mind is a state, the situation that these states are macroscopically identical in such region away from the boundary. So I think whatever you define, however you define boundary state of omega, this property should be satisfied. But yeah, so I try to take it as an intuition I have about one face state. But then how we can translate this macroscopically the same part mathematically. Fortunately, in quantum spin systems, there is convenience. Namely, in quantum spin systems, quasar equivalence Huesa equivalence more or less can be interpreted as macroscopic macroscopic equivalence because two states which are quasi-equivalent to each other can be approximated by each other's local perturbations. From this point of view, I try to take this quasar equivalence as a mathematical realization of this. Realization of this feeling of macroscopical design. This intuition and with this interpretation, I would like to suggest the following definition of boundary state. So as here, state omega B D on this upper half plane on our spin system, I say it is a boundary of our electron state. It's the following condition holds, namely. Suppose, namely, if the district of junctup strain and this pure state to such area away from the boundary are quite equipped. So that today I take it as the definition of a boundary state object current state. Okay, so at least this out of this definition of boundary state. Of boundary state. Now I'd like to construct boundary state. So again, I consider a plane. And get omega B is a boundary state I just defined. And this H5 is a GNS representation of this boundary state. So with this preparation, actually we can design. Actually, we can derive various different kinds of systems category out of this kind of state. And in particular, depending on the choice of observer or object and morphisms. And in particular, for morphisms, we can consider the following two different kinds of morphisms. Depending on what kind Depending on what kind of operation you allow yourself to carry out, the first kind of operation is we allow ourselves to use the left boundary and second operation is we allow ourselves to use only the button. More precisely, the first one, allowing ourselves to use the rest boundary, it can be we represent it as this. This algebra B L. Here, what we are doing is the following. We consider all the column which is attached to F infinite line, like this, and consider the polynomial algebra associated generating bypass, and collect all of them and take the normal course. And it turns out this is just. And it turns out this is Sister algebra. And we did Rig RD, this TL are the Sister algebra representing the operation using the left boundary. Similarly, second kind of operation using only the bulk, I regard the shift algebra, FU represented here, the shift algebra representing the operation. Presenting the operation using only the power. So, what we are doing here is the following. Now, I consider this kind of idea, like we just saw before, and consider the polynomial generated by the local observable here, and collect all of them and take an all-code out of this APU, which I regarded. I only got I have regard just algebra representing the operation using only the backlog. So yeah, so what I want to say is that there are two, we can think about two different algebra corresponding to the operation which we allow ourselves. And with this definition, we can introduce some equivalence relation between the presentation as follows. So for the presentation of So for the presentation of two dimensional quantum spin system, we write law equivalent to sigma with d to L here. If the resistor unitary in this system is allowing ourselves to use the left boundary, it's interpreted. Similarly, if uh we write a log equivalent sigma with this u here, if the this is the unit I v from this shift algebra interference. And by definition, this Sister algebra is included by this BL, the first kind of Sister algebra. As a result, this equivalence relation with V to U here is finer than the one with V to L. Now, this is a comment for. I comment for people who know about to boundary. And for rough boundary, we know that E anymore disappears. And in my terminology, it can be described as E being equivalent to the vacuum with respect to this equivalence relation with. Equivalence to relation with v to L here. But this E is not equivalent to vacuum with v to u here. The same thing happened to MN at the smooth power. Out of this observation, we think we definitely try to use P L for the boundary. We want E anyon to decide. We want E anyon to disappear at the rough boundary, so we would like to use this as a morphism, not this one. However, there is a good thing to think about this final one, Fu There is a good point about using this FU, smaller sister algebra. The good thing is, in a word, we can get In a word, we can get a copy of Bulk theory at the boundary. And this copy is this category C written here. So let me describe this category. The object of this category is a representation of a two-dimensional upper half of the system block satisfying this condition. So now what we are doing here is considering We are doing here is considering this kind of area and consider the well we restrict ourselves to the complement of this row area. And the requirement here is that the restriction of rho and pi to such complete area are unitary equivalent with respect to and unitary and unitary equivalent, and this unitary should be taken from you. In physical terminology, the requirement is the excitation of row can be pushed into this blue area using only the bulk. That is our object. And homorphism, as a uh homorphism for this uh category, uh we take it from the operation which allow ourselves to use only the pulp. To use on either bug. So, this is the category C. And it turns out this C is the braided statensa category and it is equivalent to the bow bredage histatensa category. So, as I said in our work, there is a category on bow, there is a copy of bio graded sister tester category at the boundary. But as I said before, that is not what we want. This is not what we want. We want to distinguish ENEO we don't want to ENEON to disappear at the boundary so that this is not what we want. We want. So let us try to think something hybrid. This is that is this category C written here. As an object, we take the same thing as before, as object C. But for monophysics, we allow ourselves to use left boundary as well. Unfortunately, if we do that, we don't get C-star results. We don't get C-star denser category. However, if we take identification completion of it, it becomes S-star denser category. And I would like to decide that this MQDADEM container completion is our boundary theory. Now, I would like, finally, I would like to talk about Finally, I would like to talk about a start from the conjecture. So we consider the intercenter of our boundary theory in tilde, but with some asymptotic constraint. What I mean by asymptotic constraint is we require some additional asymptotic conditions to have breaking. Breaking. So it's an additional condition, but also it is rather natural and it is satisfied by half rating obtained by the standard way. We consider this kind of drain fair center and oh, there is something wrong with that. Oh, okay. Oh, something is wrong. So maybe I got it here. So, here is the main CRM of this talk. And as a non-triviality condition of the operating, this three-fair theta with asymptotic constraint is equivalent to the above related system category. So there is a bit more There's a bit more condition here, but it's kind of a idealization of a Stefan conjecture. And so this is my theorem. So today I talked about Bandai theory that is a far half frame, there is some notable topological order, but under that, the the situation is the the situation is we we have three benefits. But we can do the same thing for different for for domain world. So we can place some things that means some peroxiary, other perox theory and consider the domain world with that by uh almost uh identical uh object, uh which is fortunately obvious. So I stopped here. Thank you very much, Bob. I have questions. So your boundary series is purely determined by is that it's true that uh could you correspondence between the uh the correspondence between the uh voice of the boundary state and the the fusion category. Because for each boundary state we got a fusion category, but we know that there are different fusion categories that there should be a one-to-one correspondence. Well there should be a one-to-one correspondence from the number of one in algebra and the number of algorithms in not now. Yeah, I understand it's old to be, but I don't I right now I don't see yeah. So you have your version of the Greenfield center, but it really different from the That materially different from the standard one for some complete edit up? No, I don't think so. But I don't know so the problem of this thing is we don't have so much examples. But there is a very standard way to construct half-rating in a QFT, right? And if we carry it out, then this is automaticized at this point. I should have another question. So when you s uh start in the bot, the the CR tensor category is automatically identical and complete. Is that right? Yes, yes, yes. But then you define a boundary category, you choose the object in the independent thing, different definition of authism. I wonder what what would make the choice What what what makes the choice of M without doing the uh adamp computer? Uh why is it not identical computing? Ah uh technically uh that it's that I cannot take the sub-object given some projection I cannot construct sub-object corresponding to that. That's the way you formulate it because you The way you formulate it because you offer results. Your basic assumption, which is common in the field, was that the boundary preserves as many symmetries of the bulk as possible. But you wanted to have that the boundary preserves as many symmetries of the bulk as possible. Do you have in your formalism Do you have in your formalism a way to study symmetry breaking by boundaries? That sounds very interesting question, but if it is finite, why I really expect we should be able to do something, but I really didn't touch on that problem, so I would like to think about it, but I have no longer thought. Further questions? Well, I think you should go in.
