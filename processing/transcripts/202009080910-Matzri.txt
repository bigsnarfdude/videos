Do you hear me? Yeah, okay. It's a pleasure. It's a great pleasure to open this Zoom meeting in honor of Andre, whom I met almost about 30 years ago, also over the internet, when my wife was translating this classic book with Platinoff on algebraic groups. And at that time, we were also confined to our home. At that time, we were also confined to our homes, that time because of the Gulf War. And so, this meeting closes a circle of sorts for me. Anyway, I'm delighted to be able to start by introducing Eli Matsri, who's going to speak on polynomials over division algebras, joint work with Gilat. So, should I start? Okay. So, thank you for the organizers for allowing me to give a talk. And especially, happy birthday, Andrei. You're very important for us here, and we love you. Many more years of enjoying your new grandchild. As for the mathematics, I'm going to talk about polynomials over division algebras. This is a work in progress which. This is a work in progress, which is joint with Shiro Gilat. And I would like to start with introducing the main objects. So F is a field. And we know what is F lambda. F lambda, just usual polynomials. polynomials and given a division algebra, if D is a division algebra, we can form in a naive way the regular polynomials, which is d lambda, which is the same as f lambda, only our coefficients are now coming from d. Are now coming from D. Namely, lambda is a central in the term. That's a naive way. Lambda is central. Well, maybe not naive, but usual way. But there is a generalization of that, which is, as far as I understand, was introduced by Orr, maybe Vederburn also, but that's what I remember. And I'm not going to introduce the entire And I'm not going to introduce the entire thing, just a little thing of that. You can do the twisted polynomial, namely dt sigma, which as an abelian group, an additive group, it's just polynomials with coefficients in D. So it's the sums di t to the power i, so di is coming from d. So d i is coming from d finite, I should say. But there is a twist when we go to multiplication. And multiplication is defined as follows. If you have d times t, the other way around, t times d then it's the same as sigma t times t. Times T, well, sigma is an odomorphism. There is another version of that adding derivations, but I'm not going to use that, so I'm not going to say anything about that. And almost all of the background I'm talking about is coming from Talking about is coming from Jacobson's book, just to give credit. So let this one be R. And for example, if sigma is the identity, then we just get that R is the usual d lambda, or lambda is central. One property of this ring is that it has less. But it has a left or right division algorithm, so it is a principal ideal domain. R is a left or right principal ideal domain. Finally, every left ideal is principal. It's generated by one polynomial. If I If I want to say another example for this, well, here is a nice example. So suppose we have K of an F in cyclic field extension with our goal. Generated by sigma, then you can plug in KSD in this construction, and you get R, R like this, just R isigma, which is when we consider So, suppose here of degree the order of sigma is some n. So, what you get in this case, you get just this cyclic algebra, k t k sigma and some t to the power n over f t to the power n of the green. Or decrease n. So this is like the blueprint for cyclic algebras. Namely, in order to get a real central simple algebra, you just need to specialize it to the end to some scalar in F, and you get simple algebra, cyclic algebra. But this one is Azumaya over Over S t to the n, t to the minus n. You need to insert t to the n to get another Mai algebra. And this one is something that I'm going to use, so maybe I'll try and leave it on the board as much as possible. Yeah, one thing I have to say when you talk about this kind of polynomial rings, I believe you have to talk about a theorem of wet. A theorem of weatherburn just to see how things are sometimes very nice when your coefficients are in a division ring, a real division ring. So Vedal Burns polynomials. So let Nominals so that P F here divisionally that P and D be algebraic otherwise say F is the center, maybe state center and this and algebraic. And this is algebraic, so it has a minimal polynomial over F that F lambda minimal polynomial then this polynomial factors completely into linear factors in B lambda. Lambda is just a point. Lambda is just a product, lambda minus di's. Well, the di's dy is special element you started with, and they are related. The di is their conjugate to d and this is quite quite surprising and very nice result by Gettel Brown. I have to say that there are generalizations of these notions by Notions by I don't want to forget, so let's say by lamb and the royal this is what's the first part, and also joining them in the second paper is A. Well, these guys just generalize this situation and they have very nice two papers on this notion of vetted polynomials. And I have to admit that some of the motivation I had was this. This, the proof, well, maybe the proof by Jacobson to this theorem, in order which motivated me to look at this kind of rings. So let's say I have a few more minutes. So, what I want to know, what to do, is to basically just tell you the results, and if I have The results, and if I have time, maybe I'll get into some books, but basically, just saying the results would be enough if you remember something of that. That would be great. But never mind, I'll just erase this. So, the result with Sheila is. The result with Shila is of a different flavor in a way because in Veruben's result, the field was arbitrary. And for us, we were reading about these known varieties at some point. And the base field there is always assumed to be prime to be closed. So we started thinking about the situation. Well, this is what we have. So this is the results. Here is the result. And we're still working on it, so if you have any good idea as to what to do next, it would be greatly appreciated. So F is going to be those three with these lines. What piece of time and what this means is that if you have if k over f is an alternate field extension, finite field extension, let's say. Then the fact that the field is close to 1 to p extensions means then the dimension is the power of p because we killed all other all other extensions. For example, if your base field is of character Your base field is of characteristic zero. You can just take a PC low subgroup of the absolute Galois group and look at the invariant subfield. This will give you a quantum picology of some field that you start with. So this is the main assumption we have on our base field. And I would like to say that this extending from a field you're trying to pick close field. To p closed field is an injection of the cohomology over the little field into this prime to p closed field, at least for the p-torsion part. So if you're starting with a cyclic algebra, for example, of degree p, you can go up to a prime to p closure and work there. One advantage is that every algebra of prime degree over such a field is cyclic. So you can always say that you're working with cyclic algebra. Working with cyclic alternatives. Okay, so the first result that we have, both results are of the same flavor, but now let R be just be a central division algebra. In particular, it has In particular, it has index a power of p and consider just the usual polynomials where lambda is central. Then every irreducible Polynomial in D lambda has a power as a p-power degree into some t so that's the first result. So that's the first result that we have. It's, well, maybe you can say that it's an observation, more of a result, but because the proof is quite simple. But that's what we can say. The second result is going a little bit to twisting. So now we'll take Rb the same as before as index. As before, as in the example, K is sigma. Again, K over F is cyclic with growth generated by sigma, then again the same holds. Namely, if you have an irreducible polynomial here, your degree has to be a power of p. Well, one application of this or a collaborative of these results concerns the multiplicative structure of Structure of algebra such as this, but let me write it down. Is that if every polynomial of degree smaller or equal to p minus one splits completely into linear factors. Yeah, I just saw the remark by Ostuk. Yes, I apologize for the mistake. You are correct. By turning to this, it splits into linear in both cases. In both cases. But that's the main corollary that I'm going to use and apply it to certain situations. Well, the first result we can use to prove a norm principle for division algebras over such fields. I mean, the norm principle is known in general, and it has a complete proof using the Odome determinants, but over such But over such fields, we can give a more explicit proof in a way using the first result. And the second result, I'm going to apply it to cyclic algebras, or maybe any kind of algebra of degree P over such a field, which is cyclic, because it's going to be closed. Then what I can say is something about the multiplicative structure. Structure of the active brand. So, another corollary is that let A over S equally degree P F so that and And D just going to be A sigma, let's call it A going to be of degree P over F. This is just a cyclic algebra over F and again since the base field is quite And again, since the base field is prime to p closed, we have roots of unity of order p inside. So we can write d actually as, well, I wrote here a. Should I change it to p, then it's actually a b p f. This is how the algebra looks like. Which just to remind everyone, this is basically the following. It's f adjoint x and y. x to the p is a, y to the p. is A, Y to the V is B, and Yx is whole XY. The main idea is that this algebra is a homomorphic image of the twisted polynomial algebra that I showed in the example, and we can consider every element here as a polynomial over k in y. In Y. So given every P in D is a twisted polynomial in y over f of x so I'll choose. So, our result says that every element can be written as a product of linear factors over k. And the main application is to Kumer spaces. So, I'll just remind the definition of a Kumar space. So, a Kumer space. D is a linear subspace of V, let's call it V such that every V in V satisfies. Satisfies v to the power of p belongs to x and v to the power p minus one is not this is the notion of a Kumar space inside D and as an example I will give the standard Kumar space. So here is the example. Let's take V to be f times X plus F of X, the field generated over F by X times Y. And this is a common space inside D of dimension P plus 1. And if for V being alpha X plus Ky. alpha x plus ky, v to the power p is alpha to the p A plus the norm 1f of x, the f of k times p. And this is clearly the same f and I kind of like these counter spaces, I was able to do some stuff with it, and what I can say now is that for all of A corollary of our results is that the multiplicative P star is generated by V. That's the main thing that interests me in this subject. So, Kumo spaces generate the algebra. I can almost say that the length of every element element of any D is at most P plus one. Namely you need only P plus one element. Actually you need P elements from V and one element which is an inverse of an element in V. Yeah, I think that's exactly what I wanted to say. If I had time I would give the proof but Time, I would give the proof, but that's okay as well. So, thank you very much, and again, happy birthday, Andre. Thank you very much. And are there any questions? Okay, so in the definition, should the commerce space be assumed to be maximal? No, this one specifically is maximal. Specifically, it is maximal, and it's still an unsolved question for us: what is the maximal dimension of such a space? In a generic setting, this is the maximal dimension. We were able to prove that in some work a couple years ago, but in the general case, I don't know. I don't even know if any Kumar space can be embedded in a standard one. In degree three we can. Every maximal Kumer space is standard, but in other degrees we don't even In other degrees, we don't even know. So, does your main theorem apply to just that one example or to any Kumer space? No, for this specific Kumer space, for this specific kind of Kumo space, standard Kumo spaces. Not for anyone. It's a good question. I don't know. Because I don't really know how they look, so I'm not sure how to prove such a thing. Any other questions? Okay. Like, I guess we break for another 14 minutes. Thank you. Thank you.
