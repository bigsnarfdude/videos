And thank you for your organizers. And also, I'm sorry my talk is not doesn't match the workshop because I gave the related talk at Shanghei Shautong University. And this work is And this work is my joint work with my student for performing numerical simulations. Oh, another open. Okay, so first the introduction and the simple moving methods. And simple moving methods, numerous methods. And number four is simulating the shading equation have a stable blow-up solution. So I use my moving mesh methods to show how efficient to simulate this one. So far, there are no papers to simulate the stable blow-up solution. And then for numerous solution for DO23 and For D equal to three and for D equal to two, unfortunately, not finished. So I need more work. And so, firstly, is the cubic and nonlinear shading equation. This is a very typical equation, and this defines many physical situations, including the phenomena of nonlinear, optimal, and plus minimal flux physics. For D tools, describes the beam focusing in nonlinear optics, the medium and Linear optical medium and P3 describes the subsonic limits of models for linear waves. So also it is a standard focusing singularity for non-linear and dispersed system. While D dimension is one, the equation is integral and the solution is known as a global. And the solution is known as global exist. In case of the dimension D2 or 3, so both numerical and the theoretical results show that for some initial conditions, the solution will global and the other initial conditions, the solution will blow up. And so in plasma, the similarity is usually called a collapse. And in non-linear optics, And in non-linear objects, the singularity compounding to extreme increase of the field amplitude due to self-focusing. There is a considerable interest in the natural for behavior of the peak, and many others have investigated the structure of the singularity, both numerically and theoretically. I'm sorry, this is not a paper show this talk. We should be interested in the numerical approximation. interesting in the numerical approximations and radially symmetric solutions with initial value problem for t equal to one and three. We assume that the initial condition is radiosymmetric and the numerical simulation shows that the solution is symmetric. Therefore, we're looking for a radially symmetric solution which is the function of R and so here. Oh, sorry. So we write it Sorry. So we write the equation as radiosymmetric case. And so we know the both mass and energy are conservative. So with this mass and energy should be conserved. So now, a sufficient, not as necessary condition for blow-up is the energy should be negative. Should be negative. Many others use the dynamic rescaling methods for simulating the proper solutions of equation. The key ideas for this method is equation tools of both time space variables. So make a change variables. And then it looks like this. This one. So AO is a AOT is a very AOT is related to the blow-up time capital T. So that means in this method, we should know the blow-up time in advance, but in real calculation is very hard. So they should repeat again, again to make adjustment. So this is very not efficient. But still, you know, this first time to simulate the blow-up solution. Solution here. And however, so this one we have exact self-stimulus solution. This one. This solution is stable. What is the blow-up solution stable? I will explain later. So here, you look at the oscillation term because of a log. When T up, this term is very small because of a log still oscillated slowly. So that means. Oscillated slowly, so that means is uh stable, okay. And so, where q is a solved an ordinary differential equation, and here there are parameters. One is this one, q0, and another with a is a constant parameter. So, those two should be choose very, you know, some some. You know, some relationship, then the solution is a monitor or smooth. Okay, so here, and so this is first proved by the oh, this cannot move. Okay, so this is by one and in 90s PhD series. And later, Chris Baden, myself, and Bob Russo using the fortune integral integration. For train integral integration theorem to extend the same results to between two and I'm sorry, move too fast. And look at this solution. The two solution will be like this one because approach to CLO quite slowly, quite slowly. And however, if you notice select A and Q0 properly, then Properly, then the solution should be oscillated very heavily. Okay, so this is difficult. Initial value problem for ordinary differential is always exist. But to choose how to choose A and Q0 is a bigger problem. So this also the numerical solution shows that they have infinitely many multi-bumper solutions, which decrease the Solutions which decrease at infinity, and one solution branches this way. Amongst those solutions, only one monitor decreases, just as you before. This we denote by Q0. And this actually provides a stable, they call it a stable blow-up solution. And so we this is called this one, and this is exactly as the early work. Work. And so Chris Bada later also theoretically analysis a lot of results. And then recently by Young and there's other person group and generalized to general terms. Okay, then now the own question. There are no theoretical proof whether the solution exists and what are the relations between And what are the relations between A and Q zero? So, this is an ordinary differential system, but there are more than 30, yes. So, nobody finds the relationship between A and the Q0. And for D equal to 2, if we let A equal to 0, then we get this equation. This equation is easy to solve. And you have a unique and exponentially pique. And use this one, we can construct an unstable exact solution. But this one, because here you know, oscillated heavily, you know, so it cannot simulate it. And so I think I have no time to explain more detail. So this one, now we move to the next one. There are a lot of papers to Of papers to simulate how what is the blow-up rate for d equal to two, and eventually people agree there are long-term correction. So that's why previous three-dimensional dimension groups and two only t minus t, or square root of t minus t. And now we have a log log. So this we call the log log correction. Not that easy. Okay, okay. So this we will show later. And of course, there are a lot of paper published with theoretical and numerical discuss this problem. And so first evidence where you notice brother cubic F3 or 2D, this is a 2D, this is those groups, and also later on, they find that A should be this value and Q0 is this value. And but myself, Russell, this study the numerical analysis and show that there are multi-peaker strategy and also analyze the step. And also analyze the stability of the solution numerically, also some theoretical analysis. And later on, those groups, so contract and analyze the numerical methods based on the standard correcting finite elements space description with piecewise linear continuous function and on this implicit correct Nicholson time steps proceed. Time steps procedure, the mesh review, they used to call mess called the mesh refinement strategy. And for proper providers, they also rate is this one. So everybody do the same thing for D equal three. And for D equal two, also verifies log log law when X is close to lower time. And later, so recently, And later, so recently, by this group studied the stable dynamics, so in the non-linear Feeling equation with radiosymmetric case, and they use more general terms, so p is general for me to the p equal to three. And so they also, you know, verify some stability. File some stability, I wouldn't explain detail. Oh, yeah, okay. And they use many initial values to show the solution obtainable dynamic scaling methods and to verify the approach to the Q. Okay, the but this only for the Q0 approach. Q0, they will approve. I will show you later on. However, this method need the proper time key in advance. So this is not very powerful. It's not clear whether they match the other parts of the Russian curve and not clear whether the mass or energy are conservative. Okay, in this talk, we first introduce a very simple and efficient. Introduce a very simple and efficient moving mesh scheme. Then we use the implicit Craig-Nicholson time step procedure with moving mesh methods to simulate a stable rubber solution. So simulated this one. And after carefully selection parameters, we find the numerical solution and the exact solution overlaps. So for u is not too small this way. And furthermore, the abder. one and furthermore they have derivative also maps and especially for d equal to equal three we choose some typical initial data that are used by other people and then we can compare and also we can reach the as large as this number and and the mesh point move to such a small and the time step Small and the time step is such a small, and the derivative is large as this one. Okay, so now we look at that. So both curves itself and derivatives are smooth in the whole domain of defense. Furthermore, both mass and energy are well preserved and also show the proper solution will be converted to the exact proper solution. However, for and however for invention two e two so i i'm not very perfect so i will need more work so now let me introduce the moving mesh methods moving mesh methods is one of the powerful methods to numerically solve time depending the pde with some kind of singularities such as short wave blow-up and moving boundary Up and moving boundary problems. Moving mesh methods use, if there's a fixed number of meshes and control by the monitor function, move the mesh adaptively, such that the errors among meshes distributed uniformly. And so many others. So I So I not and so yeah, yeah, yeah. So many others have developed very efficient and robust adaptive methods. They first contrast the computation domain and then mapping to the physical domain. Such methods are called variational-based moving method methods. In this paper, moving measure in this paper we generate measure direct uses using an exact formula and we focus on borough problem so mesh formula will explicitly express so the calculation is very simple and to derive this equation we first set such set of measure points uniformly uh here which derived our one-to-one mapping to r equal to r eta t. R equal to R eta T. And then the method will generate, minimize this one, this one. And the monitor function is related to the solution. So U is the real part is B and the imaginary part is W. And C1C2 are parameters. And if we take a derivative, so the shoulder B so equal to zero. We assume support makes. Because we assume support make a simple independent of r so k derivative equals so this equals zero and then we solve for r and you will see will be this one and you will see if n monitor function is very large so this one is increased smaller so that because the mesh is smaller and then let's say the numerical methods so so the numerical methods i think i make a very I make very fast, so not explain too much. And so, first, you know, write the u to separate the v plus itam, plus separate two, and then with the initial condition, and then the only one I need is brain. So, because it's moving mesh meshes, so the V should be related to the R, I is related to the eta and T. So, when you eta and t. So when you take a partial derivative with t, so so where eta is fixed, so first take a derivative of this term, so we generate this one, and then take a derivative of t substitute the differential equation, so we generate this once and then we use the cracker niche methods, so the time step is smaller and smaller, there's a part and then we do And then we do this one. So I need this part more faster. And the only one is the pregnancy method have one non-linear twin, we need to use linearization for use this part. And the only one is on the left boundary. This is very sensitive because it's a blue percentage, blue up point. So in this one, we should be treated very carefully. So first we expand. Carefully. So, first we expanded some this and you know fictitious point. So, because our derivative of zero, so this one should be equal by symmetric. And then this term is singular. So, we use the Robbie's rule to find this second derivative and then subscribe this one. So, we will get the scheme. And now we simulated a stable blow-up solution. And for this, in this region, we write an exact blow-up solution, like this one, and the equation is part. So, we use the moving mesh methods and the numerical scheme to describe the section. I think how much time five minutes. Okay, I move faster. So, the first five and First, finally pressing, and then we just look at here. We use our cosine assets and then do this way. Then we look at the here is very fit very well. So only this part, so numerical solution is a little up and in enlarge this part. Enlarge this part, so will be this way. And but if we look at the rest, so the rest still very smooth and in enlarge the small part, so still have something like this part. And later on, you know, still smooth, everything smooth. PI is smooth. And later on, only two, because only two because the exact solution is a cannot calculate to the infinity so only this numerical solution left and and q to the 40 still everything is smooth okay now we look at uh uh and so i think so now we look at the uh for simulation of equal free and this one i think And this one, I think I have no time to explain everything. So, just a typical initial condition, and people calculate the different people, calculate the blow-up time different. So, I use this part and look at our solution. So, first you tested whether this one have a limit. So, this means the probability rate is what? And this one will use some methods. We use some methods to show that so the proper rate must one half and the proper time is equal. If we're not, then this one, the later to go up and down. Okay, so we can adjustment the proper time. And then we find the limits. And then we simulate initially is this one. So this is a numerical initial condition. numerical initial condition and this is the exact initial exact block times the initial condition and then we look at a little bit larger so here you see the u and the exact solution is match very good but the real part imaginal part still a little bit different and later on we increase and to this And to this one, still have not very good, but it's not very good. And to this one, so met very well, I enlarge this part. Let's see what happened. So look, so this is the exact solution, is smooth curve, and one numerical solution is almost located in the curve. Okay, so here this is a V. this is a v so this look at the the r step is this large and this one is this large and then look at the rest still very smooth and even go more okay and go more so so all smooth until two I think here is a is smooth until Here is smooth and short one, smooth. And this one is local derivative. So, derivative is as large as 10 to 120 and also very smooth. So, I have no time to move very fast. The only one now look at the mass. So, mass is considered. If we use the trapezoid rule to use it, then this one is even the rigid. Even the reach to this large, the error is still absolute value. The other people use a related value. I use the absolute value. So that's still value. So this is very good. And for the energy, this is very sensitive. So I make some parameter called P, P minus P, and look at the P and P between 0 and 1. If P between 0 and 1. P between zero and one, still make this one equal to minus this is the initial energy energy. Okay, so choose P. If P is located, this one, I think this is a match very well. So look at this one. So I saw for P and then C P is between 0, 0.4 to 0.6. And look at, so this is the exact mass. Mass is, of course, increased by. Is of course increase, but not positive part. And then this is a p-value. So p-value is still located here. So and this point corresponded with 10 to 60 power. And now for the put two, not very good. So I just see and this one is okay how to detect the blow-up time. And the first is here is not very well oscillation. Very well, it's an oscillation. Look at the amount of value, of course, is very, very small, but still not perfect. Okay, and next one, so this one, you know, we must calculate a very small T model T so that the solution will approach, you have a limit. Otherwise, it cannot. And this one, sorry, and this one here have some also. And this one here have some observations of why I needed to look at my solution. And I ignore this part. So solution of the leading part is smooth, you know, everything will well. And other people probably can also just show this part. They didn't show the next part. And for the next part, you say, like, see, because not enough mesh more point move to this part. So this is some oscillation. So, how to control this one? Because this one the part. one because this one the power is 1042 and as the previous one is 45 this was a small one how to move control mesh this is the bigger problem okay so so i think i need a work so that's a sure this example just shows my my moving mesh method is very powerful so this is my talk thank you
