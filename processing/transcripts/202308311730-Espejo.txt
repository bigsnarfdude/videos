Well, our next talk is Neighborhoods of Addictive Course, given by Hibran Estrefo from UNAM and University of France. Hi, my name is Hibran. First of all, thanks to the organizers and the committee for allowing me to give. Allowing me to give a talk to present some of the results that I am researching in my PhD. My advisors are Laura Ortiz from Munam and Frank Loray from Universit√© Duran. First of all, what is the main goal of the talk? First, we are considering the VISORDA, the union of The union of five projective lines embedded in a complex surface of the dimension two, B. Such that in B, each divisor, each rational curve, is Riemann sphere, has self-intersection minus two. This example can be given, for instance. Can be given, for instance, when we blow up one point in the origin of C2. We blow up the point and we obtain a rational curve of auto-interciac intersection minus one. And if we blow up another point, we obtain a new divisor with self-intersection minus one, but the original divisor has intersectional. The original divisor has intersection minus two. And it's one result of Graward that these divisors that are obtained as blow-ups has the structure of line bundles over the Riemann sphere. Here we have O minus two. And when we consider the fibers, we can blow up two points in four fibers. Up two points in four fibers. For instance, the fiber of zero, one, the and infinity in P1, we blow up two points, and the result is one neighborhood like that example. And the question is: in how many ways can we embed this divisor in a complex surface? Complex surface. So, in order to answer this question, first we observe the following. First, we have a two-to-one cover ramified over the fibers F0, F1, F3, and F infinite. We have a two to one ramified cover. A 2 to 1 ramified cover. And when we consider the premise of the vertical lines, we obtain again a Riemann sphere with self-intersection minus one. But at infinity, we have a new Riemann surface, but now it has genus one. We can make Genus one, we can make the computation using Riemann-Hurwitz. It is an elliptic curve. And well, if we have a poleation here, we can see that the Camacho sad index, if here we have minus one and we have another point, this becomes minus two, minus, no, minus one half, and here minus one. Here, minus one. It has self-intersection minus four. And this is P1, and this is an elliptic curve. And since we have a rational course, Riemann sphere with self-intersection minus one, again by Grawert, we can consider them as blow-ups of a point. So we can contract. A point. So we can contract, we consider the blowdown, sigma, a blowdown of the red lines. And the result is an elliptic curve. But since we contracted four lines, this self-intersection minus four becomes now an elliptic curve with zero self-intersections. Elliptic curve with zero south intersection. And we also notice that in this neighborhood of the elliptic curve, we have an involution E given by E of X is equal to Y if P X is equal to P Y in the projection. Here we have that the The blowdown is a biolomorphism outside of the points where we blow up. And we have fixed points, we have four fixed points of the involution. So the question, how many ways can we embed this divisor becomes in how many neighborhoods of elliptic curves admit an involution fixing four points? And just notice that if we begin with an elliptic curve with an evolution that fixes four points, we can blow out the points and consider a surface given by the caution. Let's say if this is B tilde, V will be B tilde by a quotient by the involution. So we can go both ways. And And I will talk about the neighborhoods of elliptic curves, smooth neighborhoods of elliptic curves with self-intersection zero. But first of all, what is an elliptic curve? An elliptic curve is a one-dimensional complex manifold homeomorphic to the torus. In our context, we will think of C, a quotient by a lattice, C plus tau C, with the imaginary part of tau, great bigger. imaginary part of tau great bigger than zero. So the image to have in mind is the following. Here in the complex plane, imagine that this is the complex plane. We have a vector one, the number tau. And the quotient means that to the point x is identified by x plus one. That means we paste We paste these two sides of the parallelogram. Here we have x plus one. And on the other hand, we have x is also equivalent to x plus tau. So this is the red line. X is equivalent to x plus tau. So the image is, we have here. Uh, we have here a disk given by the red line, and we have another disk given by one, and here we have more or less like tau. So, an elliptic curve has two periods. We can think of one and tau, and well, uh, first what we mean. First, what we mean by the embedding? How do we distinguish two embeddings? Well, two embeddings are going to be equivalent. So we have our elliptic curve and we embed it in a surface. Later, I will give some examples. So if we have that this elliptic curve can be embedded in two In two neighborhoods, U and U prime, we will say that they are equivalent if there exists a biolomorphism that does the following, that does the following. Here we have the elliptic curve C. Here we have P and Phi sends the elliptic curve into the elliptic curve. Elliptic curve into the elliptic curve as the identity. And that is what it means that the diagram is commutative. Here we can embed U, C in these two neighborhoods. Here we have E of C and E prime C. And this diagram is commutative. Or that diagram like that, if we've Diagram like that, if we put the identity here just to make the distinction. So, some examples of neighborhoods of elliptic curves are obtained as quotients. We notice that we can write an elliptic curve as a quotient. And here we have the quotient of x plus 1 y and x plus tau ay. And this is a line bundle. A line bundle, and in fact, these are all the line bundles of self-intersection zero can be written as quotients like that. That is a result of Avel, according to Arnold. And we have that two of such line bundles are equivalent. If we can write benef, I will write that. We have it here x plus one. Here x plus one y L A X plus tau A Y and here we have L B given by X plus one Y and X plus tau X plus Tau B Y and they are and those the line bundles are going to be equivalent if we can write B as A two A two p i tau a and here the isomorphism will be given by x to the power 2 p x y so that when we compose x plus tau a y, we obtain x plus tau b y in the relation. Yeah, just to see that it is well defined. And we have the these line bundles. We have the these line bundles have the structure of a group. We can multiply two line bundles if we multiply the complex number that defines them. And just one observation is that this line bundle is going to be the direct product if we have that L A is equivalent to the direct product of the elliptic curve. product of the elliptic curve times C if A is equal to A 2 B i chi k with k an integer. That means that if we have the product to the power m, we are going to say that the length bundle is torsion if to some power m we have To some power m, we have that there is an integer such that a to the power of m is equal to a to the power of 2pik with k an integer. And one exercise, this is just right-integed. We have that if there is an involution. Then A squared must be equal to A to the power 2pik. That is, in our example, the line bundle must be two torsion. That is one reason. And another family of examples are provided by germs of diffeomorphism. We recall that the diffeomorphism of C0 is zero is a map an analytic map from c zero to c zero such that the linear part is different from zero and we can consider the the neighborhood uf of the elliptic curves c as the coefficient of the direct product by the action of the lattice of the lattice given by phi n is equal to x plus one y and plus one y and phi tau the xy is equal to x plus tau fy. And here we have a classification of the phiomorph is given by Ecala Netal. No, from Ecala, from Etalamboroni, Ecalamboroni, Ecal Boroni. And here we see just an observation that if Fc is analytically equivalent to Gc. equivalent to GC, G set. There is a diffeomorphism such that it conjugates the two functions. Then we have that the corresponding neighborhoods of the elliptic curves must be also analytically equivalent. Here, the isomorphism that we're considering is going to be given by x comma phi y, the isomorphism that makes. The isomorphism that makes the germs of function commute. Here we have that result, suggest that the moduli of name of elliptic curves must be also with the zero-self intersection, must be also a function. must be must be also a functional model and why why we we say that uh in both examples are uh with zero set of intersection and the reason is that we have the foliation dy equal to zero in both examples uh dy equal to zero gives a foliation of of source neighborhoods so that the elliptic curve is an invariant curve we don't have single Curve, we don't have singularities in the elliptic curve, and as a consequence of Kamachosa, we have that the self-intersection is zero. And we notice also that both examples are of the form a product of cx times cyzer with an action given by phi n and a function f, phi n dx y. The xy equal to x plus and y and phi tau f the x y equal to x plus tau plus a function y e x y y b x y such that a and b are one periodic on x. And there is a result that Arnold mentions. Well, when the self-intersection is negative, then the neighborhood is analytically equivalent to a neighborhood of its normal bundle that is a result from growth. But as I said, we are considering the self-intersection zero. And one result that Arnold mentioned is that every mention is that every neighborhood of elliptic curve with self-intersection zero can be written as as one as a quotient of of this form and once we write a neighborhood of a quotient we we fix a quotient like that we can define a formal equivalence we are going to say that two of those neighborhoods are formally equivalent if there is a g that commutes If there is a G that commutes a f g and well, U F C is analytically equivalent to UFC if there is a fee so that to use the same notation, I change. To use the same notation, I change the notation there, but so that it commutes. And we also notice that if this area is convergent, we have analytic equivalence. Arnold proves that in the case when the normal bundle is non-torsion, we have that this neighborhood is analytically equivalent to a neighborhood of its zero section. That is, if a to the power of m is equal, is this. power of m is equal is different from e to the power of 2p ik. We have that we can delete all the terms in the series of a and here we will only it will only remain we write b the x y equal to the zoom we develop as a series as a Taylor series along y. Y and we have b i that depends on x y to the power of e and he gives a step by step how to delete each power series greater than one the just like the proof of the Poincar√© theorem about the vector fields that Jessica mentioned and well I think that I And well, I think that I don't have much time, but in the just in the case of this is the case non-torsion. In the case of non-torsion, we have only one invariant that is the normal bundle. And in the case of torsion, the case that it is interesting to us, we have the classification was given by Tom Lauren Tousset in 2018 and to prove the analytically. And to prove the analytically equivalence, they use the weather type that is shown here, but I don't have much time. And once we have this invariant, I will just say that they found another K over M invariance and the result that we proved is that the informal invariance must satisfy the Must satisfy that the normal bundle is indeed trivial, is in fact trivial. We don't, I said that since there is an involution, we had that it must be to torsion, but it is stronger than tot. We proved that the normal bundle is in fact a direct product. The weather type must be odd, and we find conditions of the invariance that Tom Lauren Toussay give. Future work. A future work is to say to talk about the well that is another problem, but we have we have that we classified the formal classification of such neighborhoods and now we want to say something about the analytical classification. Analytical classification was achieved by Tom Loraya and Boronin in 2020. Boroni in 2022. So that's all. Thanks. Are there any questions? Thank you very much. Ibrahim, I are there anywhere that we are calling. Okay, let's go. Which part I don't remember I don't recall why. But for instance, this example is interesting to us. This example is interesting to us because it has to do with the equation of fine level basics. The example that said at the beginning of lowing up very soft points in the bundle, I will say the Here's a Brook surface F2, but that is just we have a line bundle over the Riemann sphere with self-intersection minus two, and we blow up. And we blow up two points. That space of configuration has to do with the equation of point level six. But I don't understand the relation quite yet. I just know that there is a reference in the article Introduction to Model Space of Connection by Frank Loray, where he explains why this space is interesting. And I will just put some reference here, like. Some reference here, like here we have the article of Robert, where he says that the self-intersection, when we have negative self-intersection, it is the direct product. The article of the 76 is the article where Arnold gives this description of elliptic curves as quotients and also proves some results about the formal classification. The formal classification. And here we have the articles of classification in the torsion case by Frank L'Oreal, Livietom, and Frederic Touss√©. And where there is the former classification, and where Frank Laurel, Frederic Touss√©d, and Sergei Morani, when we have analytical classification. And just one remark: here we have discrete invariance for the formal classification, but the analytical. Former classification, but the analytical classification is functional. There is a co-cycle of pastings and so on. Yes, I will just say this question. If we have, perhaps I can raise here. We have here F2, the Hirshebruk surface. That is, we have a rule surface over P1. P1 such that each fiber is P1 and we have a section of at infinity with intersection minus two and we consider two points in the fibers let's say zero one t and infinity and the question is here as I said Is here as I said, we blow up twice. Here we have zero-sells intersection, and we blow up twice, and we obtain a neighborhood of this divisor that is formed by five rational curves of self-intersection minus two. And the question is: what is the dependence of the configuration of points to the analytical class? Analytical class, how? Because we have, we blow up this pair of points. And what can be said about the analytical class of this divisor, of the neighborhood of this divisor? And so far we obtained that formally it is either there is a function g of v d to c zero such that C0 such that g inverse the zero is equal to d. There is a meromorphic function we can construct it explicitly by one configuration. And on the other case, we prove that there is only one formal class, the formal class given by Sir example, one of the two rolled surface over the Riemann sphere with self-intersection zero. On zero, that is not trivial. Well, the question is just about the analytical classification. What we said what we could in the formal setting, but now what is the analytical class? What is the dependence? We found some invariance, so making some hypotheses, but we are trying to see another. We are trying to see another way. If there is, if not, we will have to understand some other constructions to give an answer.
