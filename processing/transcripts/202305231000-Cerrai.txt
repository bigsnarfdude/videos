Recording in the programme Okay, so we can so in order that we can get Sandra started right on time let me welcome you to this morning session I hope you all Um, I hope you all slept well and are ready for Sandla's talk. Um, I'm going to um tell us something. What so she will keep us awake, right? Talking about a small mass diffusion approximation for a stochastic wave equation. Stochastic wave equation with constraints. Okay, not very general. Okay, so the state is yours. Okay, so thank you very much for inviting me to this conference. It's a pleasure for me to see some very good friends and also many new people. Friends and also many new people. Okay, so it's a great pleasure. So, in this talk, I will present some results that I recently obtained in collaboration with Žyslav Prezniak. And this is about the so-called Smuruchowsky-Crammer's approximation for stochastic wave equation that are subject to some constraints. So, let's see. Okay, yes, go on. Okay, so this is the equation that I'm going to consider. So, as you see, this is you see a stochastic, I mean, a wave equation where there is this damping term. And this wave equation is subject to this stochastic forcing, which has. Forcing, which has a multiplicative coefficient in front of the noise, and which depends both on the position and on the velocity. Then there are initial condition, and then this is an equation that I consider in a bounded domain. So there are this Dirichlet boundary condition. And as you see, this is an equation that depends on a parameter. So there is this small parameter μ in front of the second derivative in time. And this μ can be. In time. And this can be, I don't know, considered as the mass of these particles that are subject to this evolution. And here, as you see, there is this parameter gamma, which is the positive constant. And I mean, for what I'm going to do, you can just take a gamma equal one. It doesn't make any sense because it's constant. And the WQ is a cylindrical Vinner process. And here the reference space. And here the reference space, as always, is H, which is L2 of the domain D. And this diffusion coefficient sigma satisfies some properties that I'm going to specify in a moment. In the title, there was this wave equation with constraints. And what do I mean by constraint? In this setting, in the case that I'm going to consider, I am imposing that the solution of my stochastic Of my stochastic wave equation with damping is confined to live on the unit sphere in the Hilbert space H. So I'm imposing that the L2 norm of the solution remains equal one. And so M is the manifold where my solution is going to live. And then I have to introduce the tangent bundle of this manifold, which is calligraphic M, which of course is defined by this condition. Course is defined by this condition. And okay. So I'm imposing that my solution is living on the manifold M. And so what I need is that in order this to be true, what I need is that U and the position and the velocity have to be orthogonal with respect to the product, I mean, to the product in the Hilbert space H, and for every T greater or equal than zero. t greater equal than zero. And so, I mean, as a first step, I have to impose that this condition is satisfied by the initial condition. So I went to impose that the initial position remains on the sphere, is on the sphere, and also the initial position and the initial velocity are orthogonal. But of course, you see, imposing this condition on the initial condition doesn't give me that the solution is going to remain on the manifold. And so somehow I have to, you see, introduce. To, you see, introduce some modification of the equation in such a way that I can say that my solution is going to leave and stay on the manifold. Okay, so let's see how I can do this and let's start with the deterministic equation. So the deterministic equation is this one, okay, and here this gradient with respect to the norm of the Hib space. The Hilbert space U, so is the gradient of this energy functional phi naught, which of course is defined in this way. Okay, and then the idea is to replace this gradient along the direction u of the functional phi naught with this gradient delta of a phi. And you see, how do I construct this? How do I introduce this modification? And the natural way of doing this. And the natural way of doing this is to define the gradient tilde along a direction A of the functional phi as a pi A of the regional gradient, where pi A is, if you want, the projection of U into the tangent space of the manifold at the point A. And this is what this projection is. Yes? You agree? Yeah, this is a way of writing my deterministic evolution. Okay. Okay, so this is the modification. And if you do your computation, what you find immediately is that this new term is given by the original term, which By the original term, which is minus the Laplacian, and then you have this extra term that you have to introduce in such a way that you know that you remain on the manifold M, on the sphere. Okay, so this is the modification for the deterministic equation. And now you see, I mean, the first modification, the modification that involves the gradient of the function all of i naught. And then I have also to introduce a modification for the acceleration, okay? For the acceleration. Okay, so I have again to take a projection of the acceleration term. And so what I do, I take the projection of the acceleration, and this projection is given by this term here. Okay, and now I have just to interpret what is this term here, what is this additional term. And remember that I'm imposing that my solution is living on the sphere. So the L2 norm of the solution has to stay equal one. has to stay equal one and so what you realize immediately is that this part here this coefficient where is me i lost okay doesn't matter i mean this term here is transforming this and so this projection becomes the sum of the original acceleration plus this additional term okay um okay so if i put everything together my Together, my original deterministic damped wave equation is transformed into this one. Okay, this is what I have. Now, let's see how I can get the constrained stochastic version of this equation. And as you can expect, what I need to do is to project also the noisy term and see what I get there. Okay, so here, before doing that, let me introduce some. Doing that, let me introduce some notations and very briefly. So, here this is the bounded domain where I'm working, and H, as I was saying before, is the L2 space on this domain. And then I denote by A the realization of the Laplacian in the space H with the reclaimed boundary condition. And so, as you all know very well, this is a diagonal operator, and Ek is the orthonormal basis that diagonalize A. And so I introduced. And so I introduce these functional spaces, which are the spaces where I will do my analysis. And this is all very classical. So I just wrote to remind you the notation, but this is all super classical. And of course, since I'm dealing with a wave equation, so I'm working with the position and the velocity, I have to work on a product space. And this is offers, as we all know well, the natural product space that you consider in order to study this equation. And you see, I will need And you see, I will need suitable a priori bounds for the solution. And so I will have to pick the right beta in order to be able to treat my, I mean, to do my analysis. Okay, so this said, I introduce the operator which depends on mu, on the small mass, on the product space. And this is this operator here. And the domain, of course, is H1 for this one. So it's H2 times. So it is H2 times H1. And as known, this A mu is the generator of a C0 group, which I will call S mu. And so what do I assume for the noise? What I assume for the noise, so here I'm dealing with irregular noise. I don't want to have troubles with, I mean, giving, I mean, yes, my noise is super smooth here. And what I assume is that this noise. What I assume is that this noise can be formally written in this form. So I can expand my noise in this way. And here, Ek is the complete autonomous system that diagonalizes the Laplace operator. And the beta k is a sequence of independent Brunian motion. And Q is, I mean, what defines the color in space of my noise. And it's an operator that satisfies suitable conditions. So we have. So we have now the reproducing kernel K of the cylindrical dinner process WQ, which is nothing else than the image of the Hilbert space H through this operator Q. And then E is the Hilbert space such that the embedding of the reproducing kernel into the space E is a Hilbert Schmidt. And E is exactly the space where my noise is going to live. So in what I must, I mean, in what follows, at least in the first part of the talk, because this Least in the first part of the talk, because this talk is two parts. First, we need to give any meaning to the equation, so we have to study the well-posedness of this equation, which was not known, and then we want to study the limiting behavior of the solution when the parameter mu goes to zero. So, at least in the first part of the talk, what we assume is that this sigma naught maps the product space H into this space of bounded operators, and that's linear growth. And this Lipschitz continues on both, it's locally Lipschitz. Balls is locally lip shifts continuous, and then let's see how I can give you the constrained version of the stochastic version of this damped wave equation. So, this is my equation, how to do this. So, we have to modify sigma naught. So, we have to project. And so, what we introduce is this operator sigma, which is now the projection of sigma naught. And so, it's given by this expression here. And you see the presence of The presence of you see here this depends on z, and then here there is a u and u here. And this term here is perfectly innocuous when we work in h1 times h. It becomes less innocuous when you go from h1 times h to h beta plus one times h beta for beta bigger than zero. And but yeah, okay. But this is also for the other terms. But this is also for the other terms. So, what we have because of the assumption that we make on sigma naught, we also have that this sigma is Lipschitz continuous on balls and there's cubic growth. And yeah, and you see sigma z E belongs to the tangent space of M at the point U for every E in E. Okay, so this is this is fine. Now, this is my Now, this is my new equation. So, now this is the equation that I'm considering. Okay, so I have the modified version of the deterministic part, and then I have also the modified stochastic term. And here I'm introducing a Stratonovich integral because it's the natural type of integral that you want to have in order to be sure that your solution remains on the sphere. Okay, but I mean. Okay, but I mean, as you usually do, you don't work directly with Stratonovich, but you go back to the Ito formulation, and then with the Ito formulation, you have the classical stochastic integral in the Ito sense with sigma, and then you have this extra term. And of course, in order to give a meaning to this extra term, you need to assume suitable condition on sigma naught in such a way that you have the differentiability and then the continuity. Differentiability and then the continuity of the derivative, and then the fact that this trace is finite. So, here I didn't put all these assumptions because otherwise we never finish. But you see, you know, you need to assume what has to be assumed in order to make all this meaningful and nice and treatable. Okay? This said, you can prove that constrain damped wave equation for every fixed. Equation for every fixed mu positive as a unique mild solution that lives on the tangent bundle on calligraphic M. And when I say solution, I mean a solution in this mild sense. So what, and this is something that we have seen so many times during this conference. So you are integrating this with respect to the group associated to the operator EMU. Okay, so I have this solution. Okay, so I have this solution, and also, you see, you see, yeah, this is my result. And how do you prove this? The proof of the Wilposeness is not such a big difficult, I mean, it's not so difficult in the sense that what you have, your coefficients are locally Lipschitz continuous, so you can find a local solution up to a certain stopping time, tau, and then you have to prove that this solution actually remains. This solution actually remains on the tangent bundle, so you have to prove this invariance property for the solution of the equation, and then you need to prove suitable a priori bounds that allows you to say that with probability one, this stopping time actually is plus infinity in the sense that you have a global solution. Okay, but somehow when you study your equation in the space H1 times H, everything is quite natural. Everything is quite natural. And even if you have this acubic growth, when you do your energy estimates, everything works quite fine, which is absolutely not the case when you want to move from H1 times H, for example, to H2 times H1, where the situation is a real mess, because everything really becomes very, very complicated. Okay. Okay, so now we go to the second part of the talk, which is, I mean, the most challenging part. I mean, the most challenging part because we want to study the limiting behavior of this solution with respect to this small parameter. So, we want to consider a situation in which the mass is negligible, and you want to understand what is the defective dynamics that you have in the small mass limit. And what you see is a diffusion approximation phenomenon. And what we wanted to see is to understand what was the limiting equation that we get in the small mass limit. Get in the small mass limit. Okay, so this is, and as you see here, I have a modified version of my equation because in the previous Well-Posness result, I was taking sigma naught and then sigma, depending on the position and on the velocity. Here, I do not assume that the multiplicative coefficient in front of the noise depends on the velocity, because in that case, I mean, the limit doesn't make sense. sense so so i have to assume that sigma depends only on the position and not on the velocity but assuming that the coefficient sigma naught depends only on the position and not on the velocity means that you don't need anymore to use a stratonovich because stratonovich and ito they are the same okay and so i don't have anymore that uh ito to stratonovich correction term and so the only term is this one okay i don't have anymore that Okay, I don't have any more the term with the trace. This is disappearing. You remember? I mean, the reason is because you see the position is differentiable, and so Stratonovich and Ito are the same. But if you look at the correction term that you get, there are all derivatives of sigma with respect to V, with respect to the velocity. To v with respect to the velocity and not with respect to the position. So, you see, also from the correction term, the correction term becomes zero. I mean, let me go back. This one. You see, this term here becomes just zero. But when you have, you see, a wave equation where the multiplicative term, the coefficient, depends only on the position. Coefficient depends only on the position, it also turns is the same. There is no difference, yeah. But you see also from the correction time that you are getting, this is zero when sigma does not depend on v okay. Okay, so this is what we were doing, and yes, and so this is the equation that we have. This is the constrained version when sigma depends only on u. And what we are interested in. And what we are interested in, as I was saying, is to study the limiting behavior of the solution when goes to zero. And what we are going to prove is that u, in fact, converges to the solution of a stochastic parabolic equation that is subject to the same constraints. So the solution is still living on the sphere. But in the limit, you cannot just take here formally mu equals zero. So you kill this part and this part. You kill this part and this part, and the limit is just the derivative equal one over gamma, all the rest. Because, in the limit, because of the interaction, I mean, because of the presence of the noise, what you find is that there is an extra term, which is a noise-induced term, that you get. And our point was to understand what was this extra term that you get and try to interpret what sort of equation is. Rate, what sort of equation is this limiting equation? Okay, so this is what we have. So these are the conditions that we assume here. You see, here we assume that sigma naught maps. And the point is this, that in the previous analysis, we only work in H1 times H, and we do not need too much work. But as I was saying, here, you need, as you can imagine, tightness, and you need tightness. Tightness, and you need tightness in spaces of quite high regularity. And so you need to assume some extra conditions. And so, what we need to assume is that sigma naught maps H1 into this space of Hilbert-Schmidt operators defined on the reproducing kernel with values in H1, bounded and Lipschitz continuous on bounded subsets, but also maps H2 into Hilbert-Schmidt operators from the reproducing kernel with values in H2. Producing kernel with values in H2 with this type of growth. And then there is this condition here, which makes me suffer very much. So because I couldn't, I was not able to avoid this condition. So without the square, this is a quite natural condition. Why? Because when you remember, when you have from sigma naught to sigma, there is that extra term which has u in U in two positions. So there is a quadratic term in U. And so you see it's fine. I mean, somehow is a sort, it's not necessary, but it's perfectly legitimate to have here this without the square. But when you do your a priori bounds, at some point, we really needed to have this quadratic decays. Okay, so I still don't give up on. I still don't give up on this assumption, but this is what I can do for the moment. Okay. And you see, this is also something that involves the H1 norm. So somehow you need to assume that sigma naught depends on the H1 norm of U. In the examples that you have, this is the sort of condition that you need to assume. Okay. This said, this is the result that we obtain. And then, in the last few minutes that I have, I will try to explain. Minutes that I have, I will try to explain how you get this result. So, you see, we fix an initial condition, and the initial condition you see is in a space of high regularity because it's in H2, intersected, of course, with a tangent bundle. And what we have is that here there is a mistake. This P is less than 4, is not less than infinity. So, for every P less than 4 and P positive and eta positive, you have this convergence. So, you have a convergence in probability. Convergence in probability in Lp0T with values in H1 to this process U. And this process U is the solution of this equation. So this is the limiting equation that we get. So this is the parabolic equation, but then you see there is this extra term, which is the term that you get because of the presence of the noise. So this is the noise-induced term. And I will come back to Will come back to. I mean, I will explain more about this term and I will give you some, I mean, insight about why you get this. And I will compare this with other version of constraint parabolic, stochastic parabolic equation that have been considered in the literature. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is a term. No, no. This is a term. This is a term that gives me that the solution lives on the ball, on the sphere. But how? You see, people, I mean, the constraint stochastic parabolic equation had been considered, but not with this term, with other terms that are coming from stratonovich integral. And what I will show is that this is not the classical one. So this is another example that was not known in the literature of a constrained parabolic story. Parabolic stochastic equation. So, this is different from what was naturally considered, which was just taken. I mean, you take Stratonovich and then you live on the sphere. This is different. Yes. So you spoiled Miley. Okay, so yes, I have something on previous results on the Smurchowski-Cramis approximation. So let me start from the first paper that I wrote, I mean, a few years ago with Mark Fridley. I mean, a few years ago with Mark Freidlin. And this was the simplest of all possible situations. And in that case, when you have, you see, when you don't have the constraint equation and you have a constant damping coefficient, so gamma, as in our case, is a constant gamma. So what we prove with Mark is that in the limit as mu goes to zero, you have the convergence to this parabolic stochastic equation. So in that case, it's really. Equation. So in that case, it's really, I don't know how to say, it's a really perturbative result in the sense that you take μ equals zero and you get the equation. Okay. So the problem for us was to justify this limit, but it's really what you think it should be. Okay, so it's a perturbative result. And this was the first result which somehow started a long journey studying this type of small mass limit for this type of equations. And in that case, with Mark, we proved this convergence in probability. And then Miki came. And then Miki came and we started working on this together. And so, first of all, the convergence was improved. So, it's not only in probability, but it's in LP sense. And in fact, what you have is that you can generalize this just, I mean, to more general situations. So, instead of considering one single equation, you can consider systems of equations. And the only point is that you need to have here a matrix whose eigenvalues have strictly positive real part, and you can. Positive real part, and you can do the very same analysis also with systems. But this is very important to have this strictly positive real part for the eigenvalues, because then, still with Miki, we wanted to study the case in which instead of having a friction, you have a magnetic field. So you have a rotation. And so in that case, your matrix A is not anymore of that type. And everything ruins. Things are not working. And you can prove that the limit does not exist if you take the limit. not exist if you take the limit even with an equation in dimension one in SDE dimension one you look at the noise the stochastic convolution and you see that the limit does not exist in the small mass limit and so what we did together was to regularize the problem by adding a small friction and then in the presence of this small friction we took the small mass limit and then we took the friction to zero and what we got at the limit was a stochastic PD of Was a stochastic PD of hyperbolic type. But somehow, I mean, we modified our problem because we regularized the problem. Okay. And still, I don't know what happens. I mean, yeah, this is open. And then the case of non-constant friction. Of course, it's very important to consider cases in which the friction is not constant. And so you want to consider these type of situations. And in this type of situation, things change drastically. Change drastically. Okay. And in that case, because of the interaction between the noise and this non-constant friction, there is again a noise-induced term. And so with the Guang Yuxi, we studied this case and we discovered that we have the limit to a stochastic, a modified stochastic semi-linear parabolic equation where you have the creation of this extra drift. Okay, so let's go, and this was the result that we proved with one. This was the result that we proved with one u. You see, you still have convergence in probability to this u, and now this u is this equation here. So, as you see, this is a quasi-linear parabolic equation, and this term and this term are those that you are expecting to see. But then there is this extra term which accounts of the interplay between the noise and the fact that gamma is not constant. So, here you have the derivative of gamma, and this is the noise-induced. Gamma, and this is the noise-induced term. Um, and just a few words to go back to what I was discussing before answering to Haus' question. So, if sigma is a constant, then that equation is exactly the parabolic equation, the Guasilinear parabolic equation with the Stratonovich integral. But as soon as sigma is not constant, this is not anymore Stratonovich. So, also in this case, More Stratonovich. So, also in this case, you see that in the limit, you don't get Stratonovich equation, but you get something different. Okay, and this is exactly the same phenomenon that I'm going to see in my case. And so I have a half minute, which is not very nice, but I mean, I will be very short because at this point, I think that more or less the idea should be somehow clear. So, I repeat here what is my result. This is the limit. And so, how do I get the And so, how do I get this? Okay, how do I prove this distinction? This is what you expect to have. This is the parabolic equation with constraints. Okay, so here you have the same terms, but here you have this Stratonovic integral. And this is what people have been studying. Okay, my equation is different, but this. Is different, but this, and so you see when you go from Stratanovich to Ito, you have this term, but this term is different than this other term. Okay, we proved this. This is different. They are different. Okay, and so, but this is what you get when you consider the parabolic equation with a stratonic integral. And so, these two terms, these two terms are different. And we gave examples. And we gave examples in the paper of equations with this, and this were the solution which we, I mean, we showed a concrete example where you really find the two different solutions. Okay, so these equations are really different. So somehow was a bit unexpected from us because we were thinking that we would get the equation with Stratonovich, but we got something different. Okay, and somehow this was producing a different example of an equation living on An equation living on a parabolic equation living on the sphere. Okay. And about the proof, first you need to prove a priori. I mean, this is very classical. First, a priori bounds, because you want to have tightness in the appropriate functional space. And tightness means a priori bounds. But if you look at the equation, and now we don't have time because I have to finish, you see that in order to be able to take the limit, you have this term with this. This term with this, you see, there is this term here, and you need to take the limit in this. And if you want to take the limit in this, there is no integration by parts that allows you to put back derivatives. I mean, there is this part. And this part, which is nice in many cases, because you see, is nice because it's a number, it's not a function, but it's better when it comes to take the limit because you need to be able to take the limit in this. And so, when you want to have type. And so, when you want to have tightness and you want to be able to take the limit, you need to have tightness in H1, okay, because you want to be able to take the limit there. And this is why we were forced to do a priori bounds in spaces of higher regularity. And when you touch that equation in spaces of higher regularity, you are lost. Because the presence of constant, I mean, probably you don't realize because it never worked, but this mu is very nasty because this mu is one over mu. Because it's mu is one over mu in front of the deterministic part, is one over mu in front of the noise. It's not the right scaling that allows you to close your a priori bounds. It's bad, it's nasty. And when you want to do these bounds in these spaces of higher regularity, it's a mess. I mean, I regret it so much to work on this because it took me so much time. No one appreciates because, oh, what is this? These are a priori bounce, yes. But I can tell you that this was a huge amount of time doing this bounce. Yeah, so I don't know if it's worth but. Yeah, so I don't know if it's worth, but yeah, this is, and so then you have to take the limit and identify the limit. And this is the last slide. You have to, it's not, but you see, you have this, okay, you have this, you integrate by parts and you get this. So a priori bounds allows to kill this part, mu times the velocity, this is killed. And then Straton, Skoroko, and I mean, the Prokhorov theorem allows to take. And I mean, Prokhorov theorem allows to take the limit in this part, in this part, in this part. And then there is this part, which is quite peculiar because it's mu times u. And then there is this quadratic row on the velocity. So it's a mu times the square of the velocity. And this is clearly not negligible. And this is the non-negligible term that allows me to take the limit. And this is what is producing that term. And And I skip this because, yes, but what you get is that this is this plus a remainder, and this remainder goes to zero. Okay, so this is the non-trivial part because it's mu times the velocity square, and this is producing, it's not negligible, okay? And then, thank you. Sorry, I took thank you very much for giving us away. Thank you very much for giving us a wake. Someone has any questions? Yes. So if you don't constrain for explicit on a manifold, would you do exercise that a limit being different from a non-gas? If you don't constrain, then you are in the first case that I consider with Mark Friedlin, the first original one, because in this equation that I consider, gamma is constant. Okay, so this is the very first example. And in that case, that is the case where you have. Case that is the case where you have a perturbative result. So you just take mu equals zero and then everything is fine. The fact that you have this, you see, non-trivial term that is producing the small mass limit is because you have the constraint, because gamma is constant. Of course, I mean, just to tell you that this was considered to be, at least for me, a toy model. Okay, so I was thinking that, okay, I do this very fast because, I mean, what is of interest to me is to see what happens in the small mass limit for the geometry. Mass limit for the geometric wave equation, because that is the cool thing, not this one. And but then I got stuck with this for so much time because I couldn't close my a priori bound. And so this was, but you see, there is plenty of things to be done here. What happens with the geometric wave equation when you don't have the sphere in R2, but you have really your solution? You see, you have a three-dimensional vector and you impose that it's living on the sphere of R3. Living on the sphere of R3. What can you do? This is much more complicated. Or what happens when you have the constraint, but you have also coefficient gamma, the friction that it depends on the state. So again, this is, so there is plenty of things to do. Yeah. Anyone questions? Yes. Any intuition for what goes wrong with the keys grade or what goes wrong is that the a priori bounce. Is that the a priori bounds because you see, you have your a priori bounds, and then you need to prove compactness, and you need to use all this-uh, I mean, compactness in LP spaces combined together. And when you do your argument, I mean, you have this p less than four. Yes, this is because yeah, you need to have compactness, and the bounds that you get are, yeah. We could get, we couldn't get up to p equally. We couldn't get up to p equal infinity because in order to go to p equal infinity, you need expectation of the supremum in time for some norm bounded. And I couldn't get that. I could only get supremum of the expectation of the solution with some norm finite. And this makes a difference because, yeah. So I had to work in LP spaces and not in an infinity.
