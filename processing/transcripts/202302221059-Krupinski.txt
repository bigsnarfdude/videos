Last week, this morning, Tislo, we talked about maximum stable questions of variant types in NIP theoretics. Thank you very much for the invitation. It's great to be here in this beautiful place and in this wonderful conference. So, I will be talking about stable quotients in NIP theories. The whole project started in some Project started in some sense from a talk by Anand Pilai in Lyon in 2009. And then the case of definable or tight-definable groups, maybe the existence of maximal stable quotients was proved by Pirai and Haskell. And then some questions from their paper were answered by Adjan Poltillo, who is my student, and myself. And then we, at least more recently, we solved the case of. More recently, we solved the general case of invariant types where we proved the existence of maximal stable quotients. So, this will be the topic. The general motivation is that it fits well like the null stability topic, yes. So, the point is that we would like to distinguish some parts of structures of theories which are stable or stable like. It it may be some like subsets or there there may be quotients. In this topic we talk about quotients. In this topic, we talk about quotients. And for example, such a stable quotient is like continuous logic stable object. So we have powerful tools to talk about it. Maybe we would be able to prove some, in the future, some structural results about these stable quotients in the case of groups. And this can be also seen as maybe to distinguish this maximal stable quotient may be a step towards a decomposition of a group or of an. Of a group or of an invariant type, maybe in a like a stable quotient and maybe order-like classes. So, what Pierre Simone did was the other way around. He distinguished like in arbitrary type theory a stable part and order-like quotient, and this approach goes the other way around. I don't know what to do next, I mean, because in some examples the classes are indeed distal of such a maximal. Are indeed distal of such a maximal stable quotient, but not always. So maybe some extra assumptions are needed. Okay, but let's focus on this topic. So let me recall that by a hyper-definable set we mean a quotient x divided by E, where X is a type-definable set and E is a type-definable equivalence relation of X. And such a hyper-definable set is Hyperdefinable set is said to be stable if for every A indiscernible sequence AIBI, where only the first coordinates are from our hyperdefinable sets and the second coordinates are from anywhere. So for any such sequence the type of Ai Bj over A is the same as the type of Aj Bi over A for any equivalent sum indices i distinct than j. Having the same type, there are many equivalent definitions, one of them that there is an auto-horse fixing point-wise A, which mark the spar AIBJ to AJPI. Okay, and now it is well known that hyperdefinable sets can be considered as imaginary, type-definable imaginary sets in the continuous logic, and then that's why one can just use stability in continuous. Use stability in continuous logic to give some characterizations of what it means that such a hyperdefinable set is stable. Here we do a slightly different approach. This usual one is with pseudometrics. I will present a slightly different one. So, okay, so let f let by this letter let us denote the family of all functions from x cross c to the m, where m is a natural number, to r. Natural number to R, such functions which factor through the quotient by the relation E on the first coordinate, and which can be extended to a continuous logic formula over the empty set. By this I mean a function going to R which factors through the type space, complete types over the empty set. And then so th th these basic things Basic things were written in my first paper with Adrian Pontillo. So, x over E is stable as a hyperdefinable set using the definition from the previous slide if and only if every function f from this family is stable as a continuous logic formula. A continuous logic formula. Continuous logic formula. So, this okay, so this is if and only if every such continuous logic formula is stable. And using this. Stable. And using this equivalence and the various results of Vitai and Alex of Sviatsov on stability in continuous logic, one can easily obtain the following characterizations of stability. So this is stability in the sense of continuous logic. I will not define it because it's not important for this talk. This is just for completeness and discussing this. So let X over E be a zero hyperdefinable set, then the following conditions are. Sets, then the following conditions are equivalent to stability of this hyperdefinable set. So one is that for every model of T and for every function from this family defined on the previous slide, every f type over M in the sense of continuous logic is definable. So and so this is the only point in this characterization that uses continuous logic, the others do not. So Others do not. So, this is very useful when you want to prove stability in particular examples, namely by counting types. So, there exists lambda such that for every model of T, if the cardinality of M is post-lambda, then the number of types over M in this x over E is bounded by lambda, where of course these types as type order, these are orbits over M. And then another one I will not And then another one, I will not define generically stable types in this context, but there is a natural notion extension of the notion of a generically stable type to the hyperdefinable context. And this is equivalent to saying that any global variant type is generically stable. And moreover, these equivalent conditions are... What do you mean by generically stable in this case? So I just said I don't want to talk about it because this is really something It because this is really something not crucial for this talk. But there is a natural extension from the usual context to the hyperdefinable context. And indiscernible, and these conditions imply that every indiscernible sequence of elements of our hyperdefinable set is totally discernible. And underneath, this item is equivalent to the previous one. So underneath, this is a characterization of stability of x over e. Over E. Okay, and one more characterization. So, using item five, underneath this characterization by total intercernibility of all indiscernible sequences, we can easily extend the result of alpha and COVID paterzil, the same result as written here, but the usual context to hyperdefinable context, namely assuming NIF, in the definition of stability of this hyper-definable set, which was given on the Definable set which was given on the first slide, we can choose this indiscernible sequence so that not only Ai's are from this hyperdefinable set, but also Bi's are from this hyperdefinable set. And use some constant parameter C, which by the way can also be taken from this hyperdefinable set. So under heap we have also this characterization. So this is a brief introduction with various equivalent definitions of stability of the hyperdefinable set. The hyperdefinable set. And now, a very useful, extremely useful observation for this talk made by Haskell and Philippe: that stable hyperdefinable sets are closed undertaking Cartesian products, type-definable quotients, and hyperdefinable subsets. So, why is it important to have these properties, especially Cartesian products? So, imagine the situation that you have a type-definable set X and you have two type set. X and you have two type-definable equivalence relations on it, E and F. And suppose that X divided by E is stable, and X divided by F is stable, then I claim that X divided by E intersected with F is stable. And why? Because X divided by E intersected with F can be naturally embedded into the product X divided by E cross X divided by F and it becomes a time-definable subs time. becomes a type definable subset, hyperdefinable subset of this product. And then since stability is preserved under taking product and type definable subsets, we get stability of the original quotient. And the same argument works if you have bounded family of type-definable equivalence relations such as the quotient by each of them is stable, then the quotient by the intersection is also stable. So this is all the time used in various arguments. Okay, and now, closer to the main theme of this, of this talk. Of this, of the stock, but still about some older results. So, there is this main result of the paper of Haskell and Peeli, which is the existence of the so-called stable component in the NIP context. So, let G be a group, let's say, zero type definable in the NIP theory. Then there exists a smallest type definable over some small set of parameters of Of the monster model in which we are working, and this set is not fixed, some set of parameters, such that the quotient, it is denoted by GST, such that the quotient is stable. So, there exists such an object. So, it's like a counterpart of the result about the existence of G00. Okay? And moreover, it is then very easy to see using automorphisms that, using the fact that GST is invariant under automorphisms that GST is in fact. is in fact zero type definable and the and normal. So this is the main theorem and it is also observed the version with S T0, namely there is also a zero type definable subgroup GST0 which is defined as the intersection of all relatively definable with any parameters from the most remote subgroups H of G such that the quotient is stable. Okay, so these canonical objects exist. Is there any container? objects exist. Is there any containment with G00? So I will discuss it later. Of course, always GST is contained in G00. Because if you have a bounded quotient, then it is always stable. Because whenever you take, I don't know, whatever, an infinite in the seven equal sequence, then it must be constant, because otherwise you will get unboundedness of the quotient. Yes? Okay, so now an example. Consider a monster model K of A C D F and the CDF and the additive group of the evaluation ring of this field, then it's not difficult to show that the GST coincides with GST0 from this theorem, and this is in fact definable in this context, and it is precisely the additive group of the maximal ideal of V. And then we see the quotient is then the additive group of the residue field. So it is of course stable. We know that the residue field is algebraic. The residue field is algebraic and growth is stable. And some using the Swiss GSTRM and so on, one can show that it's really GST. The GST cannot be smaller because we would get a contradiction with stability using a valuation group etc. Okay, so this is this is the canonical example and in this context and then what did you do? Uh yeah I I think here maybe it will be everything. I don't know. It will be everything. I don't know. Okay, and now there were a few questions stated in this paper. So, one was around relation, one was, for example, to find an example where these two connected components are distinct, but not because of G00, but because of some other reason. I will go to that. And another question was: one can ask generally when, as Ardio said, when GST is equal to G00. When GST is equal to G00. And it was conjectured in this paper that it's true for ominal theories and maybe for this star. So we confirmed that in this first paper with Adrian that it is true for distar. So let me go briefly through it. So let me recall that a dance, already Adrian did it today, so, but a dance in the sellable sequence I is said to be distal if already this thing deducting cuts C1 and C2. So deducting cut means that it will So, Daedalic cut means that its cofinality on both sides is infinite. So, whenever you have such daily cuts and A feels C one, in the sense that if you put insert A in place of C one, then your resulting extended sequence is in the circle book. And when B feels C2, then if you feel C1 by A and C two by B, then the whole sequence will be in the circle. Okay, so this is this. This is distality of a sequence. So we immediately see that if we have a sequence which is totally indiscernible and consists of pairwise distinct elements, that it is never distal. So the idea is that distality is at the opposite pole from being stable, from stability. And then a theory is stable if all density stable sequences are dissed out. And we say Are distal. And we say that TH and Q, T expanded by hyperimaginary sorts, is distal if all dense discernible sequences of hyperimaginaries are distal. And we checked, we showed that whenever you have a distal sequence of elements from the home sort and you take the sequence of quotients by a time-definable equivalence relation, then it is also. Then it is also distal. And from this, it follows almost immediately that if the theory is distal, then its hyperimaginary extension is also distal. Okay, because if you have a indiscernible sequence of hyperimaginaries, then you can always find an indiscernible sequence of representatives and then you just use this first part of the theorem. It seems like something very fundamental, it is, but actually the proof is not quite trivial. It uses some tricks from this fundamental paper. From this fundamental labor of Pierre, but it requires like a bit more work. Okay, and then even for MAQs. Yes, for this, even more. So, okay, then we have this color value, which solves the problem from the paper of Hasper and Pierre. For a distant theory, a hyper-definable set is stable if and only if the relation is a bounded equivalence relation. So we bounded in many classes. In particular, for In particular, for G, a type-definable group in a distal theory, GST coincides with G00. And this follows from the previous thing, one thing I already explained. If the quotient is bounded, then it is stable. But now suppose the other direction, suppose that it is unbounded, then it's very easy using Herbert Adobe or Ramsey to find an infinite an infinite indecent boost sequence in Indecerbible sequence in this quotient consisting of pairwise distinct elements. But now, by our characterization of stability of the quotient, since it is indeservable, it is totally indeservable, and this contradicts the starters as I explained before. Okay, and now the second problem was stated. Is there any example where GST is distinct than GST zero, but also distinct from G two zeros? And two zeros and g two zeros is g star. Because notice that if I do not require this inequality then it's trivial to find examples where I have this inequality. Namely for example the circle, the unit circle, then G00 is just infinitesimals and it coincides with GST by the previous theorem. And of course G zero zero in this case the infinitesimals is not an intersection of the findable groups. An intersection of definable groups. So that's why what makes this problem more difficult is this assumption and also actually this. And the example was as follows. We take R, the additive group of R expanded by this interval. This is the T is the theory of this. And N is a one can also look at N, which is R plus minus and the so called local orders. So we say that Y is greater or equal than X. That y is greater or equal than x, but only locally. So it's easy to see that these two structures are interdefinable. And we proved quantifier elimination of this structure when you expand it by constant one. And then this is our example. Then we take the advocacy of the reals and we take G the interpretation of G in the Monster model and this precisely has these properties, so it answers the question. The question, and but there is an interesting issue that if you okay, so if you do not require this, then it's pretty easy to construct the whole families with these properties where G star 0 0 is distinct than G star 0. Because then you can take like semi-direct product of the group where G S T is distinct than G 0. GST is distinct than G00 and the other group is that G0G0 is distinct than G0. And you produce examples where you have this inequality and this inequality. But these examples always have the property that G star 0, 0 is distinct than G star 0. So the problem becomes difficult if you require G star 0 0 is equal to G star 0. And in fact, we do not, because of that, we do not have any solution of this problem for a finite exponent group. For finite exponent groups. Because for finite exponent groups, G star 00 is equal always to G star 0, so some general construction which I didn't discuss, which I didn't discuss does not work, and it's not clear how to construct such an example. We have some results around it in this paper, but the problem is still open for finite exponential. Okay, and now I'm passing to the main part of my talk, namely the new paper where we Namely, the new paper where we drop the assumption that we have a group, just work in a theory. So, when we lack a group structure, then a counterpart of quotienting by a sub-group is, of course, taking a quotient by an equivalence relation. So, the question is, what would be the counterpart of the existence of this maximal stable quotient? So, first, I claim that a naive counterpart of Haskell and Piri's theorem does not work. What I mean by a naive counterpart. What I mean by a naive counterpart. So I mean if you take any non-stable set X, for example a home sort of a non-stable theory, then I claim that a finest type-definable equivalence relation on X, a stable quotient, does not exist. We cannot expect a result of this kind. Why it does not exist. So suppose for a contradiction that it exists, then by assumption there is at least one non-trivial E-class. One non-trivial E class, by non-trivial I mean that it has at least two elements, then I consider my relation E intersected with the relation of having the same type over A. So notice that this is of course a type-definable equivalence relation on X with stable quotient. Why? Because of this general thing that I said. X over E is closed. X divided by this relation of having the same type. Sorry, X divided by E is stable. Sorry, S divided by E is stable, S divided by the by this other relation is also stable because the relation of having the same type is bounded. And then by the what I said before, then this motion is stable. And this relation is strictly finer than E because it refines this class. So there is no chance for such a naive statement. So what's the less naive statement? Is the main T URL? I don't know, it's the definer. What's strictly finer because it Because it strictified it because it refines this non-trivial class. So, so look, A, here if I intersect it with this, then the class of A will be just a single top A, but before it had at least two elements. So, yes, so the the non-naive statement is this theorem. This is the main theorem of the second paper, the recent paper with Adrian. So, C always denotes a monster model of the theory in question. Of the theory in question, assume it. Then let P be an A-invariant time, global time. Assume that C is at least this number saturated. This follows from some several applications of extracting in the circle. So here there will be a problem related to it. But if we assume this sufficient saturation, then there exists a finest equivalence relation EST on P of C prime. On P of C prime, so this is the set of realizations of P in a bigger monster model C prime, in which C is small. So there is such a relation on the set of realizations which is relatively type-definable over a small set of parameters of C, of C, not of C prime, and with stable quotient. Okay, so this is our main result. And here I will discuss some ideas around the proof of this result, but first I would like to Proof of this result, but first I would like to say this question. So, notice that before this GST, the Haskell-Piri result, it was type-definable over the empty set. But here, all the time we are working over a fixed A. Everything is like defined in terms of A. So, it is natural to expect that it should be type-definable over A. But in fact, we don't know that. So, the problem is that normally you would say, okay, it is type-definable. Would say, okay, it is type-definable, so let's show that it is invariant under automorphism over A, and then it will be type-definable over A. But there is a problem. If you apply automorphism over A, then you move this set P of C prime because P was the global type over C, so it will go somewhere else, so you change even the domain of your relation. Okay, and I was thinking a little bit about it and it was not obvious to me how to Of course this set of parameters may be look be contained in C prime. Be contained in C prime? No. No. So, no, no, it is it is it is contained in C, but but the whole type P, if you apply an automorphism of C prime over A, then you move C. This is the, yeah. Okay, and then if we were able to answer this question, then we could draw the specific degree of saturation, just say a monster model, and that's it. But without it, we need this degree of saturation. We have a certain transfer lemmas before. And transfer lemmas before proving this theorem also that if you have for one monster model C such a relation EST, then it gives us a relation on any bigger monster model. But the other way around, if we have for a bigger monster model C, and you want to pass to a smaller model, we have such a transfer result, but assuming that this relation EST is type-definable over a subset of this bigger monster model C, which is of Monster model C, which is of size small comparing to the smaller model, then we have a transfer, but our proof does not produce something small with respect to the smaller model, but because we need this kind of size. Okay, so this is the main theorem, the existence of this EST. And now, okay, examples. So we studied two examples carefully in this paper. So one is the reals with the local orders. With the local orders and with translations functions by the rationals. And then we prove quantifier limitation here and we consider the complete global type determined by saying that x, that the realization of this type is infinitely far in terms of all these from all elements of the monster model. So this determines a complete type. And then we described all the equivalent type. We described all the equivalence type-definable equivalence relations on this type. So, this is essentially a quality, the relation of being infinitesimally close, and the total relation. And it turns out that EST is precisely this relation of being infinitesimally close. This is given by this local orders here. And the same is true for the more complicated theory, the group structure with all these. Structure with all these local orders. Here, the classification again, we have the quantifier elimination, we have this type P determined by these conditions, and we have the same description of EST, but here the description of all type-definable equivalence relations on P of C prime is more complicated. There are more options. Okay, and in these cases, it is the case that the quotient by EST is stable and the classes of EST are distant. So, it's a nice decouple. Are distinct. So it's a nice decomposition like quotient stable, order-like classes. But if you do suitable examples in algebraically closed-valued fields, like generic types of closed bolts, then you get a situation where the classes are not distal because they contain generically stable types. So this is something to be explored maybe in the future. What are the conditions that implies that the classes are distal, for example? Okay, and now let's talk about the proof. So this is what you mean. So is this DP minimum or not? Uh on the face of it, I'm not sure. Yeah, I would have so generalize it. Do you have a feel like that? No, it's a it's a it's a I don't think maybe there is a way to reduce it, but I would say it's a complex part. I'm not sure. Yeah. So the proof of the main theorem is a non-trivial adaptation of the proof of Haste and Pillai's result about the existence of GS. Result about the existence of GST, which in turn was based on the proof of the Chellac's proof of the existence of G00. And the key new idea in our proof is to use relatively, the so-called relatively type-definable subsets of the group of automorphisms, which were studied and used by Khushovsky, Pilay, and myself before to prove G-compartments of all amino theories, whatever it means. And another point is an application of stronger extensions. This is the number. Of stronger extensions. This is the notion from my paper with Ludomi Redker. Okay, so I would like to focus here mostly on this part related to relatively type-definable sets to see how they appear and why they play some role. So here is the definition. So, by a relatively type-definable subset of the group of automorphisms of a monster model of a given theory, what we mean? We mean a subset We mean a subset of the following form. This is the collection of all automorphisms such that a partial type π over the empty set holds on sigma of A, B, where A and B are short tuples of parameters from C. So let me explain briefly why we call it relatively type-definable. Because notice that here I can also take A to be not short but long. It will be not short but long, enumeration of the whole monster model, because the type phi anyway talks only about the bounded part of this tuple. So take A, let it be an enumeration of the monster model, and then if you have any sigma, any automorphism, then it is in one to one correspondence with the value sigma of A. Okay, so in this way you can think about all C as a subset of the Cartesian powers C. Of the Cartesian powers, monster model C to the power which is the cardinality of C. Yes, you can think of automotive such long sequences. And then you look just in this, after this translation, you just look what the type P cuts on this set of infinite tuples. So that's why we say that it's relatively type definable, because it's given by a type I. And this idea of looking in this way, but not for type definable, but relatively definable. But relatively definable subset comes from my paper with Thomas Schapetsky at Arnold Pillai, which was written before. But type-definable version appeared in my paper with Ludi and Arnold. And then, in particular, given a partial type, P of X, Y, Z, and over the empty set and tuples A, B, C, and C, we have a relatively type-definable set defined in this way, just given by this type phi. And one could say. Phi and one could say what's the reason why I write yz as they play the same role here. So I could just use one variable y instead of y z, okay? Because just B C could be substituted as a table here. So the reason is that in the proof, very often we will have a situation where x has the same length as y and these parameters a and b will be the same. So that's why I want to distinguish this y. That's why I want to distinguish this Y and Z. It will play a role. And I will use this notation sometimes instead of repeating twice AA as corresponding parameters corresponding to X and Y, I will just write 1A. The formal meaning is that it should be AA. So, using this definition. Okay, so now let's consider the context of the main theorem. Let's see and see. context of the main theorem. Let C and C prime be two monster models such that C is small with respect to C prime and let P be a global type over C which is A invariant over some small set of parameters of C and these relatively type definable subsets of Old C prime are used to prove the following lemma which is the key thing of the main theorem. So here on the previous slide I was talking about relatively tight defined Talking about relatively type-definable subsets of C, but using now this context, we will be talking about relatively type-definable subsets of C prime always. C prime is this big monster model in which we are interested here. So, the context of this lemma is the following. Let A be in C prime and let Ai be a tuple a countable tuple of elements in C prime such that A zero has the same type such that all these elements of the sequence have the same type over A. Sequence have the same type over A, and A realizes P restricted to the whole sequence. Later, you will see why it naturally appears in the context of the theorem. Now, the assumptions may look a bit technical. So, let pi of xyz be a partial type over the empty set such that for every i, if you substitute a i as a parameter z, then you get an equivalence relation on p restricted to a i, or on the most of the problem. On the most important circle. And now, assume that there is a formula, phi of x, y, z, implied by the type pi, such that for every i less than omega, we have this. The relation given as the intersection of all these instances of pi, a j, for j distant than i, but only on the set of realizations of p restricted to a less than. Of P restricted to A less than omega, then suppose that it is never contained in the formula phi with parameter AI. Then such a configuration produces IP. Okay, this is the lemma. But your Ai's are in C prime, right? Yes. So what do you mean by P restricted to Ai of C prime? Okay, so good, very good. Good point. So the point is that P is an invariant type. Okay, so it has a unique extension to a global type. has a unique extension to a global type of C prime over C prime and then I take the restriction over star. I should have said this. Yeah, yeah. The unique, of course, the invariant extension and I take its restriction. Okay, so now I would like to explain how these relatively type-definable subsets of the group of automorphisms, how they appear. So consider the context of the level. And now this type is complete over this set of parameters. Over this set of parameters. So I'm saying that the non-inclusion in the lemma, this non-inclusion, is exactly equivalent to this non-inclusion. So the difference is that here I substitute A in place of the monster model C prime. So clearly, if I have this non-inclusion, if I have an element B witnessing this, then the pair B, A will witness the non-inclusion in here. In here. On the other hand, if I have V C witnessing this non-inclusion, then since C realizes this type and A realizes this type, there is an automorphism sigma which maps C to A. And then it maps this B here, which was the witness, to sigma of B. And then the pair sigma, then the element sigma of B witnesses the lack of this equation. And then this can be expressed in terms of. This can be expressed in terms of relatively time-definable subsets in this way. So let's see one direction, the other is exactly the same. Suppose that we have this non-inclusion. Then it means I have this element B which witnesses it. So my element B, since it is in this type, it is of the it is of the form sigma o sigma of A, where sigma is an automorphism fixing the whole sigma s less than omega. less than omega. Okay, so by taking this C, I'm saying that it satisfies this condition. It is of course here because I've chosen it so that it fixes A less than omega. Then it is in here because the sigma of A, A, AJ holds because it belongs to this intersection, so that's why it's here. And since it is not in here, I get that the sigma does not belong to here. And the other direction is the same. So in this way, we get The same. So, in this way, we sort of reduce the condition to some statement about relatively time-definable subsets, and we can use them to get IP. So, this is the idea of how to do that. So, for every i greater than omega, by the last non-inclusion, this one, I can find sigma which is in here, but not in here. Okay? For every i, I can choose such as. For every i, I can choose such a sigma i. So I'm choosing it. So let sigma i be like in the left-hand side, but not in the right-hand side. And let sigma capital A denote always such a composition of this automorphism for any finite subset of omega. And then we'll have to prove something about this relatively time-definable subset. The point is that when we are working with the automorphism group and this relatively time-definable subset, that it reminds very much the Subsets, that it reminds very much the situation of a type-definable group and various type-definable subsets, subgroups, and so on. So, it's easier to think about. And then, okay, so we need to, we prove this, that there is a formula, theta x, y, z, implied by pi, such that for all i less than omega, we have such an inclusion. So, for a given i, we work with automorphism fixing i pointwise, and here we look at And here we look at the relatively time-definable set given by i and these parameters AAAI, here given by theta, here given by pi, and this is contained in the one given by phi. So this improves a kind of compactness result for this relatively tight definable subset. But anyway, we have this this property. And then we show that for any finite subset of omega, theta. subset of omega, theta of sigma iai holds if at only if i does not belong to i. And this of course means that theta has ip directly for this claim. Okay, and maybe I don't have time to explain why it holds, but one direction, okay, one direction is very easy. If i does not belong to i, then theta holds, this follows directly from the choice of sigma i sent one more observation that this And one more observation: that these sets, this on the left, and this is the same, that they are subgroups, because you can see that this is precisely the stabilizer of the E class of A. This middle one and this one, they are not subgroups, but these are subgroups. So since they are subgroups and this sigma i are from like this subgroup, then you get this implication from right to left. In the other implication, it's a similar argument. Arguments which at the end gives a contradiction with the source of that. Okay, so and now then there is lemma 2. Assume NIP, so let P be an A-invariant type and pi, let it be a partial type over the empty set and A0 a parameter such that this relation defines an equivalence relation on P restricted to A0. So in the context of the theorem, we have So, in the context of the theorem, we have an equivalence relation on P, but then there is a standard method which allows you to find some small set of parameters such that this type that defines your relation on P of C prime will in fact define the relation on P restricted to the small set of parameters. So, it naturally appears in the context of the theorem. And then, this uses this extracting in the services, then for any AI, For any AI, for any sequence which is sufficiently long, whose elements have the same type over A, we have this chain condition, kind of chain condition that for every I, there is some type of no, sorry, sorry, this is the continuation of this sentence. So there exists I such that they intercept. such that the intersection of all these guys for J distinct than I is contained in the one with the index Ai. And this the proof of this is that suppose for a contradiction that it is not true, so then for every eye we have a weakness, we have a pair, Pi Ci, which is in here but not in here. Okay? And then I take And then I'm taking these witnesses. Then I'm taking the triples, A, A I, B I, A I, B I, C I. These AI are given from the statement. I'm taking those triples and I'm extracting an indiscernible sequence over A from this using the classical result and the fact that the sequence was sufficiently long. And all the properties that, I mean, after extracting. And after extraction and using invariance of P, we get that these pairs are still satisfied what the previous pairs were satisfying on the previous slides. And also, since now the sequence is indiscernible and these elements do not satisfy pi, then there must be a formula in pi which is good for all the members of the sequence. So there is a formula implied by power. implied by pi such that all the time delegation of this formula holds. And now we can see how we get the situation from the previous lemma. We take any realization of p restricted to this sequence and then since p is a invariant and all these elements have the same type over a then we get that they have the same type over little a. Okay, because a realizes this type over these parameters so when the so when you have two parameters which have the same When you have two parameters which have the same type over A, then by invariance of our type, we have this. So this is, and then this sequence together with A and together with this type pi and the formula phi precisely satisfies the assumptions of lemma 1. You remember there was this condition, the same type over A for A satisfying this. This is exactly this, so we get IP from the previous lemma. And then one can show the main theorem. So let's add up the new. So let up the new be the degree of saturation that we stated in the theorem, and then there is a claim that reduces the situation. So we claim that if for every countable partial type over the empty set at countable tuple A0 from C such that P X Y A0 defines an equivalence relation on the height, let's say, definitely And say, the finds an equivalence relation EA0 on T of C prime with stable quotient. If for any such situation there is no long sequence of copies of A0 over A such that all the time we have this logic closure. So if there is no such long sequence, then the theorem holds. So we look at only at countable types, countable countable sequ tuples of parameters and we say that there is no long sequence of copies of L zero so that this holds. Then the theorem holds. So what's the reason for that? So let Ai be relatively type definable subsets, relatively type definable subsets of P of C prime, which are relatively type definable given by types over small subsets of C. So what I want to show So, what I want to show, I want to show that the intersection of them is bounded, is the intersection of bounded limited of them. Because then, by what I said at the beginning of the talk, then since all the quotients by EIs are stable, then the quotient by the intersection will be stable because this is the intersection of boundary value. So, we need to show that this is, in fact, intersection. The intersection of all of them is the intersection of boundary value of them. But, by standard methods, if you have a type-defined Methods: if you have a type-definable equivalence relation, then it is in fact an intersection of type-definable equivalence relation given by countable types and countably variables as parameters. And then the number of countable types and the number of these types of the countable parameters, all of this is bounded by this number, which by the choice of mu is bounded by the cofinality of mu. By the coffinality of mu. And now, by assumption of this claim, so there is a small number less than coffinality of such choices of the data here, and then the intersection is always bounded, less than mu. So, in total, you get it's easy to see the intersection of only boundedly many things, and the TRM works. And the very last thing, which I don't have time to discuss, is that we assume that the assumption of We assume that then the assumption of the claim is not satisfied, okay, and then we produce we produce the data as in lemma two, we apply lemma two and then we do some further tricks and so on to produce again the situation from lemma one and we produce IC. So thank you for your attention. Sorry for this little Questions? Have a question? Okay. So, what do you know about E-classes? Like, do they contain digital distributables or not? You mean the classes of EST? Yeah. Yeah, so the classes of EST, yes, so there would be an idea maybe that at least under some assumptions the classes should be like order-like. So the first thing. So yes, so the first thing is this. Okay, so in the two examples that I discussed today, these local orders and Discussed today, these local orders and so on, they are distal. So you really have a decomposition of an invariant type: stable portion, distal classes. But if you take a generic type, let's say, of the valuation ring, then the EST, if I'm not mistaken, will be, like in the example for groups, it will be lying in the same coset module of the maximal idea. And then taking a class, you can really easily see that there are many generically stable types inside. Generically stable types inside, so the classes will not be discarded in this example. But there is maybe a general problem. What other general assumptions should be assumed to get this? Great question. Every class contains distal disonomination signals. Ah, sorry, sorry. Okay. So in this example, yes, but in general, I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. A good question, yeah. I was talking about like a smallest quotient. Like a smallest quotient, which is this totally any ideas of exists or not? I don't know. I don't know. I would have to think. Smallest colonial. A good idea, I have ideas. Relatedly, the theory itself is distorted. So what is E? Assume that T is distorted. What does E in this case? Okay, good point, because we know that it's bounded, yes, we know that it's bounded. That is bound. Yes, so yeah. Yes. It is the smallest, yes, by this it is the smallest bounded equivalence relation which is type definable over some small subset of parameters from C, from the smallest over some, yes. But maybe it's a good testing example for this question whether the parameters A are sufficient. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, thanks. Like G00, like in this case. Excuse me? Like G00. Like G00, yes, exactly. So, um, when you stated the theorem, there was something I didn't understand about the parameter. I mean, you were looking at considering automotivism of C prime that might move C. I mean, maybe I misunderstood something, but it would mean that you all that you could consider just automorphisms of C. And so what do you mean? And so what do you think? Yeah, yeah, but but it good good good good idea, but I think I I was thinking about it, it didn't work. Yes, so so notice that that where are you? So this this relation, yes, this relation EST lives on this set, P of C prime, yes. It's a type-definable subset of P of C prime squared. Yes, but P is invariant over a sub. So if you consider a control of. So if you consider a total movement of C that fixes A, it looks like it fixes the entire problem and then by uniqueness it has to fix EST. No? No, I don't. Okay, so it looks. Why do you develop this C prime not work in C? It will not work. Thank you. That's like your question. Yeah, okay, I would have to think, I would have to focus here. But I think such very simple things do not work here, too. Thank you, sir. It's a good idea of the opposite. What's the industry? Yeah, basically a whole picture of four in each side. So I can tell you the first one in Britain actually I wrote them. And we brought them quite more general. I was going to let me display this. I mean, you should have been more with the sample system. I was glad to get it straightened out too because the whole cell is there. I know. Which uh I have a proof of this I mean also myself some comments.
