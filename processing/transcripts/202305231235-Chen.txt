So, thank you for the organizers for the invitation. So, I'm going to talk about the directive fractional Gaussian fields and the Serpenski gas case. This is a joint work with Fabrice here. So, well, from yesterday's talk by Senior and Sinia and today's talk by Jing. Maybe you may have a rough idea on what I'm going to talk about and part of my motivation. Okay, so but anyway, let's still start from the very beginning. So well, first of all, I want to talk about the fractional Gaussian fields Euclidean space. So this has already talked by Simin about this survey, the recent survey by Lloydia C. Field Schwing and Walsingham. So on Euclidean space, one can understand the fractional Gaussian field in the distribution sense in this way. sense in this way for which this data is a laplacian and the w it's a white loyal and so here well we can understand it in this sense for okay so for f in this word space then or xs f can S F can be defined in this way. So next, I wanted to point out some special classes of Gaussian fields. So when S equals zero, it's white lines. When S is one half, it's Gaussian free field. When S is N over four, it's log correlated field. Correlated field. Also, when S is between this range, so then the Gaussian radium value X, Gaussian Rand field X would admit a density which is the fractional sorry okay. Okay, it's a fractional Brony motion and the host parameter here H is 2s minus n over 2. So can you show again the your expression your okay with the parameter S? Sorry about this where is the S so S is here and here Up here. Okay, thank you. So, my talk will mostly focus on how analytic tools come to help us understand the probabilistic object. So, it's like more flavor of analytic sense. Okay. Let's continue. Well, on Euclidean space, as you have also seen in the talk of Jing, so as Heisenberg group, so the Fourier transform is one of the main technicals. And the fractional power of Laplacian, we can think of it as a multiplier in this way. In this word space. So, well, later on, I will explain factors where we don't have the Fourier transform, how we understand this fractional power. So, also, I wanted to mention some work in other settings rather than Euclidean space. So, well, so these are some more recent work. So, in a paper of Zach Gerbom, he works on remaining manifolds without a boundary for which there is a spectral decomposition of the Laplacian, or there is some spectral assumptions. And then And then so a lot of work is about the discrete approximation of Gaussian free fields on compact manifolds, for which one part of my talk will also discuss about the discrete approximation in the fractal case. And then we have already seen the talk of for senior in the journal. So, in the joint work of Fabrican, senior work on the Lohmann fractional Gaussian field. So, there is also a recent preprint here. So, while the authors discuss fractional Gaussian fields in more general Riemannian manifolds, however, their main focus is. However, their main focus are some other topics, which is not very relevant. Okay, so a girl and the motivation. So, well, similarly as the Leuman case, oh, a girl is to Okay, I'm going to understand this object fractional power of Laplacian um the white lines for which this Laplacian would be um the direct lay Laplacian. Dirichlet Laplacian. And well, one motivation we have already learned is to study the SPDEs and factors. And this is an ongoing work, as mentioned by Jing, with all these causes. And another motivation is to study the maximum of discrete derivative fractional Gaussian fields and factors. Gaussian fields and factors. So that's why we are also interested in the discrete approximation in the talk. So and the next I wanted to discuss a little bit history about the study on fractals. So well people are always very interested in fractals. So in early 1980s or even 1980s, or even before. So, mathematical physicists typically study the diffusion of fractals. Well, it's lots of unreal fractals, but rather than works on fractal graphs. And so, from later 1980s, dying the rigorous alloy. Allows this on two factors has been studied. First, by June Kigami, so and then there are some main contributions like by Barlow Peckins and so on. So after the 1919s, so then there are lots of study for the detailed information. Detailed information about the heat colour and the heat semi-group. Some relatively regular exact factors like Sippinsky, gascade, or COVID from different but complementary viewpoints using harmonic analysis, Dirichlet forms, and probability theory. So here is a passion list of people who It's a passion list of people who contribute in this study. So, however, at this moment, we know much more about Sippinsky gasket than Sippinsky carbide. So, that's why in our study, we focus on Sierpinski gasket as a typical example. Well, so we will focus on the Well, so we will focus on the Pency gasket. So, as also mentioned in the talk of Senior, we can actually work on more general settings. For instance, in the melodograph by Martin Ballo, so he discussed about this general setting, like fractional metric space with fractional diffusion. It's typically a metric space. metric space which is alpha regular with a geodesic and also it admits a good heat color which satisfies sub-Gaussian estimate I will discuss later. And we have already learned what is separate gas kit. So this can be obtained as the As the contraction of the triangles. And okay, so we have already learned the host of dimension. We consider a normalized host of dimensions so that the measure for this pins k gas k takes one and for And for an n-level triangle, they measure 3 to the power minus n. And that is, so the host of dimension, it's log 3 over log 2. Okay, and also we can consider the discrete approximation of. Approximation of the gasket. Here are three steps about the discrete approximation, and we can continue. And we are interested in the Laplacian and this Penske gasket. So I will focus on the Dirichlet Laplacian. So I just write my slides. I just write my slides from the discrete Laplacian, not from the Dirichlet forms. So well, if we consider this delta M, which means the probabilistic Laplacian on the M level of triangles. So here there is a There is a parameter, there is a scaling 5M, which is related to the resistance form. And here I didn't point out P is not in the boundary, I mean the three vertices of the bigger triangle. And the difference compared with the Leuman case is that we consider We consider the Dirichlet boundary condition, which f is zero on the boundary. So this Laplacian is on this Pency gasket, we can think of it as the limit of this data here. I didn't specify the domain. didn't specify the domain here anyway, so that is a good space for us. Okay. So, and well, another important tool I want to mention is about the spectral theory because we don't have a Bourier transform. So this is we are This is what we are learning right now. So we have a sequence of learn negative eigenvalues for which we mean number one is the first positive eigenvalue. And for Gu Sima and Sima, they approve. Proved that the following result for the county function of the eigenvalues. So, this tells us somehow we have an estimate of the eigenvalues. Like this eigenvalue would be roughly z to the power dw over dh. And this dw is And this DW, it's the so-called worker dimension, which describes the exit time, the rate of the exit time for the brain emotion on the Pinski gasket. Yes, so for this Pinski gasket case, it's log 5 over log 2. However, let's Of a logger two. However, like for the Pisk Cabit, we don't know the exact number. We only know it's a lumber larger than two from the counting function. Yeah, yeah. So it's uh approximately this size. Also, is there a which might be a periodic? My data CPO to reality? Oh, I didn't check the details of their proof. I think it's about the structure of the virus mechanic. I'm using the violence for the first colour church, right? Yeah, yeah, but it is coming from when you were able to. So I can make I can buy I can't say what it's doing. Okay, so well on two other tools. Stop goes young head colour bonds. So this is flammable ballo packings. Another thing which is very crucial for us is Which is very crucial for us, is the herd regularity of the hip color. So, this is also essentially from ballopins and was proved in a paper with Fabrice, Patricia, and other co-authors. So, although the structure of separate gas categories is very rough, but Very rough, but we do love some regularity of it. Okay, so and also we don't have a swath space on separate gas category, so then we try to mimic a swarth space from the spectral theory, which is defined in this way. Okay, and we can Okay, and we can consider the dual space here. So this phi n is the end eigen function. Okay, so with all this preparation, then we can see that indeed for the orange. For the all range of S larger or equal than zero, so there exists centered Gaussian random field S on this distribution space in the distribution sense such that the covariation is this integral representation. Integral represented by the fractional power of Laplace. And let me be more a little bit more explicit. So, well, we can write it in terms of for the race colour. And the race colour is easier than the Royman case because we don't lead to Because we don't need it to do malice one from the heat semigroup. So that's the risk colour. That's low extra term. So from the heat color estimate, we can have some, we can learn something about the risk colour. So in particular, So in particular, a very interesting case is when S is dh over to dw. So they estimate its log of the distance. So that's like a log correlated field on Euclidean space for which it's and for in our case it's 4 in our case, it's dh over 2 dw, but in the Euclidean space, dh is n and dw is 2. So this case. Okay. So we also proved that when S so the density field exists. Density field exists if and only if when S is larger than the H over 2 dw. And so then we wanted to know the regularity of the density field. So for the density field, we can either understand it as It as in this integral, okay, for which the S is the green color and W is the gospel. So another understanding is that we can think of it as sorry. Sorry. On Flourmode they on egging functions Well, WG is AID Gaussian random variables. Well, so as I said, we are interested in the regularity of the density. So we are interested for the also when the density does not exist. So we are also consider the soberly frequency. Consider the sobleaf regularity and again the sober space is defined from the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Also the dual. Okay, so here what we know when us it's not when the density does not exist. We do Exist. We do know a little about XS. And when S is larger than dh over 2dW, so then the density is in this H alpha. Okay. So of course, all this ruin is it comes from the size. Of the size of the eigenvalues. So I shouldn't see and also that's one of our main results for the regularity, for the hurdle regularity. Well, it's so the Unified form is The unified form is this way, it looks a little bit complicated. So when S it's not one minus dh over 2dw, so the expressions are a little bit different. So that's essentially from the regularity results of Result of the Gaussian of the race colour. And I wanted to point out a little bit about the idea behind. So Senia has already mentioned it's the entropy method. And then another, in order to apply the entropy method, we need to know the further regularization for the risk. Position for the risk colour. So that's what we can obtain. So this is essentially from the regularization of the heat semigroup. So I want to next I want to uh to To briefly talk a little bit about discrete fractional Gaussian fields. So, well, that's essentially from the definition of the K-Gaming-Laplacian, we can try to understand the discretization. So each So at each level of they discrete the pinski gasket, then we can there also exist a family of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for which this eigenvalue, the first eigenvalue will at the end converge. We are at the end converge to the first eigenvalue of supensive gas case. So, and then we also have a corresponding eigenfunctions. So, then one can define the discrete race color from the sum of this term from the any values. Eigen values and eigenfunctions. Okay. In what way do the eigenfunctions of the approximating sequence converge to the eigenfunction of this? Well, so the eigenvalues they do converge. Yeah. So for the eigenfunctions, I suspect it also converges for the first one at least. What sounds would they converge? Like L3 noise or point one or L2 or something else? I'm not question maybe L2 should work. Okay, so then the discrete fraction logaus and field is defined with in this way, so with mean zero and the covariance matrix of this discrete risk. Discreate risk fact. Yeah, of this discrete risk colour. So similarly, we can also define this discrete Gaussian random variable, which is Which is which is a disc so which is a discrete version as here. Okay. So then so then we can understand this fraction loss. This fractional Gaussian field in this way, for which here it means the lumber of all the vertices in VM. So in the distribution sense, so this would work. Work. And so, roughly speaking, our result says that, well, this XSM, it converges to XS. And the main idea behind is to show the convergence. To show the convergence of the character rustic function. So, and a fellow remark is that actually we can also consider the convergence in the Sobolev space, in the dual of the Sobelief space. In the dual of the sob leaf space. So with some range of alpha, and this alpha depends on the size of the eigen functions. However, it's not as good as the classic case for these parameters. Maybe that's because while we still Well, we still don't know that much the pinscape as kit. So I think I stop here. Okay, are there any questions coming? Yes, yes. Yes, I want to at least it's so the description is there is there a way to perhaps con obtain the result for the Roben Robin conditions? Robin conditions, in which case you will have both at the same time. Okay, so uh yeah could you construct could it be constructed by proven robin conditions on the Dirt forms and then see whether that hasn't been done? Way to unify would be it is self-adjoint, and uh self-advocacy and function. Such self-adjoint can do include maybe one of these or the two can scale, it's still Yeah, you talked about studying the maximum of this process. I'm not sure I've seen any result concerning it's difficult. So that's one of our motivation when we first. One of our motivation when we first studied because you know, so in the work of Sini and Fabrice, the work on the Leuman case, so that it's largely to consider the Diricher case. But at that time, our main focus at the very beginning is to study the discrete approximation. But to study the discrete approximation, the motivation is to study that. But at this point, we still f feel it's But is there a conjecture about how it should behave, the expected value in terms of S or something? Yeah, the LDP yeah about the torus and but uh it's still at the it's still at the very beginning and we believe that maybe the CRPC ascet is too complicated and it might be easier to start with the VCLEX set which is a tree that is might be easier to consider this problem on trees yeah Yeah, yeah, that should be an open problem. Okay, so are there any more questions? Someone, if that's not the case, we thank Lee and all the speakers of this morning. And yes, you can interview. Is there a question in the Zoom? Yep. Sorry. No, it's okay. I tried to like, yeah, sorry. I didn't hear the discussion about the Robin boundary condition because I heard the question, because I thought there was some results on some either fractal domains or even fractals, but I don't know. Even fractals, but I don't know what was the conclusion. The conclusion was that it is not quite clear what the definition of the Roving condition should be. I can pass this to Fabrice to repeat what he said. Okay. Yeah, we're saying that we could consider several self-adjoint extensions of the Kigamila placian. So one of them is Neumann. One of them is. Uh, one of them is like what Kigamila Spashan is not essentially self-adjoint, so it admits infinitely many separate points. Maybe one of them could be the Robin, but I don't know if it has been done in the literature or not, the Robin case or not. Yeah, I just remember that I think some of the Italian group did something. But I might be wrong. Yeah, anyway, thanks. Thank you. Okay, so now if there are no more questions, we finally thank everybody and go for lunch. Thank you.
