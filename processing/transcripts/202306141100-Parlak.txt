 Okay, here we go. All right, welcome back. So, for our next talk, we're happy to have Anna Parlock from UC Davis, and she's going to tell us about phases of the Thurston norm ball dynamically represented by multiple distinct flows. Okay, does it work already? Do I have to turn it on? Okay, so thank you very much for the introduction and for inviting me here to Mexico. So yeah, the title of the conference is Not Surfaces and Free Manifolds. There won't be any Nots featured in the There won't be any NOTS featured in my talk, but there will be both surfaces and free manifolds, so I hope that's still okay. Oh, it doesn't work. Wait, I'm clicking next. Oh, now it works. Okay, so the main thing I want to communicate is already stated in the title of my talks. Already stated in the title of my talk. So I think it's also okay to just give a correct statement on the first slide. So essentially, I want to tell you about a recent discovery I made, namely that the non-fibrid phase of the Thurston normal can be dynamically represented by multiple distinct flows. And essentially the whole talk I will spend trying to explain what does it mean and giving some historical background for where this kind of problem comes from. So essentially, all of this is motivated by. Essentially, all of this is motivated by the work of David Fried and Lee Mosher from the 80s and 90s, where they show that pseudo-muscular flows on closed three manifolds are sort of quite tightly connected with the Thurston norm on the second homology group of those three manifolds. So that's sort of the motivation. Okay, so I'm not assuming that you know what are pseudonosa flows or anosa flows. I'm not going to give precise definition, but just some sort of intuition. Intuition. So, first, let's say, and also of flows, they are kind of flows on closed three manifolds, which have like an interesting stretching, contracting dynamics, by which I mean that there is a pair of foliations in a three-manifold. The foliations intersect transversely along flow lines. And if we look at two flow lines contained in a single leaf of one foliation, then they are forward asymptotic, which means they are getting closer to one another in positive time. One another in positive time. And if we look at the leaves of the other foliations, then the two flow lines contained in a single leaf are backward asymptotic, which means they get further apart. So if you have never seen that before, a toy example that you might have in mind is this flow on R3. R3 is, of course, not a closed pre-manifold, but at least in this case, I can give you like exact formula. So a flow, first of all, is like, you know, a smooth action of additive group of reals on a space. So here I'm acting by T on. So here I'm acting by t on x, y, z, and I'm sending it into e to the t times x, e to the minus t times y, z plus t. So essentially, when I go up, the x coordinate gets exponentially expanded and y coordinate gets exponentially contracted, right? So this is the kind of dynamics I'm talking about, but like on closed manifolds. So pseudo-Amossov flows are much more frequent. The dynamics is similar, so we also have the stretching-contracting behavior. Have the stretching-contracting behavior, but the difference is that this time foliations are allowed to be singular. So, for anal flows, foliations locally look just like foliation of like R3 by planes. And here we might have these special types of singularities, which we call like k-prongs. In this case, this picture shows a three-prong. So, essentially, there's like finitely many closed orbits of the flow where the foliations, you know, don't look like foliation by planes, but it's. Don't look like foliation by planes, but instead we have like multiple leaves meeting at this one single orbit. So this is supposed to be a closed orbit. So in this picture, you should imagine that like the top is glued to the bottom, possibly with some rotation. So that's essentially the difference between Anosov and Pseudo-Anosov. So pseudo-Anosov's have singular orbits and the foliations are singular and they are much more frequent. Okay, so we're like, do these things even exist? So of course, yes, otherwise we wouldn't be talking about them. Wouldn't be talking about them. And the simplest, let's say, non-trivial example of a pseudo-Anosso flow you can come up with would be suspension flow on the mapping torus of a pseudonosov homeomorphism. So like more generally, like you can have a closed surface and pick any homeomorphism to build a three-manifold, right? A fiber three manifold by taking the product of the surface with the interval and then gluing the top copy here, the top copy to the bottom copy via this homeomorphism. The bottom copy via this homeomorphism. And these manifolds always have a nice flow, which we call the suspension flow, which is just the unit speed flow in sort of the circle direction, right? So like these red things that are drawn here are supposed to like represent orbits, right? So you maybe start at some point in the bottom surface, you go up at unit speed until you hit the top surface, and then your homeomorphism puts you into another point in the bottom surface, and you just continue like this forever. So this is a suspension flow. So, this is a suspension flow, which is not always pseudo-anosov. But if the gluing homeomorphism is pseudo-anosov homeomorphism, then the flow is pseudo-anosov. So, that's just an example. And it's super important to mention that not all pseudo-anosov flows are of this type. So, what I mean by this type, I mean here, there's this special property that there is a surface which intersects every flow line transversely and with positive sign, right? Because namely, the fiber, right? It's sort of every flow line. Fiber, right? It's sort of every flow line comes from a point on the surface. So there are pseudo-announced flows which we call non-circular, which do not have that property. So, like, whatever surface you look at in the manifold, either there are like negative intersections or there are only positive intersections, but some orbits are just missed. So, yes, studying pseudonus of flows is not about studying fibered manifolds. In particular, they exist on non-fibered manifolds. And I would say that actually fibered And I would say that actually fibrid case is pretty well understood. And right now, people mostly look at non-fibrid case. And I'm also going to talk about non-fibrid case. Okay, so these are the kind of flows that we are looking. Well, not exactly, but these kind of dynamics we are looking at. And yeah, so I mentioned that there is a connection between these flows and the Thurston norm. So the Thurston norm is something introduced by Thurston, of course. So given a compact So, given a compact-oriented hyperbolic three-manifold, he defined a norm on the second homology group of that manifold real boundary. So, yeah, and he proved various properties of that norm. The properties that are important for me is that the unit norm of that norm is not like round, but it's a polytope, right? So it has vertices, faces, facets, and so on. But I think here we have some example in Betty number two case, some hexagon. We can have a third normal like this. We can have a Thurston normal like this. And Thurston also observed that if a three-manifold is fibered, then the homology class of the fiber must lie over a top-dimensional phase. So it cannot lie over a vertex, for instance, unless we are in bed number one, maybe. So yeah, homology classes of fibers lies over two-dimensional faces. And moreover, in this case, every other primitive In this case, every other primitive integral class lying in the interior of the cone on the space must be represented by a fiber. So these things are called fibered faces precisely for this reason. So if you look at this picture, I would use a pointer, but I'm a little bit scared, so I'm not going to do it. But like in this picture, like we have this pink thing. So this is supposed to represent a fibrid cone. These green dots are supposed to represent integral classes inside, like in the interior. So Thurston says that every green dot, well, if... Says that every green dot, well, if it's primitive at least, can be represented by a fiber of a vibration over the circle. So, in particular, if Betty number one is greater than one and the manifold is fibered, then it fibers in infinitely many distinct ways. So, yeah, these are these fibered phases. And the reason I'm mentioning them, even though I said I'm mostly interested in the non-fibered case, is because the first connection between pseudonosophos and Thurston normals proof exactly for these phases. For these phases. And I want to sort of give you like a historical background for this. So the theorem is a theorem of Fried, only for closed manifolds, that if you had, you know, given the fibrid phase of the Thurston normal, there is a unique pseudo-Anosso flow such that any fiber from the interior of the cone on that face is a cross-section to that flow, meaning that this is the surface which intersects every flow line transversely with positive sign. With positive sign. So let me maybe explain what this thing actually means. So we have these green dots, right? So every green dot is a vibration. So we know we have these suspension flows, right? So for every green dot, you have a suspension flow, which is Suranosov if the manifold is hyperbolic. But this theorem actually tells us that all these flows are actually the same, right? So even though the fibers are of different genus, the monodrome is different, the gluing homeomorphism. Is different, the gluing homeomorphism, the flow is actually the same up to isotope and reparametrization. So, if you are a dynamicist, maybe you wouldn't say this is the same flow because then you care about parametrization. But if you're a topologist and you only care about topological properties of the flow, then that's one flow. So there's like a unique flow associated to a fibrous phase. The theorem still holds for bounded manifolds, but there's some technical issue. Like we don't really talk about Suranosa flows on bounded manifolds, but blown-up flows, but nonetheless, this is still. About blown-up flows, but nonetheless, this is still true that there's like a unique flow associated to a fibridge phase. And now, of course, we want to say something about non-fibrid case. So, the first person who sort of looked at this was Lee Moder. So he wanted to kind of generalize the work of Free to the non-fibered faces. Of course, you can do this exactly because for non-fibered faces, the homology classes are not fibers. So we cannot talk about cross-sections because being cross-section to the flow is the same as being the fiber of a vibration. Same as being the fiber of a vibration. So he kind of weakened the condition, and he was just looking at surfaces which are transverse to the flow or actually almost transverse. But for simplicity, let's talk about transversality. So this just means that, you know, your surface can miss some orbits, but if it does not, then it meets it with positive sign, right? So some orbits can be missed. So Mosher sort of asked himself a question, I guess. I don't know. I never talked to him about this, but I guess. Talk to him about this, but I guess that he asked this question: whether it's possible to find a flow for a non-fibrid phase. And if yes, he would say that this flow dynamically represents that phase. So he came up with this definition of dynamical representation and, of course, proved some stuff about this. So yeah, so the results are, first of all, he showed that there are non-circular flows which dynamically represent non-fibrid phases. So like the definition makes sense. There are objects that satisfy the definition. Satisfied the definition. And he, in fact, also found sufficient conditions on a Suranos of flow to dynamically represent a phase, also in the like non-fibrid case. But like, if you compare this result with results of Freed, you can see that like it's kind of, you know, less is said, right? Because if we sort of rephrase the theorem of Freed using this new terminology, we would say that for every fiber phase, there is unique flow which dynamically represents it. Dynamically represents it. And here there's nothing like we don't have a statement that there is a flow, or we don't have a statement that there is a unique flow, right? Nothing like this. So there are these extra question. So question number one, which is, I don't know, maybe important, is like, is there such a flow for every phase? And I would say it's still open, although I kind of feel like I should comment on this. So there is a theorem which is attributed to Lee Moser and I guess Dave Gabby that That you can always find a pseudo-anosa flow which is transverse to like some homology class, like you know, certain or minimizing surface of some homology class. But dynamical representation is much more restrictive, right? Like it has to be transverse to everything, right? So like if bedding number is greater than one, then we are just not just looking for flows which are transverse to this one surface, but like all of them, right? So that's why I claim this is still open, as far as I know, because some of the flows. As far as I know, because some of the flows that are constructed using these Gabai motor technology do not satisfy the conditions of Limosure. So that's why I would say it's too open. So I'm not going to talk about this. I haven't approached this. Question number two would be: well, if a face is dynamically represented, is it dynamically represented in a unique way? Right? So can we have multiple flows which represent the same face? Multiple flows which represent the same phase. And if you remember, what's the title of my talk? You know that the answer is yes. We might have that. So I know this because I just, you know, I was just looking for concrete examples and I managed to find them using varying triangulations, which are like combinatorial tools to study Suranosa flows, which I will talk a little bit more later. But first, I want to state maybe the third question, which I think is very interesting, is that once we know that the same faith But once we know that the same phase can be dynamically represented by the same, by two different flows, the question is: how are these pros related? Can we say anything about, you know, can we get one flow from the other or something else? So, of course, ideally, I would like to have a theorem which describes all possible ways in which two different flows can represent the same phase. And I don't have that. But, you know, I found like many examples and I was just staring at them. And I could recognize that many of these examples, but Recognize that many of these examples, but not all, are kind of similar, that there is something systematic going on. And this sort of led me to defining this operation, which I call the viring mutation, which because I work with varying triangulations, not with the flows directly. And this is some sort of operation which takes one varying triangulation and spits out another. And it turns out that sometimes you can build two different flows representing the same phase and they differ by this operation. But not all cases, right? So this is not. But not all cases, right? So, this is not a complete result. Okay, so what are these things? I generally avoid giving a definition of a varying triangulation in a talk because these are just triangulations which satisfy multiple combinatorial conditions. And people like, you know, it's not a good talk material. But I will tell you what they are good for instead of giving the definition. So they were introduced by Ian Eagle originally for Originally for fibered free manifolds, so only for suspension flows. But then people quite quickly realized that these things also exist on non-fibrid manifolds. So there was this question like, you know, where do they come from? And eventually, Ian Eigle and François Garito, they proved that you can always build a variant triangulation from a Sudanosov flow. Or more precisely, you have to have like a triple or, I don't know, a manifold, a pseudonosov flow on this manifold. Manifold, a pseudonym flow on this manifold, and a finite and non-empty collection of closed orbits of that flow, which has to include all singular orbits. And there is some technical condition which is no perfect fit, which I'm not going to explain. But essentially, it restricts how the orbits of the flow behave. But you can always find a collection of orbits so that the flow relative to this collection of orbits does not have perfect fits. So this is not like super restricted. So having that data, you can build this very special kind of triangulation. Build this very special kind of triangulation, which is called a virant triangulation, but it lives on a different manifold. It lives on the complement of my set lambda. So virion triangulations, in particular, ideal triangulations of casp3 manifolds, always, and always hyperbolic. So if your manifold has a varying triangulation, it has to be hyperbolic. So yeah, the thing about these varying triangulations is that they, from their combinatorics, you can sort of restore the flow. So we would say that. Sort of restore the flow so we would say that it combinatorially encodes the flow and moreover it's canonical for the triple m flow and the collection of orbits. So this is like nice, right? Because like we have only one object, there's no wiggle room, there's no equivalence classes, nothing. There's just one object and that's it. So that's of course good. And also you can go in the other direction. So from a varying triangulation and Dane filling data satisfying some mild conditions, you can build a Sudan also flow on the Dane fill manifold. Manifold. So I hope that these two results sort of convince you that you can use varying triangulations to study pseudonosophales combinatorially. And the reason we would like to do this is because, well, like combinatorics usually simplifies many things, right? So for instance, viring triangulations are like finite combinatorial objects. So they are easier to study than flows directly. So for instance, in the context of this project, when I was looking how the two Project, when I was looking how the two flows which represent the same phase are related, I was really just staring at the triangulations. And it was easier for me to like find, you know, what's the connection between triangulations that connecting the flows directly. Secondly, you know, there's like a lot of software or good software to study triangulations already. So if you want to do experiments, you don't have to like write your code from scratch. You can like rely on Snappy, you can rely on Regina. You can rely on Regina and just maybe add some extra code, but you don't have to start from scratch. So I use Snappy and Regina quite a lot to sort of get some information. And also sort of in this context, many computations boil down to basic linear algebra once you have the triangulation. So for instance, you know, given a flow, I might be interested in like finding the cone of transverse surfaces or homology classes of transverse surfaces. So if I have a very triangulation, So, if I have a variant triangulation, it's a simple computation. Just, you know, really basic linear algebra. And if it's coded up, it's like, you know, it's a second, right? So, that's like advantages. There's one disadvantage that I think I should mention, namely, you know, we change the manifolds, right? We have to drill. And sure, we can go back by the infilling, but the problem, at least in this project, is that I was looking for examples also of anosof or pseudo-anoso flows on closed manifolds, and I wanted them to be hyperbolic. And the thing is, like, if I Hyperbolic. And the thing is, like, if I didn't fill, I sometimes lose hyperbolicity. So, some examples that I thought are okay actually were not okay because they would not give me like a genuine pseudonosophoson hyperbolic closed manifolds. So, this is something that to keep in mind that like there's this problem of drilling. You change the manifold, it's a little bit pain in the neck. But nonetheless, they are good. So, yeah, so I mentioned that I managed to like find examples of flows which represent the same phase and they differ by. The same phase, and they differ by something which I call the Viring mutation. And it's kind of hard to say what that is without telling you what is a Viring triangulation because you know it's an operation which takes one Viring triangulation and spits out another. But I'll try to give you some sort of intuition of what that is. So this is some sort of specialization of a normal mutation. So normal mutation, I would just say it's just you have a three-manifold, you have a properly embedded surface in that manifold, you cut along it, you get a sutured manifold with. You get a sutured manifold with two copies of that surface in the boundary, and then you just fix some homeomorphism of that surface to glue your manifold in a different way. And you get another manifold typically. Sometimes you get the same manifold, but it's of course very non-generic. But more generally, you get this new manifold, which I call the Newton manifold. So, viring mutation is a combinatorial operation. So, it's a little bit different because I really cut along branched surfaces and not like unbranched surfaces. Like unbranched surfaces. So it's actually different, but the sort of goal is to perform a mutation in a way so that you cut along surface which is transverse to the flow, and you do only those mutations which ensure that after the mutation, the mutant manifold also has a pseudonoso flow transverse to a surface of the same topological type. So that's sort of the goal. That's not how it's defined, but that's the goal, right? So sort of some special kind of mutation where the property of having some sort of The property of having some pseudonyms of flow is preserved. And of course, there are some many, many conditions that have to be satisfied here, which I'm not going to talk about. So, okay, so why am I even mentioning this? So I did find examples where the two flows representing the same phase differ by mutation, and some examples where they don't differ by mutation, and I haven't figured out how they differ. But I was a little bit unhappy because it turns out. Happy because it turns out that all the examples that do differ by mutation, after the infilling, they give me toroidal manifolds, right? So I was not happy because I leave the world of hyperbolic manifolds. So yeah, I was a little bit unhappy about this, but it turns out in the end that actually these examples are nonetheless interesting. So I found that accidentally actually, because it turns out that many of them give counterexamples to some old theorem in dynamics, namely classification theorem. Namely, classification theorem of, and also flows on so-called Bonati-Langevin manifolds. So, I haven't heard about this theorem when I was writing this paper, but somebody like made me realize this, that I mean, someone actually was suggesting that my paper is wrong because it's in contradiction with this paper, but it turns out that the other paper is wrong. Anyway, so I have like three minutes left, so I'm not sure how much I will be able to talk about this, but essentially, This, but essentially, so Bonati-Langevin manifolds are just very simple graph manifolds, right? You just have an orientable circle bundle over a twohold RP2, which is sort of like pictured more or less here. This octagon and like A1 is identified with A3, but like with a twist, and A2 is identified with A4, but with a twist, and you get this orientable circle bundle, and you get two tori. And if you like identify them using some homeomorphism of the torus, you get a graph. Some homeomorphism of the torus, you get a graph manifold. And the reason they are called BL manifolds is because in 94, this was like one of the first, like Bonati and Langevin constructed, like explicitly constructed an anosoph flows on one of these manifolds. And then Barbod generalized the construction. Essentially, he showed that most of them have anosoflows. And then there's this wrong theorem, which says that actually, if we are talking about anoso flows on these manifolds, there's only one. Flows on these manifolds, there's only one which is transverse to this unique source on this manifold. So, um, so the thing is, like, it turns out that these homeomorphic bring mutants that I keep getting give me two different flows on these manifolds very often. And the reason I know they are different flows is because the defoliations of one of the flows are transversally orientable and the other are not. So, the flows cannot be topologically equivalent. So, this is actually immediate that they are different. And, yeah. Different, and yeah, so it turns out that I completely accidentally got these counterexamples. Uh, so yeah, I think like the correct statement of the wrong theorem is probably that there are two flows on these manifolds and not one, which was, you know, not really a big difference. But anyway, so yeah, that's kind of what I got. And the reason I'm mentioning this is that I kind of have impression that like some people like don't really value this kind of computations or like experimental mathematics because you, you know, Experimental mathematics, because you're just checking stuff, right? But it turns out that maybe it's important to check stuff, right? So that we don't keep making things up, right? Like, you know, proving theorems that are actually wrong. So yeah, that's what I got. So thank you for your attention. Is there something that I have to switch here? For different flows learning,       I are more questions.
