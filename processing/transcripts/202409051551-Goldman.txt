The vertices or sorry, label edges with my j. I'm going to add another condition here. I'm going to use a different convention. I think we've mostly been using what's called the presentation graphic, but I'm going to use the think and diagram convention, where if there's no edge between i and j, then we set And then we set Mij equal to 2. So Mij can actually be in 3 and including 8. Okay, so with this information, we just define the same group the same kind of way, we take the verses for the argument group. We take the vertices and the only relations are these commutation equations. Sorry, not commutation. Okay. So this is familiar, but what I'm going to But what I want to do now is consider some extra information. So we want to label, is that visible? Not great. Not very. The vertices with some integers p sub i, which can be. integers p sub i, which can be 2 to infinity. And then I'm going to define the Schecker group on this diagram to be the same information here, same information here, but now i to the pi is set equal to 1. So this is uh should look pretty familiar. For example, if For example, if all pi are equal to 2, then the Shepherd group is Oxford group. And I guess I should write down there's no relation to PI is infinity. And same here, if I just look at the relation. View help with deep rotation. Okay, so why might one want to look at this? There are a couple of motivating groups that we can think about. So Alex mentioned that we can sort of think of art groups as like cousins of mapping class groups. So the kind of most obvious thing is: well, we're quotienting by powers of generators. Of generators. So it's sort of like quotients of mapping class groups by powers or daintwidths. So some results here that Let's see. Damani Hagen in Etienne showed that they're asylum hyperbolic and Ericstock Again. And Martana and Systo 24 show that they're HH genes in some cases. Okay, so this is kind of, you know, a semi-obvious, obvious kind of relation here. But they also come historically. But they also come historically from complex reflection groups. So we think of, you know, Coxley groups come from radial flexion groups. Then some Shepard groups, mainly the finite ones, come from Come from some complex reflection groups, namely the symmetry groups of what are called regular complex polytopes. So there's a short list of finite Shepherd groups that are not Coxeter groups. So of course all the Coxeter groups are finite Shepherd groups. This I really mean the Coxer groups that are not, sorry, the Shepherd groups that are not Coxer groups all satisfy these because of course there's some finite Coxer groups that are not symmetry groups of regular polytopes. Symmetry groups of regular polytopes. So I can just write it down really quick because it's pretty short of us. So if there's no label on an edge, I'm assuming it's three, and if there's no label on a vertex, I'm assuming it's two. So, so far we have one infinite family where we can vary on p and on the length of the diagram. There's a couple exceptional ones that I'll just write all together here. So, this quotient of the four-strand grade group and quotient of the five-strand grade group are equipped. Five-strand breakgroup, part-fine. We have an infinite family here, the only other infinite family, where we don't just take any m, p, and q, but we need 1 over p plus 2 over m plus 1 over q to be bigger than or just bigger than 1. So a lot of this is covered in Covered in Shepard's thesis and why they're named after him. This was in 52. And Coxlitter has a really great treatment of them, sort of similar to his treatment of the real polytopes. So, kind of an interesting thing is why. Is why do we have finite Shepherd groups instead of all Shepherd groups? So it turns out you can define an analog of a teacher representation for all finite Shepherd groups. But in general, if the group is infinite, it won't be feasible. So they don't exactly come from all complex reflection groups, but they generalize the presentation. The presentation. So, hence why we still call them shepherd groups. Okay, so this definition is really general. I mean, the PI can be anything. The MIJ can be anything. So it seems kind of hopeless to be able to prove anything about all shepherd groups. In fact, some of the things we even know for all. In fact, some of the things we even know for all Martin groups, we don't know for all shepherd groups. So, for example, if you take gamma is a full subgraph, so that just means if two vertices share an edge in lambda, then they share an edge in gamma. And it inherits the labeling, then it's not known if the Shepherd group generated by just this graph is isomorphic to the subgroup on the vertices of that subgroup. So, this is known in some cases. It's a fairly non-trivial property to show. I think for art groups, it is not too trivial. Groups, it's not too trivial. So it makes sense that we want to sort of narrow our scope like we do with art groups a lot. So I'll define some properties that might be worth looking at. So, kind of a big one for art and groups has been two-dimensional art groups. So, we'll say that. So we'll say that the Shepard group is two-dimensional if the Barton group or the Coxlander group is two-dimensional, which I'll arrange you means that if the Coxlander group is finite, then there are at most two vertices sorry. For a subgroup, for a subgraph, the subgraph gives you a finite coxfield group if no one or not with one. If no one or not with knowing. If it gives you a finite construct group that has fewer not two verses, you can define the type FC condition, which is the same here. If gamma has no edge labeled infinity, then W or W lambda is finite. And we can have, we have one more condition, which I'll call FPA, which just stands for the finite parabolics agree. So we'll say that the Shepherd group, gamma, is finite, then only if the Coxer group is finite. And so by this, sorry, by this, I just mean remove all the vertex labels and look at it like a regular Copster group. So an example of a group not satisfying this condition, which will be important, is if you just take some dihedral group like this, but the sum is less than or equal to 1, because if and m is finite. So, of course, all the dihedral cluster groups are finite, and the M is finite. So, if you take a large enough P and Q, then eventually it will become infinite, and it won't satisfy this condition. Okay, so I'm going to write down some known results so far. So there's a So there's a subclass called diagrams, which I don't really want to define, but basically if your vertex label is larger than 2, then all of the edges coming off have to be 2 or infinity. So it's sort of right-angled, but you can have some like cockset or subgroups in there. So if it's a diagram, then it's cat zero proving by marrying. Approved by Mary Ann 22 and it has a solvable problem. This was Louise Paris and Mary in London 23. The only other results that I've been able to find, at least regarding some more general checker groups, is one by lice. So if you have all three of these, so if it's 2D and FC and the finite parabolics agree, then it's automatic. So something that I showed recently is if you get rid of the 2G, you just look at Fc with the finite parabolics agreeing, then they're co-compactly cumulative. Co-compactly cumulative. And if you remove FC with like a pesky little condition of not having a subdiagram of this type, then they are cat zero. And they're at cat zero. So this isn't any kind of like a poison subgroup. It's just if it includes this, we're not sure how to do it. Because even though this is a finite group, this complex that it acts on is some three-dimensional spherical complex. So some finite three-dimensional spherical complex, but still not quite trackable. But still not quite tractable. Catherine, are those all threes? Those are all threes. So that's this group. Got it. So if you take the five-part string and break group, mod out all the generators by three, we know how to show that this complex, which is like a generalization of the Coxford complex or the spherical complex. We're not trying to show that's cat one. Okay, and then some. Okay, and then some new results that are yet to be published. If you have that, it's just 2D. So, all of these, except maybe the dire groups, all require this kind of strict condition, which is pretty stringent because there's not much you can do to extend the Coxter groups using only these admissible diagrams. So, what can we show? What can we show when we don't have this? So if it's two-dimensional, then it's asymmetrically hyperbolic if the vertex is greater than 3, or at least 3. This was shown for art groups by Nicola. In M and we show that they're relatively hyperbolic relative to the edge subgroups if the coxswain group is were hyperbolic. So this is similar to work of Charney and Chris. Of Charney and Chris, who did this for Erdwin Groups in 05. So both of these are still in preparation, hopefully out soon. And there's kind of an interesting side result. So if it's two-dimensional and not FPA, so if you have some edge subgroup that is the sum that I have written up is less than or equal to one, then it's not. Then it's not cat zero. As in, it emits no proper action on a cat zero space. So this is quite interesting. The Artin groups are conjectured to be count zero. The Coxler groups are well known to be count zero. So to have some of these quotients of Artin groups by large powers that are not count zero is sort of paradoxical. Is sort of paradoxical. I think the reason for this, or the reason for this specific result, is that if gamma is this etch group and I'll say H is the sum. And if h is equal to 1, then the shepherd group is commensurable to the integer Heisenberg group in three dimensions. And if it's less than one, then And it's, um, so this specifically doesn't situate this, but I'm going to write this just real quick. If it is less than one, then it's bi-automatic and a uniform address in. In the isometry group of the universal cover of SL2R. Okay, so this I think maybe says why it's not cat0 here. The reason it's not cat0 here is simply because it's a non-trivial central extension of a rotation triangle. Of a rotation triangle. And the Euler class is infinite order. So you can do some fun colonology stuff to show that it can't virtually split along its center, so it can't be cats. And the reason why we need to have two-dimensional for this is because we can show that it has a complex group structure like one group. Structure like Larm group or Foxyer group, where it's cat zero, so we know the edge subgroups in bed solving or resolving this question. So I guess I'll stop there. Thank you. Any questions? Mention the the result about the immersion of the hyperpollock cluster. So the Chani and Crisp result about Artengrops is about weakly relatively hyperbolic. Right. This is about genuinely relatively hyperbolic because it's weakly hyperbolic. No, it's we also like RT groups in some ways are more complicated than cocaine groups. I'm just wondering if you impose the restriction that all the vertex labels are finite, does that make it easier for those classical things? No, so most of these are shown all when they're all finite. All finite. So all of these, you meaning just vertex labels? Yeah, I'm saying let the edge labels be anything, but impose that all the vertex labels have different labels. No, so that's still the case over here. I guess kind of implicitly I meant that all of these should be finite when I took this sum. I guess you could say one over going to be zero. But even if these are all finite, these two things still hold. So it's still. So it it's still kind of uh it is kind of strange. Um so I don't have a lot of intuition for the FPA hypothesis, but in the spot where you said you can't have these 3323 subgraphs, the group, this is a very specific question, the group that's got four vertices that looks exactly like that, but with fours instead of threes. Exactly like that, but with fours instead of threes. Is that okay? No, that's infinite. Oh, these are all, I see. So, yeah, so finite means all the finite subdiagrams, if they're Coxer diagrams, when you add the labels, they stay finite groups. So, I really don't have a lot of intuition for that. Thank you. So, any of these ships are going to contain the gas destructor of the top one of the My guess would be no, because generally they'll have a lot of torsion in the generators. So you don't have like a nice monoid that can embed, or I guess the monoid would be isometric or isomorphic to the shepherd group. I haven't given it too much thought. I just sort of thought about that and then thought it's maybe not worth pursuing, but I'm not sure. Actually, no one maybe Bernette would like to tell us. Yes, thank you. So a short announcement. So this, I hope everyone heard that there will be a little reading of a play tonight. All of the rules are assigned.
