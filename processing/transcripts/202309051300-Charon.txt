The works I'm going to be presenting today was done in collaboration with quite a few people, including Martin Bauer and Emmanuel Hartmann, FSU, my former PhD student, ESG Supreme, as well as some of our collaborators in the University of Hill, Emui Person and Mohamed Derin. So I'm a little aware that this talk might be slightly frustrating for some people in the audience because I'm not really going to be discussing anything directly related to biomedical data, even though these are applications I'm really interested in. Are applications I'm really interested in. But rather, this talk is going to be like a first part that's going to be about presenting a mathematical but mostly numerical framework to basically perform a lot of tasks and operation in shape spaces, specifically shape spaces of surfaces. With the hope that this might trigger some interest for some people in the audience to either use this kind of method, or at least elements that are developed as part of this pipeline, for potential applications. For potential applications to your data set. And then the second part of the talk, which I may or may not have time to discuss, you will see, is going to be about some recent application we did of some bias of this model for the problem of computer vision and augmented reality, about analyzing the motion of full body, full human body. So in terms of biological scale, but as much macro scale as you can do. Makes sense. But so let me start with the first part. And there we are going to reiterate a bit what was said in the two previous. We repeat what's set in the previous talks.
