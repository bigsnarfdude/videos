Okay, thank you very much for the invitation. I'm sorry I couldn't come in person, but maybe next time. Okay, so I'm going to talk to you about like basically two geometric flow equations. One is the mean curvature flow and the other one is the Ricci flow. And basically the most important questions about regarding these geometric flows is the understanding the singularity. Understanding the singularities in both flows. And the way how you understand the singularities, you have to do some appropriate rescaling. Models of your solutions, and they happen to be so-called ancient solutions. So these ancient solutions are just the solutions. Solutions are just the solutions to either of the two geometric equations, either the Minkowitz flow, let's say, or the Ricci flow that exists all the way from negative infinity up to some time capital T, where capital T can be also plus infinity, in which case we refer to these solutions as eternal solutions. So, these ancient solutions, so once again, these ancient solutions are just the singularity models of like the mean curvature flow and the Ricci flow. Incurvitz flow and the Ricci flow. And in order to understand the singularities in both flows, you need to understand these ancient solutions and maybe try to classify them. And the motivation behind understanding these ancient solutions is to understand the shape of the singularities, maybe flow through the singularity, you know, try to define some sort of weak solutions, or maybe like even perform surgery as was done in both. As was done in both flows, the mean Fribischer flow and the Ricci flow. And so, our work on ancient solutions basically in both flows continues the previous work of Hamilton and Herald Manuel-Dericci flow. And like in the Minkerwicher flow, we somehow build up on important works by Sufuskinsin Estrari, Hassel-Wolfer-Kleiner, and Brian White, and many others, of course. So, I'm going to start with very special cases of these ancient solutions or very special examples of these ancient solutions. And they are called the solitons. And solitons are just the self-similar solutions. These are solutions to our geometric equations that just flow by like diffeomorphisms and homotides. And some typical examples of these solid ones are, for example, the spheres. Solid ones, like for example, the spheres. For example, in both the Min Curvischer flow and the Ricci flow, the sphere just evolves in a self-similar way by shrinking. So as you approach the singular time, the sphere just shrinks to a point. And as you go backward in time to negative infinity, it just expands. So the radius becomes somehow infinity. And then similarly, cylinders are also like examples of those self-similar solutions. Of those self-similar solutions in both flows. And what happens to the cylinders, they also become singular in finite time and like they retain the same shape, right? Cylindrical shape retains. What happens as we approach the singular time is that the radius of the cylinder becomes smaller and smaller. And at the singular time, basically, everything collapses to a line if we talk about the round cylinder. And besides those spheres and cylinders, which are the examples of shrinking solitons, there are also some other types, let's say, of translating solitons in the mean curvature flow. They just move by translations. These are examples of eternal solutions that exist from negative infinity to plus infinity, and they just move by translations. The example is the Ball soliton, which I also drew a picture of. Drew a picture of on this slide. And the analogs of those in the Ricci flow are discovered by Brian and they are called statusolitons and they just move by diffeomorphisms as well. So the goal basically in these geometric flows is to understand these ancient solutions, but that can be very hard if you don't impose some extra assumptions. For example, you can try to classify solitons, which are self-similar. Solitons, which are self-similar solutions. So, in addition to the PDE, they also satisfy a nice elliptic equation. So, you have an extra structure there. Even that problem by itself seems to be very hard. Or you can put some appropriate curvature bounds as time approaches to negative infinity. For example, we want to understand type 1 ancient solutions, which just means that the curvature dies off as a constant over time as time approaches to negative infinity. Time approaches to negative infinity. Or you can talk about these ancient solutions and try to understand those that satisfy some non-collapsing conditions, which I'm going to address in the later slides. Or maybe you can put some assumptions on some k-convexity, for example, in the case of the mean curvature flow, or for example, an assumption that. Like there are also other examples of ancient solutions which are not the solitons. So that makes this problem of classifying ancient solutions in particular very hard. Now let me draw the analysis. Very hard. Now, let me draw the analogy with the Will theorems for, for example, parabolic equations. Let's say that Mn is a complete non-compact Riemannian manifold with non-negative Ricci curve from 1975 who proved that any positive hormone on such a manifold has to be constant. And this is basically the analog of the Wilf theorem for harmonic functions on Rn. And now you can ask the question whether there is an analog of such a theorem, for example, for solutions of the heat equation, which are like, but the answer is no. For example, you can see that. Yes, just to let you know, you're coming in and out here. So we're hearing about 75% of what you're shut down. Oh, really? So the connection is, can you hear me now? We can right now. Yeah, it comes and goes. Oh, really? That's a good suggestion. Yeah, maybe you could stop your video just to see if it helps. Ah, to stop my video. Okay, sure. To stop my video, okay? Sure, okay. So, let me start. So, does it help? Is it better? Probably. Thank you. Let's go ahead. Okay, so I just want to, so with the questions that we want to understand, which is the classifying these ancient solutions, I want to draw the analogy with these Louisville theorems for parabolic equations. So, I was just mentioning that, for example, for the heat equation, which would be a model for us, right, because both mean turbulent. Us, right? Because both Minter-Witchflow and Ricci Flow are modeled on this heat flow, basically. Like in this case, right, the answer is no, right? Because you can, for example, have e to the x1 plus t, which is a solution of this equation on Rn cross R, right? So this should be a counterexample. So you don't have only constant solutions. And there is like a result of Suppl√© and Jang from 2006 who considered And six who considered again a non-compact Riemannian manifolds with no negative Ricci curvature. And in the case when you have a positive ancient solution, so ancient again means that you have a solution to the heat equation which exists from negative infinity up to some time capital T. And if they impose in addition this growth condition that u is some exponential that like that you that this Like that u that this growth of u is controlled by this exponential to the little o of a distance from a fixed point p plus square root of t, then you use a constant. And if you drop the assumption on positivity, then you have to impose a stricter condition on the growth. So namely, u has to be a little o of a distance to a fixed point plus square root of t. Then they show that u is a constant, right? So in general, like there is no way that you can classify all these ancient solutions. Classify all these ancient solutions even to the heat equation. And so, like, so I lied a little bit to you when I said that the heat flow models like our flows, our flows are like much more complex, much more complicated. They are totally non-linear. So, maybe I will say that it's in some sense, like more or less, there is a resemblance of behavior of our flows to basically this semi-linear heat flow. Heat flow. And here I'll just mention a result of Giga and Kohn, who actually proved that if you do the type 1 rescaling of the solutions of this semi-linear heat equation at a singular time capital T, right, so this is the type 1 rescaling that I wrote on the slide. Then they proved this L infinity bound. Flow satisfies, right? So it is the equation star on this on this slide. And they want to basically analyze the blob behavior of U. And in order to do that, they basically need to understand the long time behavior of this W bar. And W bar is just like type 1 rescaling of the original solution U, right? So, and capital P is the singular time. P is the singular time. And so I'm mentioning this result because, like, in what follows, we basically got an idea from this theorem of Merle and Zach, who tried to understand these blow-up limits, W of tau, which are just the limits of W bar at tau plus tau k, and tau k is any sequence of times that approaches to plus infinity. Infinity. So they showed that, and this W is basically an eternal solution to this equation star. They needed to classify, in order to understand their question, they needed to classify eternal solutions to this equation star. And here is where we got the idea for our work. So I just, that's why I'm just mentioning this on this slide. So again, eternal solutions are the solutions that exist. Eternal solutions are the solution that exists from negative infinity to plus infinity. And the simplest solutions to eternal solutions to these equations are just the zero solutions and the constant solutions. But besides from those, here kappa is non-zero, you can compute what it is, but besides from these solutions, there is also a solution which is not constant. It is constant in space, but not in time. But not in time. And the first two solutions are just the stationary solutions of the equation star, while the third solution is not. And they had to somehow capture also this third solution, which would somehow correspond, in our case, to capturing the ancient solutions, which are not solitons. So they don't have this special action, like they don't have this special structure, that they just move by diffeomorphisms and homoties. So that is some sort of the analogy. Some sort of the analogy like that I want to mention. And so, like, so now I just want to mention some results about the classification of these ancient solutions in the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. And these are basically like joint works with Dascalopoulos, Hamilton, then Anganent, again, Dascallopoulos and Brandle. The first is for the Ricci flow, sorry, both for the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. mean curvature flow. Okay, so here is the, I wrote the equation for the Ricci flow equation, the equation for the Ricci flow, namely if you have like a manifold M and a metric G on it, you evolve the metric G starting at time zero, let's say with some nice and smooth metric G0, and you evolve it in time via this equation Rf, right? So dG dt is just negative 2 Ricci. And this was introduced by Richard Hamilton in the 80s in his attempts. In the 80s, in his attempts to prove the Poincar√© conjecture, which was later done by Perelman. So, this is the Ricci flow equation, and the Min-Kurwitzer flow equation is that you start with an embedding of a hypersurface in Rn plus one. For us, it would be always co-dimension one hypersurface, and you evolve it by this MCF equation where df/dt is minus hŒΩ, h is just the mean curvature, and nu is the outward unit normal vector. So, these are the equations. Normal vector. So these are the equations that we want to look at. And right, so what I want to mention is that this definition of kappa non-collapsedness, which was introduced by Perelman. So if you have an ancient solution to the Ricci flow, let's say in dimension n, you will say that it is kappa non-collapsed. If the volume, right, everything is computed with respect to the evolving metric g of t, right? So the volume of the bowl. t right so the volume of the ball of radius r has a lower bound by some kappa r to the n provided that you have this curvature bound by one over r squared in this ball of radius r and i will just mention that a big contribution of perelman was that like if of course like if you start the ricci flow at any smooth manifold it is kappa non-collapsed originally at the initial time but but what he showed that this constant kappa doesn't deteriorate This constant kappa doesn't deteriorate as time approaches to the singular time, so it stays kappa non-collapsed. And hence, all singularity models, which are our ancient solutions, are kappa non-collapsed. So that is somehow natural condition that you want to add when you try to classify the ancient solutions because, right, in the context of understanding the singularity models of the flows. And there is an analogous notion of how. Is an analogous notion of alpha non-collapsed solutions in the mean curvature flow, and this is what I also drew at the picture. So, you will say that it is alpha-non-collapsed, and this makes sense to talk only when the mean curvature is positive. So, for positive mean-convex hypersurfaces, where at each point you can find these two tangent balls from inside and outside that are touching your hypersurface at point P and whose radius is at least this alpha over. Radius is at least this alpha over h to the p. And this condition is also preserved along the mean curvature flow. So, when you talk about the singularity models, let's say of mean-convex, hypers of mean-convex mean curvature flows, then it makes sense also to impose alpha-non-collapsedness for the ancient solutions that you want to classify. Okay, so we were like in the context of the Ricci flav, we were interested to classify these ancient kappa solutions. These ancient kappa solutions. This notion was introduced by Perelman because he proved that, like in the case of three-dimensional Ricci flow, the singularity models are these ancient kappa solutions, which means that they are kappa non-collapsed. That is the definition that I have just given. They are ancient and they have no negative sectional curvature, which always happens in the case of 3D Ricci flows due to Hamilton IV pinching. Close due to Hamilton Ivy pinching estimate. And here is like the theorem which we proved. So there is like the theorem of Brendle and then there is a separate work by Brendle Dascalopoulos and myself. So we basically classified all Kappa solutions to the three-dimensional Ricci flow and they happen to be the spheres, the Perelman ovals, cylinders, and the Brand soliton. And I will just mention that Brandle. Mentioned that Brendle did the classification in the complete non-compact case where he proved that all 3D kappa solutions are the brand solitons or the round cylinders. And together with Brendan and Askolopoulos, we basically classify three-dimensional compact kappa solutions where you have only these spheres or Perelman ovals. And spheres, cylinders, and branch-soliton, these are the examples of self-solid. Soliton, these are the examples of self-similar solutions or the solitons. While Perelman oval is not a soliton solution, right, it is just an ancient solution. So I drew like approximately its picture, right, like on this slide. It is not given in the closed form, and Perelman just gave the rough asymptotics, right? Saying that in the middle, these solutions roughly look like a cylinder, and at the tips, it roughly looks like the brand. Roughly looks like the brand soliton. Okay, so and so this was a this theorem was conjectured by Perelman, and then like we spent quite some time in order to prove this theorem. So basically the steps in the proof. So I just want to mention the steps in the proof in this compact case which we considered. So as I said already, the rough asymptotics as time approaches to negative Symptotics as time approaches to negative infinity of this ancient compa-kappa solution was given by Perelman just by saying that in the middle, as t approaches to negative infinity, the solution looks like round cylinder and around the tips, it roughly looks like the branch soliton. And then we had to do like step two, which was that we needed to prove that every such solution has to be rotationally symmetric. So this was a step two. And then step three, assume. And then step three, assuming that it is rotationally symmetric, which we proved in step two, we gave detailed asymptotics of any ancient compact Kappa solution, right? And then by using these asymptotics, so that was the first paper. Step three was just like the first paper. And then the second paper was by using this very precise matched asymptotics of every 3D kappa solutions, which Kappa solution in the compact case, we gave the classic. In the compact case, we gave the classification. Namely, we said that either it has to be the sphere, or if not, it has to be the Perelman's Perelman's oval. And so maybe it's a little bit easier to explain these techniques that we use to prove this Ricci-Flow result in the context of the Minker Ritchie-flow because it's a little bit easier to visualize because you can embed everything in our. You can embed everything in Rn, right? So you have the ambient manifold. And here I will just mention the result of Hasselhofer and Kleiner, who proved that if you have an ancient compact and non-collapse solution in the context of the previous definition, which I gave earlier, then they showed it has to be convex. And if it's convex, compact, and self-similar, it has to be the sphere. So that's what we already know. So the goal here would be to classify ancient. Here would be to classify ancient non-collapse solutions of the mean curvature flowing dimensions n bigger or equal than two that are not self-similar, because if they are self-similar, we know that they are the spheres. And so, in general, like if you don't have any additional assumptions, it's known that there are like many, many different solutions in the mean curvature flow. So, in our work, we restrict ourselves to uniformly two convex solutions, which means that you take the two lowest principles. means that you take the two lowest principal eigenvalues of your second fundamental form and you require this to be greater or equal than beta h for some beta positive, which in turn basically gives you that as time approaches to a negative infinity after rescaling, your solution in the middle looks more and more like a round cylinder. So this condition gives you that, that basically like right in the middle your solution looks like a round cylinder. And so here I'm just And so, here I'm just reminding you of the examples of these ancient non-collapsed two-convex solutions to the mean curvature flow. So, we have the spheres, we have the cylinders, we have the ball soliton, right? They are all non-collapsed solutions. The first two are shrinking solutions, right? And the ball-soliton is also moving by translations. And in addition to this solitron or self-similar solutions, Soliton or self-similar solutions. You also have these brown white ovals, which are basically the analogues of Perelman's ovals for the Ricci flow. So in the middle, these solutions look like cylinders and around the tips, they look like the ball solitons, which we have on this slide. Okay. And so I'll just mention the theorem of Brandle and Choi, who considered non-compact, uniformly two-convex, non-collapse tension solutions, and they proved they have to. Abstention solutions and they proved they have to be the cylinders and the ball soliton. And together with Duncan and Tendaskolopoulos, we proved that in the COMPA case, the only non-collapsed, uniformly two-convexed ancient solutions are the spheres and those rotationally symmetric brand ovals. So, I will just say that, like, recently, actually, like Choi Hasselhoper Hershkovich and White, they also showed. White. They also showed that two convexity can be replaced by the assumption that as t approaches to negative infinity, the solution approaches the round cylinder. And so I just want to briefly outline the steps in the proof. You do this parabolic rescaling by the square root of t minus t. You also have to scale the time, then which goes to tau, right, tau goes from negative infinity to plus infinity. From negative infinity to plus infinity, and we already know by the result of Sujia Wang that the backward limit as tau approaches to negative infinity of our solution is around cylinder. And we use L2 methods to classify those ancient solutions. We first prove the unique matched asymptotics of the rotationally symmetric ancient ovals. And then we prove that all our solutions have to be rotationally symmetric. Solutions have to be rotationally symmetric. That is our step three. And once we know that, then we prove the uniqueness, right? Using the fact that we have rotational symmetry and the precise matched asymptotics, then we manage to prove the uniqueness. And right, so I'm out of time, right? So just more of it. Yeah, okay. So I just said like briefly outline the steps. So okay, then I'm going to stop here. Thank you very much for your attention. Your attention. Thank you. Any questions? Here or online? Just a quick question. In either of these cases, the Perelman oval or the white oval, how rapidly do you converge to the cylinder as you go backwards in time? As you go backwards in time, is it exponential or polynomial? Oh, okay. Right. So, as you right, so it's polynomial. It's polynomial. And this is like basically what happens. We do it really this precise matched asymptotics. And what you prove is that your, let's say, the profile, let's call it the profile function is root 2, where root 2 corresponds to the round cylinder. And then we prove the second order asymptotics, which is basically given by the Hermit polynomial divided by tau. Polynomial divided by tau, and Hermit polynomial corresponds to the zero eigenvalue of the linearized operator around the cylinder. So you get something like y squared minus two divided by tau, right? So that's the rate of convergence to the cylinder. It's polynomial and given by the neutral mode. Yeah. Thank you. Any more questions? Okay. If not, let's take a picture. Okay, if not, let's thank Professor Sashum again. Thank you.
