Okay, um uh thanks for the invitation and Dave and Joe have already given great talks on this subject. So thanks to them I can just keep my talk on the live side. So today I will still talk about especially post-sympathetic waterways and the top day is based on John Works with David Nicholas and John Road. I also just want to motivate you a bit about why we study such ribs. So the starting point of our work is this Of our work is this kind of dispersion relation for one-dimensional free surface water waves. And C here is the wave speed, G is the gravity acceleration constant, tau is the surface tension coefficient, k here is the wave number. And here is a picture to illustrate the idea. So given a certain wave speed, there exist two distinct wave numbers that satisfy this dispersion relation. So if these two wave numbers are rationally related, this is related to the Wilton-Ripple problem. Related to the Wilton Ripple problem, and for us, we think that okay, K1 and K2 can be irrationally related. For example, for one wave number is 1, the other is 1 over root 2, and the superposition of these two waves will still be a solution to the linearized traveling wave problem. And on the other hand, for this superposition, it is specially quasi-purolic. So you can see it's not repeating itself, and it does not go to zero at infinity. So for this, we say that, okay, this at least tells us. Alice tells us a spatial positriolic trolley waves exist at a linear level. And we actually use this as an initial guess and we obtain them. Before I finish that, I want to mention that Bridges and Diaz first studied these waves and they constructed the basically nonlinear approximations of these waves. And they actually use that as an initial guess and we obtained the solution of the fully non-linear traveling wave problem. And Dave has also shown. Problem and Dave has also shown you the talk. And also, I want to say that thanks to their talk, I will mention as Dave has shown, or as John has shown all the time in my talks. Okay, so here, as you can see, eta is the initial condition of the traveling wave, and it is not repeating itself, it doesn't go to zero at infinity. We have also computed the time evolution of this traveling wave. So, here, just imagine that we are taking like snapshots of an evolving wave. The blue line is the initial condition. So, the wave is indeed. Condition, so the wave is indeed propagating from left to right without changing shape. And this is actually a trolley solution, but that bifurcates from the zero solution. So these solutions of small amplitude, and if you compare it to the linear solution, they don't differ much. And if we go back to the bifurcation plot, so here we have like a primary bifurcation branch, which is the periodic traveling solution branch, and we have Solution branch, and we have the solutions I have shown you is a small title solution that bifurcates from the zero solution. Of course, we can look at quasi-periodic bifurcations that will show up further along this primary branch. And we have also done this. So, here is a picture of the quasi-periodic bifurcation from a high-tech amplitude overhanging traveling wave. So, here, the dotted line is a periodic traveling wave which is overhanging, and Which is overhanging, and this red line here is the quasi-bifurcation. So, we zoom in on the trolls of these two waves, you can see that different from the periodic wave, the quasi-wave troll is asymmetric. Okay, and for this kind of trial waves and for the especially quasi-periodic waves, we said, okay, they don't go to zero-infinity and they are not repeating themselves in space. So they are lacking translation symmetry. I also don't have mentioned how they approach. How we approach, like how we represent this with. So instead of looking at this one-dimensional quasi-periodic function itself, we lift it up to a higher-dimensional tolerance and to a periodic problem that defined on the higher-dimensional tolerance. And here is a picture to be left with the 2D case. So Dave has also shown you this picture. We have the color plot of the pure odd function. And our positive pure function will just take values along these red lines, which are slope one over. These red lines, which are slope 1 over root 2, and because of the irrational slope, the red line will be dense in the whole torus. And the quasi-prote function will look like this. Okay, so this is a case for the 1D quasi-pure function. And now we want to move on to the 2D case. And we have 2D waves, which are also more realistic. And how do we represent these 2D waves? So for 1D quasi-bel function, we need a purely function that is defined at least on a two-term. That is defined at least on two tars. So, for two deposit periodic functions, we need a periodic function that is defined on at least three tars. So, here is a model example to do. Here is a model example to illustrate the idea. So, before we have, wait, sorry. I think before I should mention this. Should mention this. So here is the thing that before I talk about two quasi-periods, and here, of course, we can define de quasi-periods, and we have this wave vector k that is quasi-periodic wave number vector k. And for de quasi-periods, the wave vector is a d-vector. And for genuine quasi-period functions, we require that the entries of k are linearly dependent over integers. Okay, so after I mentioned this, if we go back to the bifurcation plot, I want to say that we should view the quasi-purial functions as the object that is defined on a higher dimensional space. So for the bifurcation plot, it actually bifurcates from a lower dimensional periodic solution to a higher dimensional quasi-related function. And for the 2D case, so before we see this kind of one-dimensional quasi-process, One-dimensional quasiperiotic wave number vector. Now we will have a wave number matrix. So for the p-function to be generally quasiperiodic, we require that the rows of k are linearly independent over integers. So for the 2D wave, here is an example. We have three quasi-periods at least, and then we will have a 3 by 2 matrix, and the results are linearly independent over integers. Okay. And before I show you a picture of the Wendy. Before I show you a picture of the 1D quota function and I show you a torus, so here is a picture to illustrate the idea for 2D equilateral functions. We will have a periodic function defined on the three torus. So this is like the heat map of the 3D periodic function. And before we have positive function, let's go take values along the red lines, if you remember. For here, we will have the positive function that will take values along its parallel points. Parallel planes, and because of this irrational relation, these planes will also fill up the torus, this 3d cube. And this is a picture to demonstrate the actual cross-separative function, which is 2d. So till now, I talk about the quasi-priority function representation. After this, I want to talk about how we compute these quasar-priority waves. Possibility for waves, and I will talk about the method we used in 2D and the method we are going to use in 3D. And also, like, at the end, I will conclude with some preliminary threat for results we have obtained for this quasi-theory problem. Okay. So, let's go back to the equations of motion. John and Dave have already given the equations of motion. So, I'll just quickly talk about the meaning of terms. So, we are interested in this incompressible potential flow. There exists a lot of potential. There exists a velocity potential capital phi, such that the velocity field can be written as a gradient of the velocity potential. And this velocity potential will satisfy this directional Newman boundary value problem. And it's a quasi-value problem, so x belongs to the whole entire real plane. And you'll be like, wait a minute, didn't you see that you are going to lift the problem up to a height dimensional torque? And yes, that's exactly what we are going to do. So, once we lift it up to a higher dimensional torus, we will represent this quasi-Pearly function in terms of a pearly function. And also, it will take values along the direction k times x. Okay, so after this, after we want to leave this problem to the hard. Want to leave this problem to the higher-dimensional charge, the equations will also change. So, before we have a Laplacian equation, now it's still an elliptic equation, but we have this operator here. Instead of this part, like the Laplacian in the x direction. And the difference is that for our spatial domain, for the lateral direction or the horizontal direction, it is defined on the D-dimensional towers. So it's periodic on the x and either In the horizontal direction. And to compute the water base, we go back to the definition of the quasi-periodic direction Newman operator. We have a quasi-periodic version of the traditional periodic direction to Newman operator. And also, like, we can just, these are the time evolution equations of the free surface elevation and also the value of the velocity potential on the phrase surface. So, I believe all of you know that if we I believe all of you know that if we just evolve these two equations, we can obtain the motion of the whole fluid domain, of the whole flow. Okay. So now how do we solve these equations? And in 2D, we use a conformal mapping approach John has mentioned. And for this approach, I want to talk about the case where we have like a variable bottom boundary. So we actually map the fluid domain or we map the hormonal. Domain, or we map the horizontal strip to the fluid domain. And the idea is like this: we use a conformal map to simplify the fluid domain to a horizontal strip. And in this way, we can also simplify the calculation of the Dirich to Newman operator. So, Dirich Newman operator is a non-local operator. Now, instead, we will have a question here for transform. As John mentioned, this is still a non-local operator, but it is very easy to compute. But it is very easy to compute. We just need to multiply the Fourier coefficients by the corresponding Fourier multipliers. So here, we simplify the Fourier domain, and there is an extra cost. The cost is that the equation we will have more equations to deal with. So before we just need to evolve the free surface, now due to the conformal parametrization, we need to evolve both the parametrization of the free surface and the bottom boundary at the same time. Moreover, we also need to keep track of the The width of the stream here. So, to keep the spatial period of the water wave in the comfortable domain and physical domain the same, we need to let this h will change with time. So we also need to calculate the time evolution of h. We simplify the fluid domain, we have more equations to deal with. So, that's the idea. And I noticed there will also be a talk on the case when the fluid bottom boundary is changing with time. So, I'm also looking forward to. With time. So I'm also looking forward to that talk as well. Okay. And here is a numerical result. So here, this is a periodic first surface, and the bottom is also a periodic bottom boundary. But the spatial periods of these two things are irrationally related. So one is the spatial period 2π, the other one is 2π rule 2. And just let the free surface fall down from the rest. Fall down from the rest. And here is the time evolution of the free surface. You can see it's oscillating up and down. And because of the irrational relation between the free surface and the bottom boundary, each wave peak is developing a unique pattern. Okay, come on, come on. Now, this is about the one-dimensional wave. Let's move on to the two-dimensional waves. So, for the 2D surface, So for the 2D surface, the conformal mapping cannot be easily applied. We adopted the method developed by Nichols and Ritic. This is the transformed field expansions. And Dave has already given an extensive talk on this method. So here, I just want to briefly mention about how I think about this method. So here, the idea is simple. For 2D, we try to simplify the full domain. We do the same thing for 3D. And we don't have a conformal map, so we introduce. We don't have a conformal map, so we introduce this change of variables here. If we look at this change of variables, when y is equal to eta tilde, we will get 0. So basically, we map the free surface to the flat plane at y is equal to 0. We also simplify the fluid domain. But the equations will become more complicated, as Dave has mentioned. Before we have zero here, now we have non-zero terms on right side, but luckily these terms depend on either tilde. terms depend on eta tilde. So if the size of e to tilde is very small, we can write down the series expansion for phi tilde and also for the directional Newman operator. And we can plug them back into the original equation. We can obtain the elliptic problem for the coefficient phi delta n and phi delta n here. And we and the good part compared to the previous case, the right side also depends The random side also depends on phi tilde, but for this new set of equations, the rand side no longer depends on phi tilde n. So it can depend on phi n minus 1, phi n minus 2, but it does not depend on phi n. So we can just solve that explicitly and iteratively and obtain this series expansion, the coefficient. And we also have proved the Prove the analyticity of the direction operator in the Poisson parallelic case. And I will talk a bit more in the end. I will talk about how we obtain this theorem. So before that, I just want to show you a numerical result to validate our method. And David has talked about like the manufacturer solution thing. So basically the idea is we compute the in-solder, we compare the in-solder truncation with the The truncation with the exact solution, and this is a plot of relative error versus the truncation order. So you can see that when the size of eta is small, in other words, the size of epsilon is small, we have this design convergence. And here, this line does not look good because epsilon is large. So we try to investigate what happened here, and we notice that actually the series is divergent at this point. So the epsilon is equal to 0.2 is outside of our radius of coverage. Is outside of our release coverage. Okay, and maybe in the future we can use Pyday to improve this result. We have done, we did that for the one decades, we haven't done that for the two decades. Okay. Now, let me briefly talk about how we get the analyticity of the duration operator. So, all of this will depend on the elliptic estimates of this Of this Dirich-Luman boundary value problem, and it's a linear problem. And it would be like, okay, this looks like some standard Laplacian equation. Why can't you just use the standard elliptic estimates we have time before? You have no important years. And the answer is that we have tried, but we failed miserably, all because of this change operator here, and because of the small divisor issue. So I'm not going to give you the full detail, but I want to show you how the small divisor shows up. Want to show you how the small divisor shows up in our proof. Let's look at this simple case. So here we have this one-dimensional Laplacian equation, or Poisson equation actually. And we have a random side, and we have a periodic case, and I assume that the random side is of zero average. And of course, we can write down the Fourier coefficient in terms of the Fourier coefficient of f. And we know that, okay, the function u is two orders more regular than f. This is a standard elliptic f. Than f. This is a standard elliptic estimate. But what happens in the quasi-periodic case? So I'm not going to talk about the general case. I will just talk about the simple case where we have two quasi-periods, one for the wave vector k, y is 1, y is 1 over root 2. So we will have this operator. And still, thanks to the irrational relation between 1 and 1 over root 2, the bottom here, the divider here, will not be 0. We can still write down the Fourier coefficients of u in terms of f here, but In terms of f here, but different from the top case, the bottom can get arbitrarily close to zero. So by dividing this divisor, you is not getting any more regular, you cannot regain the two orders of regularity using the standard elliptic estimate. And what should we do? So I think what we do is, if we go back to the elliptic estimate, what does this plus two mean? It means that, okay, my first order derivative is the h. is in Hs and my second order derivative is in Hs. What we do is the same thing. We cannot obtain this. Basically means that we cannot obtain the regularity for the derivative of U in all spatial directions, but we can give the regularity just along the polypiolic direction. So in other words It's here. In other words, it looks like maybe a totality, but this is actually what we need. So along the quasi-period direction, it's two orders more regular. And you'll be like, what about other directions? So if we go back to the original equation, look at here, and look at here, and if you go to the time evolution equation, the derivative that show up will only be this kind of directional derivatives. So we actually can use just this. So we actually can use just this idea to prove the regularity for the function along the positive reality. So we cannot really use the standard elliptic estimate. So in the end, we have to basically bond all these terms one by one and deal with small divisor issues one by one. And yeah, maybe I'll just end out here. And in the future, hopefully, I can do something about. Something about, so this is just for the True Neumann operator and elliptic estimate for this quasi-periodic elliptic problem. So in the future, we hope that we can do something theoretical about the full water wave equations, and which will be future more complicated. And here, I just show you the preliminary results about the computation of the dimensional stream operator in quasi-periodic setting. So, in the future, we hope to use this to compute the We hope to use this to compute the full water wave problem. Maybe also we can add the variable photon boundary in that case. And that's all for today. Thank you very much.
