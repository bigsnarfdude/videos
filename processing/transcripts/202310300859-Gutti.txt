On our different fields of the both from the astrophysics from the statistics side and some issues from astrostatistics from the astronomy side. Our first speaker, Yogesh Pablo, is from Pennsylvania State University, Penn State, and he's going to be talking about the resurgence of the cross-disciplinary field of astrostatistics. Thank you. I should present your history. I shall present a historical perspective of the rapid growth of astrostatistics. Many of the concepts of statistics had roots in astronomy and for example this Galileo's Galileo's Galileo's data analysis had basic rudiments of rudiments of least absolute deviation method. Legendre, Laplace, Gauss developed least squares regression and normal error theory and so on. In the 19th century and 20th century, statistics moved towards human sciences. Despite centuries of closed associations between the two fields, the question was broken and the astronomers moved towards astrophysics because of the power of electromagnetism development and with quantum mechanics and so on. Quantum mechanics and so on. So, astronomers and statisticians substantially broke contact. Modern observational astronomy has been characterized by, is it possible to make it small? I cannot see this. Continue, I will work on that. This part. This is important. Oh, I see. Okay. So, okay, that's good. That's good. Thanks. Modern observational astronomy has been characterized by an enormous growth in data petabytes of data. LSST is expected to bring in several petabytes of data. Several petabytes of data each month. So, enormous footprint of statistics and machine learning methods in astronomy literature, though most of the increase in the last few years is in machine learning. Only about 400 papers per year had in astronomy in this ADS data set, ADS database, about Database: about 400 had mention of statistics, but about 1300 per year in the past decade had machine learning in their capstas. The growth of meteorological problems in astronomy motivated the first cross-disciplinary conferences at Penn State. It. Eric and I organized the first one in 1991. I think David was there. I don't remember. Tom Loredo was the one who attended all of them from the beginning. And he was the proponent of Bayesian statistics for astronomers. And the idea was to bring in astronomers and statisticians together and And see how to help each other. So, for the first one, 50% of the attendants were from astronomy side and 50% were from statistics side. Many statisticians like Brad Efrant, Peter Pickle, they all attended this. I think maybe out of curiosity. So, in the beginning, it was a struggle because of language barrier between these two fields. Staticians had hardly any idea of what's going on in astronomy. Astronomers had any idea of what's going on in statistics. So, they had to talk to each other. And the format we had in the first one was as one of One of the astronomers give a talk and statisticians comment on it and see what kind of methods that can be used. Alternatively, statisticians propose some of their methods and see whether astronomers can use any of them. Since then, we had this every five years at Penn State until 2011. In 2016, CMU organized this. CMU organized the conference. Then the pandemic hit us, so we had to go virtual in 2021. This year, in June, we had in-person conference at Penn State. This all started, business of astrostatics all started with Eric Fagelson visiting me in the late 80s. He talked to in the statistics department, we had a consulting center and he had some problem in astronomy. He wanted to talk to some statisticians. I was the I joined Penn State in 1985. They pointed to me and saying that he is fresh off from he came fresh off from the boat so he can. Fresh off from the boat, so he can go and talk to him. Others were not willing to talk to him at that time. So he came to me with a problem: there's some regression. There are several types of regressions. What is the best one? So we discussed and then we had a problem in understanding each other. Again, like astronomy versus statistics problem. So we spent a several time, several Times discussing issues involved in that, and that's how we became very close friends and started working on several problems. He educated me on astronomy, and I educated him on statistics. That culminated into a book in late 90s. I think it was published in 1996. That was the time we coined the term astro statistics. When we published this book. When we publish this book by the same name. In 2003, Center for Astro Statistics was created at Penn State to facilitate development and promulgation of statistical expertise in astronomy and astrophysics. The activities of Center were multifaceted and we started in 2005 by Started in 2005, a series of summer schools. We had it almost every year, except during the pandemic, in June, at Wednesday, sometimes two schools, one in astronomy, astrostatistics, one in astroinformatics. And the basic idea is to foster new cross-disciplinary collaborations. We published a book in 2012 to essentially give astronomers idea of what is available out there in statistics and how to access them and with some statistical computing using R. Since then with the there Since then, there is a strong growth in the field. We had several groups organized short training courses, Penn State and also in Mexico, China, India, Germany, and I think Ashish organizes some in astroinformatics and so on. There were several cross-disciplinary collaborations started. Disciplinary collaborations starting at Harvard, David Van Dyke, Carnegie Mellon, Larry Wassiman, Tinaves, Schaefer and so on, Penn State, NASA Ames Stanford and Stanford collaboration that I forgot his name, Sculpt was from NASA Ames. And Jean-Luc Stark and Don Ho collaborated on Danaho collaborated on image processing, corner collaboration, done so far. Trying to know. Caltech, CMU, and PIN State collaborated on some virtual observatory initiatives and we developed a web-based And we developed a web-based computing not only gives you, you don't need to know the R language or any programming, it's a web-based computing and it not only gives you the answer to many of the problems, estimates and so on, but also it gives you, if you click on a button, it gives you the all-port behind it. We started with a very small number of In 1971, Lindenburg came up with their that is one of the earlier ones came up with their estimate of truncated data, how to estimate of distribution of truncated data. And Woodrow gave you a theoretical support for that. A theoretical support for that. Plum Scarger periodogram was published in, Scarger published his paper in 1982. It had thousands of citations. We started statistical challenges in modern astronomy in 1991. The term astro statistics was coined in 1996. ADU meetings started in 2001, that is, astronomical. 2001, that is astronomical data analysis meetings jointly organized by Fian Murta and Jean-Luc Stark, and they were held I think every three years. First astro statistics program at SAMHSI was held in 2006. SAMHSI was instrumental in developing the collaborations among the astronomers and special teachers. It provided a basic A basic location where we could meet together for months or weeks or a semester long programs so that we could discuss and start new collaborations. International Astro Statistical Association was formed in 2010. Anita is currently the president of that. The president of that modern status, our book was published in 2012, and starting in 2012, many astronomical societies like IAU, AAS and statistical societies like ASA and ISI had special interest groups, formed special interest groups in those big associations. ISA's international status. International Statistical Institute, Astro Statistics Special Interest Group was formed in 2017 when they had their meeting in Morocco. Let me elaborate on the statistics, astrostatistics at SAMC. SAMC Statistics and Applied Mathematical Sciences Institute, it had its own building in research triangular. In Research Triangular Park in Naka Garana. First one was held in 2006. It's a semester-long program, started with introductory lectures and then several groups were formed and they had their own discussions every week. And people from different fields came and in-house stayed there for two or three weeks, some stayed for Two, three weeks, some stayed for the whole semester. This program brought together many statisticians, computer scientists, physicists, and so on, astronomers and so on. And it also launched many careers of many statisticians and astronomers. David Sterning was one of the postdocs there, and David Jones was one of the posts. David Jones was one of the postdocs. Tuck was postdoc. Tuck now is a faculty at Penn State. The first astrostatistics program focused on Bayesian statistics, exoplanets and particle physics. This was notice that this was in 2006. Exoplanets were discussion on exoplanets were at a preliminary stage. So like we are developing methods that are Methods that are expected to be fruitful for LSST. At that time, Eric Ford and others were thinking about what kind of data we are expected to get and how to handle those data sets. That was the discussion at that time. And Kepler data started coming in 2013 and so on. There was a second There was a second program. It's a sub-program of a bigger program at SAMSI. It's called Statistical and Computational Methodology for Massive Data sets focused on the search for transience sparsity, synaptic surveys, graphical models, and graphical processes. Eric Ford held a Ford held a two-week long program in summer of 2013 on Kepler data. Then in 2016-2017 academic year, we had year-long program and statistical methods, statistical, mathematical and computational methods for astronomy. There, we focused on time-domain astronomy. We focused on time-domain astronomy, pulsar timing arrays to detect gravitational waves. This was before the gravitational waves are actually announced, selection effects for gravitational waves and so on. The program was timely in the sense that first gravitational wave was detected in 2015, September 14, but it was not But it was not announced until the following January. We had a planning committee meeting in 2015, September 21st. That's one week after it was detected. Many LIGO scientists were in the meeting. They had to keep mum about the discovery of the gravitational wave because of NSF proposed rules. NSF imposed rules. So we were not aware of that, but it was timely because of that. And it was finally announced on February 11, 2016. There is a recent resurgence in astro statistics. There is a growth in 5% volume classification, regression. Regression exoplanet Bayesian methods are growing very fast. Machine learning is one of the fastest growing field in astronomy. Random forest, deep learning is another area which is growing very fast. So astro statistics future is secure because it's in the hands of ang generation here. On the hands of an generation here. Ben and others are pursuing it, Jesse, Sarah, David, and so on. I think with that, I'll stop. Thank you. Excellent, we have plenty of time for questions. So apparently that's not recording. Before that, apparently I've got to stop recording. We're all doing this.
