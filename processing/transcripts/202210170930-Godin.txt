Christopher for now just there's some people coming in so Christophe uh Elot will give us a workshop um and and I imagine we will be participating right um if there are any questions from from the people on zoom just put your hand up i can also help interrupt if that's necessary or something Interrupt if that's necessary or something. And yeah, let's go. Thank you, Christopher. Thanks. Yeah, first disclaimer. So I'm not a biologist and I'm not even working on trees full time or on plants. So it's like a hobby for me. So I'm a physicist by training, but I'm in mechanical engineering most of the time. And yeah, usually when I do topics about plants, Topics about plants related to mechanical engineering in some way. And this thing I'm going to talk about is not even a work in progress, it's just an idea. So we did some work with your head during the trip here. Hopefully, it lasted a long time. So we had to do a few things. And also, uh and also the this idea starts with discussion with uh bruno bruno who's online you see so maybe they can they can help at some point and feel free to interrupt me and uh to correct me etc uh so the before starting uh i want to start with this uh code so uh So it looks like the Okan razor, or a few scientists said things similar. But what is interesting is that this sentence has been made by Mencken, was journalism, and it was about American politics, in fact, on more than one hundred years ago. It's not a new thing. But I think it applies to modelling. It applies to modeling. And so, today, what I want to do is show through an example what I don't even know if I'm a modeler, but what a guy like me can do. Yeah, so we will use an example, and this example is trees, and in particular, the branches that are almost horizontal. So, the lowest branches of So, the lowest branches of a tree, and you can see on this large oak that these branches have a sort of S shape. And the question is, can we explain it or can we say something about it by invoking mechanical engineering? And there are other examples. So, sometimes it happens when there is some opening or Is some opening or but I don't think it's universal. So some trees don't have this sort of shape, not really. And I don't think there is any beta or if there is, I don't know, but maybe Reno can correct me if I'm wrong. And so for the mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineer that I am. There is a nice paper with actually a mathematical result, and it's a famous one. So, the first author is Joe Keller. So, he's a famous applied mathematician. And in this paper, the problem that we're interested in is given a certain volume of material, what is the best shape to have the highest column? And when you want to find Pro the when you want to fight the claim due to spelt rate, okay. And the result is actually, I mean, the paper is very hard to read, and there is not a single figure. So I made a figure for you. So the idea is that the idea is that you can compare a column with uniform cross-section. With uniform cross-section to the optimal column. And this optimal column is about twice as high. And it has this profile. So it's pointly at the top. Here it's almost cylindrical. And in between, you have the shape. And so the problem you are solving is about the same mentor, the same Young's modulus, the same Modulus, the same cross-section. So the only thing you vary here is the size of the cross-section. But whatever the cross-section, whether it's circular, square, I-D, whatever, it works because it's not really important. But to find this, that's very difficult calculation. I'm not trying to try to explain it. But the interesting thing is that when you look at the top, so it's very pointy, and you have a So it's very pointy, and you have the scaling load between the radius and the distance from the top with the three alpha variants. But it's not optimizing just being the tallest, it also has to be tallest with a constant volume. So these two are the same volume. Yeah, but like I could make across section there make a really thin hair going up. So these two are at the critical height height or buckling. Buckling, okay. Now here to you, when I saw this image, I thought we had to have the Bosch 95 in by the toilet skyscraper. No, it's it um just just from the outside. Maybe I don't think. Maybe maybe it's a country, yeah. Okay, so this is nice, but this is not what clients do. The related study from Thomas Magnon is given a cross-section this time, what is the optimal length of a considerable beam, such as the horizontal. Such that the horizontal extension is maximum. So here you have a photograph of the experiment. You have a rubber tube and you try to calculate what is the optimal length, such that the horizontal extension for the extreme point on the left is maximum. And you see, like there is an optimal. When you increase the length after that, then it comes back to the right. And so I'm going to explain it on board, this calculation and how it can be related to another problem. But here it's the constant intersection and the question is what is the optimal length? So it's a starting point. So here you can do calculations and it's easy and I'm going to show you on board. Of course it's very far from what plants do. So that's why Plants doom. So that's where the modeling part goes into better, okay? Is it clear why the first problem is super difficult to solve? The second one is a bit more easy, and that there is a sort of intuitive explanation of that. Okay, this one could be very difficult if you allow for a variational cross-section. Then it becomes almost as hard as the first one. But here, the cross-section is the same. You're just optimizing the scalar of the length. But you could do the same with the, let's say, Same with the let's say if you have a given volume of material and a given shape of the cross-section, what is the optimal shape? You probably find something similar to that, but it's not exactly the same problem, so it's not exactly the same shape. Why is this problem particularly difficult? Okay, so because for a given shape, you have to compute the modes of the buckling, and there is not only one but infinity, and then you have to. But infinity, and then you have to find the most unstable of this mode. And you are trying to find the eigenvalue associated to this mode. This is what you try to minimize. So you are trying to minimize the eigenvalue of an eigenvalue problem while the shape is entering through an integral problem. So yeah, it's calculus a variation, but I invite you to look at the paper here, put it on the chat, and you, yeah, you. It on the track, and you, yeah, do you start like perpendicular at the base? Do you have to constrain your shape? Yeah, yeah, no, it's just comes out. Yeah. But actually, I have to make this drawing. Yeah. So this one is accurate. It's from a picture of the paper. But I had to read like 10 papers on the subject because it's only applied mathematicians. So apparently the So, apparently, the notion of figures does not exist now. We're talking about the shape of the column, but there is no figure for you. So, that cross-section is not a triangle, right? And it has sort of a circular cross-section. The longitudinal cross-section of that. No, no, it's top. It's not. It's stopped like the bottom. At the bottom, it's perpendicular to the ground. Okay, perfect. And at the top, it's curved. Yeah, perfect. With a burler that has. I wasn't sure I saw that. And in between, you have changed compatibility, like an inflection point. Yeah, it's curved this way, and then it's curved. And yeah, so you could do the same sort of calculation in this case. To my knowledge, it has not been done. It could be a first, at least it's new. But I was saying, yeah, if you if you want to sort of convince people working on trees, maybe it won't be enough to show what is the best. Show what is the best shape of the column that you prefer aggregate, and then you sort of put it horizontally, and it has a largest extension. And so for me, the main reason is that when you do that, there is no growth. There is no history of growth. And growth has two parts. Because you have Cambium, and you have both primary. You have both primary and secondary growth. So, what you want to describe is what is the optimal primary growth and what is the optimal secondary growth, such that at a given time, the branch has the maximal extension. Or maybe it's not a problem you want to solve. Maybe maximum extension is not an issue, but then I have to give another talk. Let's say you have a tree that is growing near a It's drawing near a lake or the sea. So I think the maximal extension is good because it reaches light. And the problem will be the way. So you have to fight the weight. But trees, so trees are secondary growth, they are primary growth. They can orient the growth due to tropism. The material is aging, so the procrastination are not the same. And on top of that, the load. The load is applied as it grows. I mean, the load increases as the growth occurs. So the newly added layers of the secondary growth do not bear any load when they are added. And so all of this makes things very complicated. And so the I think it's a good example to think about what modeling is or what this sort of model can do. In fact, because there is a full complexity of what nature does, and then there is what we can do, and basically you have to make trade-offs. But for me, the trade-offs is not just the matter of what I can do or what software I'm using or what tools I have in my toolbox. The trade-off is really what is the question. Trade-off is really what is the question I want to address, and this is everything should depend on that. So, what is exactly the problem I want to address? And so, in this case, the way to formulate it would be to say I made the hypothesis that natural selection has the selective growth strategies that allow branches. Strategies that allows branches to grow, if not optimally near optimally horizontally. The question I'm asking is then, if I find the mathematical optimal, is it close to what I can measure on the real screen? So when you do that, you have to do some modeling choices because you cannot take the full complexity. You have to choose which method, and so that sort of, I mean, it turns around. I mean, it turns around what this meeting is about. So, at what scale are you modeling your branch? Are you modeling each individual cell, or do you have a wanted description of the beam or something in between? And then, given these two, you can have an output or an objective. In this case, we are talking about optimization. So, the objective would be what do you optimize for? optimize for and what do you optimize for which with which contraint constraint so do you optimize for maximal remote extension with a given volume or with a given growth flow so you say each year you have a certain amount of value mass of food that you can allocate wherever you want that sort of thing this is a constraint and then And then, once you have done that, it all points out to what you will be able to measure, what you will be able to output in your model, and how you can be compared to data and what will be a measure of success. And I think everything is a link here and it's not a linear thing, and you have to think all of that together. And so, basically, that means that for each question, you have a new model. So, I'm not an advocate for. So, I'm not an advocate for universal software that could model everything. I think each question basically should have almost its own model. Okay, so that being said, now we can do this on goal. So, let me tell me if you can see otherwise. So, let me try to explain what what Thomas McMahon did with computation of the beam, the length of the beam with a maximum horizontal extinction. So the idea is like have a beam. Can't you have a beam? So it's attached to a wall with a given angle and then it has a shape. Then it has a shape which is due to the own weight of the beam. So here we have an angle called the theta naught. Then I have a coordinate along the beam S at each point I have an angle here which should be a theta s and the beam has a length which is the l. which is the L okay and uh then you just use the beam beam equation so what you what you write is that the bending modulus times the curvature at a given point so this is the moment applied to the right Apply to the right of the point of the ring. If you are here, you have to. This would be equal to the sum of the moment of all the waves forced along the length here. It would be the integral between S and N of the level R. So you have a here at the direction check. The direction x, we have to go to x minus this is the level on times the mass times the mass of a is the area g sine. So actually we can differentiate this and this is the This and this is the curvature of the derivative of the angle with respect to s and you differentiate that we want to get something easier to understand that the second derivative of the angle which is the derivative of the curvature is equal to the sum of forces along this between the place where you are and the The place where you are in the end. This would be L minus S times B. So this is the weight of the part of the beam between S and L. And then, so this is the force which is the vertical. And you have to project it along the direction which is parallel to the normal, to the line. To the with the light, where you have a cos theta in okay. I don't know if you know this, you know this or not, but it's just came to the fact that when you when you have uh when you when you zoom in, you have your middle line, you have your your section, you have here the force that will be applied would be the sum of all the weights of all the rest of the beam. On this part, the first approximation is that you have the opposite force. That you have the opposite force, and this will have to equilibrate with the internal moment. But the left part of the beam is not on the right part, so that means that you have a moment like this. So, this is the this means that the derivative of the moment is proportional to the projection of the force. Of the force along the normal or the middle line. This is what we write on the middle. Actually, this is easier to integrate. Here, the thing is that this is work, it's written with dimensions. But what we want to do is get rid of this dimension and think about how things scale. Because we don't want to solve this problem for every single value of the young address, but So the first idea is to normalize the length by L. Okay, this is what we do. So we say that theta of the new variable is S divided by L. And now I want to put that into this equation. So if I do that, I will have EI. Then here I have a second derivative with. Yeah, I have a second derivative with respect to s. So this has the dimension of one of the squared. Now let's add a second derivative with respect to the new variable theta here to be a factor one minus theta rho g a plus equal to When I do that, I have covered all the dimensions here and here and here. So actually, I have a single number which covers all these dimensions. And it's a dimensionless number because over it is without dimension. And so I can write it second derivative of theta equals k representation of MacNorman one minus theta. one minus eta cos theta and this k is rho g l cube rho g rho g l cube divided by e i and this number has no dimension. And so, it's interesting. So, I have this equation, and now I have this dimensionless number that tells me basically how the weight is balanced by the bending rigidity. So, when k is large, I'm expecting a very large bending and something like that. The bending and something like this with k is very large, and on the contrary, if k is small, I'll have something that is basically straight and weight doesn't anymore. Okay, and this is what this number is. But that does not really solve my problem yet. So, the question is now so I'm doing the sort of I will sort of go away from the paper of McMahon, which is slightly different because he considers the constant cross-section. We consider that the only unknown here is L. So he's trying to find what is the optimal L when everything L is given. What I want to solve is slightly different. To compare with the tallest colour of the colour, what I want to do is constrain the volume and trying to see what is the aspect ratio that is optimal for given. Show it is optimal for given volume. I want to introduce the volume in K. Fine. Yeah, the volume is fixed. And I'm trying to, for a given volume, the question is: what is the best aspect ratio of the beam to have a maximum horizontal extension? So the volume is a section time L and I want to introduce the NASPEC ratio that we call alpha to be A divided by something by the unit of cross-section so involving B so it could be B. involving v so it would be v to the power two third so this would be my expectation they said y uh okay this is in uh this is meter squared oh okay so i need uh this uh this module actually correct another something dimensional but yeah we need a yeah but just a dimension uh so if i So, if I express k like this, and I will do something else. So, here is the second moment of inertia that you need when you do the beam rigidity. The dimension of the length is to the power of four and depend on the area. So, it's proportional to the area squared, and the prefactor is in fact linked to the shape. The shape means it's circular shape, it's one of the balls, I think, squarely was one of the six, whatever. And so, depending on the shape, you have a different factor, but you have, but this I would call it beta. It's geometrical times a squared. So, this is in the dimension of the length of the power of four. So, beta is a sort of. sort of cross-sectional cross-section shape so when I put all that together so I want in K I want to have only dimensionless number and B so what I want to get rid of A L L and I so I have row G so yeah so I have a little explain yeah so Z and then I have L square so L maybe I should write here here if I can write it alpha times So I think that L is V to the power one third divided by alpha. Okay, so I have A L is V and then I have L squared and L squared is, let's say, D two current. These two currents as I did by the start curve and here I have E beta and A squares will be alpha squared D for the and so here I have And so here I have V five row and here V four third. So if I take, if I separate things with dimension, things without dimension, I'll have rho g v one third divided by e. This is dimensionless. This is the dimension of the length. So basically here you have something modulated pressure, like E. And then you have And then you have one over alpha to the power of four and the beta. And so this is K. So K so dimensionless. Yeah, so this colour. So, this number is dimensionless. I can give it a name, and it's related to the properties of the material and to the volume that is fixed. And here, alpha is something that I try to optimize. So, this I can give it again, the name, the gamma, and this is the alpha power point. And so now, so this is the Um, so this is the k that is here. So, k is the gamma divided by half part to the power four. Uh, so when I change it, I change the shape. But what I want to optimize, in fact, is a lamp, it's a real lamp. And so this length is a dimension, okay? And so for the lamp, I have to do the same exercise. I have to separate what I know and what I optimize for. The parameters I know and the parameters are optimized. I know it's a parameter document. So I expect to do it in the right bar. So when I have my V, when I want to find this distance, so we call it X N. What I do, in fact, is that each part here is the protection of the Protection of the depending on the angle. So you have to integrate the cosine of the angle theta between zero and one. And when you add dimension, you have to multiply by L. So L okay, so you find theta in this. We come back to how you integrate this numeric. You want your beta everywhere, you integrate, and you have an x. Here you have an L. Okay, and so this L has to be replaced by something related to quantity we know and the album. And so we are going to use this as well. There's a question here. Are you sure it's the test? That's the first point. In the experiments, if you yeah, it overshoots, it's having come back, but with this equation, you cannot come back with the equation when you reach when the cost is zero, but you know, you cannot come, you cannot, in this equation, you can't do, you would have to split it in two domains. If there's an extreme path shape, is that where you're sort of thinking about? Oh, and the curl side. Sure. The extra one is here and this quick answer is to say that this does not occur for the moment. I think it never couldn't. I think it kind of couldn't because it can because the secondary because you need to change sign where it varies. Yeah, because this would be negative and yeah, you can use the curvature of yeah. Use in the curvature, but yeah, very poor thing. Yeah, you have a monotonous change of curvature, and here the curvature has to be zero. So, if sign change time, it doesn't work. We don't need that. So, now we have this. So, what we want to do is replace this. we want to do is replace this L by things we know, we don't know. So L again is e to the power one per divided by n terms. This is not exactly what I want. So I want what I would like to do is adding only one parameter, which is K. I would like to change K, see what shape I get. Then adding a curve that tells me what is the X depends on K in this. So I wanted to introduce K here. So what I want to do is actually. So, what I want I want to do is actually replace alpha by gamma is the whole. So, to use this formula, we say how it should be one four. Okay, one four one four three one third let me like I'm further by okay so once I have this here uh k sort of parameter I'm paying with so you can see that here when I increase k I get more curvature so there is more burning it's not very good. It's not very good. But yeah, when I increase K is good because it can reach longer points. Despite what I was saying, the kilometer scale is small and it can be large. And so when I have this, actually, I can download the over. The only thing you need is to solve numerically the equation like this here. And I can tell you we know how to do it. In fact, it's quite easy. And the result should be that I can plot in the end K here. Is it a problem that you have volume and volume handling in gamma as well? Gamma has also gamma gamma and no, it's not it's not important that volume is gamma because volume is the parameter space. Volume is the parameter of space. And so, what I'm going to conclude as a function of k is the value of what is on the right here when I remove V and gamma. So, here, if I plot X times gamma one four divided by B one pro. I'm expecting a sort of maximum. This maximum occurs for a certain value of k. And here I put x, the maximum extension, but it's it's uh sort of normalized by quantity that are fixed. Whether I'm optimizing a really lengthy meter whether whether I'm optimizing this quantity is the same. Okay, so this is really the maximum and the form. So, the question is: how do you find this curve in numerous G? How do you integrate this equation? And the answer is that you start out away from what we call a shooting method. So, what you do is actually. Start at the end. So at the end, because there is no moment and no tension, the curvature is zero. But what you don't know at the end is the angle. You have sort of to guess what is the angle at the end. Here you take an angle, which is the guess. And then you can integrate this equation because if you know the angle. The angle theta, you know that theta prime is zero, and here you have an equation for theta double prime, so it means that you can integrate back towards the zero. And what the guess, I mean, the idea is to find the guess that makes the angle here. It tells you when you have the length that is exactly one. This is a sort of adaptive way to do it. In fact, a simpler way to do it. You can see that, in fact, K here plays a role of re-normalization of the length. What you can do is start with the get, integrate until you reach zero. This will occur for something different than one. Will occur for something different than one, but this line here is actually linked to the value of k. So you do it the opposite. Instead of guessing for a given value of k, you look at how the k depends on the guess. This will be true. This theta guess will be true for a given k. So you do it in this order and then you don't have to guess if you do work. So you span from, let's say, minus pi over 2. Minus pi over two and three zero. And for all these angles, you have all the values of k. And so each time you find the curve, you can calculate this integral. And so you find this curve like this. And that's it. So the next thing now is to look at the scaling. So K is that what is written here. So K is Is rho g let's keep here. So, here i will write it again as e beta the magical factor that is on the cross section. So, instead of a square and a here, so we have only one a so and this um so for the for the optimal beam, this are the value. As a value, let's say 1.3 or value of something. So it's a user scalar that you compute with this. And what you get, in fact, is that in order to reach it, is that the length and the area, the cross-section area, should change in a way that this ratio is constant. Constant, so you find exactly the same. Uh, uh, yeah, the three alpha. I mean, yeah, if you look at the power is a ratio of three between the length and the area, if you look at the radius, it's the power three alpha. So it's the same power as the power you get at the tip of the polarized column, the power you find when you look at what is the beam that resists the cling due to its own weight. To its own weight, that's and that's what you find in many applications in nature. That was cared the size of the femur in animals, that was cared the size of nails, but you buy a basically the inertia, like because we're considering that was a form of I, right? That's where it comes in. The beta, yeah, beta is a beta is a domain minimum parameter. A domain parameter which I divided by a square meter. So, so if you have a circular cross-section of the domain value, it's a rectangular or triangular or whatever, it's another one. But this is just a number that depends on the shape of the cross-section. Yeah, but this is the assumption here. Yeah, it's a geometric hypothesis that the Hypothesis is that the shape of a cross-section doesn't change. It can be anything. It can have a flower shape or whatever. I can still compute the eye. But this flower shape can be maintained. So it's different sizes, but the shape. Yeah, so basically you find the scaling like this. So again, this is also what you get when you look at the scaling. When you look at the scaling of the radius and length of things that need to resist the bugging. So yeah, it's a native. I didn't find the picture, but Maglon the Senge wrote the paper. He actually had a book, which is on the size and line, okay, the title. Yeah, and there are plenty of examples. And one of the examples is the next you can buy. The main you can buy in the store. So they range from a fraction of a centimeter to 20 centimeters. And you can see that the small name is not, I mean, geometrically, they're not the same. The radius increase more than the length. And in fact, exactly like this, when you plot, when you log the length against the radius, you find this really an exponent of this allometry, which is the three resistant set working. And so you find the same here. And so, yeah. Well, basically, that's what I wanted to explain. So I think maybe I can take a question so we can talk about how to start from there or from something else and go to something that is more like a growing branch. Because here is no growth, there is no tapering, there is no branching, there is no secondary growth, there is no... No secondary growth or something. Are there any questions from the comments? We didn't talk about this S shape because we began. Okay. The question is: what do you need to get the answer? I'm not sure I have the answer, but. So now you have broken. So you have something like this. The question is that you are going to add some material here. We have some weight. So first effect is that the weapon will bend down. Then you also add the material here. So the question, if you keep on bending down when you add material, you want to... Bending down when you add material, you want to get to S. So, in order to get to S, I don't think I have exactly the answer, but you can either add this piece with a certain angle here, have some kind of tropism of the primary world, or the two are not excluded, or you can have for preception or you can have a response, you can have the secondary growth. Secondary growth will induce torque because you have reaction mood and it will change the curvature. So you can have both. My guess is that both will give you a nice shape and you don't need both to get an S shape. Each one of them could give you a nice shape. So biologically, do we agree that, like, I mean, this is the end point, right? You see a branch latens, but for A branch like this, but for it to have grown like that, I don't think there's ever a moment that the branch was growing downwards, right? I mean, if we could have gone, you like rewind time and you would have looked at the dynamics of this structure. As you said, like the reason it bends down is because it buckles on its weight. It doesn't, the primary growth never grew downwards. Do we agree with that? So, so, so, so, trees, they grow from the tip, right? Yeah, um, and so if you would go back in time, right, it's not that we would have this line going back in time, right? You would actually have the tip is always sort of trying to move upwards. At a certain moment, it starts sagging, creeping, whatever, and it it it falls on its own weight, and then this, you know, it starts to. And then this, you know, it starts to strengthen itself, right? And then you have that little part going up. So the history seems to be super pertinent somehow. Yeah, I agree. I'm just dabbling here. I don't know. That's what, I mean, we are saying, I think we're saying the same thing when I tell you that growth is important. I mean, and different. That's completely different from this because here you have both time and space. And basically, instead of having a ODE, you have a PD. OD, you have a PE. You need to solve this PE with something. It grew part, it grew the fit, but it's sad because the rest was just end. Okay, but there are two ways to do that. So either you grow here and you sort of impose a curvature here, and then when you add into this curvature that is originally in this direction, because you will be adding weight, it will. Adding weight, it will bend and finally be in this direction. And so this point will be the same as this point at some point, for some growth. Exactly. And so that's why I said one of my guesses that you only need the trophism, so you only need to induce a finite curvature at the end, which is a clock to get something with the edge-shaped results. But you could also say that because. I could also say that because of the sort of population in this part, you create a video, you have to overshoot. Basically, you have a curvature of number one, say negative, and you have to overshoot to have something that is positive. So, procreation does not exactly do that usually for a single shoot. But yeah, it's a bit different. But yeah, it's a bit different. Secondary growth, so the models that people have used to include both trophism and co-perception are not relevant exactly because the secondary growth doesn't need to have the same mechanism as a primary growth. There are questions online. Oh, there's online. Raised his hand much for me, so he's first your mic, your mic. Thank you. My first question is, so is this calculation done under the assumption that in the absence of gravity, this branch would be straight? Yes, the calculation I'm making. So, the question is whether if a plant tries to really optimize how far the branch can reach, whether it would not be a good idea to have some curvature, some rest curvature, so that basically in the absence of gravity, it would tend to curve upwards, but then gravity would make it to a more horizontal position. Yes, so the question will be: you have a beam of constant per section, but you can vary the sort of tree strength, the natural curvature along the beam. Correct. Looking at what is the best function to natural curvature, that's what you have the maximum extension. Is that correct? It is correct. And probably there is some cost of having a natural curve. Having natural curvature not zero, but still it may result in a longer reach than my guess is that if you have if the anchor point is the horizontal, then probably the best curvature is such that when you add weight, you have a straight uh a straight beam. I think Bruno wants to say something. This is what we observed actually when we keep some axes growing on the horizontal and so they sag a little bit under the self-weight. But after that, we let them react and then suppress the sensing of orientation versus gravity. And then they're going to try to take very straight because they're sensing the curvature, the actual curvature. Maha made this point clearly. Maha made this point clearly. And so they correct it much more. And then they come back to a very straight and horizontal, I mean, and completely straight, not bending anymore. So they have produced interesting curvature that is just compensating the bending on the sulphoid. And that's what we observe actually experimentally. I mean, and so it means, so that's properception exactly on run. It weighs, it corrects. Ways it corrects for not being straight as long as you leave it enough time to grow. Just not overshoot the straight line. Straight, but you don't have the opposite character. So you can no? If you want to have an S shape, you need some. No, for S shape, it's not a topic, actually. The easiest thing is actually to think that, as you said, that the To think that, as you said, that the tip is growing. I mean, its primary growth is very fast and it stays to a steady state, which is with a given angle to the tropic angle, let's say a set point angle. And this is always the case. So any steps in growth in length is going to give you the same angle. And then any curvature is fixed by the addition of the new layers. Of the new layers due to secondary growth. It means that the cell wall, when it's which is primary cell wall in the secondary growing cambium, it's getting molded around because it's kind of viscous, and then it's straightened up. And so it blocks any curvature, which means that with this time of process, straight feature or straight axis is unstable. Axis is unstable because any curvature is going to be fixed. And so you have to, so that's what you see. You see there in the S shape because of the two mechanism. And if you want to see S anything else on the L shape, you have to have a regulation, something that feeds back and make it straighter. And that's the point. So it's been published long ago, this S shape. You can see them in all the axes that don't grow a lot. Conifers do a lot on. Conifers, like do a lot on that on the basis. And as you pointed rightly, Christophe, there are many branches that can escape because they regulate a lot and they grow in girth and able to make active changes in curvature, in intrancy curvature, like Shemek was saying. So I have heard kind of well to comment that at the end, the end result of this, though, is that the branch is well on the tree. It is well on the tree, has this kind of quite straight position, but it is it has a straight position under gravity. If you because if you chopped it and turned it upside down, then it would have a very different curvature. So, yeah. I have one more question, if I may. So, to what extent, if like, because three is definitely optimizing something, but to what extent the criteria is. Optimizing something, but to what extent the criterion that it is trying to optimize the reach of lateral branches is actually a valid criterion. Because in a sense, one could say that what tree is trying to do is to maximize photosynthesis. And well, it may have different strategies for this. A good example of this is that a tree may produce short shoots, as often as they do, which have lots of leaves. Which have lots of leaves nearby, which one could say, well, they kind of shape each other. However, there is quite cheap for the tree to produce the branches with separaties because the head can be short. And also, well, shading is not necessarily such a bad thing because it may prevent saturation. So, overall, this of course complicates things and which would take away from the beauty of this presentation. Away from the beauty of this presentation, which we had. But having said this, there is a question to what extent the reach of the horizontal reach of branches is a good criterion for optimality. I mean, my answer, which is not the real answer, my comment about that is that if you look at the lowest branches, which are also old and usually long. I mean, they cannot sag on the weight of the weight they meet the ground. So it may not be the maximum horizontal extent, but it may be the fact that you don't want them to go down below the ground. So you want to... Denny's the same as having a... It's the lowest branches that need to go furthest to self-avoid their own shadow. Their own shadow, also, yeah, right. So, the options are easy if this is what Channel could say. Yeah, you want a growth spurt that happens like when it's not always triggered, but in certain circumstances, in shade, branches can actually trigger a growth spurt accounted evenly. So, we grow faster actually in shade than we grow like in the south. That's why you have the lower ones. So, but yeah, but this usually, yeah, but it's not so much horizontal, it's more like upwards, but it can also be horizontal. So, even like showing what you just suggested, like, I think like when it comes to the phenomenon of shape avoidance, I think it will still be valid essentially to maximize photosynthesis to grow very fast to possibly get out of shadow. Yeah, but okay, my point also is that there is they're going to go fast, but you've got They want to go fast, but you don't want to. When there's a ground here, so you want to be eaten by the ground touch the ground and then they go back up. Bruno? Yes, just two comments here. Well, the first is true that there are some branches below the crown. That's the one that has the maximum. That's the one that has the maximum extent, and usually you see that the end they can kind of surround the shape of the crown and so reach the light. But still, I wanted to point out that from a biological perspective, it's got Chemek was wondering this, that many trees actually that do these very large branches, I mean very long branches, actually for a long time they keep them straight and then they suck. And then they sag. And the reason why they sag is actually because they are doing what the arborist call layering or marketing, markotage enfancé. That is, they're going to reach the ground and they're going to root there and make a new tree. And that's many trees do that. Plain trees do that. The green oak do that. And there are many of them. They like gigant strawberry plants. Strawberry plants. You know strawberries? They do this and they go to the ground, touch it, make a root, and do it again. The if, which I don't know where to say in English. If, someone knows the if it's uh sorry, well, it's a dark conifer that do dark all the time, and you can see it, and but the garden. And you can see it, and but the gardeners they ate it, so they prevent it. But when you see very old trees, it's obvious. So, some at some point, actually, it's good for them to sag and reach the ground and hit the ground and grow again. So, that's just a limit to a deep. There are several strategies here, and this is a very common structure, much more common strategy than we think. And I really have a lot of observations and pictures of that. Okay, for the sake of time, I think we. Okay, for the sake of time, I think we discussed for an hour. Are there any concluding remarks or journey questions? So then I really want to thank. Oh, there is a question. I really want to thank the speaker. This was really very interesting and I asked. Okay, and so thank you for everybody that joined us with Zoom. I believe that is it. That is it for the Zoom. Now, what we do have for this afternoon is our breakout sessions.
