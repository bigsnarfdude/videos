Today, I'm going to talk about this. This is based on the joint work with Adam Naiman. And the motivation of this research is very simple. So, first motivation is this. So, characterize a scheme X which is which is isolated projective space, which is a projective scheme associated to polynomial algebra. That is a very old classical question in computed variety geometry. And of course, we can ask something similar in non-computed situations. So, I want to change this to be AS regular. So, this is a non-commutative scheme. The question is, when a non-community scheme is configured to project scheme associated to S regular? Or if Professor Wonder likes, I can add the question. And this was actually answered. Was actually answered by joint work with Uyama a several years ago. So, this tells that the non-commutative question is somehow easier to answer. But I would say that the non-commutative answer is not the answer to the commutative answer because we don't have no idea when a non-commutative scheme is isometric to the commutative scheme. So, this is the first motivation. I don't know. Actually, this one is done, but today I want to do a regular. S regular Z algebra. And why we care about Z algebra was explained in yesterday's talk, I hope. That's today. And in order to do this, I maybe define what is called ASF regular algebra today. That's the first motivation of the talk, of the research. And the second one is more complete. So if So if x is a quadratic surface in P3, so means that x is the polynomial info variable and f is negatively two element. Again, x is one of the following. X is isompix 2, something like this. Something like this, or something like this, or this, and that. And this can be characterized by f. For example, f is in this case, x squared, x squared plus y squared, x squared plus y squared plus z squared, and x squared plus y squared plus z squared plus zero squared. Now, also, uh, we Now, also, we can classify using geometry. So, from here, it's all reduced. And from here, it's integral. And from here, it's smooth. So, there are only four possible quadruple surface in P3F2 isomorphism. A very simple classification. A very simple classification, and the question is something that is true in non-commutable setting. So, again, we're going to change the this to be um this is the uh um four-dimensional and this radian a quadratic is regular algebra and f is not just a degree two elements it must be Degree two elements must be at least normal or in some cases central. I want to see something like this is true in a non-committed world. And the more specific question is this. If, yep, oh, this f is a central element of s. Okay, so in a non-community setting, okay, if x is Okay, if x is smooth and or integral, then x is something like quantum p1 plus. Oh, I should say, okay. So in a commuted case, this is also p1 plus p1. So we want to ask that in a non-commuted setting too, if x is smooth or integral or both, then we can say that x is both a v1 close. X is what's up V1 cross V1. This is a question. And another question is: can you cross Y? That's X. That's the motivation. I will give a partial answer, not a complete answer today. Okay, so maybe I'll say it later, but smooth means that because in the non-computer world, we don't have to. Because in the non-computed world, we don't have geometry, so basically, this tells that the global dimension of the category of coherent shapes over X is finite. That is smooth. And integral means depends on two things. This algebra is domain or F is irreducible. So ultimately, in the computer case, they are the same, but In the computer case, they are the same, but we don't know. Actually, I don't have an answer that this is the equivalent one. So maybe we can just add those assumptions as we need. Okay, so now I will define the Z algebra, which already appeared in yesterday's talk, but I'm going to use some different notations and terminologies, or sometimes definitions are not exactly the same. Definitions are not exactly the same as yesterday's talk, so I would define it. Okay, so a C, which is indexed by C equals Z, is a Z algebra. If the whole in two things is true, one is the multiplication. Application looks like if this number J and S are the same, then it goes to C I T and otherwise zero. So this kind of matrix multiplication and And typically, the algebra do not have a unity, but we assume that each sub-algebra CII has a unity denoted by EI. So it's sounds like that EI. That the EI, so actually, C is a ZR to right one only. If C, there is this isn't what is in some sense complete set of orthogonalized idempotent. So an algebra is a Z algebra I found only if it has a complete Fund only if it has a complete set of orthogonal anti-potents. Or another way is that I said is maybe you can view this as a matrix of infinite size. That's maybe another way to see. And for module, this is the graded write module. I always take write module. This is by definition MJ, the action respects the indices too. So if S equal to T, then that's Mj tensor times S T goes to M T if S is the same as J, but zero otherwise. So that's the definition of great right module, right C module. And we already see two examples in yesterday's talk. So let's see the example which are going to use. Both examples would be used. Yes. Yeah. Okay. One is if A is usual. Is usual great algebra right then? Um, I use a different notation in yesterday's talk, like the a bar a j minus i, and now i and j was moving. This is a z algebra. Algebra. But in this case, the category of this Z algebra grade right module over AA bar is the equivalent to the original category of graded write A modules. So, in this sense, a theory of the algebra contains a theory of Z graded algebra. And another typical example is that if we have objects indexed by Z, so EI is an object in some K linear category, K is some field, K linear category. Then we can define the algebra, which I Algebra which I denote. So this let's call this to be E. Then we can define this is my notation C of E is defined to be. E minus j e minus i so this is in z algebra. Okay, well, we can put actually j and i, which is z algebra, but for the purpose of this my talk, I put minus j and minus i here. These are an example of z algebra. And since because of this example, we might say that all the homological properties of A actually are true for the algebra. And that is very tempting to say. But it's kind of hard to, more harder to tedious to check that structure. Tedious to check that such statements. So there are some differences between Z algebra and Z grade algebra. So for example, let's say Z algebra. And for any this doesn't have me and a positive integer with any integer we can define UZ algebra, which is Use the algebra, which is shift of C by R, which is defined to be C i plus R and J plus R. That is again a Z algebra. And for any graded module C, we can define. We can define M of R. This is the gas shift by R. That's really reasonable. But the point is that this, if we start with the graded right C module, this is not the grade right C module. This is a graded right C shifted by R module. And And this is actually a functor from here to equivalence functor. But this shift is not auto-equivalence in whatever sense. Because this is not the ready to write. Ready to write CMOS. So, this is a shift functor exists, but not automorphism, not all equivalence. Okay, that's one difference. That's actually a problem. And we can define C L R. Now, L is also integer, and this is defined to be C. C I plus L and J plus R for I J in Z. This is not Z algebra anymore unless R equals L. But this is what is called bilated C of R, no C of L C of C O C O bimo. If you forget about those indices or grading, it doesn't really matter, but if you keep track of this grading, we can define like this: this is a biomodule, but the C of R, C of L biomodule. That's another problem we have to be careful. Careful. Yeah. Not all. Oh, sorry. Yeah. Thank you very much. Natalie. Yes, yes. Okay, so please point out if I make a mistake. Right, right, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But the point is that there is a because this and this one are equivalent, there may be a way. If we want to see maybe a way to make it automatic, but there are no canonical way to make it functions to be automatic. But for yeah, this is a great article. Maybe I'll say that maybe this is what mentioned yesterday, but yeah, so we define that maybe like here. We say that maybe I'll just do here. Now we say that C is R periodic. This is by definition C and C of R are isomic as Z algebras. And as in yesterday's talk, if C is coming from this one, I mean grade algebra. I mean, graded algebra, then if and only if C is one periodic. So, in this case, there is a canonical way to build this as a shift of function, I mean, auto equivalence by identifying that this one and one shift. But in general, there are no canonical ways to view the shift functions in auto repurposed. Okay. Okay. Okay, so now we're going to define the AS regular algebra, a Z algebra. So we say that C is, oh, by the way, before doing that, I will make the standard assumption from here. Okay, so from now on, we assume that C is connected. C is connected, which means that Cii is K and C I J is zero for I bigger than J. I think I forgot maybe the other one. Let's see. Yes, I is bigger than J. Okay, so this is the definition of conducted. So in this case, In this case, if this is the case, then we define a PI to be EIC that is all the indicum projectors. And also, we define SI, this is the vision BICEI. That's the That's the OR symbols. And I will say that this has a graded right C module structure, but not the grade left C module structure. This has a grade right C module structure and a grade left C module structure both. So that's also something we have to kill. And there is another assumption that Assumption that we want to make from now on. Second assumption, this is still a continuing assumption. C is a coherent. And I will not define the coherent, but what I want to use is that the category finite should be presented graded right similar. Presented graded right C module is an RVDM category. That's something I want to use. And unfortunately, I won't define what is finitely presented here. But one remark is that if you want to see as a graded write C module, then the only canonical way is just adding these PIs. That's the way we can view C as a graded right symbol canonically, but this is not finitely generated. This is not finitely generated. So, this is another problem we have to be careful. Okay, so now we define the S regular Z algebra. So, we assume that was assumption. C is always conducted and C is graded coherent, whatever it means. Okay, so that we can work on the finite represented category here. So we say that C is A as regular of dimension D and Goldenstein parameters. And also this is the what is called Goldenstein parameter. It's by definition two conditions A A projective dimension of all the samples is the same as D for any that's one first condition. And the second condition is that XQ S I T J is K if Q equals D and J equal I. and j equal i plus l and zero otherwise. That is the very natural generalization of a circular algebra into Z algebra, but I would not use this definition today. I don't know if this is a good idea of doing, but I want to define something so that theory works. For this one, yeah, I don't use it, but it's okay, but I don't have streamlined for new levels or anything. Because basically, I have to work on a coherent first. Okay, so for any graded write module, we can define column M portion part which is the element of M such that C is finite dimensional over K. Over k, the whole individual k vector space as a vector space. And we define that, let's see, torsion module to be the finitely presented module such that Such that this tau m is the same as m. And again, we define different notations. This is defined like a cubile. And this notation is used by my supervisor, Paul Smith. And respecting him, I keep using these notations, but it's Notations, but it's somehow he's using a QGL too. So maybe I am the only one using this notation. Okay, so this is the chaos. So this is the same as QGo in yesterday's talk. And morally, this is the category of overhead shifts over non-commutable projective scheme associated. So this is just a, you know, more or less no sense. You know, more or less males. Okay, so for this setting, we have a very important theorem. That is the key theorem, the local reality theorem. Okay, so by the standard assumption on C, if this tau is finite homological to the Is finite homological dimension, so this is zero for any high q. Then we have a local duality of epsilon. So r tau m star is I would not really say the notation definition of notation, but just something like local reality is true. Cordiality is true. So, this holds for any complex right and so this star is k vector space dual and This tau of C is tau of M is defined on the graded right C module, but actually this has a vibrated C C Y module and this is graded right C module, but Y taken style have graded right C module. So this is one fake is as a left C modules. Okay and so this And so this looks like a dualizing complex. So that's the key theorem we need for the future research. So by motivating by this theorem, we're going to define the ASF regular. Algebra So C is A S F regular of dimension D and G P, the coordinate in front of the L is by definition, yep. This one, not necessarily in this setting, but in the definition A is irregular algebra, this will be closer to the thing in degree one, degree single degree, yeah? For AS regular algebra, yes, but this is for the general, very general. Yeah, just assuming that a connected and coherent and finite homologue. Okay, so uh let's see. And first part is the same. So projective dimension of the simple module is always D for any i. And second part kind of splits into two parts. So first, this dualizing complex is isorphic to C of zero. B of zero, maybe I'll have to look at minus negative L if q equals b or q and zero otherwise. Maybe I'll write down the second condition. And if I write down, then kind of computing, this is isomorphic to C of L zero if q equal to d and If q equals d and q is not d. So, this is somehow a contradicting condition. But what I mean is this: remember, this has C C bimodule structure, but this has C C negative L bimodal structure, and this has C L C bimodal structure. So, this isomorphism is on the left, and this isomorphism is on the right. Almost with on the right, so that's the uh my definition of ASF regularly. So, somehow, dualizer complex is concentrated in only one position, and we know the both left module structure and right module structure. That's the definition of ASF regularly, okay. F is provenious. Okay, so F is Flubinius because in the usual, I mean, this is just a remark, but if A is usual finite dimensional Z and my Z rate algebra, then A star is the same as R 0 tau A. So this is really saying that this is isompic to A itself. That's the, so this is the condition of Rubenius. Of Rubenius. So this F means Fluvenius. So the higher dimensional generalization of Houbenius condition. Okay, so now I want to characterize this as if regular algebra categorically. That's the second part. And so now, again, this appeared in the yesterday's talk, but I want to repeat it. So let's say that C is a k-linear. Let's say that C is a K-linear abiding category. And we will abstractly define the canonical biomodule. So auto-equivalence, this isn't real auto-equivalence of the category, C, is called canonical biomodule. If in the derived category, this is viewed as this derived category, all the equivalents of the category. It's oh, no, I forgot. It shifted to cell functor. For some D. But this actually is actually unique to be determined by C. So that is a very abstract notion of canonical biomodule. Usual canodical module in a community bioject geometry is the defines chemical biomodule, in a Summer's case at least. Okay, so and so we say that sequence of objects, what is yeah. Oh, okay, so I guess it's a notation for auto equivalence. So this is a notation. This is notation of functor. Yeah. So just applying the object here by this. That's a functor. That's a notation. It tries to make like a Patient. It tries to make like a looks like a biomunger, but not really biomush, just a function. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, that is actually all recognized with C. So this is, so now HEI as the object of C is Geometric Helix If three conditions first I don't know E I plus oh oh P D L This L isn't now a This L isn't now a positive integer, non-negative integer. This one is isentric to this inverse for any i. So basically, it's enough to give up E0 up to EL minus one to give a sequence, you know, or the sequence. And V E R. PI EI plus one F2 EI plus L minus one is a full exceptional sequence or of course derived the category. And finally, geometric conditions can So for X group, we have the following condition. This is going to be zero for any q non-zero and um zero and i is that's the strong condition strongness condition and uh this geometric helix was originally defined by bondadorchuk but this definition is not exactly same as theirs but i will explain it later and uh bonda passporzchuk defined the first condition by using mutations First condition by using mutations, right? Okay, then I can say the first main result that if E, the sequence is ample, which is undefined, but ample geometric paradigms of period L. Then if we take C to be C of E, remember this is just homomorphism of infinite homomorphism of this sequence E is ASF ASF regular Borenstein parameter equal L and also L periodic and L periodic. And L periodic. Okay, so this period of L is the period of helix, and this period of L periodic is this Z algebra is L periodic. Such that original C is obtained by tails of C. So you can recover the original category. And moreover, this C is Nesylian defined only if this category is Nessilian, defined only if each object is Neither object. So we can check that when the obtain the SF regular ZR. Obtain the SF regular Z algebra obtained like this on the city, we can check it, and we have a converse of this serum conversely if C. If C is ASF regular Borenstein parameter equal L and L paleoelectron. Then P which is negative P. So this P is now viewed as an P I, a P negative. P i, a p negative i in the category of tails is ample with geometric edits of L and such that you can actually recover C by taking this p. So, this is completely the converse of this theorem. So, together, these two theorems together, this is a characterization when the category or non-committable scheme is isomorphic to projective scheme associated to F-regular ZLG. Or ample means that, yeah, basically, roughly speaking. Roughly speaking, very roughly speaking, this is somehow projective generator. This is very rough for any M well, it's behave like a projection generator, but not all of them, just negative part. All of them, just negative part. Okay, positive part, yeah. Maybe I can just maybe wrong. I mean, the other one, or something like that. Okay, so I'll tell you the uh some difference between Von der Polschik's work. So, as I said, Von der Polschik already defined the geometric headaches by using the mutations. Mutations and our definition of geometric helics is the same as under polished definition. If and only if the rank of K0 of C is the same as global dimension of C plus one and And in front of only A C obtained here is Kuzu. So Okao-san said that Ondara's definition is somehow restricted because we have this strong restriction here. But if we only consider Kozu algebra, this is a correct restriction in some sense. And I'm not really thinking of. I'm not very thinking of carefully, but probably this condition is related to the existence of roots of third functor too. So we don't usually have a roots of third functions in our city. Okay, so now this is a calculation of non-computative scheme, which is isomic. Scheme which is isomic to projective scheme associated to S regular algebra. Now, as I said, as we obtained like this, there is no way to check that the dose category is isomorphic to a community variety. So it doesn't really answer the community question, more generally. Okay, so now I'm going to make the second question and more concrete application here. Application here. So this is the division due to Vandenberg. We say that K-linear category C is quantum P1 cross P1 if C is equivalent to tails of C where C is C is three-dimensional, maybe I have to say three-dimensional cubic is regular Z algebra. That is the definition. And I don't define what is cubic. This is defined in terms of the resolution, shape of the resolution of the simple modules. But cubic implies. But cubic implies GK dimension is four and uh implies. I hope that the if gk dimension is four and generated indegree one, then they are the same, but I have no proof. And Vandenberg proves the following. So for any three devangeron, oh, I have to say neither here. Three-dimensional Missileian cubic S regular Z algebra There exists four-dimensional necessary and quadratic workers whichever you like. Whichever you like is regular algebra. Okay, so this is not a Z algebra anymore. Okay, this is just an algebra. And no more element of degree two, such that if you take a second Valonesi of C, is isomorphic to S divided by F and taking building just as a Z algebra. Algebra. Okay, so what this tells? This tells that roughly speaking, so then if then if Tos S is actually equivalent to the situation, Is actually equivalent to Hels of second Bernese, which is equivalent to by this result, Hels of S divided by F bar, but that is equivalent to Hels of S. So this tells that this is a quantum P1 cross P1, and this is a quantum project in quantum P3. So this tells that every quantum P1 cross P1. That every quantum P1 cross P1 is actually a quantum quadric surface in quantum P3. That's the roughly speaking theorem tells. Very good. And we have some converse by using our theorem. So now S is the four-dimensional. Musselian quadratic is regular usual algebra, and f is a negative two element, but unfortunately we have to assume central, not necessarily, I mean, not just a normal, but central, such that, so let's take x to be a non-convergent of x over f is smooth and integral, and integral. And integral. Then there could be three-dimensional ASF regular Z algebra of Borenstein parameter four. And actually, this has four periodic, but actually even better, two periodic. Periodic. If it is two periodic, then obviously it's four periodic. Such that non-communicable projective scheme, maybe obviously tails is, I think, two tails of C. So this is really the converse. My certain Certain assumptions here, central. Oh, maybe I have to say one more standard. Let's get black box condition. And in the original paper, I mean, and the Smiths and the Vandenberg claims that every Smiths quadruped is standard, but actually found the current example. So I have to add this assumption standard there. But anyway, in a standard case, at least we can. Standard case, at least we can say that the other round quantum quadrant in quantum P3 is actually quantum field, field speak. So this gives the answer in the question I posed in the beginning. Okay. So the question is that it's okay to assume that smooth, right? But why we have to assume smooth end in? We have to assume the integral. That was the question. I will explain why later. Now, okay. Ten more minutes. So. So, going back to the easier case, the classification of non-commutative mechanics, now x is, well, maybe start with the commutative case, large of s over f. Now, s is in polynomial in three variables, and f is in degree two element. Then, we have a similar picture. X is either looking to double line or pair of line, and so. pair one i and circle depending on f x squared x squared plus y squared and x squared plus y squared plus z squared okay and here from here it's reduced and from here integral or you can say smooth in this case in a three-dimensional i mean three variable case integral is the same as case integral is the same as same as so what happens if we again replace this this to be um three-dimensional merucillian quadratic is regular algebra and this is normal or central maybe central maybe actually i can only Actually, I can only do the central guest today, so what's the central? Then we have a following result. The other theorem I said before is that joint work with Adam Nyman, but this one is joint to work with Aigenfu and Matsuno and me. So all of them are here. Okay. So in this situation, or maybe I'll write down the assumption. So this is a three-dimensional Nesserian quadratic. Quadiatic is regular algebra, and f is a normal central element here. And if X project scheme associated is smooth, then there are two possibilities. Then either Either first possibility is that x is integral, which actually the same as the derived category of projectful scheme associated to S over F is derived category of two coordinate cut quiver. And if on the only actually so tails oh, s over s maybe I have to say this projective scheme, non-commutative projective scheme is actually commutative P1 it's commutative P1 or Oh, integral means that it's a domain, or if it is irreducible. Yes, that's my definition. We say X is integral if this is a domain, or this is irreducible. Or, the second possibility is that x is not integral, which means in that case, actually the derived category of vector scheme associated to S over F is equivalent to the derived category of the path algebra of D for theta. And maybe you don't have to say it, but of course, in this case, projective scheme is the narrative one. So even if we assume smooth, okay, in the commutative case, smooth is the same as integral. But in a non-commutative case, even assuming smooth, it could be integral or not integral. But there are only two possibilities. Okay, so maybe I'll give a simple example. If we take the skew polynomial algebra, so relation is xy plus yx, yz plus zy, and xz plus zx. And if we take that f is, f is x squared plus y squared plus z square. Then X, or you can check this is actually smooth. But you can easily check that this is the same as X plus Y plus C squared. Because if we square this, then we have X Y plus Y Y X or something, these are canceled out. So it's smooth, but not in the. So at least such an example exists. And in the beginning, my motivation is to classify a non-commutative smooth quadratic surface, which I don't have the answer, but I want to say this. You know, classification of three-dimensional quadratic S3 algebra, of course, known, but there are plenty of too many. Okay, so in order to classify non-competitive conic, we have too many examples of three-dimensional quadratic S3 algebra. And for each algebra, we have to find a central element. That's horrible projects. But this tells that at least in a smooth case, at least At least up to a greater direct equivalent, there are only two. Very short list. So, even though we don't have a classification of four-dimensional necessity is regular algebra, quadratic is regular algebra, no competitive quadratic surface, at least with case, maybe a much shorter length. That's my expectation. Thank you very much.
