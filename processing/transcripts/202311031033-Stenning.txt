Yes, and thank you all for coming to this last session. So, this is an astronomy summary talk from a statistics point of view. And so, I will echo something that Gwen said earlier, because I didn't know she was also going to make this comment. So, there was this question asked on the first day, and I'm paraphrasing here quite a bit, that was basically saying, Basically, saying that it's maybe clear that statistics can help astronomy. The question was whether astronomy could benefit statistics. So I think my answer to that is yes. And that's it. That's the summary. We can all go home to lunch. Okay, I should give an actual summary. So, something that I've said. So, something that I've said in grant applications when I'm giving outreach talks, probably recycled some variation of this phrase over and over, which is that modern astronomy contends with complex physics, complex technology, and complex data. And I think the result of that is an abundance of kind of fun and interesting statistical challenges that. That often leads to advances in statistics in the form of new methodology that can be generalized. Plus, it's just a fun way of making a career. So, I'm not going to summarize all the different astronomy topics that we learned about this week because I don't know that I could do that justice in only half an hour. So, instead, I'm just going to point out. So instead, I'm just going to point out a few of them that I think sort of highlight one or more of these sort of ideas. So the first I stole from Jess MacIver's talk. I also picked examples, not because I think that they were the best, but because I could find them easily on the Google Drive. So if you don't see yours, it's not a comment on quality or anything. It's which one made the best. It's which one made the best easy-to-show slides like this. So, Jess is doing Bayesian inference of source populations to try to understand and characterize gravitational waves from what I understood in any case. Please do correct me if I flop a little bit on any of the actual astronomy. So, there's already sort of sophisticated methodology that underpins. Methodology that underpins the kinds of analyses that they're doing. But both from Just's talk and also just from talking during meals, in particular during dinner last night, we're realizing that there's a lot of complications, a lot of challenges that come with trying to improve the fidelity of the modeling. So there's a lot of noise that is That is not Gaussian and not even necessarily consistent. I think Jess told a story that one of the noise that they had to try to figure out how to work with was because a mouse got into the detector and did his daily constitutional there. So that's the kind of thing, like thinking about modeling these discrepancies, how to deal with data that's highly Mount Gaussian, what to do when you have simulations that have lots of images. Have simulations that have lots of input parameters and you can't necessarily run them very quickly, kind of gives a testbed for developing new statistical methodology that is not only so it's typically not just useful for that one tailored application, but whose ideas can be generalized to many other applications both in astronomy and beyond astronomy. So I know that there was a session that I didn't get a chance to go to on simulation-based inference, and I think. Simulation-based inference. And I think the number of attendees there shows that there's a lot of interest in possible applications for these sorts of ideas. And I know outside of astronomy, epidemiology, biology, ecology, earth sciences, a lot of fields now use complex computer models to try to understand physical phenomena and trying to. Phenomena and trying to merge those sorts of simulations with principled statistical approaches for properly quantifying uncertainty or making predictions is, I think, an interesting and ongoing area of statistics. And then this I stole from Yang Chen's talk. I don't think Yang is here. So, what I wanted to point out here. So, what I wanted to point out here is that the data is very complex. So, it's looking at images of a region on the sun in different wavelengths. And I think there's also a magnetogram there, so also magnetic fields. So, this is very high-dimensional, complicated data. And Yang came up with a very complex statistical approach for trying to. Approach for trying to model these data. I won't even pretend like I understood all of the details of this approach yet, but I'm interested in following up. And then the last one that I'll highlight was Aria's talk, where she was using, oh, I guess I got this wrong when I put the keywords highlight. It was copula elicitable maps, not elicitable copulas. So apologies for that. So, apologies for that. Which kind of highlights something else that I'll point out later: which is that I'm learning some new statistics from the astronomers, let alone just learning some new astronomy from the astronomers. And so, my point here is that it's not just that astronomers come to statisticians with some problem. We're like, okay, here's ready-to-go kind of approach. Kind of approach that has a Python or R package or something, a lot of times the challenges that are presented by the astronomers lead to or necessitate the development of new statistical methodology because of how interesting, how complicated they can be. And so, some of the, as I mentioned, there's many other topics. As I mentioned, there are many other talks. I'm not going to highlight all of the different astronomy applications, but Max is here. So, Max developed a methodology, Stratlearn, that was motivated by an application in astronomy, but is a general-purpose technique for doing machine learning when you have covariate shift in domain adaptation. And this was motivated by sort of very Of very old statistics in some ways. Propensity scores have been around for a while using the causal inference literature, but they haven't really made their way into astronomy and then kind of machine learning maybe a little bit more generally. And yeah, I'll leave it there. So if I didn't highlight your specific work, it's again not because I think anything is better, but I think anything is better, but in the interest of time, I chose to just highlight those three. And so I thought I would kind of talk about some of the personal takeaways that I have from this workshop. The first of which came up last night, which is that I feel like the answer to every question is it depends. And I mean that, I don't. And I mean that, I don't mean that completely flippantly, even. I think a lot of times, if someone comes to me, an astronomer that I haven't been working with for a while, they might have some questions like, how much data do I need to accomplish task X? Or which sampling algorithm should I use to fit my model? Like those sorts of questions. And my answer is always: I don't know, it depends. I don't know, it depends. And I think that that's true. It's, I mean, astronomy deals with hard questions, complicated data, and complicated models. And so these sorts of questions don't have easy statistical solutions most of the time. And I think we kind of realized that in some of the discussion groups where people would pose questions and then we would talk about that one question. And we would talk about that one question for 90 minutes, maybe, and kind of make a little bit of a dent in sort of bridging the understanding gap, but really just laying the foundation for further collaboration and exploration, as opposed to just being able to give a simple answer to a complex question. Another segue I have going along with the Halloween theme that we had earlier in the week is that the next generation is scary. The next generation is scary. And I don't just mean they're dance moves. I won't actually show the videos. I'll just keep them in case I need them in the future for any reason. But what I actually mean is that the next generation is very good at astrostatistics. And since Ted already brought up that I've been working with him for more than 10 years now, I guess I'll say I'm getting old. That's another takeaway that I have. Another takeaway that I have. So I'm going to use this time to reminisce a little bit because I think it does reflect a little bit on my understanding of, or my approach to astrostatistics more generally from the point of view as a statistician. So a story that I've told to probably some of you at some point, so apologies if you've heard me say this too many times, is that back when I was an undergraduate, so this was So, this was, or let's say, 15 years, plus or minus a few. I initially was interested in pursuing astronomy as a PhD and being an astronomer. I didn't have a physics undergrad degree. I had applied math, so I would have had to take the physics GRE. So, for that, I was taking a couple years after undergraduate to work as a lab tech. Work as a lab tech and kind of build my astronomy and physics knowledge more broadly. And so at that time, I won't name names on the negative side of things. So I'll say I was working in an astronomy lab. And in the department, we would have these pizza lunch talks that were kind of more informal talks about people's research or interesting topics or discussion of new. Discussion of new results. So, David Hogg, who many of you may know, was a visiting researcher at the time. And so, he decided that he would give this kind of like a short series on useful statistics for astronomy. And so at the time, I didn't really know much statistics. I took one stats course. I hated it. But so, the topics that he talked about, I still remember, were cross-validation and boot. Cross-validation and bootstrap. And I thought that that was really cool, but I overheard a senior professor, I'll say, afterwards commenting that he couldn't really see why any of this would be useful and that you could kind of fit a model by just plotting your points on graph paper and getting a ruler. That was also the professor who taught the statistical methods for astronomy course to the graduate students. And so I think back when I was kind of I was kind of thinking about what I wanted to do with my own career. It was kind of by complete chance that I ended up becoming interested in statistics. That was because the professor I worked for, who was an astronomer, lived next door to Andrew Gelman, who's a famous statistician. Some of you maybe are familiar with. And so he kind of just gave him his Bayesian data analysis book when they were talking one day. He was like, oh, this might be useful. Talking one day, he was like, No, this might be useful for you. Because I was an applied math major, that got passed down to me. And I guess the rest is history in some sense. But at the time, I was sort of warned against maybe trying to pursue astrostatistics as both a research path in graduate school and as a future career. And I think the opinion at the time was that astronomers would never take any science I would do seriously. Any science I would do seriously, and statisticians might not think that it was that something that had that much of an applied focus would really be like good enough statistics. I also told the story to a few of you during some meals that one of my favorite questions from my job interviews after I got my PhD was, you don't seem like a real statistician, which, yes, that is not a question, it's a comment. But I think that those advanced I think that those attitudes have changed a lot in the 15, again, plus or minus a few years since I started graduate school. And I think a lot of that does come from the younger generations who are really like not only excellent astronomers, but excellent statisticians in their own rights. Like we have Gwen Eady and Josh Biegel here, who are, I guess, my generation-ish and also. My generation-ish in also pursuing astrostatistics. And now, yeah, I've seen lots of talks where, as I said, I have to Google some of these statistics concepts because they're doing really advanced methodological development in addition to really cool science. So, I think that that's something that's encouraging to see. And I'm scared and super excited to see what the state of the field will. To see what the state of the field will be when all of the students in the audience are become professors and they're giving these kinds of summary talks sometime in the future. So I thought I would end this summary by describing how I think, I should have prefaced a lot of this by saying that these are my opinions, so just blanket warning, how statisticians can get more involved with astronomy and with With astronomy and with astrostatistics. So, the first of which is obviously talk to astronomers, especially when you're doing kind of interdisciplinary methodological research that's actually motivated by the science. You want to make sure that you're getting the science correct and not doing some kind of machine learning model where you're finding a relationship between RA and DEC, which is something I saw 10 years ago. Like 10 years ago. And if you're more senior, I think a great way to get involved is actually to get graduate students to talk to each other. So when I was a graduate student, I worked closely with a graduate student who was in astronomy, who was under the supervision of Ted Ron Hibble. I don't know if Ted is still on the call. And I think that that was one of the more productive parts of my graduate school career because we both wanted to get our Because we both wanted to get our PhDs and we both wanted to write papers. So it was just a lot of fun to kind of learn a bit about the astronomy, develop statistical methodology, and then see it immediately used to do kind of cool science. Gwen already said this, so I don't need to dwell on it, but kind of one-size-fits-all techniques can be risky, and so challenging astronomy problems. Challenging astronomy problems often require bespoke statistical methodology that can then be generalized. So I won't say more on that since you kind of already talked about it, but I do want to say that there's no monoliths. So I learned that about astronomy and I think it's also true of statistics, but none of us are experts in everything and there aren't going to be statistical approaches that are appropriate for every Appropriate for every problem. I'm mostly a Bayesian, but I don't think that Bayesian analysis is necessarily the right thing to do for every situation. And yeah, I think different fields of astronomy have their own unique challenges and opportunities for statisticians. Gwendolyn made this point, but I think getting involved early is really the key to having a successful. Is really the key to having a successful collaboration and for having astronomy be useful to statistics or to someone's statistical career because I think we don't want to be just referees. And if you, I liked Wade's example from her husband, but like sometimes it's like they come to you and they want cleaning, and you tell them that they need a root in a house. So sometimes if the work is really far along, there can be a tendency for wanting some kind of a validation, I think, from statisticians that like, okay, what you did is correct. And sometimes the answer to that is no, it's not correct, and then it gets Not correct, and then it gets awkward because you don't want to tell them that they should go back to step one, change the model, change the model fitting, and yeah, then you're kind of stuck in a difficult place. So I think to get involved in astronomy, I'm repeating myself a little bit now, but we had these discussion groups and at least in the ones I was in, there was a lot of crosstalk between the disciplines. Of cross-talk between the disciplines, and I think a lot of them laid the foundation for future collaborations. So, maybe I don't need to say this to everyone in the room since I think we all kind of are on the same page. And then, what I will say finally is that there are astrostatistics organizations out there that both statisticians and astronomers can join. So, one of which is the astrostatistics group, that's part of the American. Group that's part of the American Statistical Association. And I learned about a week ago that the American Statistical Association also includes Canada. I'm sure the Canadians aren't very happy with that. But so there are big meetings called the Joint Statistical Meetings that happen every year. And the ASA usually has a couple of astrostatistics sessions. What they also have every year is a student paper competition. Student paper competition. So, if you any of you who are students and have work that you've submitted in the past year, or if you're advisors and you know of students who aren't here that have submitted work in the past year, I encourage you to think about submitting to the competition. I think the announcement for that will be sent soon, Casey. And there's also the International Astrostatistics Association. Astrostatistics Association. I think a few of us were just elected to the council for that, so I'm not as familiar with this one, but I guess I will have to be calm soon. And there's also with the AAS and astrostatistics and an astroinformatics working group that I think Gwen is the chair of. Gwen will also be the chair of the ASA two years from now. I guess I'm the chair next year. So there's many ways. So this is another way of kind of meeting. Way of kind of meeting others from the community who might not be at this particular workshop, but who would be eager to collaborate with astronomers or statisticians, depending on what side you're coming from. So I'm almost out of time, so I'll just say I'll reiterate Gwen's thank you to, well, all of you for attending, to the other organizers, and to Bamp and the technical staff for having us here. Technical staff for having us here. So, thank you very much. So we have forty-five minutes on our uh agenda before lunch, which we don't
