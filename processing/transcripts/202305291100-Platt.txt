The talk is about an example of a G2INC control, and here you see a little cartoon of what I'm about to describe. It's a bit hard to see here, but here we have in gray some singular space and some red thing on it that will be a connection. And here, a section in a certain bundle on this singular thing. Then you can glue these. Thing, then you can glue these two things together, and on a smoothing of this manifold, you get some very interesting connection. That's what I'm about to describe. Exactly, yes, that's why I made this picture. So I'll start with a little introduction about hyperkela4 manifolds. And so on C2, we can take these correct. So on C2 we can take these coordinates y0 to y three and you can write down three symplectic forms omega one, omega two, omega three. Once you've written down omega one, you get the other two by cyclically permuting these three reasons there. And each of them is a Kela form for some complex structure. And you can notice these guys, these two forms, are invariant under this multiplication by minus one, just because multiplication by minus one acts as minus one on a one form, but these guys are two forms, so it acts as the identity. So what you have is that these three nice two forms actually descend to this quotient, C2 mod plus minus one. So you have three forms on this quotient, C2 mod plus minus one. Now this Now, this is an orbifold. These three forms are forms on this orbifold. If you don't like the word orbifold, that's fine. You can just think of these two forms as being defined on the smooth points of this orbit fold. For this talk, you never need to know what's an orbit fold point, actually. Is it an A1 singular? Yes, okay. Yes, okay, fair. So I said, yeah, this has a singularity exactly at the origin, where this map minus one had a fixed point. And algebraic geometry gives you for free the blow-up of this thing, which is some complex manifold denoted by x, eh, together with some projection map from x onto this singular space here. And so this dimension. And so this dimension real dimension four is a complex manifold. But even better than this, it's actually not just a complex manifold, but named after Iguchi and Hansen, this also has a hyperkela triple, again. So some omega1, twiddle, omega2, twiddle, omega three, twiddle. Some two forms on X. And even better than that, it's not just a hypercaleitrible, but it's actually a one-parameter family of them. So you have this. You have this t here, that's one real number, and for each positive real number, you get a hypercala triple. And so the picture is like this: you know, on the right, you have your singular space, this is C2 mod plus minus one, and then this resolution map pi. And so from each of these blue guys, you have a map pi here. And this number t controls roughly how close the smooth manifold is to. This smooth manifold is to this red manifold. So, if you wanted, you could make some statement about in which sense these blue manifolds converge to these red manifolds. We can make many statements like this. That was Fiber Kala 4 manifolds. The next thing is the exceptional heat group G2. And so, we've heard loads about the algebraic aspects of the Algebraic aspects of the Lie group G2. But for this talk, it's extremely helpful to think of G2 in one very specific way. And I'm going to write this down for you. So on R7, we can consider these coordinates, x1, x2, x3 on R3, and then on C2, the coordinates from before. And then you can write down this three form. This is the same three form that we've seen in the previous talk. form that we've seen in the previous talk just written differently using this splitting yeah so it's the volume form on R3 minus Exi wedge omega I and if you're so inclined you can also compute the Hodge star of this guy yeah I did this for your convenience it's a simple linear algebra computation we will need this a lot later on this Hodge star of phase zero Then we've seen one can define G2 as the stabilizer in GSNR of this three-form phi zero. And what does it have to do with octonions? You know this now is that phi zero can actually be written in terms of the cross product on R7, where you identify R7 with the imaginary octonions. So that's what. So that's what all of this has to do with the Octonians, but actually you can forget everything about O and just think of this three-form ideally written in this very nice format here. So that up to here that's all just like linear algebra and group theory. And now it's always if you have some local concept you can bring this to a manifold. In this case by taking a three form on some By taking a 3-form on some 7-manifold, and you say this is a G2 structure if at every point X, your phi looks like this model form phi 0. So if for all X there exists some linear isomorphism, which pulls back phi 0 to your phi at this point X. Now, the question when does there exist a G3 structure? When does there exist a T3 structure? It is a topological question that has a not so hard answer, but there is a very complicated relationship between these three forms and the holonomy group of a manifold. And that comes about as follows. So we've also seen G2 sits in SO7. There are ways to see this very explicitly. To see this very explicitly, and because of this, if you have a G2 structure on a manifold, in particular, you have an SO7 structure. Now, an SO7 structure is exactly a Riemannian metric plus an orientation. So, if you have such a phi, it will give you a G phi, a metric, and a watch star. And now comes the amazing theorem. Amazing theorem by Fernandez and Gray, which says that the holonomy group of this metric G phi, which is induced from phi in some very complicated way, so this holonomy group is contained in G2 if and only if D phi equals 0 and D of star phi equals to 0. And so this is the thing that everyone always says when they write down this theorem: d of phi equals 0. D of phi equals zero, this linear equation in phi is okay, but d of star phi is highly non-linear because this star inconveniently depends on phi itself. So this is a very complicated PVE to solve. And in fact, one of the great mysteries of this research area of G2 is to find out which smooth semi manifolds admit a metric with holonomy and say. Metric with holonomy, say, equal to G2 or contained in G2. So, this is one of the big questions. And you can compare this with the Calabiao case, where if you write down some Kehla manifold, or let's say Kehler manifold, there's some topological criterion that we can check, which will tell you whether there exists a Kalabiometric on this guy or not. And it would be nice to have this in G2, because for Calabiom info, we have many billions of examples. Billions of examples. And for G2, not so many. And this is exactly what motivates this sort of gauge theory that I'm about to tell you in a bit. So I'll explain the dream, how gauge theory can help with this question throughout the talk. But to hear any questions or comments? Okay, so then I'll start with an example of the G2 manifold. So I'll explain the G2 manifold where all of this is taking place. And then comes the example of the G2 instant on this. And in the meantime, I'll explain to you what's the G2 instant on. So the way we cook up our G2 manifold is like this. G2 manifolds like this. Start with some homogeneous degree six polynomial in three variables. Then you can write down this guy here. So this y is the set where f of x, y, z equals w squared. This is a subset of some weighted projective space here. So it's the same as CP3, three-dimensional projective space, only Only when you quotient out some C star action, there are some complicated ways. But if you're a bit less familiar with algebraic geometry, it doesn't matter so much. Just think of this as CP3. So this is some variety cut out by some equation in CP3. So CP3, this weighted project space is not smooth, right? But is this Y smooth? Yeah, Y is smooth. It doesn't look that way from the picture, but yeah. Why those weights? Is there quick? Yeah, so I mean this is a nice equation in the real numbers, but on projective space you want that left-hand side and the right-hand side scale with the same power of lambda when you multiply a point with some lambda. When you multiply a point with some lambda. Now, if this was in literal CP3, then this would scale with lambda to the power 6, and the right-hand side would only scale with lambda squared. And so to be able to make sense of this equation, you must put it into some more complicated projector space. But perhaps the real question is: why did you pick degree six? Okay, brilliant question. Fortunately, Fortunately, if you choose a curve of degree 6, turns out what you get here is a K3 surface. This only works for degree 6, not for degree 5, not for degree 7. And this exactly makes use of this algebraic geometry characterization of Kalabiaus I alluded to. Namely, if you choose a degree 6 polynomial, there is this topological criterion that you can choose. Topological criterion that you can check, and it's a one-line computation. And then there is this very deep theorem, Yaus' proof of the Carladi conjecture, which tells you, well, because this guy is a K3 surface, it admits a hyperkeler triple, omega 1, omega 2, omega 3. Excuse me, we're not admitting it to be a K3 surface. Well, maybe for this talk, just take it as a definition to admit a high. Just take it as a definition to admit a hypercala triple and not be the torus. The online computation that you refer to is the adjunct formula, but it has triple canonical violence. You can take triple canonical violence as the definition. And not being the tallest. Yeah, so here's a little picture of this with a cartoon. Of this cartoon. So the red thing together with the red thing together with the blue thing is our Y. So you see, no, actually, you don't see, but so this yellow curve should be in some, it lies in some gray plane, which is a bit missing here. Now, if you took some point away from this yellow curve, it would have two images, two pre-images under... Images under a projection onto CP2, one on the direct thing, one on the blue string. Only if you're exactly on this yellow curve, so if f vanishes, then you can see in this equation here, the left-hand side is zero. So the square root of zero is well defined. There's only one pre-image. So that's why it's a double cover, branched double cover, exactly branched over the set of F, the vanishing locus of F. Of f, the vanishing locus of f. Why are we taking this a quality polynomial in C of 3? Another brilliant question. We're going to see this around this height here of this light. It's going to come very soon. But before we come to that, I want to make one more comment about T3 times y. Namely, we have this hypercalax triple, very nice. So what we can do is we can write a three-form, we can write down a three-form. form, we can write down a three form on T3 times y. And this is the three form I want to write down. You may notice this is exactly the same formula as on the previous slide, only now it has a slightly different meaning. The dx123 are some frame on T3 now. And these omega i's are these highly complicated hypercala, these highly complicated calaforms on Y. Before they were these very easy Kalaforms on C. These very easy teleforms on C2, but now we don't know much about them, we just know their existence from this very complicated theorem. So now the great thing about being on a double cover or branch double cover is you have two involutions. So the first involution is this alpha here, which takes some point and just maps the last component W to minus W. So you can So you can, I mean, as I've written this, this is a map from CP3 to CP3 maybe, but you can convince yourself it actually preserves this equality map. And it's an involution because if you apply it twice, it's the identity. Now, there is a second involution you could write down if you wanted. And this is this sigma here, which is just complex conjugation in each coordinate. Now, if you're on a quartic, you still have this. You still have this guy if you chose a real quartic, but yeah, there depending on your quartic, there may be no holomorphic involution or there may be very many of them, but it may not be very obvious which one you choose. I'm confused. Are you saying that sigma preserves y? But f doesn't have real coefficients. Doesn't have real coefficients. Right, so if you choose F to have real coefficients, yes. Right. I should have mentioned that. Thank you. Also, is it clear that this is the only choice you could make? So, could it choose another set of weights such that exactly these two symmetries? And so these work, obviously. You mean these weights, yeah? These weights, yeah? Yeah. You mean change the weights and change the R EFF to get still get out of the way? Yeah, yeah. No, you can't. No, you can't. You want K3 surface, that is. You want branch level cover, K3 surface thing determines all these numbers. Okay, there's one thing you can do if UB has a complete intersection, it's a mid-directional. Complete intersection in semi-dimensional makeup in a dimensionless space, space this size, predictive space this size. Well, there is one more thing you can do. If you take as a definition of K3 surface that it has trivial canonical bundle, then you can take other things, but it won't be smooth. If you want to be smooth and have trivial canonical bundle, then it can only be a sex stick. Okay. Now, okay, this is a lot of information now. So this alpha guy, this is a holomorphic involution, just because each of these four entries is a holomorphic function and is anti-holomorphic. So that means that alpha will preserve the bless you. The Kerla structure corresponding to the complex structure of this wire. So alpha star omega1 equals omega 1. And likewise, sigma star omega 1 equals minus omega. This is just because you know it doesn't preserve omega 1. And just from the fact that it's an evolution, it must be equal to plus or minus omega 1. And so it's equal to minus omega 1. Okay, so this is how you get these two things. Then these other relations, they're a bit, I mean, it's a computation you have to make, but it's easy. One way to do it is you look at a fixed point. For example, if you want to figure out this first line, you look at a fixed point of alpha, which actually is exactly this yellow line here. And you only need to figure out what's alpha star omega 2 in this one fixed point. And again, because it's an involution, And again, because it's an involution, alpha, you will find it's plus or minus here. And that means over the whole manifold it's plus or minus. So if you do some computation like this, you get the first line. And then in the second line, you actually have to make some choice, but you can make this choice so that this is true. So that sigma star omega 2 is equal to plus omega 2, and sigma star omega 3 is equal to minus omega 3. And now we can extend this to T3 times y. Does this mean that sigma is holomorphic for J2? Yes. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Anti-holomorphic and holomorphic is kind of the same under hypercalera rotations for non-symplectic involutions. There is also the case, which doesn't appear here, that alpha preserves omega 1. That alpha preserves omega 1 and omega 2 and omega 3. This is also interesting. You get other examples of G2 manifolds, but it's not interesting today. Okay, so now comes the extension to T3 times Y, and I want to extend it in such a way to preserve this product G2 structure here. Sorry, I need to say control. That's not normal. And the way you do it is, for example, let's look at this alpha twiddle here, which is our extension. So you have to choose some signs on these first three coordinates, x1, x2, x3. And here I chose x1, one half minus x2, minus x3. So I have two minus signs. And I exactly want these minus signs to cancel out. want these minus signs to cancel out this minus sign here from the omega 2 and this minus sign here so you can check if you if you actually pull back this pi under alpha twiddle it's actually preserved and likewise if you choose the science or sigma twiddle in a similarly clever way you can arrange it so that sigma twiddle And arrange it so that sigma to it also preserves this file. So if you just had for the first one, just minus x2 and minus x3, that would still hold, right? So why it didn't have? Yeah, okay, I didn't want to talk about this, but it's basically just so that the fixed point sets of alpha and sigma are disjoint, I see. Yeah, it's a fair question. And okay, so these maps preserve the phi, so this phi again preserves to the orbifold quotient. So we have some G2 structure phi or B on this ORB fold. And again, if you don't like the word ORB fold, just think of it as a G2 structure on the smooth locus of this 7-ORB fold, which will be some open 7-manifold. Okay, so now we can I can finish the explanation of the G2 manifold where this is happening. Not that fast. And so here's our RV4, T3 times y mod some maps. This is the T3 times y mod Z2 squared from the title. Actually, there was a square. From the title. Actually, there was a squared missing in the title. But anyway, this is the thing I attempted to mention in the title. This has some singular set wherever these guys have fixed points. Let's forget about alpha Twitter. Let's just look at the fixed points that have sigma Twitter. And now on this blue line, far away from the singular set, you have this phi orbiting that I explained on the previous slide. Now, what you can do is, in a neighborhood of the screen set, you can write down another G2 structure. And here's how that goes. The neighborhood is at least diffeomorphic to the fixed point set times B4 divided by plus minus 1. So in the normal direction, this looks like B4 or plus minus 1. So what you can do is fix some point here in the singular set and choose. In the singular set and choose some orthonormal basis just in this point, and then you can write down this three-form here, which is again the same formula as before. Just now we have that these omega i's, they are in the hyperkala triple on C2 mod plus minus 1. Now this contains a small lie in that you could have chosen different E1, E2, and 3. E1, E2, E3. It would actually give you a different phi U, but there is one extra ingredient for this construction, which is exactly a matching between these one forms on the singular manifold and the hyperkela triple on C2 mod plus minus one, which I'm not going to go into, but if you're given this extra ingredient, there is some well-defined way to write down this phi. Fine. So this guy was singular. Now we can pass to a smooth manifold as follows. Remember we have this map pi here, which is the resolution of C2 of plus minus 1. So you can write down some neighborhood u twiddle, some open set u twiddle, which is the fixed point set times and then some subset of Iguchi Hansen spins. Spins so up here, this guy B4 mod plus minus 1. This lives in this C2 mod plus minus 1. But then we take the pre-image under this blower map. So this is some smooth set in Iguchi Hansen space. So uTwiddle is some open smooth setting manifold. And now on uTwiddle, you can write And now on uTwiddle, you can write down the following G2 structure. Again, it's the same formula. I'm writing the same thing over and over again. It's here, EI wedge omega IT. I may have forgotten a twiddle here. Anyway, this should be the hypercalor triple Oni Grouchy Johnson space that you've seen on slide number one. And as before, on the blue set, we have this ORB fold. The blue set, we have this Orbifold G2 structure here. Now, the amazing theorem by Joyce and Caribianis is that you can somehow glue together the red thing and the blue thing, and there actually exists a G2 structure, say phi twiddle t, which is torsion-free. So nabla phi twiddle t equals to zero. So in particular, So, in particular, it's closed and co-closed. So, that means this guy will have holonomy contained in G2, which is what we are after. And even better than this, you can kind of describe what phi twiddle looks like. Namely, far away from thick sigma, that's on the blue set, you can estimate the difference phi twiddle minus phi or b, and it's kind of small. And very near fixed sigma, so on the red set, you can estimate. So on the red set, you can estimate the difference by twiddle minus this guy here, this product G2 structure. And it's also small. So for your first case there, originally these um guys were this complicated hybrid triple. How is it they become kind of a little bit simpler, or much simpler, with open setup? So let's say you can are you talking about these guys here? So I'm not sure I understand the question. So on C2, what plus minus one, these guys are super easy. They have this very exact formula I wrote down on page one. Yeah. And are you asking why? I mean, this would just be in one fiber. Are you asking why on the whole? Fiber. Are you asking why on the whole rep thing I have some easy formula? Can you say it again? But is this? Yeah, because originally on T3 cross white, these forms were quite complicated, right? They were the hyperfilm and triple. So I'm just wondering how they suddenly became so complicated. Right. Okay, thank you. So there are two products going on. There's T3 times Y, which is actually the blue area. And there's this hypercala triple, which is super complicated. But then Complicated. But then, through some coincidence, there is a little region in this product. There's a little region which looks like some three manifold times just C21, plus minus one. And there it actually almost needs this very simple hypercalept. So it's two different G2 product forms, and it takes this for different reasons. The red set U is just The red set of U is just a neighborhood of the green line. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. Thank you. But it's a smooth G2R before fold. Which one? This guy here? Yeah. U. Yes, it's a smooth G2R before. Yeah, inside T3 times Y. You're just saying when I zoom near there, it's like the flat structure. I didn't say that, but if you go home thinking that it's okay, but if you look at the paper, you might wonder what did Daniel say during this talk. I have another question here. Can you explain in the nuts channel we've got two main techniques? We've got two main technicalities. The question goes to you to what distinguishes this construction from a classical Joy's construction of GFO manifold, because it's very similar in its labor. There must be a subtle point which I have not yet identified. So we have this K3 surface Y here. Joyce had a T4 here. You can play the same game. On T4, you can write down a hyperkeletricle, you can define such a limit and such a limit, build this quotient. You can do everything I'm about to say. It's just now with this shiny new paper, with this theorem, it can also handle the case where the orbifold is not flat, but it's some non-flat thing. Well, some non-flex thing. That's the difference, I would say. Yeah, essentially, in Joyce's original construction, you can take the same Aguchi Hansen everywhere. But here, we have to change which Iguchi Hansen we're taking. There's a three-parameter family of Iguchi Hansen, and you have to modify them to make it work. Okay, to make it what work? To make a three-form on there with small enough torsion to apply joices. Maybe nothing. And you're going to apply choices. I mean, this is the black box one needs to go to but it seems to me that not varying. Well, it seems to be the same. Well, I only told you how this looks in one point. This is only a point-wise thing that you have an orthogonal. But isn't the singular set of products? Fix a product and it's always the same. Okay, so it's circles, and it doesn't need to vary. Well, yes, yes, that's true. Yes, that's true. I mean, it's still a bit annoying to write this down because there is no global author in the frame E2B3. Okay, I can say that. What you say is true, but I thought this is the easiest 20%. Can you say what is XEH or what is? What is XEH and what is the place? What is M? Can I say what this is? This is the Gucci-Hansen space. This is this 4-manifold, which is the blow-up of this single guy. That was from way back in the first slide. Fix sigma twill is S1 times S2. You did say we can interrupt, right? I don't want to mess up your time. No, no, it's good. So can we think of a do you think this could be generalized if we further choose non-trivial translations or yeah, this has been done in the paper. The problem is. So the gluing theorem exists, but there is no example. But there is no example where you have this matching between the one forms and the hypercala triple in this more general case. So if you do what I just said, the authentic phi is going to have more portion than it should. Well, yeah, you can think of it this way, yes. Another way to say the same thing is there is no canonical file you could even write down. Maybe let's talk about this afterwards. Okay, so this was nice. That was the G2 manifold. But now we come to instanton. So I promised you one instanton. And so this is in dimension four here, a definition. And that is a connection. And that is, a connection on some bundle over a hypercala 4 manifold, say y, is called anti-selfty or instanton if it satisfies this equation here. So A is some connection. If you have a connection, you can cook up its curvature. So FA is the curvature of this connection. And it's a two-form with values in some complicated bundle. Bundle. But at the heart of it, it's still a two form, so you can wedge it with these other two forms, and you can see if the wedge product is zero or not. So, before I tell you about this, I wanted to say this is originally from the physics literature. These guys cared first about these instantons, but then These instantons, but then made a very popular mathematics, this Donaldson's work, who looked at the space of solutions to this equation and was able to settle some questions about the topology of four manifolds by looking at the space of solutions of this anti-self-QO equation. And so there's a dream, and that dream is you can define something like anti-self-QO in the G2 world, so G2 instant on. G2 instanton. And maybe, if you look at the space of solutions to G2 instantons, maybe it can tell you something about which smooth seven manifolds admit torsion for G2 structures. No further comments how likely this is to be achieved, but it's one motivation to write down this definition of G2 structure, G2 instant work. How does your definition of anti-self-duality relate to the one with the hard? Relate to the one with the hot star, it's the same, okay. Because point-wise, these guys span the self-dual two forms. There are three of them and the space of self-dual two forms is three-dimensional in every point. So, if it went to zero with each of them, that means it cannot be contained in the space of self-QO2 forms. It must be purely contained in the space of anti-celf Q02 forms. Great, thanks. Yeah, that explains the name. Yes. So can you imagine any time how your second point helps you find toward the GT structures? Yeah. Yeah. No. If I could, then this, I wouldn't be very famous. Ideally, that's what you'd like. Well, okay. I mean, I'm really not qualified to talk about this. I mean, I'm really not qualified to talk about this, but you could take some seven manifold with some G2 structure that's not torsion-free and look at the space of solutions to this equation. And maybe if this is a certain number, like zero or five or something, maybe this can be a necessary or sufficient criterion for the existence of a torsion 3G2 structure on the screen. The way I said it, this is never going to be. The way I said it, this is never going to be true. It will be way more complicated than this. But maybe it gives you an idea of the kind of statement you could dream for. Yes. It's meant to be an analog of the three-manifold story. Because not like the four-manifold case, it places strong differential to logical restrictions. Yes, the calcium invariant. Yes, the custom invariant in dimension 3 would be a better analog in some sense. But if you see the next bullet point, you will see that I need these ND served. So. Is there anything like this for formats? Can you detect that they have KLR structures? Um using SamuelWritten you can say it does not have a sympathet function. Like CP two connects from CP two doesn't have a sympathetic structure from Samuel Written too. Sympathetic structure. So I will read it to some answer from that. Yeah, I don't know more than what Gonsalvo said. Okay. So one example of a G2 instant is the following. Let's look at this product situation, which conveniently is exactly the situation we're in for our G2 manufacturing. We're in for our G2 manifold. So let's say you're at on T3 times y, you have the projection onto the second component, and you have some anti-self dual instanton on y. Then what you can look at is p star y, so the pullback to this seven manifold. And turns out this is a G2 instantone. Why is that? Well, so for the definition of G2 instanton, we have to look at this wedge problem. We have to look at this wedge product here, and then for your convenience, I plugged in the formula for psi from the beginning. So, this is what psi looks like in this product situation. Now, we want this to be zero, so I multiply this out. We have f match vol and then minus this complicated sums. Now, vol, this is a four-form. This is a four-form on a four-man on a four-manifold y and f of p star a also is a two-form and it has only components in the y direction. So you have some form and it has six components in y direction, but y is only four dimensional, so this guy must be zero. And for the second summon, it's even easier because we had that, no, sorry, did we have ASD instantone? We have FA which omega i equals to zero. And I mean, it's not immediate, you still have to think about it a bit, but that implies that F P star A wedge omega K is equal to zero by the anti-self-dual condition. So this whole wedge product is equal to zero. So, this whole wedge product is equal to zero. So, you've now seen your first example of a G2 instant on it. Okay, so if you remember my explanation of this metric on the G2 metric on the seven manifold, this was two things glued together: one near the singularity and one thing far away from the singularity. Away from the singularity. Now I'm going to do the same thing with G2 instantons. I'll explain to you one G2 instantone far away from the singularity and then one G2 instanton near the singularity. And right, okay. So the bundle we begin with is this tangent bundle. This tangent bundle TCP2, let's call this E. And you will notice that the Lady Glitter connection, which is a connection on the tangent bundle, is a Hermit-Einstein connection. So it satisfies this thing where F two, zero is the two zero component under this splitting here of the two forms. Splitting here of the two forms. F0, two is also equal to zero. And yeah, this condition, as it's written here, is an inner product between two two forms with values in this complicated bundle u of v. So if you take the inner product, the result would be a zero form with values in this complicated bundle. And the Hermit Einstein. And the Hermit-Einstein condition exactly tells you that this is not some very complicated section, but it's actually just a constant multiple of the identity. Okay, so there is a fig theorem called the Donaldson-Uhen-Beckeau theorem, which says that if you have a Hermit-Einstein connection, If you have a Hermit Einstein connection, so a guy which looks like this, then the bundle on which this connection is defined is the stable bundle. Now, I didn't want to define stable in this talk, some algebraic geometry definition. All I want to say is, if you know that while the E is stable, then you can do some algebraic geometry trick to find that the pullback to our branch double cover K3 servers. Double cover K3 service is also stable. So remember, Y is a K3 service, a branch double cover or CP2. So we have this projection map rho. You can pull back E, rho of E, and I'm saying there's some argument to prove that this is again a stable bundle, which I'm not going to tell you about. So stability is stable under base change. Under pullback? Something like this. Something, yeah, yeah, something. Something like this. Something yeah yeah something like this. Yeah. Probably I'm gonna ask Mank to about those yeah that you need to make many uh restrictions. I mean don't don't go home thinking that stability is preserved under Playback. Like this is not true in general. But budget button of CP2 is fine. Yeah exactly. Okay then so if you take my word for it that this guy is a stable bundler or starry then Is a stable bundle row starry, then by the same theorem, there exists some Hermit-Einstein connection A here. So some connection satisfying these three conditions. Okay, now I think there were some details here that maybe no, I should say this, sorry. So this is a this is a um This is a connection on a ranked complex vector bundle. So, this is a U2 connection in the language of principal bundles. Now, there's always a way if you have some Lie group homomorphism from one group to another that you can extend your connection from whatever you start with, in this case a U2 bundle, to such a connection. To such a connection, in this case a PU2 bundle. So here, in this case, the Lie group homomorphism is the quotient map. Just PU2 is U2 mod its center. And it turns out, some pleasant Lie group fact, that this is isomorphic to SO three. So this is general nonsense. You get a P U two connection out of our U two connection called A twiddle. U2 connection called A twiddle. Now the reason you needed to do this is that now this equation becomes these equations here. So f2 comma 0 and f0 comma 2, they're still 0, nothing changes. But here something changed. So before we had that this inner product is some multiple of the identity. So in the Lie algebra of you In the Lie algebra of U2, the identity is an element. If you quotient out and look at PU2, then you exactly quotient out by these identity elements. So in PU2, this equation actually tells you that this inner product is zero. That's what's written there. Because of the quotient being identity and zero is the same in P of two. And let's just say from this, it follows that A twiddle is anti-self TO. That's the case because on a complex manifold, the self-two two forms, you can they split like this, but I need to hurry up the next bit so. So the main takeaway until here is you have this a twiddle, which is an anti-self keyword connection. Now what you can do is if you remember sigma, that was a map on our tangent bundle. No, sorry, what was sigma? Sigma was the complex conjugate. Sigma was the complex conjugation. And again, like with some hand waving, I won't tell you about the details, but you can interpret the differential of sigma as actually being a map. It's actually mapping this rho star of V to rho star of V. And so it will be some lift of this map sigma on the K3 surface, and it's a check. And it's a check, not an easy check, but a check you can do that it preserves this connection alpha Twiggle. And likewise, there's another way. There's actually what's called a tautological lift, alpha prime of alpha. But yeah, we don't need to see the formula for this. There's some sort of lift of alpha to this bundle called. Alpha to this bundle called alpha prime. So this was on the K3 surface y, and you can extend this to the product T3 times Y. And what you get is that, well, the pullback P star A twiddle is a G2 instanton on this seven manifold. That's what we've seen on the previous slide. If you pull back an ASD instanton, you get a G2 instanton. And And now we use the fact that we have these lifts, sigma prime and alpha prime. P star alpha twiddle was the bundle on p star rho star e. So I realized this may be a bit hard to see, but it's p star rho star e. And because alpha prime sigma prime preserve this connection, And preserve this connection, as we've seen two times before, you get something on the orbifold quotient. In this case, this orbifold quotient also happens to be some orbit bundle. But again, you don't like orbit bundle or so, just think of the smooth locus of this. This is fine. Okay, so we got some G to instanton over this T3 times one. This is the first ingredient of two that we will glue together. Ingredient of two that we will glue together. The second that we will glue in is now this must be something near this singular set. So what do we glue in there? Okay, so here's how this goes. Remember, near the singular set, this looks like some three manifold, maybe the fixed point set of our involution, times this Eguchi Hansen space, this smooth four manifold that you blew in. Smooth four-manifold that you can win. And now on this guy, we want a G2 install. The way you do it is you write down the set of all anti-Self-Dual connections on Nicoch-Jansen space. And there you need to be careful. You need to say what's the framing and you need to quotient out by some isomorphisms. But it can be done. And then this is a well-defined menu. This is a well-defined manifold here. And so ignore this. Hyperkela, this is very nice, but I want to not talk about this now. So what we need is some map from our three manifold into this moduli space of anti-selfq connections. And then I mean I mean, if it satisfies some partial differential equation that you can cook up using the hyperkela structure, that's nice. But let's not worry about this now. So just think of some map from this tree manifold into this modular space. Is this like the infinite decimal obstruction that you need to specify for like leaving one? What does it mean this future section such? Okay, yeah, I'll see it in a second, I think. Second, I think. Yeah, this will come in a bit. Why that's important. You know, I just said, let's not talk about it, let's talk about it. But before then, imagine the following. So here's our three manifold, L, this blue thing. And then in the normal direction, in every point, you have this four-manifold, this Eguch-Jansen space, which is this red line. Now, over one Higut-Jansen space, this S. Good Janssen space, this S defines you some connection. This is this green line. And now, if you choose a connection in each point of L, this actually defines you a connection over this whole seven manifold, over all of L times the Gucci-Hansen. This is this orange sheet here. This is the cartoon of this connection over the second manifold denote S of A. And the reason you need the Fueta equation is the following. If this is a Fueta section, then S of A is close to being a G2 instanton in some extremely precise sense. It won't be a G2 instanton on the nose, but some error terms vanish if it satisfies this equation. And one example, which is the example that I used in this Turing construction for a Fueta section, is take a Vueta section which is constant. So for all x, it gives you the same connection A. This is the constant Fueta section, and I haven't explained this equation at all, but you immediately see if S is constant, then this equation is always satisfied. This equation is always satisfied because ds is the zero map, so this PDE will be satisfied. Okay, so but I must wrap up, and I will wrap up now, because we have the two ingredients. The first one was this S of A from the last slide, which is a G2 instanton over this over this red region here, near the fixed point Z, which comes from this Fuel aspect G. Which comes from this Fueta spection. And then we have this other G2 instanton from two slides back over this blue manifold, which comes from a stable bundle. We put it back to T3 times y and at this lift and so on and so forth. So we have these two G2 instantons. And now we have exactly the same theorem as for the G2 metrics of G2 structures, which is the following, namely Namely, on this smooth manifold M, there exists a G2 instanton, say AT twiddle. And better than this, again, you can kind of describe what it looks like. Namely, far away from the fixed point set, so on the blue area, it looks like this P star A twitter, so this thing coming from the stable bundle, and near the singular set on the The singular set, on the red set, it looks like this thing coming from the Fouito section. And I say small here, but of course, in the paper, there will be a very rigorous estimate. Question? Does this always mean for all small t? There exists? Yes. And so here's the cartoon from the beginning. You started with the thing on the R default. Oh, now the colors are exactly reversed. I just realized that. Rehearsed. I just realized that. You start with the thing on the orbit fold and you glue in this Vueta section, and you get some very interesting, very complicated G2 instanton on the smooth G2M folder. And 20 seconds, because this is a problem that may be relevant for the problem session. Namely, here, as you've seen. Here, as you've seen, I used the constant Fourier intersection, but there is no example known of an interesting Fourier intersection. So, Fourier section, which is not constant, but still rigid. So, this would be a nice thing to cook up. But that's all I had to say for now. So, thank you very much.
