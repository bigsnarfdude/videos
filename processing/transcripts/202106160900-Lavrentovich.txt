Thank you very much. Thank you for inviting me. I hope you hear me and even see me. So this is a work in progress, and the student that is involved is Rona Koizumi. We are still in the middle of deciphering the thing. Deciphering the things that we see. And I would like to start with the motivation of this work. In the video, you see the phase transition. The black is the isotropic phase. It's just organic material that is melted and is being viewed between two cross-polarizers. This is why this isotropic phase is black. And then you see bright filaments that eventually Filaments that eventually close up into tori. Those are leaked crystalline nuclei. When you look at this picture, even without knowing much about the leak crystals, you would immediately realize that the structures resemble the DNA condensates. The difference is that, as we learned during this conference, that the DNA condensates are typical. DNA condensates are typically 50 nanometers more or less in diameter, while these things in the video are much larger. They are on the scale of tens and hundreds of micrometers. So although the structural organization might be similar, the fact that they are much larger means that we can study them under the regular optical microscope. The regular optical microscope, and if needed, we can change the conditions and explore in details what's going on. And this was the motivation, because what you see here is actually the topological transition, because the first nuclei must be single-connected things in the shape of sphere, and then somehow they elongate and find the ends of themselves and close up. Of themselves and close up into toroidal structures. So, the possibility to explore the system in which you observe the topological transitions was the main motivation of this work, simply because it's simple and reproducible. So, I will first discuss very briefly the main factors that affect the shape of droplets of licked crystals. Shape of droplets of licked crystals. And then we'll go through the well-known facts such as behavior and shape of thermotropic licked crystals. And then we will go to the second part of the talk where we will be dealing with this specific type of leak crystals, which is kind of biologically relevant because it resembles the structure of DNA. It's the lyotropic hormonic leak crystals, and we will see that. Crystals, and we will see that the shape is not always trivial. And we observe the topological transition from tractoids to toroids. And I will finish with a brief account of toroidal structures in light tropic harmonics. So, this is the main factors that define the behavior of leak crystals in an isotope. Crystals in an isotropic fluid, or it might be its own melt. The surface tension is anisotropic. It means that in addition to the normal surface tension coefficient here, you also have a contribution that depends on the angle between the director inside the droplet and the normal to the interface. The simplest shape of this additional term. Of this additional term is just the scalar product squared of the two vectors. And if one looks at the known material parameters for regular thermotropic leak crystals, one would realize that, as expected, the anisotropy of surface tension is weaker than the surface tension itself. The other thing that controls the behavior of the droplets and their shape is. Droplets and their shape is internal elasticity written here in the Frank Ozin presentation with display, twist, and band contributions. And one can construct dimensionless quantities that would characterize the ratio of the surface tension to the elastic energy and for anchoring to the elastic energy. And typically, the surface tension wins. And because of that, if you And because of that, if you study the droplets of normal thermotropic leak crystals in the isotropic environment, you would see rounded shapes, spheres, and inside of those spheres, you would see topological defects that are stable because of the Coin-Carret and Gauss theorems. You can change the boundary conditions and you would observe how these topological defects would. How these topological defects would morph. There is only one exception, at least known to me, when the droplets of thermotropic crystals not only become pronouncedly non-spherical, but even show the division. This is the example here. It happens during the phase transition from the chiral cholosteric to the so-called smactic. And some time ago, we connected it with the fact that. Ago, we connected it with the fact that maybe because of the structure of the interface, the effective surface tension is negative. But again, this is a very specific case, and I'm not going to expand on it. It's just an exclusion from the rule that proves the general rule that in thermotropics the surface tension wins. And now we will proceed to Proceed to the leotropic chromonic crystals, which are very peculiar types of materials. They are formed by plant-like molecules. The one is shown here. And when thrown in water, these molecules try to stack on top of each other in order to shield this hydrophobic central cores from water and form elongated aggregates. This aggregates a very similar Aggregates are very similar to the DNA strands. The distance between the molecules along the aggregate is the same as the distance between base pairs in the DNA. The diameter is the same. The electric charges, two per base pair, is the same. So it's very similar. The only difference is that the sticking energy that keeps these molecules together is weak. Together is weak. It's not a covalent bond, it's a hydrophobic bond, and this energy is only 10 Boltzmann temperatures. So, because of that, small changes in temperature could easily reduce or increase the length of the aggregates, which is a polydispersed quantity that depends strongly on the scission energy, delta, and temperature, and also on the consumption. And on temperature, and also on the concentration of the material. So, when the concentration is high enough, then this elongated aggregates form a liquid crystal phase mainly because of the Onsager mechanism. And if we compare this type of liquid crystal with the other types, such as Onsager system, which is comprised of rods of fixed length. Fixed lengths, then we would realize that in the chromonics, there are two independent parameters that can be used to explore the phase diagram. One is concentration, which is the same as in the Onsager system. And another one is temperature. As you probably know, the Onsager system is a thermal. The temperature doesn't play any role because disordering is controlled. This ordering disordering is controlled by entropy. And temperature is important in the so-called thermotropic crystals, in which case we don't have a solvent. We have the entire space filled with the same type of molecules and temperature just produces some disorganization in orientation of those molecules. So, in the case of chromonics, you have both. You can increase the temperature and the aggregate. The temperature and the aggregates will become shorter, and you would go into the isotropic phase, or you can change the concentration. The higher concentration would produce more ordered states. This is the typical phase diagram. As you might see here on the horizontal axis, we have the concentration of the material, and on the vertical axis, we have temperature. Axis, we have temperature, and here is the sketch of three phases: the isotopic phase, the nematic phase, in which one has only an orientational order, and columnar phase, in which the aggregates, columnar aggregates form a hexagonal lattice. So, let's just consider a very simple situation when we go through temperature from the isotropic phase to the coexistence region between the Resistance region between the nematic and the isotopic phase. And you see the nuclei of the nematic. Those are this orange entities. And they are clearly not circular, not spherical. And you can estimate the ratio of the surface tension to the anchoring, which is in this type of material opposite to what we typically observe. What we typically observe here, the surface tension appears to be smaller than the anisotropy of the surface tension. Another interesting thing is that the number of cusps that you observe in the shapes, those are the cusps and the poles, kind of correlates with the director field inside the droplet. Here, I see the few nuclei coalescing. Nuclei coalescing and forming a topological defect in the center of the nuclei. And this is a defect of strengths minus one half. And you can count three cusps at the surface, while in the normal tectoids, you would have just two cusps. You can do the inverse transition. You can melt the nematic into the isotopic phase and you would observe again. And you would observe again that now the negative tactoids have the same feature. They show cusps, and the cusps are the number of cusps is correlating with the surrounding director field. So how to explain these shapes? Apparently, we need to minimize the elastic energy and anisotropic surface energy, and there are some attempts to do this. To do this, Epiphanio Virga and other people do the approach with different methods in putting numerical simulations. But we decided just to, as a first step, to do it in a very simple fashion. Namely, we decide to fix the director field and consider that it doesn't change no matter what is the shape of the tactoid. The tactoid and then minimize the anisotropic surface tension, which for the nucleus that is located in the center of the defect acquires this form. And then the problem boils down to the wolf construction for a liquid crystal, not just a regular crystal, but a liquid crystal. But the math is exactly the same. We have the The same. We have the plot of the surface tension as the function of azimuthal angle shown here. And then we draw the lines OA to this plot of surface tension and then reconstruct the normal to this line. And the envelope of all these normals AB would produce the equilibrium shape. And from this construction, we can find the condition of the normal. Find the condition on the surface anchoring strengths, this W which tells us that if this left-hand side of the equation is smaller than zero, then we would have cusps. And here I show the results for different director configurations, defects of strengths minus one, minus one half, and the corresponding shapes of the nuclei. Shapes of the nuclei. So the visible part is what is inside the configurations. Everything that is beyond the cusps is invisible because it cannot be realized in physical world. And here you see the result for two particular cases for the negative tactoid inside the minus one half defect and for positive tactoid. And for positive tactoid, which has minus one-half defect in the center. So, although we made a very drastic approximation, this minimization of just the surface tension produces results that are kind of resembling what is observed in the experiment. But now we decided to make our life easier by expanding the range in which the The range in which the biphasic region can be observed, and for that, we combine the chromonic material with a crowding agent, polyethylene glycol. It's used in biology for a variety of reasons, very similar to what we use it for. Namely, it helps to phase separate the isotropic phase from the condensed ordered phase. Convinced ordered phase. The molecules of PEG go into water and they kind of expel the chromonic molecules from water into condensates. And then suddenly in the biphasic regions, we saw that it's not only tactoids that could exist, but also toroids. And sometimes they transform one into another. This is a thick sample, and it's very difficult to kind of reconstruct the director field. So we decided. Field. So we decided to go into the simpler problem in which the material is confined between two glass plates and the thickness is only a few micrometers. So the structure is essentially two-dimensional. And here you see the topological transformation. On the left-hand side, it's the tactoid, or in other branches of science, people call these structures different names such as. And different names, such as spindles, for example. And then, as you change the temperature, the two cusps transform into two defects, two disclinations that approach each other and then eventually join in the center. And you can see clearly that the topology of the entire formation is changed from being the disc-like to The disk-like to donut-like. The first question that arises here is: what is the phase inside this formation? Is it always anematic or maybe we have a simple transition between anematic and the columbar phase? So, are we going through this region in which we have only coexistence of isotropic? The coexistence of isotropic and nematic, or maybe we are going through this region where we have columnar phase and the isotropic phase. And X-ray tells us that we are strictly in the nematic domain. There is no columnar phase at this stage. So the transition is not caused by the phase transformation. It's simply some reorganization of the nematic phase. And so we decided to just calculate. And so we decided to just calculate the elastic energy of the two formations. For toroids, it's very simple. It's just the so-called splay term is absent because there is no splay. There is only bad of the director field. And so the answer is found immediately. But for the tactoid, it's a little bit more complicated. So we used the specific Specific system of coordinates in which the director field is assumed to be following the coordinate lines. And in that case, we can calculate both splay and band term. And from the ratio of the two energies, it is kind of clear that if the splay elastic constant becomes larger and larger, then the tactoid would be less and less. It would be less and less energetically preferable and eventually might transform into the toroid. Of course, we have to remember that the actual transition is not between the tactoid and toroid. It goes through the elliptic formation in which you have two foci that approach each other. And so, again, we could calculate the elastic energy making some dramatic assumptions that the director lines for. That the director lines follow the coordinate lines of the ellipsoidal system of coordinates and arrive at a similar expression that contains the splay deformations. Splay deformations are clearly visible here near the course of the defects and band deformation. Band is again the exclusive deformation of the toroid and something that exists in tactoids in the equatorial. In tactoids in the equatorial plane. And again, we see that if we would increase k11, then chances are that the structure on the left will be less preferable than the structure on the right. Of course, the consideration should also take into account the surface energy, but with this very weak dependence of the perimeter of an ellipse. Parameter of an ellipse on the eccentricity of the formation, we kind of see that the elastic energy is more important than the change in the length of the interface between the two phases. So what do we know about the elastic constants? Here are the results that we already knew before this work that changing the concentration of the material. Of the material dramatically changes elastic constant, for example, splay elastic constant. This is the geometrical presentation of splay. It increases dramatically with the concentration. And the simple model presentations of the elastic constants suggest that as you elongate the aggregates, as the concentration becomes As the concentration becomes larger and larger, what happens is that making splay becomes more and more difficult because splay requires to fill the empty pockets with the ends of the molecules. And if the molecules are very long, there are not that many ends available. And because of that, the elastic constant of splay increases dramatically with the concentration. On the other hand, band does not. And band does not require any ends, it's just the quantity that is related to the persistent lengths of the aggregates. And so the ratio of splay to band constant should be a function of concentration and should increase with the concentration. And this is probably the reason why we observe the transition from the tactoid to toroid. But of course, the problem. Course, the problem needs mathematical analysis done in a proper way and maybe simulations. And I would like to conclude with another example, which is on the higher end of concentrations. It's in the region where we have just the isotropic and columnar phase coexisting. If you equilibrate the system for a long time, then you would see these formations. And one of those is the subject of One of those is the subject of the reminder of this talk. It's the toroidal structure with well-defined facets caused by the hexagonal ordering of the aggregates. And as you change the concentration, you observe a clear trend in the shape development of those toroids. If the concentration is low, they are kind of thin, and as you increase the concentration, they become more. Concentration they become more and more resembling a sphere, they become fat. This is the result for pure disodium chromogly, pure chromonic liquid crystal. And the next slide shows similar results when the chromonic is condensed by the PEG molecules. And again, you see the same trend as the concentration increases, you observe more fat. From more fat toroids. So, we could not do the description of all these structures. We could just use the approximation of very thin toroids when the radius of the hole is much, much larger than the thickness of the toroid. And in this approximation, it's possible to calculate. It's possible to calculate the surface and elastic energy of the toroid and find out by minimization that the ratio of the thickness of the toroid to the radius is a function of the surface tension and the elastic constant of band and also depends on the volume. And the ratio This ratio can be rewritten in the form of dimensionless quantity beta that measures the ratio of elastic constant to the surface tension and also the characteristic size of the toroid. And the experiments show that, in fact, the trend, although it's derived for very thin toroids, is more or less. It's more or less what one would see in the experiments. If you plot A over R to the power of five-thirds as the function of the characteristic scale, you would see that the larger is toroid, the fatter it becomes. And similarly, for the dependence of the dimensionless parameter on the concentration, you would see that as the concentration increases. As the concentration increases, this beta parameter goes down, and that is again qualitatively clear because smaller beta means that the surface tension becomes more and more important. And that means that the toroid would like to minimize the surface area and become closer to a sphere. And a larger beta means that we would have a stronger band. A stronger band constant, and it will be better for the toroid to expand the central hole so that the density of splay of, I'm sorry, band deformation is not that high. So, as I said, this is work in progress and the preliminary results are that chromonic materials offer interesting scenarios of changing shapes and even Change in shapes and even the topology of their droplets as the function of temperature and concentration. In the case of columnar phases, we kind of saw how in the experiments how the shapes are affected by concentration and temperature and propose a very simple model based on the assumption of very thin toroids. In toroids, but recently, Carmed Mitri and their colleagues developed full, not full, full model that doesn't rely on this approximation and describes the experimental findings rather well. That's all. Thank you very much for your attention. Thank you very much for the great talk. Any questions?
