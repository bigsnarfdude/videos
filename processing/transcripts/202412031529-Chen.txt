From Ardan Pain, and he's going to tell us how to expand Ricky Solar. Alright, well, first I'd just like to thank the organizers for inviting me. I've been here in the past, this is my first time giving a talk with this facility. It's a really nice facility. It's nice to see lots of familiar and your faces. Right, so this is the title of the talk. So expanding Ricci solitons are self-similar solutions of the Ricci foil, which I'll try to tell you more about. And the ones I want to talk about have a certain asymptotic behavior at spatial identity. Asymptotic to behavior at spatial identities or asymptotic to Riemannian codes. So, what I want to start out with is basically spend quite some time just motivating why we'd be interested in these objects and then say a bit about the existence results that we have in this direction. Okay, so basically, the basic motivation comes from looking at reach and flow. So, let me just recall some facts about reach and flow. Alright, so the Ricci flow is a parabolic flow that evolves a metric on a fixed smooth manifold, right? So we've got a smooth manifold, a family of Riemannian metrics indexed by time, satisfying Tg equals minus T V G. And oftentimes we have some initial condition where we prescribe maybe at time zero we want a fixed Riemannian manifold and we want to. Riemannian manifold, and we want to evolve it according to this equation. Okay, so why is this equation nice? Why might we consider this equation? One remark is that in harmonic coordinates at any fixed time, this equation takes the form dt Gij is equal to Laplace Gij plus more order terms. So in harmonic coordinates of So, in harmonic coordinates of a fixed time, we see that it looks like a heat equation plus a lower order term. So, we might expect it to have some nice smoothing properties for a manifold. Maybe also just a quick comment about where this flow came from originally. So, well, Hamilton first considered this flow on three manifolds, and he was trying to basically ask about when do you have constant curvature metrics on a three-manifold, which in three-manifold cases is equivalent to, say, an Einstein manifold. Is equivalent to, say, an Einstein metric. Okay, and so, well, Einstein metrics are critical points of the total scalar curve to functional, maybe normalized by volume. And so you might try to then consider gradient flow of this functional. So this doesn't quite work because Einstein metrics minimize this functional within their conformal This functional within their conformal class, but outside of the conformal class, they actually maximize this functional in all but finitely many directions. But if you kind of just formally take the gradient of this functional, you will see a minus Ti-Ricci term plus a conformal term. If you make some modifications, you essentially get the Ricci flow. So that's where this originally came from. All right. Okay, so these are kind of some promising features of the flow. And of course, then the reason people are still interested in this many years since it was introduced is because it has many useful applications. Is because it has many useful applications. So, we mentioned two, for instance, the Ricci flow will give you an independent proof of the uniformization theorem for compact two manifolds. And in dimension three, about 20 years ago, then this gave us a proof of geometrization. Geometrization conjecture, a special case in which is the Paris conjecture that classifies compact free manifolds. One remark that's kind of interesting, actually, even just in the two-dimensional case, right, so it proves uniformization for compact manifolds, but if you, there's also a version of uniformization for non-compact connected manifolds, so it's an interesting question where they want to use regional approach to that. All right, and so, well, the kind of broad So, well, the kind of broad motivation for the topic of today's talk is kind of what can we do with RuiGFlow in dimension four. And so maybe a quick preview of what I'm going to say is that starting in dimension four, you see conical singularities of the Ricci flow. You want to kind of understand how you can resolve these conical singularities and flow past those. And expanding Ricci solitons are objects that are important in. Are objects that are important in the kind of solution of that question, or expect to be important in the solution of that question. Okay, right, so let me just continue a bit talking about the lower dimensional cases versus the motivation. So example, let's consider a Ricci flow with initial data, something pretty simple, so just around E sphere. So in this case, then the Ricci curvature is just. Case, then the Ricci curvature is just the Gauss curvature times the metric itself. And then using the scaling properties of the Ricci tensor, then we can easily come up with the Ricci flow solution, which is going to be Vg of t equals 1 minus T times G C. So if we draw ourselves a picture of what this looks like, we have our time axis in the vertical direction, time is 0, we have our ground view. 0, we have our ground unit q sphere, and it's going to shrink to a point singularity, so our singular time t equals 1/2. So this is our sort of space-time picture of what's happening along the flight. All right, so in general, we might hope to have some smoothing properties, but already we can see in dimension two, we might see some singularities. Now, fortunately, in dimension two, Now, fortunately, in dimension two, this singularity is not a big concern for us. You see that the shape is just the same. It's still around sphere, just smaller. So we can just normalize the volume to be constant. Okay? And then once we do that, then we just see the same round units here that persists for all times. Okay, so. Okay, so this is, of course, for this very special case of the round sphere, but it turns out in dimension two, this kind of procedure actually takes care of any singularity that we see, starting from the compact two manifold. So any of these two singularity of compact H2O can be addressed in this way. Way. Right, so there's not too much to worry about, and this is an important feature that leads potentially to this independent proof of decompression. Right, so now let's move up to dimension three. This is dimension two. As we move up in dimension, we kind of get more and more complicated singularity behavior. Let's take a look at dimension three because kind of the addressing of singularity behavior. Addressing of singularities will motivate what we might hope to do, like we mentioned before. So now mentioning this three, we have more singularities that we cannot just address by normalizing volume. Okay, um so let's draw another picture. Okay, so of course we can consider the round threes here. Of course, we can consider the round 3 sphere. It will do the same thing. Essentially, shrink to a point in finite time. Again, just like to mention two, this case is not a big concern for us. We can just normalize the volume. But then some new behaviors happen. So this is a net pinch here. So you can think about this as being some kind of rotationally symmetric object where the cross-sections are two skirts. So I've got a square. I'm just going to have. Here, which is going to have very high positive curvature, and so therefore it's going to kind of compete with this negative curvature coming from the saddle region. If the curvature is higher, then it will kind of pinch inwards more and more. So we'll maybe see that part pinching closer together, hence the name. And then eventually we reach a singularity where things are only blowing up on a small subset of our manifold. There's also the degenerate version of this, known as the degenerate net pinch. Right, okay, so again we have these cross-sectional two skiers, but we also have positive curvature on this end that's moving inwards as our net is pinching down, and so it's a special case when these kind of things are kind of collapsing inwards at the same Are kind of collapsing inwards at the same rate just right, so you get kind of singularity at this tilt right here. Okay, so once again, now if we just start from the compact manifold, three manifold, run the flow, try to understand how it smooths things out and maybe tells us what our compact three manifold is, we run into this problem where we're kind of stuck, right? So we want to understand how we can sort of continue. Understand how we can sort of continue the flow and try to keep using its smoothing properties. So, any questionnaire? Right, so then there's kind of two components in order to do this. The first is we want to understand, well, what are the possible singularities that can arise from the breach of flow? So classify the singularities. And once you understand the singularities, how do you kind of modify your manifold in order that you can continue the flow? So this is what's known as surgery. Okay, so regarding classifying singularities, what one does is parabolic rescaling. So basically, right. Simple case, the sphere. We kind of zoom in closer and closer to our manifold as we approach the singular time. So maybe here we take a very wide view of the sphere. Here we kind of zoom in very close. Then we rescale so that this is the same size as before. Then we just see the same old round sphere. So then if we were to take limits, we basically get this picture here, not just our fixed unit rounds here. So we can take limits. And again, what are known as singularity models or blow-up models? Okay, so in this picture, for instance, maybe we start out here, we zoom in closer to this next pinched area, and so when we rescale this region to be the same size as the original box. To be the same size as the original box, right now we're going to see kind of a region that looks more and more cylindrical. And in this last case, we're going to do something similar. And you see something like this. Okay, so in these pictures, for these particular examples, the singularity models that one obtains are the following. So in the first case, so the pictures we have. Pictures we have. We have S3, right? So if the three skier models its own cyclone under the Ricci flow, we have a cylinder, S2 cross R. And in this last case, this is something that looks a bit like a paraboloid, which is named after the person who found it, known as the Bryant, Bryant soliton, or the Bryant solution. Okay, and so, well, the nice thing in dimension three is that these basically give you all of the singularities. All of the singularities in compact 3D Ricci flow. And so basically, we have a complete answer to this by the work of Charlotte. So these are all variant models, up to maybe taking some quotients. The quotient of S3 or something else. And then Brenzel identified the last case as indeed being bright solitop. Okay, right, so that kind of addresses this first question here. And let me just draw a quick picture about the surgery so that we can keep this in mind when we talk about the next core. Okay, so now it's a certain portion of what we'd like to do. Okay, so once again, if we see a round sphere, that's really not too much of a concern. We have a pretty good idea of kind of We have a pretty good idea of kind of the topology and geometry of that. So x3k is okay. In the other cases, what we want to do is we want to kind of look just before the singular time when we still have a smooth Riemannian manifold. And we kind of know that our singularity is occurring in this neck region, so we want to cut away from this neck region along. Along the cross-sectional two spheres. Okay, so then you, in this picture, get kind of two connected components, and then you want to cap off by D3s, let's say here. And then one has to do. And then one has to do some more work to establish that when you run this, you don't run into more singularities and so on, but at least one might hope that this allows you to continue past the singular time, and that turns out to be the case. And maybe I'll just remarks on the degenerate case, right? So we have our kind of curvature blow up occurring at the tip. So we kind of cut off here and cap off with something a bit nicer. Again, some kind of topological D3. D3. So a challenge, maybe a nice, a D3 with a nicer challenge ring. All right. And well, since we have our classification of singularities, we know that these are basically the cases that are important to address. And once we have this, then we have what's known as the theory of 3D region forward surgery, which is a program initiated by Hamilton. By Hamilton, and then let me record the final thesis completed by Harlman. And so this leads us to many, many topological applications in 3D. Okay, good. So that's kind of the overview of the lower-dimensional case, motivate what we'll talk about. Dimensional case motivate what we'll talk about in the 40 case. So, right, then a natural question: Of course, 40 is a very interesting dimension for many pathological applications, and so we might ask, well, as a first step, can we construct a theory of regulat with surgery to kind of take care of singularities that we see? So, to come back to our 4D question, 4D4. Well, surgery. So is there such theory? The answer is we don't know right now, but hopefully in the future there will be some. So again, if we just think about the 3D case, what do we need to do? We need to understand the singularities that we see, and then we need to figure out how to resolve them, right? So classify singularities. Classify singularities and then find some way of taking care of them. Alright, so the first part, classifying singularities. Unfortunately, we don't have a classification of singularities. We're very far from that. We don't even know, say, 4D compact Einstein manifolds. So we don't have this. Unlike the 3D case. Unlike the 3D case. Moreover, we certainly know of examples where we see singularity behavior that's qualitatively different from these cylinders or spheres in the lower dimensional case. And so new singularities. New singularity models that are not, say, spherical or cylindrical. So for instance, One can see a flat cone, part of 1C2. Also, a cone, an asymptotically conical model, which I won't say much about, but it's called FIK, named after the people who discovered it, Feldman, Illman, and Kanoth, but it's an object which is asymptotic to some Kaler coloring for you. Okay, so let me just say who did these. So this is due to Appleton. And this is due to the object. This is a non-compact object that it appears as a singularity model is due to Maximum. Alright? So these are new in the sense that these are conical models, which we did not see. Did not see in the lower-dimensional setting. And so, if one were to have some understanding of singularities, one certainly has to take care of things to although we don't have a classification of 4D singularity models, we do know a little bit about About their behavior of spatial infinity. So, there's recent work that in 4D, if you run into some finite time singularity of the region flow, and you take a suitable blow-up, so maybe not just any blow-up, but a suitable blow-up. It's going to be one of three things. So you may not know what your singularities are, but they have some behavior at infinity that is not in two large permits. So it's either some compact singularity model. So for instance, a round sphere would be one of these. It could be a cylinder. So ST primes R, S t primes R2, or some quotient of it, or the last case is a cone. So a reminding cone over a 3-manifold N3, a cone metric such that the scalar curvature Is non-negative. So we know a little bit about some spatial asymptotic behavior of our singularity models. And this is a question on terminology. Do these complex singularity models unquote all the gradient shrinkers? Yes, so that's a good point. I was trying to avoid saying gradient shrinkers to skip the definition, but yes, so more precisely, this is smooth, compact, gradient shrinker. Right, so as kind of indicated by the title of the As kind of indicated by the title of my talk, so we want to kind of, in this talk, focus on the cone case. So we know there exist conical singularities. In general, they seem to be some important class of singularities that one has to deal with in the 4D reticulum setting. And so we want to understand how to deal with components. Or at least what sorts of objects we might use to address these components. Alright, Eric, can you say a little bit what suitable means? Uh, suitable. Right, okay, so when we did this okay, so when we did a block sequence, you have a lot of freedom of choice in sort of terms of how you zoom in. So this is a sort of neighborhood centered at some point. Really, you want some parabolic neighborhood, but you can choose, you have a lot of choice of points converging to Converging to where your curvature is blowing up. And so suitable blow up means you choose a suitable sequence of points. And then you take limits for that particular sequence. And then you'll get a one of these. So an example is like the Bryant soliton I drew earlier. So in the picture I drew before, we got the Bryant soliton, right? So this converged like two, okay, so the Gary model was the Bryant soliton, which doesn't fall. The bright skeleton, which doesn't fall onto this list. But that kind of depended on you taking the rescaling at neighborhoods of this point on the very left here. But if you were to take a blow up on some sequence of points, that instead kind of travels kind of drifts to the right, then you'll instead see A cylinder. So that's kind of an example of what I mean here. So the bullet, so your bullet model depends on your sequence of points that you take the limit for. In general, it's non-unique. Okay. Right, okay. So maybe I'll have these conical singularities of n4d Rigiflow, and let's think about kind of what we might hope to do to resolve them with Rigiflow. Okay, so let's have a picture of some compact 4D UG flow, which is kind of forming a conical singularity. Okay, so here we have a conical singularity. So here we have a conical singularity. Okay, and if we look at what happens on the level of the bullet model is kind of this non-compact object that's sort of flowing into a colon. Singularity model of our conical singularity, and here is the cone that. Singularity, and here is the column that it floats in. So one can sort of hope, and there are reasons that one that this maybe is a reasonable hope, that maybe there's some Ricci flow that kind of smooths out this cone and keeps going for us. So it has some that smooths this out. So a huge flow coming out of the same Of the same code. Right, can we find one of these? And suppose we could find one of these, right? So, and the level of the globe model is sort of smoothing out this conical singularity. Well, maybe we can bring this back into a compact setting and do something like what we did before, right? So then maybe we can cut out this region and glue in this. this object, every smoothing out the cone, and be able to continue the flow. Alright, so there's kind of two things that we might hope would happen. And so now we basically get to the reason for the title of this talk. Basically, finding these objects here are these aspects. Are just asymptotically conical, right? So they should have some conical behavior at infinity, expanding register under the names for these things. So I won't say too much about point two, so we're going to go resume like one for most of the rest of this talk. So this leads us to the question of finding expanding Ricci solitons. Okay, I'll give you the definition in a moment. Maybe a comment on the word Ricci solitons. All this means is that it's a self-similar solution of the Ricci flow. In a way that maybe I'll state a bit more precisely in a moment here, which are asking how to reconical. And right A C probably later on, right? Because we want the isotopics to match well enough that we can do this Boolean. Okay, so just the definition. So we say that a Riemannian manifold, mg. Energy with a vector field X is an expander, equivalently the expander of G soliton, if it satisfies the following equation. So we remember that the Ricci flow equation was d dt of G equals minus 2 Ricci. So if minus 2 Ricci is equal to 2 reg is equal to g plus the lead derivative in the direction x of g. So if we kind of pretend this is now our new right-hand side of our equation, given this manifold, and what we see is basically we have two kinds of evolution for this manifold. We have this evolution by scaling and this evolution by the kind of flow of x. And this is where the self-similarity comes in. So this fixed manifold. Similarity comes in. So, this fixed manifold generates or is kind of associated to a Ricci flow, which will evolve by scaling and pullbacks by diffimorphisms. And so, in that sense, we view it as being self-similar, because neither of those kind of change shapes of the manifold very much. Right, so let me write down the brief volume that you get from this. So we have an associated UG flow Ut, which is going to be T times pulled back by some family of isomorphisms of this fixed G, T greater than zero, where phi is basically the flow. Is basically the flow of X up to some scale. So here maybe more explicitly we see of the self-similarity, right? We have the scaling in time. That's why it's expanding, right? As time grows, we're scaling our metric up. And so then we have maybe some family of diffeomorphisms that is changing between here metric in that way. Changing between hereometric in that way, but otherwise it's essentially self-summit. Okay, so that is our associated Ricci flow. And so in the cone case, we basically should imagine there we have our cone that's singular at time zero, and then there's an associated family of expanders that flows out of the cone, and maybe as time goes to zero, converges back to this singular object of the cone in some weak sense. Okay, so those are expanding weak solitons. Let me give you an. Let me give you an explicit example. So just take the flat metric, and the vector root x is equal to minus one half r partial r. Okay, so of course the flat metric is Ricci flat, so this is really static under the Ricci flow. But we can also view it as an expanding Ricci soliton where kind of the scaling up by T and the diffeomorphism phi are fighting against each other. And phi are fighting against each other. So this is associated with the Ricci flow. In the above form, g of t is equal to t times a pullback of delta ij, where phi t I think should be e to the minus, so phi t of x should be t. Should be t to the minus one times times x, right? So the vector field is kind of moving things inwards, and that's competing against the t, that's scaling things outwards. So we still get our static flow, right? So this is still equal to just delta ij, but we can view it in this particular form. So that's an example of an expanding veg solid. Okay, so Okay, so then motivated by these, so what is our question? Our question is kind of given some conical singularity, is there one of these objects, an expanding reticeliton, which smooths out this code? So the question is, so maybe we fix some topology on which we want to find our expander. M4 and cone. And the cone. Is there a metric G and a vector field X on F4 such that the expanding soliton equation is satisfied? And if g is asymptotic to gamma as we go to infinity. So the picture is that we have a cone. We have some manifold. Maybe it has some topology inside some compact region. Here's M4. We want kind of boundary of M4 to equal M3. And so we're trying to find these objects, the metric x. Objects, the metric X and the vector, sorry, metric G, vector field X, so that we have a certain asymptotic behavior. So we can view this as, so this turns out to be a kind of elliptic boundary value problem where our boundary data is this asymptotic code of the thing. So this is going to be, in some sense, our elliptic equation. Maybe this looks a bit strange because we have x as well, but I'll try. Because we have x as well, but I'll try to do this somewhat precisely later. So, elliptic boundary value problem, and then we have this boundary data, that spatial identity. Okay, so this kind of viewpoint of this question is. Sorry about if N is like memorable to call anything. Sorry? If N is my motivated to be calling? Uh it it may not be. So so right, so you could you could kind of just maybe come up with any four manifold with boundaries. We only require that this should be true, so that you have the asymptotic behavior should match. But inside your asymptotically conical smooth expander, may have some additional topology that you didn't see the colour. Yeah. What was the remote are these processes? Sorry, the cone or the R plus R plus N. Right, so this itself is not really the Ricci soliton, it's sort of the asymptotic cone of the Ricci soliton. So the Ricci solitons are, okay, so generally they're also smooth objects. They're also smooth objects. And then they flow into this cone and they hit the singularity at some time. So they're kind of like the dual picture to the expander case, where the expander exists for all positive times. The shrinkers, these singularity models exist for all negative times, saying they flow into something singular at time t equals zero, which is that column. There's no requisite for the equation for the column. Or do you mean like which columns we see under this picture? I mean, I think below. Oh, I see. Um right, so we we don't know too much about what the cones should be other than that they have non-negative scalar tiltship. So there's very few examples of such cones that we see. So I think in 40 there's only one example of such a cone that we see. But in general we don't know currently. Oh, maybe a quick comment. So maybe one wonders: okay, so we have this cone. Wonders, okay, so we have this cone. Why do we want to look for these particular Ricci flows coming out of the cone and not something else? These are nice for a number of reasons. So you get some monofinicity properties for some entropy functionals, which are potentially useful. And kind of setting up the problem in this way is a convenient way to kind of look for these solutions where, and because the cone itself is singular, you can't just take this as an initial data and plug it into the region flow and get all automatically solutions. Into the Reachiflow and get an automatic resolution because of the sync point. So, are you trying to flow past the comb, like past the singularity, past it like you did with surgery before? Exactly. Are you looking for like on the other side of the comb, how close to a comb do you need to get? Like, how close to a comb can you get? Like, 32 plum standard? Or I guess right, right. So, so I guess this picture should. So, I guess this picture should be getting very close to the cone, maybe away from the cone tip in some local sense. But when you do the gluing, then what you need is: so, when you have a conical singularity, so maybe this region is fairly close to the asymptotics of the cone, so you just want your objects which are folding out to have close enough asymptotics that you can do. Yeah, and so then you'd you'd like to continue to. So, that is your picture on the right-hand side, is that supposed to be on? Is that supposed to mirror the pink coming through the blue thing? These here. Is that fair mirroring the coming out of that side? Right, yeah. So these objects that we're looking for here, these expanders, so these things here are exactly these that we're looking for. Yeah, so we're looking for a fixed object here, but this is the picture where we have kind of this fixed object and then the associated Reachy flow. And so this red thing here, the associated And so this red thing here, the associated terrific stuff, because they're self-simplified. We only need to kind of define one time slice to get the whole thing. Yeah. Sure, thanks. Right. Okay. So maybe I'll mention kind of some analogies to this viewpoint, right? An elliptic problem with some boundary values, which has come up in a number of other geometric settings as well, including some related to. from homogeometry. So some related settings. So maybe one that's very close is just the analogous picture for asymptotically conical expanders in the mean curvature of a close setting. Okay, um another one uh Um another one uh is a plateau problem with some prescribed boundary. So if you have maybe some manifold with boundary, you're looking for some stationary immersion into maybe Euclidean space with the prescribed boundary, and so the stationary immersion condition gives you some elliptic problem, and then your prescribed boundary is this boundary data of the boundary. Boundaries is this boundary data for the math that you're looking for. And another one is informally compact Einstein's, where now you have some prescribed conformal intended maybe there are others that Maybe there are others that I don't know as well, which I'd be very interested. Here are some examples. Okay, so maybe let's think a bit more about what boundary data should we be concerned with in our case. Right, so let's so well on one hand we really only need to deal with cones that appear as singularities under VG flow. In 4D, cones arising as singularities in 4D VG flow. As I sort of mentioned in words earlier. As I sort of mentioned in words earlier, we only know one example of such a color, which is the FIK, kind of cone associated with the FIK string. Okay, but unfortunately, we can't really rule out that the others occur either. So the best we can do is to take that third point in Bamler's result, which tells us that all cones must have non-negative scalar curvature. Of scalar curvature. So maybe we can never figure out what are the cones that do appear, but maybe we can try to make sure that for anyone that possibly does appear, we do have some expander that would be able to help us. So any such phone? Okay, so in in my notation, this is r was constant three. r plus cosmic 3 and uh gamma equal to qr squared plus r squared h. Okay, so now if the cone has non-negative scalar curvature, this implies that the scalar curvature of the link has positive scalar curvature. And so that places some strong restrictions on the topology of n. So we do have some limits on what sort of boundary values we do need to worry about in this case. Need to worry about these case. So this implies that M3 is a manifold emitting positive curvature. It could be asked that it's oriented as well, and so then we get that it's just going to be a connected sum of circular space forms together with some S2 process form. Okay, um so let me now say a bit about what's previously done in this direction. So, previously, for this problem of finding an expanding soliton, Solaton, asymptotic to a certain cone. When the given cone has a curvature operator, not negative, then this has been done. We have existence due to Simon's farewell. And moreover, we actually also have the second part of that picture I had before. The second part of that picture I had before with the surgery and resolving these conical singularities. So, we also have the surgery procedures also been done by Schultz. So, in this case, we have a stronger curvature restriction on the cone. Everything is okay, or our imagined picture works like we expect. Now, let me just remark that in this case, again, Again, this implies that the length of our cone is going to be quotient of some three scales, all right? So just one of these three components. And so let me now state our first result. It's an existence result. Again, for cones over the same topology. But we're able to now have just the scalar curvature. Now have just the scalar curvature assumption. So, um, any code is the Is the width scalar non-negative? Is the asymptotic cone of some expander on D4. So we do allow for isolated orbital singularities, in this case at the center, origin of D4. Right, so where this comes from is a more general framework of degree theory that we have, where the model A degree theory that we have were the moduli spaces of expanders on a fixed, for example. And again, some of these sort of parallel certain developments in some of these fields as well. So Matt. So we have, so I should say, given given M4. And so here we have a compact animal with boundary M4, which we hope to, on which we hope to find an asymptotically conical expander. Asked the cone over boundary of M4. So given M4, the trajectory map from this group M, a moduli space of expanding R2 solitons on our fixed four manifold with boundary. Which are asymptotically conical. And then we just have kind of the natural projection down to their asymptotic cones, which are called cones. So, this map is proper with a well-defined z degree. In general, which depends on M4, which we call standard free M4. So in particular, when this number is non-zero, then we have search activity of this map, and that would tell us then that basically every cone metric here has at least one corresponding expander that's asymptotically to it. Uh let me mention some remarks. So in the case when M4 is either D4 or maybe a quotient of D4 by some finite group acting isometrically on the S3. 3, then one can compute the expander degree is equal to 1. And how we establish this is basically there's some rigidity properties of the Gaussian expander that I showed you earlier. And that basically is how we get this theorem right here. So follows from the free theory and some uniqueness results for the Gaussian expander. Another remark I'd like to mention is that this problem, this elliptic problem of solving for expanders. Solving for expanders, you can do it formally, not on your smooth medical, but in a kind of on, yeah, so you can always solve this problem formally in terms of power studio expansions on, say, an interval cross N3. And so, really, kind of, your solutions are almost prescribed up to. Your solutions are almost prescribed up to some terms that are decaying exponentially at time infinity, at spatial infinity. And then, maybe some kind of questions that actually occur with these results, in this framework of this expander degree, is, well, in the first case, given this decomposition, we might like to understand kind of two questions. So, one is, what is the expanded degree for some four-manifold whose boundary is S2 cross S1? Boundary is S2 cross S1. So I hope that this is non-zero so that we have things available for us to resolve conical singularities. There's some M4 boundary. Boundary is s process one. So similar to the CCE case, right, there's two filling ins. You can either do D3 process S1 or D2 process S2. And then the second question is, well, does it maybe behave well under operations that correspond to this connected sum of the level of the link? So it's the boundary connected sum. So basically, if you have some expander on F1 and One and some other expander on two. Can you do some kind of boundary connected sum construction and understand what are the expanders that are asymptotically conical and cones over the connected sums of their boundaries? Okay, so I don't have very much time. Okay, so I don't have very much time remaining, so maybe I'll just kind of quickly list out and say a bit about some of the ingredients that go into these results. Sorry, you say this is a question? These are questions, sorry. These are, yeah, so this is question one. This is question two. Hopefully, maybe we'll be able to say something about this case not too long. Yeah, so I mean, the hope is that maybe you can say that the expanded degree is non-zero in each of these. The expander degree is non-zero in each of these cases, and then get the existence of all these smooth expanders that you would possibly need to resolve colonial singularities. So the second question somehow gave a hint what the choice of the n for. Possibly, yeah. So if you could actually carry out this construction and kind of do some Googling or something, then maybe, yeah. But whether that can depend, I guess that's uncertain. Okay, so some ingredients, which unfortunately I won't time to say much about. But first is the construction of this moduli space. So I didn't say much about this, but there's some gauging issues here. So constructing an M. So there's kind of a local picture where you want to solve the corresponding elliptic equation to have a local structure. This relies on a certain gauge, the deterrent gauge, which is related to the API gauge in the Einstein case. It's essentially the same thing. So you have the local structure, but then to define the kind of global structure at the space m, you also need to have a gauge along this conical end. This conical N. And these are things that one's going to have to resolve and make sure that you're sort of accounting for these appropriately. The second part is the properness of this projection map. So I think one big advantage we have in the expander case that may be different from some Different from some other settings is this viewpoint of our expanders as being sort of weak, Greechy flows coming out of the cones. So you have some preservation of entropy that gives you some geometric controls, some non-collapsing properties. Also gives you some good uniform asymptotic control when you kind of restrict your asymptotic cones to some compact sense because there's the properness. Right, so the properness, and there's also the Definition of the orientation that allows one to define the expanded degree. So if you have kind of a regular point of this projection, eventually the orientation is going to depend on the index of the linearization of the elliptic operator that we saw that defined the expander equation. And then also just again related to this first time. Again, related to this first point, resolving the gauging issues. So, this gauge is not just far away, but it's globally. So, there's two different gauges. So, one is the global one is kind of a fixed set of coordinates at infinity for your expander. So, you have your M4. So, maybe just a quick picture. So, you have your M4, and then you kind of have a fixed map here. So, this is I process. Here, so this is i cross m3. You have a fixed map iota going into m4 that basically parametrizes parametrizes this region here. So you want a fixed set of coordinates here to work with. And so this is the global structure. But then when you're actually solving the equation to find your expanders, that's when you want to use this Bianchi cage to determine H. And that that could potentially move this up here, and so then you have to resolve these these two different cages, understanding the structure. Understanding construction. Right, so I'll finish there. Thanks. So, thank you for a very good question. Oh, oh.
