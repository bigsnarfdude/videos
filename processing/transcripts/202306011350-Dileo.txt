Okay, so for the second opening at all, we have Julia DeLeau from the University of Bari. Please, the fourth. So thank you very much. So I would say that in this moment everybody knows what the three alpha diversity for is. So I will focus on a special property in dimension 7, which is In dimension 7, which is linked to some G2 structure, and which is the existence of some generalized kinetic spinels. So let me briefly recall what a generalized Kinnet spinel is. This is defined as a spinal field on the remaining spin manifold satisfying this equation which involves asymmetric anhomorphism field X. endomorphism field S, which we can assume in a derogator form. And the eigenvalues of this endomorphism S are called generalized Kieling numbers. When they coincide with an vanishing lambda, we say that C is a Riemannian Kieling spin. Obviously, when S is equal to zero, we have nothing but an oblique parallel spin. And I would like only to recall that Like only to recall that generalized kidney spin orders naturally arise on a hypersurfaces of Riemannian spin manifolds endowed with a parallel spin or well since we will be focused on a seven-dimensional case I'm recalling here that on a seven-dimensional compact simply connected display manifold it is already It is already well known that the manifold admits at least one generalized cumin spinol, if it is a co-calibrated G2, while it admits exactly one or two or three kumin spinoles, if it is nearly paralleled G2, Einstein alpha Sasaki and three alpha Sasaki. Well, let's go now to three alpha delta Sasaki manifolds which are Sasaki manifolds, which are a generalization of three alpha-Sasaki manifolds. So we are in the context of almost three complex thermometric manifolds, and we have two complementary orthogonal distributions. One particle distribution, which is three-dimensional and spanned by three globally defined vector fields, which are orthonormal, and which the endomorphism of the Physique phi of the structure act in this way. The horizontal distribution H is such that the endomorphisms are compatible with the Riemannian metric and they satisfy quaternionic identities so that the dimension of the manifold is 4n plus 3. Well, this is the defining condition for a 3 alpha delta Sasaki manifold, which involves As a Saki manifold, which involves the fundamental two forms Vi and which allow to show various properties already described by Ernie, Jonas and Leander. So I will be quick. Yes. Equation one basically defines the numbers alpha and delta. Sorry? Equation one is the definition of these two numbers alpha and delta. Yes, we can we choose alpha and delta the only. Choose alpha and delta, the only question is: why did you choose to write it this way? I mean, why not just put the alpha on the first term and the delta? Ah, okay. Yes, when we wrote this first paper with the Inca, the other coefficients just of beta and gamma were already. No, no, that's not my question. I guess, is it because you want something special to happen when they're equal, so that the term value. So that the term vanishes because you could have just defined it to be 2 alpha phi i plus 2 delta eta j by j k, right? Ah, okay. Close to the case that alpha equal to delta is 3 alpha sasaki. It was more natural to define it in this way because yes, 3 alpha sasaki is the only case where you can see that. The only case you can see that the fundamental two forms are closed. It was more natural. Alpha equal to delta equal to one is this exact case. Okay, so we have this three-dimensional vertical distribution, which is intangible with the totally geodesic leaves, and the red vector fields are killing. Of killing. As already Leander said, we have a locally defined Riemannian summation of a quaternionic manifold whose scalar curvature is a positive multiple of the product alpha delta. And in fact, we distinguish these manifolds into positive, negative, and degenerate. According to the product alpha delta being positive. product alpha delta being positive negative or delta equals to zero. In particular, a special example of the generated three alpha delta Sacchi manifold is given by the quaternionic Isen Delbde group. These three classes are all preserved by special type of deformations of the structure which we call the Homoathetic deformations. So So every three alpha delta Sasaki manifold then meets a unique matrix connection with the total skew symmetric torsion, satisfying these quaternionic type equation regarding the covariant derivatives of the structured isolates. The torsion of this connection is given by this 3-4. By this three-form, which is convenient to express in terms of the horizontal fundamental two forms. And this connection has the remarkable property that it has a parallel torsion. So let's go now to the seven-dimensional case. In this case, we can consider adapted local organomal frames. Local orthonormal frames of this type, which in particular know to have to locally express the horizontal fundamental two forms. And we can consider the three-form omega defined in this way, which defines a G2 structure. This G2 structure is co-closed so that we always have a co-calibrated G2 structure. And as a co-calibrated G2 structure, there exists a unique matrix function with the total skew symmetry torsion preserving the structure. The torsion is given by this three-form, which we can show that coincides with the detrion of the canonical connection. So, for a seven-dimensional L3-alpha delta-Saki manifold, the canonical connection connects the connection. Manifold, the canonical connection of the three alpha delta Sasaki structure coincides with the characteristic torsion of the G2 structure. And thus, it has parallel torsion. This is the property we are interested in, as co-calibrated G2 structures with the parallel characteristic torsion have been studied by Thomas Friedrich in a paper 2007. And we can apply his results to show that there exists some generalized kidney spinels. We need to consider the canonical spinal field Cz law defined in this manifold, which is the unique spinal field satisfying these equations. And using the spinal fields, we We obtained that C0 is in fact a generalized kinetic spinos with two eigenvalues corresponding respectively to horizontal or vertical eigenvectors. And these two eigenvalues coincide if and only if delta is equal to 5 alpha, in which case the Case the co-calibrated G2 structure is nearly parallel? Well, I would like to remark the fact that this is a very special case. In fact, on any pre-alpha deltas acuman equal, we can have a complete expression of the Riemannian Ricci tensor and the Ricci tensor of the canonical. And the reach in terms of the canonical connection. Here the dimension is 4n plus 3. And from these expressions, we can see that the Riemannian manifold is Riemannian-Einstein only in two cases, one of which is the 3-alpha-sasaki case. It is Nabla-Einstein only in one case, and it is both Riemannian-Einstein and Nabla-Einstein in one special case. instance in one special case that is n equal to one or dimension of the manifold seven and delta equal to five alpha which is the case that canonical the canonical spin of phys epsilon is a Riemannian kidney spino well but we can also consider the Clifford product of the three characteristic Characteristic vector fields C1, C2, and C3 with this canonical spin of field. And in this way, we obtain three more generalized kinemin spinels with three eigenvalues. And we can see that any two of these eigenvalues coincide if and only if the structure is three alpha Sasakian. Well, Well, actually, these results were already known in two special cases, which are the seven-dimensional Trisasaki manifold case and the case of seven-dimensional protagonic assembly group. They were both treated by Ilke, with Thomas Friedrich and with Ferreira Storm. It was not clear that these two special cases could be viewed in a unified judgment. In a unified general framework, which we identified with three Alpha Delta Sasaki manifolds. So here I'm briefly summarizing the two Isen cases, the three Alpha Sasaki case where we have the chemonical spinol filled with, which is a generalized kining sphenol with two distinct eigenvalues and three remaining. And three Riemannian kidney spinols. While in the second I say case, C0 is a Riemannian kidney spinol, and we have three generalized kidney spinels, a spinol with three distinct eigenvalues. In all the other cases, we have four independent generalized kidney spinos with this expression for the Riemannian-rich coverage. Some more remarks. Generalised kidney spinels with three distinct eigenvalues are quite rare. On the spheres, Morojano-Sammelman showed that the only spheres admitting generalized kidney spheres with two distinct ligand variables are only the three-dimensional sphere and the seven-dimensional sphere. Dimensional sphere. Here, with the three alpha-delta-sasaki manifolds, we have generalized kidney spinos with three distinct eigenvalues, already known for the quaternionic Isen group. And very recently, Ilka, together with Jordan Hoffmann and Marie-Am√©lie Lowell, showed that on the homogeneous seven sphere there exists. There exists some generalized kidney spin also with four distinct eigenvalues, but this is not a three-alpha delta Sasaki metric. Okay. So this is a short bibliography and I finished. Thank you very much. Thank you, Julius. So questions? General question. Is there a way that I should think of these eigenvalues geometrically? Yes. And it's all the things that I'm going to call it. Yeah yeah for the Argus surface yes is there a upper bound on the number of distinct eigenvalues generally? I don't know actually upper bound on the number of distinct eigenvalues that are generalized. It could be ultra large. Are there other questions then? So, since you're chairing, can I make a single comment? Okay, so after Schugan's talk, and I started seeing things, alpha delta wouldn't be initials, would they? Would be? Initials. Initials? Alpha was had to be alpha because we have pretty alpha contact alpha sounds. The beta was is this other case? And the beta has a more general expectation in the table which we didn't tell you. And it then the gamma was the degree of freedom in the family of connections. Of connections, right? And then delta measured the commutator of these. We really started with alpha because it measured the diagonal, delta, gamma, delta. So a question related to your answer to transpression. Can given a generalized killing spinner, for the alphabetical, can you isometrically embed it somewhere so that Somewhere so that the second one inside you to get the one is a bit appear to you. This is an analytic for you. But if you've got this concern and the efficiency and this bit you know is the cover at the bottom to the airport then you get this shift very soon. Yes, yes, I was asking the other way. Yeah, the other way one and I would cover that. Um that should be actually starting by the other. I'm not quite excited. So, are there other questions? If not, let's thank Julia again. Okay, so beat the head of scale. Yeah, I'm beat the head off scan here. I think we can go ahead and find the stage on the front so we can you do that full screen maybe that's good that's good single stage down is forwarding. Okay, so for the final lightning talk of today, we have Marcus F. Meier from Aberdeen. If you'll tell us about instantons, calibrated some manifolds and speed. Yeah, thank you very much. And thanks for the organizers for putting together this wonderful conference. For putting together this wonderful conference. So, I'll be discussing one aspect of an ongoing research project that I have with Dominic Joyce, which I think relates nicely to the theme of the workshop. And one of the objectives of this talk is going to be to explain how the deformation theory of pits and tons and calibrated submanifolds fit together. Sub-manifolds fit together and to give one application based on an analytic result that I'll present. Alright. It's not going so well. Okay. Okay, so to set the stage, let's recall that a G2 instanton on the principle of G bundle P over a G2 manifold X satisfies this condition that the curvature, which with the four-form. That the curvature wedge with the floor form is equal to zero. So if you've got a G2 encyng, you might try to construct another one just by deforming the one that you've got a little bit. And well, there's going to be, you're going to use a one form to do that, but immediately you notice there's an infinitesimal condition that you need to satisfy for the modified connection to the missing tau, which is that Which is that the one form needs to be in the kernel of this map here. Alright. Okay, and this is part of what's called the deformation complex. And the other two terms are due to, well, the first one is because gauge transformations and the last one is to do with Yankee identity. Right. And roughly speaking, the deformation complex encodes what Complex encodes what the tangent space of the moduli space of two and solutons looks like. And I can sort of combine this information together neatly into a single operator by forming what's called a roll-up, which means you take all the even bits together and you take all the odd bits of your chain complex together. You use adjoints to put it all together. And the result is that the roll-up of this complex can be identified. Of this complex can be identified with a twisted Dirac operator, where we notice here that the odd forms 1 plus 7 can be identified with the spinner bundle and similarly for even forms. And one comment here is that the roller, unlike the complex, makes sense for all connections. And that can be quite useful because certain aspects of the deformation theory can. Aspects of the deformation theory can then be studied just by looking at any connection. And similarly for spin-setting connections. Okay, so let's talk about associatives. So M is supposed to be an associative here. And I don't think I need to review the definition. We've seen it a couple of times this week. I just want to remind you of how the deformation theory goes. Theory goes, which is due to Mechlin. So it can be described by choosing a spin structure on the threefold. That gives us a quadrature line bundle. And immediately, because X is a G2 manifold, it's spin, there's a two out of three spin structure on the normal bundle, which will be called new during this talk. And that's given by two paternalic line bundles. By two patternic line bundles, and they're more or less determined by fitting into this isomorphism here between the spin bundle on X, on the free fold, and on the normal bundle. Right. So for an associative, something special happens. You can actually identify the positive spinner bundle, sigma plus, with spinner bundle on n. And that means that you can identify the normal bundle u. The normal bundle with a twisted spinner bundle. And that's quite important because that explains how in this theorem due to MacLean, you're supposed to interpret actually the elements in the domain as deformations. So a little deformation of the associative m can be thought of as a normal section. And the theorem says that the deformation complex That the deformation complex, again, it's kind of rolled up form, is in fact just a twisted Dirac operator, twisted by sigma minus the minimum of the range. Okay, and again, it makes sense for all actually oriented embeddings. It's been structured, just auxiliary, and a different one would give the same operator. And similarly, for KLE case. All right, now I want to connect the two. To connect the two, and let me just remind you that if we have a complex vector bundle, then it carries a natural spin C structure, given simply by taking these complex exterior powers, let's suppose the rank is even, I guess, then we can divide them into even and odd. And there's a Clifford multiplication going between the two, which is given by Which is given by this usual combination of creation and manipulation. So V is a vector and V and psi is the one spinner. So that's the even quality. All right, it's an important point that actually the complex structures gives a little bit more. Namely, in this model, as you can see, there is a given vacuum. There's one vector that's kind of preferred in the positive spinner bundle. Bundle, and that will be used in a moment. And what I want to do now is I want to explain how to construct a vector bundle on which this G2 instant function lives. All right, so using Clifford multiplication, we can see that there is a complex of vector bundles where I take the two spinner bundles and pull them back along the projection to V. Okay. Okay, so the elements are then these pairs of a vector and a spinner, and they can be multiplied obviously by Clifford multiplication. And I suppose that the rank is 2 for simplicity, and also for simplicity, I'd like to assume that we have a spin structure on V because that will mean we have a platerionic structure actually on the spinner bundles. On the spinner bundles, the spin structure. And therefore, the positive part is actually trivial because we had a vector and it's now a quasi-nonic line bundle. Very good. In other words, this pullback bundle that I just, part of it, the sigma minus pullback, is actually framed. That's what this means. This morphism of vector bundles is an isomorphism outside the zero section. The target is termial. It's framed. And I can think of this. Right, and I can think of this as defining a vector bundle, E, over the compactified sphere bundle of this original vector bundle, V. So in a moment, M is going to be the associative and V is going to be the normal bundle. And it makes sense in this context to assume that the normal bundle has a complex structure. Bundle has a complex structure, not really be able to explain that very much. Okay, now I want to discuss the relation between the deformation theories. So, as I said, we take V to be the normal bundle. And the bundle that I just constructed, if I can view this as a principal bundle as well, form the adjoint bundle, as we should in gauge theory, of course. Theory, of course, and the only comment really I want to make here is that I get two copies here of sigma minus, and I use, I distribute these two copies. I put one into the fiber operator, so you can see this dagger operator, it's a Dirac operator twisted by one of my sigma minuses, and one of them I gifted fiber. So I will twist the Dirac operator on the fiber also by one of these guys. And that is actually something that you can identify with. That you can identify with the familiar anti-self-duality operator from Donaldson theory sitting on S6. And it is spin4 equivariant. And I hope we remember that the McLean operator is this operator. Remember what X tilde was again? I forgot. Sorry, yeah, I didn't really say it. X tilde is this sphere bundle thing on the previous slide. That is going to be X tilde. So it's a sphere bundle made out of the normal bundle of the assistance. Made out of the normal bundle of the SACF. Oh no, it's a good notation. Supposed to remind you of X. I think of it as a local version of X. All right. Okay, and then that was going to be one of the punchlines. The following observation that if you take the tensor product of these two operators thought of as chain complexes. Operators thought of as chain complexes, according to the Kunet theorem. You roll them back up again, you get one operator. This is, in fact, just the G2 instanton operator. Twisted by that bundle that I just constructed. And I, you know, I distributed the two copies accordingly too. Any degrees? Can we go? Any degree? What do you mean degree? What is degree? These are chain complexes. So it's. chain complexes so what's what's the degree what's degree zero what's degree one oh uh the domain is degree zero yeah all right so that is the analytic theorem I'd like to mention it works actually much more generally whenever you're in a fiber bundle situation and one of the operators equivariant but applied to this special case on this four-sphere bundle I'm saying that well there's a I'm saying that, well, there's a way actually to relate the spectra of the G to instantone operator. Well, I can actually do that quite. I need to do what's called an adiabatic limit. So the fiber, the four spheres, they're being multiplied by some factor of epsilon, and they will eventually become very small, but finite, not zero. And there's a relation between the eigenspace of the GT-Enstanton operator. Of the G2 instanton operators and the McLean operators on the base. And well, in generality, you would actually consider the operator on the base and it's adjoint and twisted by connections which have to do with the solutions of the fiber operator. But in this case, it's really quite simple because I'm working with the scalar ASC operator. And I guess we know how to compute the kernel and the co-kernel, which is obviously the chain complex method. Obviously, the chain complex method, and they're actually just these two trivial representations. So we get these two operators, and what the theorem is really saying is that there are kind of two regimes. There's the regime of small eigenvalues that I somehow have under control, and then there's the regime of big eigenvalues that I don't really understand, and a schematic picture of the situation. Schematic picture situations: this scale parameter epsilon, and there's some more or less geometrically determined threshold from which from where on I'll be speaking of small eigenvalues. And there they're actually going together very nicely according to multiplicity and all that. And then there's a large regime where I don't really know what's going on. Okay, and I have one application of Have one application of this. It's combined other techniques that we have. And so for G2, the application would read that actually to define an orientation on the moduli space of G2 instant ones, that's actually the same thing as defining an orientation, moduli spaces, associates threefolds. That's something proven now in a different way that I've already proven a couple of years. Way that I've already proven a couple of years back, Dominic. More interesting, probably, is this following color, which answers a question put to us by Richard Thomas on how to construct orientations in Thomas and Thomas theory for Calabio fourfolds. And in this talk, you can see that the answer is that you need an orientation for the moduli space of Cayley submanifolds. Space Hayley submanifolds. And we have some other technology to explain what this is in more detail. That's beyond the scope of this talk. So thank you very much for your attention.
