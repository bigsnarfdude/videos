So during periods of rapid environmental change, like what's happening in those in the Australian wet tropics where those racing rainbow fish live, populations may need to adapt rapidly to avoid extinction. But the fuel for this adaptation in the form of either standing genetic variation or new mutations may often be insufficient. But hybridization between two parental lineages almost instantaneously boosts variation. Instantaneously boosts variation in hybrid osprey. And that may provide this fuel, and this has been demonstrated in sunflowers extensively, and wood ants, and in those rainbow fish, and in other species. But incompatibilities that arise between parental populations may prevent hybrids from utilizing this variation. So the question that we set out to answer is, when does hybridization speed adaptation? Speed adaptation to a novel environment. And so, to answer this, we ran simulations of parents and hybrids adapting to novel environments using Fisher's geometric model. So, this has already been described in Troy's talk, so I'll just go through this quickly. Under this model, mutations are vectors in a multi-dimensional trait space, and here we're just assuming just a single phenotypic optimum. And mutations are additive with respect to the utmost. Mutations are additive with respect to phenotype. So, an individual's phenotype can be seen as the sum of all the mutational vectors that are present in its genome. And here just on the right, there's two parental populations that have shifted their phenotype from the black dot towards a local fitness peak by fixing a series of three or four mutations, those black arrows. And for the simulations, we assumed a Gaussian fitness. We assumed a Gaussian fitness surface where the fitness is a function of the squared deviations of each individual's trait from some optimal value summed over all in traits. And what makes Fisher's geometric model particularly useful for hybridization studies is that the fitness effect of each mutation is entirely context dependent. And so incompatibilities naturally arise when Compatibilities naturally arise when co-adapted alleles break apart in a hybrid individual. So, here just on the left is two cartoon parental populations, one black and one blue, that have adapted towards some red optimum. But these dotted black mutations, which were beneficial in the parental context in the hypothetical hybrid on the right, are now deleterious because they're taken out of that context. And it's just important to stop and remember. And it's just important to stop and remember that there are many different models that map or relate hybrid genotype to hybrid fitness, Gavrilet's whole landscape, or the Jansky-Mueller incompatibilities, or BDMIs. But a particular strength of Fisher's geometric model is it allows us to relate within species adaptation to predictions about hybrid fish. Predictions about hybrid fits, which is particularly important in this context where we're trying to see if mixing the differences between isolated parental populations can speed hybrid adaptation. And Fisher's geometric model has already been used extensively to think about the properties of mutations in evolving isolated populations. And also using this model, predictions for analytical predictions for hybrid fitness have been obtained, but these have focused mainly But these have focused mainly on early hybrid generations like F1 or F2. And particularly, they've emphasized the consequences of the deleterious consequences of hybridization, particularly in reference to parental environments. But in these scenarios that I'm talking about, with rapid environmental change, these parental environments don't exist anymore, and so the excess variation generated by hybridization. Variation generated by hybridization may allow hybrids to do that pass. And so, to answer when we did when this might happen, we set up simulations with two phases. And so, in the first phase, we allowed hybrids to adapt to some optimum, just in a 2D representation, this yellow dot over there, and we allowed them to adapt isolated for 1500 generations until they were very well adapted. And then at generation 1500. Generation 1500, we shifted the optimum towards this red dot in these diagrams, and we created an isolated hybrid population, and then we tracked the fitness and other statistics as all of these populations adapted to this new shifted algorithm. Just some technical details about the simulations, which are running slim. We simulated a single megabase chromosome, and mutations randomly pointed in any direction. There was no Direction, there was no covariance of this model, and we had an exponentially distributed effect size. So, just jumping sort of straight to the main conclusion, in just about any scenario that you could think of under these simple assumptions, which sort of two major things I forgot to mention, just for these, the population size is kept constant. There's only five trait dimensions. Hybrids always adapted faster. Here we're just showing that there's, here we're just showing two adaptational scenarios. Showing two adaptational scenarios. We tested many others. Here on the x-axis is the generation, remembering that generation 1500 is when the optimum shifted again. And then on the y-axis is fitness, where we have a maximal fitness of 100 in this model. And hybrids out-adapted parental populations. But the only time when hybrids, under these simple assumptions, These simple assumptions adapted slower than parental populations is when the environmental shifts were very small. And that's because the excess variation in hybrids, when the shift is very small, actually pulls their average phenotype away from even this new optimum, and that causes their phenotype to lag behind parents adapting to their new shift. So, yeah, so these results are interesting. So, these results are interesting, and there's lots of other examples that adaptational scenarios that we went through. But not all incompatibilities can be described using Fisher's geometric model, as I mentioned before. There's lots of other ones. And another well-used framework for thinking about hybrid fitness are these chance new learning compatibilities or BDMIs. And under this BDMI framework, untested. EDMI framework, untested combinations of pairs of alleles from isolated populations result in a set finistific set. And we wanted to see to what extent these context-independent compatibilities interfered with the abilities, the ability of hybrid to capitalize on their excess variation. To do this, we've modified these simulations where we fixed 10 to 30 pairs of these BD myelci. Medium i loci, one of each pair in each of the hybrid genomes. We randomly distributed their location across these genomes. And then we assumed, just for here, a dominant version of these BDMIs, where any time there was a homozygous or a heterozygous version of this pair together in a hybrid genome, they suffered a fitness deficit that was incorporated multiplicatively. The fitness under Fissures Geometric Model. And so, what we found interestingly is that how much these intrinsic incompatibilities interfered with the abilities of hybrids to capitalize on their variation depended on the environmental scenario that we had. So, in all scenarios, there was a greater initial fitness drop, as you would expect, when you start loading in these intrinsic incompatibilities that are revealed. Compatibilities that are revealed even in the F1 generation. But what we found is that scenarios where this next shift in the optimum was parallel, what's that direction, parallel with the original axis of rental adaptation, we found that hybrids were still able to adapt quite a bit quicker. But when, in scenarios where the shift was perpendicular, like the one on the right, found that the slope of a hybrid adaptation started to drop. A hybrid adaptation started to drop as we added more of these intrinsic incompatibilities, and the parental population was increasingly able to overtake the hybrids in later generations. And so, what we think is going on here is that different adaptational scenarios promote more or less uni-parental inheritance. And so, this graph shows the majority proportion of the hybrid genome derived from a single parental. From a single parental population. And it shows the extent to which parentally derived mutations originated from one parent over the other. We think that in certain scenarios, like when there's a perpendicular optimum shift, that promotes more of a mix of parentally inherited alleles in order to significantly shift the optimum, the phenotype towards this new optimum. But when we're casting this in the light of intrinsic and This is in the light of intrinsic incompatibilities, we think that mixing of parental incompatibilities in general will interfere. So, yeah, the mixing of parental backgrounds generally interferes with the elimination of these intrinsic incompatibilities. And here, this is a graph of the strength of the fitnesses introduction from the intrinsic incompatibilities where lower is worse. And we see that the greater mixing of parental backgrounds caused by this perpendicular. Caused by this perpendicular optimum shift seems to result in a less efficient elimination of these intrinsic. So, yeah, again, that's interesting. But up until now, as I mentioned before, we've been assuming a constant population size. But we know that a reduced population size from this sudden environmental shift can slow adaptation due to increased influence of drift and a smaller number of mutations. And we wanted to know. Of mutations, and we wanted to know if this again would affect relative hybrid adaptational speed. And now, if hybrids can capitalize on their variation to avoid extinction. And so, to do this, we modified our simulations again, where we implemented explicit population demography using a stochastic birth-death approximation, where the expected change and the variance in change are the population size at generation T or Population size and generation T are given by these equations. And under the scenarios we've examined so far, sorry, and these contain both a logistic component and a fitness component where that W bar T is the average fitness of the population of generation T. And under the scenarios we've examined so far, we would expect that after the environment shifts, there would be a sudden population drop. Do populations Drop due population size drop due to maladaptation, followed by a release of competition that would increase the per capita growth rate to some extent. And then, as parents adapted to this new optimum, the per capita growth rate would increase further, promoting vestige. And so, what we found is that this is just one scenario shown here, but identical results were shown for other scenarios. Hybrids were more likely to persist compared to parents. Persist compared to parents only with a high extinction likelihood, which is represented by this r. It's a very small r for people at the back, which is the intrinsic growth rate. And this just shows the, this graph just shows the extinction probability after the new optimum shift for both hybrids and parents for different values of this intrinsic growth rate. And all populations were more likely to go extinct when R was smaller, but hybrids were only more likely to persist with a really Only more likely to persist with a really small R. And just to sort of show what we think is happening here, this is a graph of the population size per generation for surviving populations immediately after the second optimum shift. And for low values of R, shown with this dotted line, even after the release from competition, initially after the optimum shift, the growth, the per capita growth rate is negative, but for higher R value. Negative, but for higher R values, this release from competition results in an overall positive growth rate, but starting at an extremely low population size. And so in the low R and the negative birth rate case, hybrids were more likely to persist due to their greater access to genetic variation saving them. But in the higher R and the slightly positive birth rate case, the more severe bottom-like hybrid. More severe bottleneck from hybrids due to these incompatibilities caused hybrids to go and steam more often. But when they did survive, the hybrids still adapted faster and they were comparatively less affected by the effects of the bottleneck. So just a couple conclusions. Hybridization is often beneficial for adaptation to novel environments, these limited scenarios that we've set up here, but it depends on the adaptational scenario that we've constructed. That means. And the effect of intrinsic incompatibilities on adaptation was also dependent on the adaptational scenario, and it doesn't necessarily cause hybrids to lag behind populations. And in scenarios of high extinction risk, we showed that hybridization can be a mechanism of evolutionary rescue. And obviously, here there are certain factors around hybrids, such as mate choice or spatial organization and relation of hybrid populations and parental populations. Of hybrid populations and parental populations, but that is material for future work. So, thank you so much. I'm thinking about the difference you see when you have different kinds of incompatibilities and with the intrinsic incompatibilities that you would see that mixing differential backgrounds could make it harder to eliminate those compatibilities. In the work that was done looking at sunflower hybridization, recapitulating the biome, they often saw the same repeated blocks of the two particle gene bones and less mixing than you might expect, sort of these big blocks that looked like wild hybrids. Do you thought, I mean, I'm wondering if we can take your results and sort of interpret that, at least in those organisms, those genomes, there were a lot of hybrid hybrids. In those organisms, in those genomes, there were a lot of intrinsic compatibilities that were being gotten around by having large carontal blocks in the genome. When you think of the whole genome as having blocks of something versus you're saying that in these studies there was a repeatability with respect to which. Blocks were sort of larger than you would expect given how much combinations of blocks happening. So it seemed like maybe things there were incompatibilities, which would be a little bit more likely to be a little bit more. Yeah, I mean, I guess the other thing what I Yeah, I mean I guess the other thing when I think about sunflowers is that this is the first thing I think of, I don't even know if this is an answer to that, when I think of sunflowers as a combination of the genome in sunflowers. So I don't know if that would have something to do with it. Yeah, I was trying to hypothesize from the fact that the wild hybrids, which presumably hybridized a really long time ago, and the ones that they made in the lab. And the ones that they made in the lab are served the same blocks. You're right, it could be a recombination thing rather than a selection thing. That could also be a function of this universal mutation vectors pointing any way they want to, but I would imagine the modularity in certain sections of the genome would be a thing. So I perhaps that would have something to do with that. Does dimension of phenotypic space matter? Yes. Yep, that is a. I don't know if I have a. I made a slide, but I don't know if that's ready. Yes, yes, it does. So it's interesting how that does, because when you increase dimensionality, you get. You expect that all populations would adapt slower, because things, more ways for things point wrong. But in these scenarios, we're allowing the parents to accumulate. The parents to accumulate mutations sort of towards some optimum themselves. And what that, when you increase and you increase the number of mutations you need to fix to get to that initial optimum, then what that does is it increases the genetic diversity levels. And so then that causes, everything slows down after that second optimum shift, but higher slowdown loss. So actually more higher trait dimension, whatever trait means, trait dimension means that you have to, it actually improves hyperdioches. It actually improves some favorite adaptations for you, but we will be back from the conference break. We have an hour at 3:45. I'm just saying about the variants on scratch, but uh also
