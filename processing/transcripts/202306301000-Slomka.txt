From the opening of the Israel, and he will talk about boundary sums and vertex-generated polytopes. Please go ahead. Hi, everyone. So, first, thank you for the invitation and the opportunity to speak. So, I will speak about a joint work, very recent. It's now in Alcar the past few days. Probably there will be. Few days probably there will be some more versions in the future. So, this is a joint work with Chiri Alston of Idan and Tomo Fallach, who is a master's student of the both of us. And I should say upfront that I must confess that I took the slides, the presentation from Shiri, so most of it's hers. So, I must give the credit. I must give the credit, but as you know, it certainly does not mean that the talk will be also as good as Shiri's talk. So don't yeah. So let me start with some motivation. So do you see the pointer of the mouse? Just to so I know you see it? Yes. Yes? Okay. Anyway, so let me start with some brief motivation. So Brief motivation. So, the first, the main motivation for me at least is something that is a motivation for many, many papers, of many authors, and this is called Vitaly Milman. So, this was about a year ago, I think also in a Bills conference that we were watching this, one of the talks about Bruninkovsky type inequalities in the discrete case about Lattice point enumerators, and we were discussing. And we were discussing, and Vitali was commenting about the fact that the boundary contribution is somewhat significant. So you need, there is some error return that you need to, that comes in the discrete case. So Brunikovsky does not hold in the naive way. So points near the boundary somehow give some error term. And he was wondering about the option, the possibility that there is something complex. The possibility that there is something complementing in the usual case. So essentially, he was asking about the significance of the boundary parts of the convex body, for example, if you look at Wuninkowski. So this was a main motivation. This is what started off the research. And another motivation, mostly for the second main part of the talk about polygons, comes from computational geometry. Computational geometry and specifically from a paper called Exact Minkowski Sums of Polygons with Holes. And so I heard about it from Shiri, who heard about it from Dan Halper and from Tel Aviv. And so the paper has this point of view of robotics and computational geometry, which I know almost nothing about. But the thing is that what they had there essentially is an efficient algorithm to Essentially, it is an efficient algorithm to compute Mitskowski sums of polygons, but that have holes, okay, not any polygons. So they have many, many nice pictures. So for example, think about this polytope here, this square here in the blue, and then the polytope with a hole inside it. And if you take the Minkowski sun, you get this green part. And they have some nice observation in the paper saying that at some point. Saying that at some cases you can actually get rid of the whole or forget about the whole, don't give it any importance, and then the algorithm becomes efficient. And this was in the back of our minds when we thought about this project. So, another nice picture here, also another observation. You can take these polygons that don't have holes, for example, the blue and the orange. And if you sum it up, I don't know. Orange, and if you sum it up, I don't know if you can see. If you sum it up, you get some polygon which has many, many small holes inside it. Okay, so this was the second motivation. And now let me start with what we did with respect to the Buninkowski inequality. So let me first state it. So the classical one, let me write it with the standard average of k plus t over two. And instead of the usual arithmetic sum, I give the average. I give the average, I give the geometric one. This is not an accident. So, this is also one form of the inequality. And the question was, what happens if we take just the boundaries of the sets, of the boundary of K and the boundary of T, and we take the average, what happens then to the volume of the average? Can you get something? And what we showed is that you actually get the same thing using the geometric average. So, you get the volume of the average of the The volume of the average of the boundary sums is greater or equal to the geometric average of the volume of K and T. And once you see it, so we think about convex sets. Okay, in my mind, at least always everything is convex, but sometimes you do something with convex and then it turns out that it's also correct as is for more general settings. So, here also, it's enough to have compact sets with connected boundary. Okay, so this means also that the dimension starts here from two. In dimension one, if you just sum In dimension one, if you just sum up things, you get the sum of the boundaries will just be three or four points. This is not interesting, so this is from dimension two. And at least for the convex case, K and T L convex, we also have the equality, which is very similar to the original one. So in dimension three and above, they have to be a transit of one another and dimension two, any two homothets. Okay, so this is the first result. And let me put it here again. And just a couple of reminds. Again, and just a couple of remarks. So, the proof is easy. This inequality is pretty easy. I will try to explain it more or less how to do it in the next slide. And another remark is that you cannot really expect to do anything with which is not one half. If you think about lambda going to zero, you can very easily understand that, or to one, doesn't matter. You can easily understand that then it will break the inequality. But we do have. Break the inequality, okay. But we do have some version still for lambda, which is not half. Um, I will get to this very quickly. So, also, please stop me if you have any questions. I will try to do my best to answer. Okay. Okay, so this is the inequality. And again, let me put it here. So, I want to compare it. It seems very natural. Some of you may know results about restricted Minkowski sums of bodies. So, essentially, it means that instead of taking the Minkowski sum of any... Instead of taking the Minkowski sum of any two points in the sets, you take a restricted set of x, y, and k times t, and then you take the Minkowski sum only within this set. And a very beautiful result of Charlie and Vukulesko from 96 tells you that if under some restrictions on this theta, this subset of k times t, which depends on the dimension here and this parameter. Here and this parameter which relates to the volume ratio. If the volume is big enough, okay, if you didn't throw too many points, then you do get a Bruninkovsky inequality, but with a price of, right, instead of one over N, you get a bit worse power, so you get two over N, but you do get some Bomnikovsky inequality. Okay, and in our case, I will get to it not in the next slide, but in a few. In our case, But in a few, in our case, well, it's not really restricted in the sense of this theorem because we are talking about boundaries which are of measure zero, but we do get something in this spirit. So this I will show in a couple of slides, okay? If you add some restrictions. Okay, so let me try to explain a bit about the proof and what's going on. A bit about the proof and what's going on here when you sum two boundaries. So let's start with an example. So take a ball, take a square, K and T, and then we take the boundaries of the bodies, right? And we start adding maps. So we take the square and start putting copies of the circle in the boundary and more and more and more. And essentially, in the end, you get this kind of body, which is not convex anymore. Okay. So you get that. So, you get k plus t. This is the blue thing, but with a hole inside it. And you can also write an equation for this. We explain it right away. So essentially, you get that the boundary sum is, first of all, it's the sum of everything, k plus t, but then you need to subtract this union. Actually, it's not really a union. One of these sets is empty. I will explain it in a minute. So you actually get a difference, right? This is a is the right this is a uh is the difference uh of k and t and oh t my t and k and let's understand what what these are what is this union here that i need to subtract here to to get rid of okay so let's put the picture here again okay so these points here what are these points is exactly and so on let me go one back so this is these are the points here in the in the white here the hole that if you put a circle center that you Put a circle centered at one of these points, right? It will be completely inside the square, okay, in the interior, essentially. So, this means that you couldn't reach it by a point in the boundary, right, from this picture here. So, in an equation, it means exactly this. So, we take here t minus k, okay? O minus, but let me just say minus, not the usual Minkowski difference. So, the Minkowski subtraction here is just all the points such that if I take x minus. The point such that if I take x minus k, so here in our case, k is a simply symmetric, but in the general case, so you just believe me that there is a minus, it should be a minus. So x minus k completely, you can shift. If you shift it by x, you get entirely in the interior of t. Okay. And you can also write it as this intersection of all points in k such that x plus the interior just take the intersection of everything. Okay. And similarly, k minus t is all are all the points. Generally, k minus t is all are all the points such that if you transit minus t, you get inside k. So now you can see evidently that you cannot have both of them not empty, right? One of them has to be empty because if you can shift one inside the other, you can do the opposite. So only one of them in this case, t minus k is not empty, right? So then what you get immediately a corollary is that if the widths of k and t are not comparable, meaning in every in every direction you can find In every direction, you can find one of them has a width which comes out, then which is in many, many cases, then you get automatically that these two are empty, and then the sum of the boundaries is just the sum of the sets. And this was also observed by, so this we discovered in the past few days actually, we did not know about it, but this was also noticed by Olivelli. Also, noticed by Olive Alley. So, yeah, should give the credit here. Okay. So, let me also again. So, let's talk one more thing about this T minus K. We can also think about it again as the largest convex. There's a question. Yes? Yeah, so in your corollary, the minus is the usual Minkowski sum, right? Yes, yes, yes. So this minus the usual Minkowski sum. So just looking at the width. So just looking at right at the width of the thinking about the width of the body. Okay. Got it. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So another way to say, so you see it's convex. It's obviously it's convex. So this is also another way to say it. It's the largest convex set L, let's call it L, such that L minus K, the usual Minkowski sum of L and minus K, is completely inside the T of the interior of the event. Okay? And now we have. Okay, and now we are ready for the proof essentially. So, what we do is the following: right, so assume without loss of generality that say the volume of t is bigger than the volume of k. And then we take the difference. So, the difference is just the volume of the sum, the usual Minkowski sum, minus the volume of this difference. But this difference, we just said that this difference is, okay, yeah, this difference L. We can write this Bruminkovsky just for K plus T here, right? And we still have this L here, but now we know that L again is the largest set such that L minus K is included in T. So we can again bound the volume of L from above, which is what we need to get rid of this L here, by invoking Bolmkovsky again. Invoking Bornkovsky again, right? And then we can essentially what we get is something about just numbers. Okay, we just play with a bit with some simple inequalities about numbers and you get the inequality. So here, again, we use the usual arithmetic type Bominkowski and we actually use this deficit between the arithmetic inequality and the geometric, right? There is a difference between the usual arithmetic average and the geometric to get what we. And the geometric to get what we need right here. Okay, so this is essentially how you prove it. Okay, and now, as I said, the restricted Boominkovsky, if we think about this Shark and Vukorescu, then we also show that if you give some bounds for the volume ratio of K and T, okay, so this is the statement that we have, if it's between C over square root n and square root n, then you can also get Then you can also get the same thing for the Minkowski sum of the boundaries. So, here it follows exactly from the result. Okay, we just invoke the result, but we need to show that there exists some theta, some restricted sum that is actually included in the sum of the boundaries, which is pretty big. And this is done via this assumption, plus what I just showed you with the previous slide: that L minus K is included in T. So, if you use these two things and both So, if you use these two things and Bolminkovsky, again, the same technique, you can get some restricted set theta, which is of enough volume in the sense of Shark and Vokulesko, and then you get this inequality. Okay. So, this is the Bruninkowski type. And what I wanted to say from before is what happens when you take a different lambda. So, it's not true in general. But if you look at something a bit different, so you take the volume of one minus lambda. The volume of one minus lambda, the boundary of k plus lambda, the lambda the boundary of t, and then you take the uh symmetric, right? You take the opposite thing with lambda and one minus lambda, and you multiply them, then you can get a Bruninkowski type inequality. So this is, right, there is no square root because we took, you think about each one of them coming with a square root and then it goes away. But then you need some correction factor, and the correction factor is just depending on lambda. So it's one minus one minus two lambda to the n. 1 minus 2 lambda to the n. And also, we know the equality case in the convex set, in the convex case, it's exactly the same about translates in high dimensions and in dimension 2, it's homo sets. Okay, but now that the proof is essentially the same, so the same concept, the same idea, only the inequalities about numbers are a bit more difficult, so we need to analyze some rational function, some polynomial, and understand. function, some polynomial, and understand exactly the minimum of this polynomial. But you get the same thing. So this is about Bruninkovsky. And now let's talk about some of boundaries. So let me put it here back the slide from before. And here you see that if you think about now instead of K and T, two general bodies, if you take K and K again, then obviously you cannot shift K inside it. not shift k inside its own interior, right? So these two guys are all both empty, which means that this sum is the same, right? So let me write it here. So again, think about convex, although it's true for any compact and connected boundary set K. But immediately we get that the boundary of K plus the boundary of K Minkowski sum is 2K, right? So this is also, I need to say also, we found out very recently that it was also observed by Fodelizing Langian and Zvavich. By Fodelizing Lange and Bavich, and they used it also to show something else. And once you look at this equation, it's very natural to think about, wait, if I take a polytope as K, right, I replace K by P, then what happens if I now move to lower dimensional boundaries, right? A polytope has a nice structure. What happens if I try to sum up, Minkowski sum, different lower dimensional parts? Lower dimensional parts of the polytope. So, this is the next part of the talk. So, let me just denote first by dkp, the union of all the k-dimensional phases, okay, for any k between 0 and n. So, n meaning just p itself, and 0 means the vertices of the polyton. And now, what we showed is that if actually, if you take That if actually, if you take the n over two boundary part, okay, all n over two dimensional faces. So if it's not even, then you take, right, you need the flow and the ceiling so that the sun is n exactly. If you take the convex, I'm sorry, the Minkowski sum of these two boundary parts, you again get 2p. Okay, so this is a result. So this is a result that seems to me, I mean, to us, that very natural and maybe should be known. We couldn't find it anywhere if anyone. It anywhere, uh, if anyone knows that that would be nice, uh, but we did prove it, and I will also explain a bit how to prove it. Uh, but I should also say a few remarks, which are actually propositions from the paper. So, first of all, the flow of n over 2 is the smallest integer for the simplex, right? You can for the simplex, you have to take n over 2. So, this you can see. So, let me take another two-dimensional picture. Take another two-dimensional picture. If you take two triangles and you sum them up, you will very easily see that you'll get the entire triangle, twice the triangle. But if you take zero and zero, which means you take all the vertices and you put copies of P, then you do not get to P, but you get a hole which is the shape of a triangle again here. Right? So you have to take n over two. And the second remark is actually that we have monotonicity. Actually, that we have monotonicity. So, I wrote it here not in the strongest way. Here, what I write is that if you know that for some k you have this equality, that you can sum the boundaries of k and n minus k and get to p, then for any in between, any pairing between k and n minus k, you get the same thing, okay, up to n over 2, from k to n over 2. Actually, here, the monotonicity is stronger, meaning that if any point x is in this sum, then it's also in the summary. Sum that then it's also in the sum with m between k and n minus k. Okay, so not just you don't need to require that it's equal to 2p, but just monotonicity with respect to inclusion. Okay, right. So now this brings us to defining the critical dimension, right? So for any polytope, let me denote by kp the minimal k, the minimal dimension of the faces such. dimension of the faces such that you can have this you can sum up the the parts and get this convex set again to p okay so for example okay yeah sorry something is the picture sorry something is in the way of uh okay yeah no it's better sorry so yeah so for example if you take the cross polytope uh which i drew here then um Drew here, then you can check that. Okay, one needs to prove it, but you can check that the critical dimension is n minus one over to flow. Okay, so this it has to be right at at least this because you have this triangle, this simplex right here, which requires the dimension of n minus two, n minus one over two. Okay, okay, so this is the okay, so again, let me write. So again, let me write the theorem. Now I write it as just the average instead of the sum equals to p. And let me explain about the proof a bit. So what do we do? So first of all, clearly one inclusion is obvious, right? So the average is included in P, but now we need the opposite direction. So take any x in P, and we want to show that it's included as an average of these guys. So what we do is we take a polytope. So we take X, we take P. So we take x, we take p minus x and x minus p, both having a point zero included in them, so it's not empty. And if you look at the picture here, so we took p, we took a point x in the in the in the set, then we look at x minus p, right, or minus p. So this is the set q essentially up to translation, right? So this is centered at x, so we need to shift by x to get it centered. X to get it centered at zero. So it's a centrally symmetric set Q. Okay. And what one can show is that any face of Q is actually an intersection of a face F minus X of P minus X, right, of this part, and the phase GX, which is X minus G of X minus P. Okay, so we, well, again, f and g are faces of the original polytop p. So this is true. So, this is true. And once you see this, then take any point in the intersection of f minus x and x minus g, and what you get is that x plus y is right, it's one on the one hand, it's in the phase f, and on the other hand, x minus y is in the face g. So if you look, you look at the sum, the average, then you get that x is the average of f and g from f and g, right? So, what does it mean? It means that we reduce the problem to finding some phase s. some phase S of the form f minus X and X minus G intersection, such that the dimensions is what we need. So the dimension of F is less than flow of N over 2, and the dimension G is less than the ceiling of N over 2. Okay, so now the idea, just how to do it, I will not give all the details here, so you can, of course, you can encourage you to look at the paper and see how it goes. But if you look at, you start with a zero-dimensional face F. With a zero-dimensional face S, then we know that the sum right from the dimension theorem linear algebra, we know that the sum of the dimensions of the faces is less than n, at most n. So we have two options. Either it happens both of them are smaller than the ceiling on n over two and we are done, or one of them is bigger and one is smaller, right? Now, if one is bigger and one is smaller, since q is symmetric, we can. Since Q is symmetric, we can also look at the face corresponding to the face which is minus S. And then the roles of F and G interchange, and we get that the dimension of this new guy, new F corresponding to the minus S is, so if it was smaller and bigger, now it will be bigger and smaller, right? So then what we can do is we can actually take a hike, right? Take a start from the point from the face, the vertex we started, and we want to go in a path. To go in a path via vertices until we get to everything is connected, right? So we get, we walk on vertices until we get from the point S to the point minus S. And every time we go, every index we go, we look at these two dimensions. And at some point, something has to flip because it starts from smaller, bigger, and then bigger, smaller. And what you can show is that the point of interest where it interchanges exactly, you can show that there. You can show that there things go right and you can find your faces. So, I did not give all the details, of course, but just the sketch, right? Okay, so this is the idea how to show it. Okay. Okay, so let me move on. So, again, reminding you the definition of the critical dimension. And now, the focus of the remaining of the talk is what happens to Is uh what happens to uh is okay so so it's polytopes that the critical dimension of them is actually zero, okay? So, this is the main thing, and we call them vertex generated polytopes, okay. And again, it means that every again, every polytope with itself gives you 2p, but now vertex-generated means that if you sum up the polytope with only the vertices, the zero-dimensional faces, then again you get the same thing, 2p. Get the same thing to p right. So again, not everything is vertex generated for sure. For example, the simplex, there are more examples, right? And here are more examples that more pictures in the three-dimensional case. So here you can see it's very similar to the simplex. Here, a cube gives you a vertex-generated friend. And here also, you don't get vertex-generated mainly because. Generated mainly because, right, you can see the simplex. You have faces that are simplex, and then only at least on those faces you get a hold, regardless of the fact that inside you get also holds. Okay. Okay, so vertex generated. We denote the class by Vg, Vg of Rn, vertex generated polytopes. And why do we call them vertex generated? So this is a name that we also that we came up with. I don't know if it's a good name. I hope so. I don't know if it's a good name. I hope so. But let me, and if you have a better name, you can certainly suggest. So, the idea is: why did we call them? Because you can iterate the equation, right? We have p equals half of v plus p. We can iterate again, p is equal to v plus p over 2. So, we can write it like so, and then keep going. So, it means that we wrote p is a sum of many, many right, of some points, and one over eight p and so on and so on. And 1 over 8p, and so on, and so on. So essentially, this means that this iteration gives you the following proposition, right? Gives you that p is the intersection of the who from 1 to infinity of the sum of these discrete points, the Minkowski sum of these points, and a small, a very small copy of B. And when J goes to infinity, this vanishes, right? This contribution vanishes, which means essentially that P is the closure of just. That p is the closure of just the sum of these skilled sets, of the sign of summing the vertices each time with a smaller and smaller power. Okay. And of course, if you look at the simplex again, for example, if something which is not vertex generated, so you cannot really iterate and get equality, each time you iterate, you get more holes and more holes and more holes. So actually, if you look at this process, you will get it's nice just to observe. Process, you will get, it's nice just to observe that you get the Serpinsky triangle. Okay, and for other stuff, other polytopes, you can, you should get something more fractal-like arrangements, but this is something that we are still, we haven't explored too much. Okay, so this is why we called it vertex generator. And now, right, if you look at this class, the many, many questions arise. that many many questions arise uh and unfortunately we we we only up to now at least we only answer a few so let me let me tell you briefly what what we do know about this class so first of all uh it's it's pretty rich in the sense that all the zoonotopes are vertex generated okay and more generally and more generally if you take any vertex generated polytope if you add a segment a minkowski sound with a segment then again you stay you remain vertex generated Stay, you remain vertex generated. So, this immediately shows you that zone tops are vertex generated. You start with one segment which is clearly vertex generated, right? And then you can just add more and more segments and get that all zone tops. But this is not, I will explain a different, easier way to show that the zone tops are vertex generated. But this is also something that worth mentioning. Another nice observation is that it's actually dense in the plane. Okay, this is done if you think about a polytope. Done, if you think about a polytope, you can construct small arcs above each of the edges. I mean, above, I mean, outside of the polytop itself, very, very small arcs, and then choose points on the arcs and take the convex hug. So you get something which is pretty close to the original one and is a vertex generated, but this fails in higher dimensions. We don't have an idea if it's dense or not so far. Another result is in the Another result is in the sense of generalized, like you have generalized zonoids. So, here, if you think about what about polytopes, that if you add the zonotope, then you get, you become vertex generated. So, the result is that actually for any polytope, you can sum a zonotope and make it vertex generated. Okay. And let me write it again here. But now you can maybe hope that, okay, but if I sum Maybe hope that okay, but if I sum a very, very small zoonotope, then it would be close to p, and then you get denseness, right? So, uh, um, this is not the case. So, and I should have said that I didn't say that the poof is by induction, um, but this this zonotope cannot be too small, okay? And to understand it, at least it follows from the following theorem. Actually, this is uh it's written as a theoretic as a theorem, but it's very, very easy just to. It's very, very easy just writing up the definitions, more or less. So, here you can see, okay, let me read it. It's very hard to read, maybe. But if you look at P and Q, right, take a point of P which is not vertex generated. What does it mean? It means that it has a, if you look at P plus V P over 2, it has, it's not everything, it has a whole, right? So look at it as a whole, it's a convex set. I'm sorry, it's not a convex set necessarily, it's a whole. But then if you take a small enough polyto q, the It a cube that you can shift it inside this hole, then this difference right will not be empty, and this difference will not be empty. The result tells you that this difference is actually included in this guy, this difference. What does it mean? It means that this has to have a hole. If it's everything, that the right-hand side would be empty. So, for any p which is not relative generated, there is a hole. You can shift some small polytop inside. And this means that also if p plus means that also if p plus q cannot be vertex generated so you don't have any hope to add something small so you have to add something big enough and a zoomotope does the does the job okay another nice observation of our student is actually thinking about different metrics instead of harsh dove so what he did is the following so again take p and q convex hulls of the vertices and you define this values metric The Fallach metric to be the Hausdorff distance between the vertices themselves, between the set of vertices. So, clearly, this is another way to write it. So, take the smallest ball such that the set of vertices of one is included in the sum with the ball of the other. And you can easily see that, right? So, for example, if I take a triangle and I break this one of the edges just a little bit and I add another vertex here, so the Here, so the usual Hausdorff metric does not see this, right? It's still very small, the difference. But our metric right here, it senses it, right? It makes a difference. But if you add, so it's not just a combinatorial metric, right? It's not just the vertices themselves, but also, right, you can add vertices around the vertices, the existing vertices, and still get something close. But a nice, so of course, it's easy to check that this metric is weaker. To check that this metric is weaker in this sense. Okay, so the difference is bigger than the and the distance is bigger. And what they show that the class is actually closing this metric, which is a nice thing. Now, also again, this metric seems natural. I don't know if anyone knows about it. I didn't see any use of this metric anywhere, but if anyone knows about it or any uses of it in the literature, I would be interested. Okay. Okay, so this is another result. How much time do I have? Like seven minutes or so? Am I right? Yes, about five or six, I think. Five or six. Okay, okay. Okay, let's see what I can make. Okay, so let's just focus right now on symmetric polytopes and see the following observations. See the following observation. So, if you take a symmetric polytope, clearly it has as a necessary condition, you have to have facets that are also vertex generated if you want P to be vertex generated. But in this case, we can also show the opposite. So, meaning that polytopes, symmetric polytopes, are vertex generated if and only if all of the facets are. And this also gives you immediately that all zoonotopes are vertex. Are vertex generated, right? Because with zoonotops, we know that there are a zoonotop if and only if all the even two-dimensional faces are symmetric. So you get it for free. And the proof is very easy. So here is P, right? Centrally symmetric. And take any point X, and I'll take the ray emanating from zero to in direction X, and it touches the boundary at some point here. I don't know why, okay? Some point here, I don't know why. Okay, so it's some facet of the polytope, and now this facet is vertex generated, which means that you can find some vertex of P and also of F such that this point is inside this copy, right? So this is the copy here of P over 2, right? But clearly, zero also is inside this copy just because it's centrally symmetric. If this is V, this is the vertex that gives you. This is the vertex that gives you the point. Then v minus v over 2 clearly gives you 0, so 0 is inside. But once 0 is inside, then x is on the line between 0 and the point, and you get for free also that x is in p plus v p over 2, right? You can just write it down and you get immediately that this is in, oh, okay, I mean, it's in this copy, of course, clearly, of just its convex, right? So it's immediate. Right. So now. It's immediate. Right, so now we get for free that zone tops belong to the vertex generated class. Okay, another remark is that we can actually so we can actually show that any vertex generated point of you can you can you can put it as a facet of another big one which is centrally symmetric. Okay, right. So the third thing, and I have The third thing, and I have something like two minutes just to explain, is that is connected to these guys, is about covering numbers. So, a very simple observation about the vertex-generated polytopes is, right, it gives you for free also, very naturally, covering estimates, right? So, if you have vertex-generated, it means that the vertices, the carbonality of the vertices, gives you a covering number of p by p over 2, right? So, you have covering number of p by p over 2 is. Number of p by p over 2 is less than the number of vertices and immediately from volume bound right the calvary number is bounded from below by 2 to the n so this means that any polytope which is vertex generated has to have at least 2 to the n vertices and we can also tell you that that exactly 2 to the n means that it's the cube essentially a linear image of the cube and this is done by essentially you need to find some Essentially, you need to find some big 2 to the n antipodal set in your polytop, and then you use a result of Dancer and Gundbaum to show that to conclude that it's a Q. Okay, so this is another result. And now, again, the way we iterated before, we can take not just the covering number of P by P over 2, but we can write down P as a sum, right, of vertices, many, many sums of vertices, and P over 2 to the M. And if you iterate the same thing, you get this. And if you iterate the same thing, you get this inequality: that the covering number of p by p over 2 to the n is less than the number of velocities to the power of m. And again, from volume bounds, you have the other direction, you have its bound from below by 2 to the mn. So, for example, if p is close to the, it doesn't have too many vertices, for example, it's close to 2 to the end, then the covering estimates are very good. And I have to say, of course, that this result is very similar. It's reminiscent, it's a simple. A reminiscent, it's a simple case in some sense of the celebrated Morelema, right? Which is in a much more general case of Banach spaces with type P. And he has essentially a result of this spirit covering P by some constant times P, by things that also are. So he uses also averages of vertices to get his covering estimates, which are also dependent. Which are also depending on the type. So it's another example, maybe a more simple example of Moville. And now you can also take, so if vertex generated, if you thought about taking the usual average, one half p and one half the vertice, the vertices, you can think also about taking a different lambda. Maybe if I make any a, which is maybe bigger. Take any A, which is maybe bigger, a bit, then I can get more polytopes to have this equation, right? This equality, being the sum of the vertices and the set with coefficients a and 1 minus a. So for example, again, the simplex, right, with one half, it didn't work. And if you try to make it bigger, at some point, if a is big enough, then you will get that you cover. And actually, the theorem tells you that for any p, this infamous. any p this infimum this uh this constant this lambda is anywhere between half and n over n plus one well n over n plus one is exactly what is needed for the simplex and only the simplex any any other body you can you can use another better and now you get again the same iteration the same idea you get covering estimates uh for p and n for any polytope not just vertex generated right so you get n over n plus one to the power of n p you get it uh bounded by the vertices Bounded by the vertices to the power of n. So again, this is more well enough for any polytop type type result. Okay, so I think I should be done. So I don't have time, so I maybe just leave it right here. So there are many, many questions, many things that we don't know, and let me leave it maybe for later. So I'll just put it here. So thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Are there any questions? Are there online participants? Are there any questions? Just speak up. Okay, then we thank you for the public. Then we thank Boas again for his nice talk. Thank you.
