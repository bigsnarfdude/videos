This is part two of Sugal's talk on benchmarks for analytic footlooks relations. Thank you very much. And I'm going to start by reminding people of this Zoom map that Matt has. And so I talked about one more object over here, which is the torsion of beating groups, which is a umbrella. And also, there are some other objects such as E0 omega that I talked about. And the rest of the talk, I want to focus on the Barrel side over here and see what I can do. And also talk about, if I have time, I'll talk about things that are outside this. About things that are outside of this carnival realm. And so I think you can clean up everything and move on. Let's see. Here we go. The first object also was mentioned by Matt that this is defined by Friedman Stanley, a general jump operator for Borel equivalence relations. For Borel equivalence relations. So, if you have a Borel equivalence relation, the jump of this E is essentially what we call convalescence of orbits of E. So officially, it's defined on X to the N as the infinite sequence of the original equivalence relation space that is on. And so, two sequences, X to the N and And so, two sequences Xn and Yn are E plus equivalent if and only if their corresponding E classes as a set coincide with each other. So another way to say this is actually to say that for every Xn, there is a Yn that is E equivalent to it, and for every Yn, there's Xn that is E equivalent to it. Obviously, this equivalent. Obviously, it's the equivalence relation, and but what Friedman Stanley proved in their original, the same paper that I mentioned before, is that for Borel equivalence relations that has more than one class, this is always a jump. This complexity is always higher than the original equivalence relation. So, here I use this reduction that is less than. Reduction that is less than or equal to, but not equal to, right? So and this will give us a whole bunch of equivalence relations starting from equality. Namely, if we actually start with equality, then we can actually talk about equality plus and equality plus again, plus plus, that's two plus. That's two plus, and then three pluses, four pluses, etc. And then you can actually collect all of the equivalence n pluses together and then jump again. And that'll in some way define omega plus and omega plus one plus, etc. And so this way you can actually define alpha plus. Define alpha plus for any kind of ordinal alpha. And then this is coming from essentially also Scott. Once again, it predates the equivalence relation theory. It happens in model theory that if you have any Borel S infinity orbital equivalence relation, then it's an S infinity orbital coordination, first of all, but it's also Borel. If it's Borel, Also, barrel. If it's barrel, then it's below one of these alpha pluses. Okay, so of equality. And so in other words, what we have shown here is kind of a cofinal sequence of lengths omega 1, of course. It's an unconventional sequence of equivalence relations that captures all of the Borel equivalence relations that are generated. That are generated by S infinity actions. Okay. So this is a very nice, obviously very nice picture that we are able to, it's not a wild picture, is actually saying that we sort of understand how everybody comes up, that it is always reducible to one of these. However, in reality, in practice, of course, we actually use any of this. We actually use any of this. We say that obviously equality is the important one we use, and we have the examples we just showed before that there are examples where equality plus is used. What about double plus and what about three pluses, etc.? You know, even the finite ones. The honest thing is that we don't really have a whole lot of natural examples that correspond to the complexity of these equivalence relations. But on the theory side, there has been a whole lot of results developed about these. For example, I think I'm going to keep this picture and yeah, I want to mention one result that is due to course categories and woe that says that you can actually understand. Understand, like you know, if you have equivalence relation, you want to know whether it's actually borrow reducible to one of these alpha plus of equality. How, you know, there's another characterization of these. So what they say is this, focus on this part. E is for all reducible is for all reducible to To the alpha plus equivalence relation of equality. If and only if there is a Polish topology, you can change the topology on the underlying space tau. There's a Polish topology such that with respect to this new topology, this equivalence relation is a certain Borel set of certain complexity, pi zero beta. Pi zero beta. Okay. And what's the relationship between alpha and beta? It's actually a very simple relationship. It's just, you know, sometimes it's alpha, sometimes it's alpha plus one, sometimes it's alpha plus two. So in the finite case, if alpha is zero, beta is one. If alpha is one, beta is three, et cetera. And then for infinite ordinal, it follows a slightly different pattern. Okay. Different pattern, okay, but it's a very simple direct relationship. So, this is one way to actually. I don't know that there are, I don't know any examples where this theorem has been successfully applied in a real situation to argue that certain things are borrow reducible to alpha plus. But this potentially, this is a tool, right? Potentially, we. Two. Potentially, we could say that, yeah, possibly we could use this one day to say that here's an equivalence relation. Maybe we can actually do this reduction, bro reduction by actually smartly or carefully define a Polish topology on the NI space. I mean, it's just conceivable that this could happen. I want to mention one result over here, which seems to be. Which seems to be also putting a little bit of hope that these things might come up. This is a result of Dane and I and also based on some work of Selesky that also goes back to almost 30 years ago. Suppose you have a non-archimedian, so not very realistic hypothesis, but to prove our. Hypothesis to prove our theorems we need them. So it's a close subgroup of S infinity, it's abelian, and it does not involve either these groups, Zn or Zp infinite sum of Zp to the nth power. Involve here means that G involves H if If, as a definition, if H is a closed subgroup subgroup of a K, which is a quotient group of G. So this is a, there's a continuous surjective homomorphism from G to K, and then H is a subgroup of K. So that is involvement. That is involvement. So, involvement is actually one way to say that these groups somehow appear in G. Okay, if G does not involve any of this, then any orbital concentration of G is for all reducible to this thing, this E0 to the N3 pluses. And I think there are some recent results by Asafshani that show or that shows that this. That shows that this is a sharp upper bound. So, in other words, there are things that are of this or somewhat close to this kind of complexity. So, 3 pluses did come up in some context, but it's still not an application situation. It's still a theoretical situation. Okay. But I think in general, even two pluses, I have. Even two pluses, I haven't seen any of the real applications where the two pluses show up as a complete invert. So next, I want to talk a little bit about the subshifts and the subflows as another kind of dynamical systems that we have considered before. By subshifts, I mean the following thing. By subject, so I mean the following thing is first of Bernoulli shift is a on the finite alphabet, sigma is a canner system sigma to the z as the canner set, and then t is the shift map. Okay, and then a subshift is this canner system where the underlying space is a closed invariant subset rather than the whole sigma to the z. And then by subflow, And then by sub-flow, I don't know if even this is a standard terminology, but in our work, we actually use this terminology that if you have a countably infinite group gamma, then the Bernoulli flow on a finite alphabet sigma for this gamma is this pair. Sigma to the gamma is the Polish space with the product topology, and then gamma acts on this also as a shape. acts on this also as a shift map. And then subflow is a pair where this underlying set is a closed invariant subset. And I think that subsystem subflows have been looked at a lot as symbolic dynamical systems or topological dynamical systems. And it's well known that It's well known that continuous maps between such things, homeomorphisms being one example, is determined by sometimes called block codes, sometimes called finite codes of whatever. So it's really just a finite to one map, finite string to one digit map. So the topological conjugates, because of that, the topological conjugate relation between subships is bar reducible to Is Barrow reducible to E infinity? The universal kind of Barrow equivalence relation I mentioned before. This was, I think, noticed by John Clements first, but of course, it's based on some well-known facts in chemical systems. And John proved this theorem that says that the topological conjugacy relation. The topological conjugacy relation for all subshifts on 0, 1, this particular alphabet, is we're all bireducible to E infinity. Okay, once again, you know, this is a wonderful theorem that gives a sort of a canonical by now example of classification problems that are that have this E infinity as Have this E infinity as its exact complexity. So further establishes E infinity as a benchmark equivalence relation. Okay, so once again, these things are not really designed by us and they come up in the nature of the problem. So I want to mention that subflows and subshifts, and therefore, in general, if you consider subflows, it's the same thing. There's also There's also you replace that Z group by any condomin group. You also have this notion of block codes and homeomorphisms are also determined by block codes. And therefore, every if you talk about a topological conjugacy relation, then every equivalence class in that topological conjugacy class is actually countable. Okay, so therefore, broad reducible. Therefore, broad reducible to infinity. Once again, I think the challenge over here, I mean, we understand a whole lot about the subshifts and subflows, but the challenging problem is still about minimal subflows and minimal subshifts. And I want to give some examples of minimal subflow subshifts, some classes of minimal ones that are known to be whose complexity has known. Whose complexity has known to be determined. So here's one example that is a result of Aaron Hill and I, that the topological contradicting relation of all minimal rank one subshifts is for all bioreducible with E0. So when you consider minimal rank one, I'm not going to define rank one, but it's a subclass of subshifts, particular kinds of subscripts. You consider all of those things. Consider all of those things, if you consider only minimal ones, then it is not going to generate a complexity that is comparable to E infinity, but it actually goes down to E0. Just as a reminder, the relationship of these equivalence relations is like, you know, above equality is E0 and above E0. And above E0, there's infinity, E0, omega, et cetera. So all the equivalence relations that are countable are between forms of a huge universe over here, even if they're kind of short. But it's a very complex universe over here. John's example gets up here, and what we have been shown. We have been shown for minimal subshifts, it has always been E0. And Simon Thomas also noted that if you talk about the subshifts, then these turplitz subshifts, which are automatically minimal, turpless by definition is minimal because of this periodicity structure, is a topological contradicting relation for these. Controversy relation for these is Borea reduces E0. So it's above E0, therefore is not reducible to equality, but the exact complexity of all turpless subshifts is not known. And also I want to mention this result of joint work with Steve Jackson and Brendan Seward. That if you if you have a if you move Have a if you move away from z and talk about the countable infinite group in general, then the topological conjugacy of all minimal gamma subflows. Yeah, so I it's important to mention here minimal minimal subflows bro reduces E0. Once again, it's above E0, every one of them. Above E0, every one of them, as long as this is an infinite group, it's above E0. But only in the case of locally finite, we were able to determine this exact complexity. So when gamma is locally finite, then the topological congregacy of all gamma subflows, including the minimal ones, is for all bireducible to E0. So you can see that when we talk about the subflows and sub-flows, When we talk about the subflows and subshifts, all of a sudden we don't really need to even go up to like equality plus. We are reducing down to E infinity and E zero. This is probably like, you know, I think my talk over here, I wanted to actually wanted it to be useful to everybody who actually worked on real classification problems. When you think about possible complete invariants to use, Complete invariance to use to classify your object. Sometimes it's unexpected. Like, you know, these objects are subships and subflows are actually quite complex, but in terms of borrow reducibility, it is actually rather low in terms of the borrow reducibility hierarchy. I think at this point, I have mentioned all of the benchmark equivalence relations that come from the S infinity actions as I wanted. So, to summarize again, there are two non-borall ones, and then the whole bunch. Bora ones, and then a whole bunch of borrow ones. And then I characterize everything above equality plus, which the ones that I mentioned are all of the form equality alpha plus. Those are kind of nice theoretical objects, but in practice, we haven't been able to use them. And then below the equality plus, there are a bunch of them which A bunch of them which could be possible, could be useful as well. Okay, and now finally, I think in the remaining time, I would really like to talk about two equivalence, two classes of equivalence relations that are known to be not reducible to countable structures. And I think that in a lot of work of Matt and Benji and other people. Benji and other people, that this has been heavily used, what is known as yours turbulence theory, which is known to be obstacles to reduction to asymptotic orbital constructions. Okay. So I'm going to try to give an honest definition of turbulence. Whether it is, you're able to absorb this is, I just want to give. Uh, is I just want to give it uh so that you can see that the nature of this is actually heavily topological. Okay, so um, so if we have a continuous action of a Polish group on the Polish space, so this is important, by the way, that the turbulence theory is important by the way that we consider continuous actions. Because it's topological. So if you have an open set of the analyzed space and X, an element of the set, so let me draw a picture. So here's X, and here's U, and also a small neighborhood of the identity in the group, what we call V, then you can try to use. Can try to use V elements to move X about. As long as it is staying inside U, then you create a kind of a local orbit. So what we call the local UV orbit is denoted by O of X U V. It's a set of all Y where you can reach from X to Y by this kind of finite path. Finite path where each one is goes to the next one by an element of the neighborhood of V. So here's a G that is in V that sends X to G dot X, which is still in U, and then you send it again to another one, G prime dx, that is still in U and G prime in V, etc. Okay, so all of the things that are reachable. All of the things that are reachable by these small steps, you know, finite many steps. This is called a local UV orbit. Are all x i's assumed to be you require all of the paths along the way to be u? Yes, but not just the tent, right? Right, right, right. Not just the final one, but but all of the points, yeah. Okay, and uh next okay, uh, turbulence is actually the following concept. So you under in such a context, the action is called turbulent if it satisfies three conditions, three axioms. One is every orbit is meager, second is every orbit is dense, and then T3 is that every local orbit. Three is that every local orbit, as we just defined, is somewhere dense. So, in other words, its closure, the interior of the closure of the setting is anonymity. So, very simple definition if you look back, but of course, very ingenious kind of consideration at the time when Greg first considered it. Greg first to consider it. So we also try to define a notion that is slightly weaker than turbulent. I mean, this turbulent is a well-known definition, and so I don't want to change it, but I do want to talk about this pre-turbulent notion, which says that for all X and Y in X, if X is in U, If x is in u and y is somewhere else in general, and the v is a neighborhood-based neighborhood of identity in the group, then you can actually reach some point in the orbit of y, in this local orbit. So x can go somewhere. Go somewhere. Okay. This is the local orbit, but if you take the closure of it, it actually gets to something that is actually in the same orbit as y. So this is about a pre-turbulent. And you can see that pre-turbulent is actually weaker than T2 plus T3. So T2 plus T3, if you have T2 and T3, you will actually be. Be you will have pretty turbulence because if the local orbit is somewhere dense, its interior is open and non-empty, and if the orbit of Y is dense, T2, then the orbit of Y will show up in that open set. So it's actually a consequence of T2 and T3. So, preturbulent is actually a weaker notion. However, even with this weaker notion, Greg was able to prove that if you have a pre-turbulent action of S and of gene, some kind of Polish group on Polish space. Polish group on Polish space continuous action, then it is already not broad reducible to any S infinity action. Okay, so Exg is not going to be broad reducible to EYS infinity if you have an S infinity action on some Y. So pre-turbulence is actually not that hard to verify, and example is not that hard to come up with. Come up with. One of the earliest examples that Greg himself came up was to show that the conjugacy relation of this homeomorphism group of 0, 1 squared, which is two-dimensional version of that home 0, 1 that we considered at the beginning of this talk, is that this is not brawl-reducible to any S infinity orbital concentration. Greg showed this. Concentration. Greg showed this exactly by producing a turbulent action of this H of 0, 1 squared group. So that it actually reduces to the contrary relation. So I think that so this is why Greg actually mentioned that the home 01 resulting as a contrast because that one is. Contrast because that one is reducible to a colored three-colored meaning order, remember, and this one is not. Okay. So, but of course, there are many examples of turbulent actions, including the ones that came up in the consideration of regarding theory and dynamical systems. And so, those are the techniques that are being used to show that. That are being used to show that anything is not reducible to kind of structures. I think I'm going to finish early, given the speed I'm talking, which is okay. I think we can, it's late in the day for you. And I think we can also use some time for questions and answers. So the last So the last topic I want to talk about is anti-idealisticity. And this is another obstacle to reduction to S-infinity orbital concentration, but also not only as an obstacle to reduction to S-infinity orbital concentration, but also as obstacles to reduction to any orbital concentrations of a polished group of action. So I want to once again just give the Just give the honest definition over here and state some theorems. So you know that, okay, these are actually very well studied. Okay, so suppose we have a Polish group X and the equivalence relation. We call this equivalence relation idealistic. This is a notion, I think, defined by Keckerson LeBeau, that if there is an assignment, That if there is an assignment from classes of bonus relation E, or we say E orbits, for each class, we define a sigma ideal, IC. So that this sigma ideal, obviously, you know, we don't want the whole class to be in the sigma ideal. Otherwise, if the whole class is in the, as I said, is in the sigma ideal. The as a set is in the sigma ideal, then the sigma ideal is trivial. Everything will be in the sigma ideal, but uh, so the whole class is not, and but there is a way to assign a sigma ideal, such as sigma ideal, non-trivial sigma ideal to each class. But we also want to say that this assignment from C to IC is Borel, and their way of saying that this is Borel is the following. So for each borel set A, So, for each borel set A contained in the x square, so if we look at if you look at you look at a fixed x and look at all of the y's that are in the in the x section of A, which are all Which are also equivalent to X. And then, when you assign this to the ideal over here, we want that to be a Borel set. We want the set of X's where the set of Y's in the class where this becomes an ideal set is where. Set is viral. So this is a roundabout way to say that this assignment is viral. You can actually try to forget about this definition and try to define it yourself. And you will find that this is the kind of the natural way to define the broadness of this notion. And idealistic is actually the following thing. So think about an action. Action. I think I'm going to bring the next. Yes. Any orbital constellation of a Polish group action is idealistic because if you have a group G acting on the space X, then you create these orbits. So you have this X over here, you have G dot X, which is the orbit, right? Then you can assign. Then you can assign a sigma ideal by actually pulling for the sigma ideal that is existing on G, let's say the meager ideal or the if G has a measure, then you can talk about the null ideal, etc. And you can just put, you can always put the meager ideal, for example, onto this and via this action, and then you get a brawl. And then you get a Borrow, you can check that you get a Borrow assignment, and this orbit constellation becomes idealistic. And I'm going to move to the next slide. And Kaperson LeBo found this canonical example of a A equivalence relation that is not idealistic, not only is not idealistic, it's not even reducible to any idealistic equivalence relation. And this is known to be E1. So E1 is defined very similarly to E0. You have two sequences, Xn and Yn over here. You say that they eventually equal. Eventually agree. So starting from certain capital N, they're talking about the same element. They're talking about the same elements, so that's E1. But the key point over here is that Xn and Y are not sequences, are not zeros and ones, but they are real numbers themselves. So it's not important whether they're honest real numbers or two to the end elements of the Kinner space, but there's a material difference between when this is a real number and when this is an actual number. So, E1 is a very simply defined equivalence relation. Keckers Levo proved that E1 is not broadly reducible to any idealistic equivalence relations. It's a wonderful theorem. And I think it's very published very early in the early 90s. So in that zoo, in particular, E1 is not reducible to any. Particular E1 is not reducible to any orbital constellations. So, in that zoo map over there, I think, so E1 will look like E1 should be somewhere over here. Outside of this green thing, the green thing is actually the orbital constellations. And then E1 is reducible to this bilips equivalence of compound matrix basis. Of compound matrix spaces. Okay. And in fact, there is an unresolved conjecture of also Kekrista to say that maybe E1 is the least such. If you have a constellation that is not reducible to any idealistic or any orbit equivalent even, maybe E1 is actually reducible to it, and E1 is therefore the smallest one. And we don't have any progress on this process. Any progress on this problem since its mention proposed 30 years ago. So I think. Oh, did I? Okay. Right. And I think I'm about to like the final review is that we talked about the fact that we're going to be Final review is that we talked about things around this blue region over here, and I think I've told you almost everything I know about it. But I also believe that all of the natural classification problems that have to do with dynamical systems, as long as we are able to determine their exact complexity, have shown up in the Complexity have shown up in this map over here. So finally, I think I'm finishing 20, 15 minutes early. So some further readings about this part. And I mentioned the Eorte Tech Chris LeBow paper and our paper about the NARAC media reading published groups and Clements result about the universal accountable for all equivalence relation. Accountable for all equalness relations, etc. And I just want to point to the last one, which is the book I wrote about 13 years ago. It has almost all the proofs that I mentioned today. So I guess if you're interested, you can find pretty much all the proofs over there, including the for example, Kecker's wall theorem. Chris of Wall theorem, the Freeman-Stanley theorem, all of these things about carnival structures, et cetera. Not so much about the dynamical systems, because my book was not really about applications, but rather about the theory. So, well, thank you very much for your attention over here. And I hope that this will. Hope that this will serve as a good introduction and good luck with your classification efforts. I have one question about the turbulence. Definition of turbulence? Definition of turbulence? Yes. Okay. So, yeah, about the third condition. So, the fact that every local orbit is somewhere dense. So, if instead of asking for every local orbit, one has one local orbit being somewhere dense. Does it give any So, of course, that's already a lot of information. And I think that a lot of times you can, once again, I think this depends a whole lot on the particular, if you have just one local orbit, you would have only one open set and only one neighborhood of the group. And so you could actually try to For example, restricts your attention to just that part of the space, and that still tells a whole lot about what's going on. But on the other hand, I think that there are certain kinds of results that can be proved in this. For example, I think that that is just a meager and dense without without the summary, without the assumption of a. Sunward without the assumption of the local orbit, just meager and dense already tells you that it is not reducible to equality, for example. But then if you add a little bit more, it will tell you that it will not be reducible to equality plus. And then you have full turbulence, then it will tell you that you cannot reduce to any SM5 reaction. So I think that this is not a full answer to your question, but I think that it's. To your question, but I think that it does imply something, but just not the whole, not the full thing. Yes, you can move the local orbit by a group element. It's just that the groups are not community. So, like it could be cheap. I mean, like you know, which is still okay, but yeah, you don't but you don't go too close. Right. But yeah, you can spread along the orbit this. Spread around the orbit, if you don't have to go to the connection. Yeah, okay, you will get a density set of bits of you. You will kind of take conjugate bits of v and then it's okay. So, yeah, once you have one, you have a dense set of ones, but get but then maybe maybe maybe one get a g d Maybe one get a G delta set of couple and points. That's enough. That's enough for the thing. Because you restrict to the G delta, you work on the G dynasty? I just want to thank Sue, especially because his first talk started at 4 a.m. this time. Thank you. Thank you. But it's my pleasure. I think I want to thank Matt in particular, I think, to really persuade me into talking this early, because he convinced me that this is a really worthwhile effort. I'm really glad I did it. Well, thank you for doing it. Yeah, I think when you
