And I'd like to thank the organizers, session chairs, and for providing me this opportunity to present my work. And also, I'd like to thank all the speakers for wonderful presentations. So, today I'll be talking about a model which tries to unify these different disparate regimes in the rheological curve for non-Brownian suspensions. Suspensions. And before that, suspensions are basically materials formed when we have a bunch of particles suspended in a fluid medium. And then there are plenty of examples. Like in nature, we have mud, river silt, milk, and human blood. There are some natural examples, and suspensions are very find a bunch of applications in industry. Bunch of applications in industry like this: coal slurry, metal pests in solar cell printing, concrete, biomass slurries, and paints and smoothies. So it's essential to basically learn about and understand what basic principles govern the rheology of these suspensions so that we can predict and control their flow in various applications. Applications. So, as a result of which, there has been a tremendous interest in the field. And among the various parameters which control the rheology of suspensions, the volume fraction, which is the fraction of particle volume compared to the total volume, seems to be the most obvious parameter. And as a result, it has been studied quite a lot. So, if you look at If you look at the viscosity versus the volume fraction, and if we also plot the minimum gap distance between the particles on a graph like this, you can imagine as the volume fraction increases, the average minimum gap between the particles decreases and at some fraction, which is also known as random closing fraction, it becomes zero. And this is the maximum volume fraction that can be achieved. Uh, then we can also look at how the viscosity varies. So, in the very dilute shear limit, Einstein came up with this nice linear relation, relationship between the viscosity and the volume fraction, which tells us that in the dilute regime, viscosity increases linearly. And since the particles are well separated, this formula could be derived by ignoring the inter-particle interactions. But if we move to a semi-dilute, We move to a semi-dilute regime, then these interactions start becoming important. And Bachelor and Green, in this classical paper, they corrected and improved Einstein's formula by adding this extra term. And now we can predict the viscosity at a higher volume fraction. But as we go to even higher volume fractions, the particles become very close, and the many body interactions and inter-particle interactions become. Interparticle interactions become very important. So, theoretical analysis is difficult, but people have come up with these empirical formulas to model this behavior. And surprisingly, as you can see from this formula, this viscosity diverges at a maximum volume fraction, which is smaller than this random closing fraction. And the reason becomes apparent if you look at this minimum distance. At this minimum distance, so the minimum distance here becomes so small that the short range interactions between the particles they start playing a determining role. And in some cases, the particles can even touch each other and that can lead to various constraints on the particle motions, which is depicted very nicely with these gear-like diagrams. So, yeah, so short range interactions become important, and also these contacts become important. Become important. And as a result, so at low volume fractions, because particles are well separated, the behavior is Newtonian. But as we increase the volume fraction, the behavior becomes highly non-Newtonian and essentially rate dependent, which is clear here. So initially, the suspension shear thins, then there is this flat line, which is the Newtonian Play-2, then it undergoes a shear thickening, and finally, in some cases, it In some cases, it also undergoes the second shear thinning regime at a very high shear rate. So, the same data can be also represented on a stress versus shear rate plot, where all these regions become clear by just looking at the slope. So, at low shear rates, the slope is less than one, so it is shear thinning, and so on. So, since this, this is well-known behavior, and it has been known for. Is well-known behavior and it has been known for like a few decades now. There are a lot of explanations for these different regimes. So, the initial shear thinning, there is an explanation based on the attractive-repulsive DLVR forces or adhesion and friction. And also, there are some explanations based on ordering in the suspensions. There is some correlation between the ordering and this initial shear thinning. And recently, there is this nice. This nice explanation, which relies on the fact that the fluid in the interstitial gaps might be shear thinning, and it can give rise to the shear thinning. But when we come to this Newtonian Plato, there are, to the best of my knowledge, there are no explanations for this, and it still eludes us, like why we get this flat line after the initial shear thinning. After the initial shear thinning, and then shear thickening, when it comes to shear thickening, also, this has been known for a long time, and we are now starting to understand it better why it happens. But some earlier explanations that included order, disorder, transition and hydroclustering due to lubrication interactions. But recently, the most popular theory is based on these constraint activation due to increasing. Due to increasing stress, and the most popular constraint is this friction. And it was presented by Murray, Professor Mortardin, Professor Morris and co-workers in this nice GOR study in 2014. So I just feel sad because at that time I was an undergraduate. I was just starting undergraduate and I couldn't read it in real time. But I find this study very fascinating. And then, again, when we come to even higher shear rates, first, there is the lack of experimental data in this regime. And the experiments that go to such a high shear rates, some of them, they report a second shear thinning regime. And also, again, various explanations have been given for this regime, but most of these are kind of a qualitative explanation. are kind of a qualitative explanations and they cannot reproduce this sec they cannot reproduce the second shear thinning quantitatively. So as you can see there are these this literature survey gives us to various questions which I have reported here. So can we try to come up with a model which can unify all these regimes and give a Unify all these regimes and give a in a nice single framework and so that we can have these regimes and the various transitions from one to another. And what might be the reason behind this intermediate neutronium plate and the second shear thinning. So the idea is simple. So as the shear rate or shear stress increases, the particles they come closer and closer together and as they come closer there are these different force interactions that Different force interactions that get activated, and as a result, we see this nice transition from one region to another. So, let's first look at what, let's just zoom in in this inter-particle gap and see and try to understand what's happening. So, if we zoom in, then the particles are usual, even the smooth particles, they are usually have small roughnesses and irregularities on their surfaces, which are represented by represent, which are represented. Which are represent here with these hemispheres. So, in a shear flow, these particles are translating as well as rotating. And because of that, the first obvious interaction is the hydrodynamic or lubrication interaction, which scales inversely as this interparticle gap. And then, other interactions we can look at this parameter lambda, which is which is a dimensionless inter-particle gap based on the Based on the asperity size, HR. And because of that, there can be normal as well as tangential forces on the particles. And this can be the friction and the forces can be nicely represented on the Streiback curve, which is very popular for lubricated friction. So let's just see first the interaction when the interparticle graph is smaller, very small compared to. Graph is smaller, very small compared to the radius, but large compared to these irregularities. So, in that case, we have hydrodynamic lubrication and the particles are kind of well separated. So, in this regime, DLVO forces are important. Then, as the particles come even closer and the inter-particle is comparable to the roughness, then there is this partial EHL regime where there might be partial contacts and the. And the normal force suddenly increases, as well as there is a sudden rise in the friction. And finally, the particles can come into direct contact when the aspirators deform and this inter-particle distance becomes smaller than the roughness. And this is called boundary lubrication regime. And this is where friction is active, and DEM-like and various contact forces are also present. So, because of this. Uh, so because of this, there can be torques on the particles as well. So, moving forward, in this model, we try to model these various interactions based on the inter-particle distance and simulate them in a Stokes regime so that we can ignore inertia. So, yeah, lubrication forces we use the resistance formulation, but I'm not given the detail to save time. Then, the attractive and repulsive forces of the DLV origin. Of the DLVO origin, they have this nice well-established expressions, and these are active when the particles are well separated or when lambda is high enough. And kappa here is the d-by length, and FR, FAR all the characteristic magnitudes of these attractive and repulsive forces, respectively. And here is the center to center normal vector between the particles. Then, as I mentioned, as they come, As I mentioned, as they come even closer when the lambda is between one and two, the particles are not exactly touching, but they are very, very close. And we hypothesize that there is this again extra stress scale, extra force scale, which is due to the non-DLV interactions. And its magnitude is given with F and D. And it tries to prevent the particles from coming into contact. It can also be imagined. Can also be imagined like a steric repulsion. And finally, if the force is high enough, the particles they come into contact due to this deformation of the asperity and we can model the normal and tangential forces using Hertz law and a spring. And also we have Coulomb's law for the friction, and friction gets activated. And in this recent study by Chartier et al. in soft matter, they measured this. They measured this friction and they found out that the coefficient of friction decreases. So, when the asperities are deformed by a small amount, the contact is the elastic regime and we have a high coefficient of friction. But as the asperities deform more, they go to plastic region and the coefficient of friction decreases like this. We can fit this data by using this log type of relationship here. And I'll be using this relationship as a model for. This relationship as a model for friction in this framework. So, these are simulation parameters, and I report mostly the viscosity and other details for the algorithm and the method can be found in our previous publications. So, yeah, moving forward, so going on to results. So, as you can see here, I compare the simulation results with the I compare the simulation results with this experimental study by Charteitel because we used the force measurements and coefficient of friction from their measurements. So as you can see, the matching with the experimental data is very nice. And we also get the continuous shear thickening at low shear rates, the continuous shear thickening at low volume fractions, and discontinuous shear thickening at high volume fractions, then shear thinning, the Newtonian play2, and then finally. Thinning the Newtonian plate 2, and then finally the second shear thinning regime as well. So, to explain why we get these different transitions, we need to look at the probability function for the average of this interparticle length lambda and various contributions to the viscosity, like from the hydrodynamic interactions, from the contact interactions, and non-contact interactions. Interactions and non-contact interactions, which are the DLEVO and non-DLVO forces. So, initially, at low shear rates, most of the particles are well separated, and we have the DLVO forces which are dominant. So, you can imagine them to be particles with a higher apparent radius. And as we increase the shear rate, they come closer, and as a result, their apparent radius decreases. So, you can imagine it has to, so as we increase the shadow radius, So, as we increase the shear rate, you can imagine there is this apparent decrease in the volume fraction, and as a result, we get this initial shear thinning. And as we then increase the shear rate further, the particles come very close to each other such that the non-DLVA forces are now sorry. I hear there is an. So, I hear there is an echo. Okay, I'll go ahead. So, this kind of acts as a barrier to prevent this contacts and it delays the shear thickening. So, we get this nice Newtonian play-2 as shown here. And then finally, as the stress or shear rate increases further, this barrier is broken and particles come into direct contact, and there is this sudden activation of friction. And there is this sudden activation of friction, and as a result, there is this jump in the viscosity and we get this shear thickening. But as we increase the shear rate again further, the asperities deform and they go into plastic regions so that the coefficient of friction decreases and that finally gives us this second shear thinning. So yeah, so this is a nice summary of So, this is a nice summary of which interactions are dominant in which regime, and how the transition from one to the other gives this nice complicated rheology. So, since we can basically change various force interaction magnitudes and dy length and coefficient of friction, we can. Can we can also reproduce various other rheological curves? So, in some cases, this Newtonian plateau is very narrow, or in some cases, this second shield thinning is not present, and that can also be easily modeled in this framework. So, since the DLVO interactions, they govern this initial shear thinning, we can change the order and magnitude. We can change the order and magnitude of this initial shear thinning by carefully changing the magnitude of the attractive forces or the d-by length. Then the non-DLV interactions, they basically delay this transition to shear thinning and as a result they give rise to Newton and Plato. And so if we have like if the non-DLV interactions are not present or they are Interactions are not present, or they are weak compared to the others. Then, you can see here from this green line that there is no Newtonian play2, and which might be true in some suspensions like silica suspensions, where this Newtonian play-2 is very narrow. And finally, in some cases like polymeric particles, we have a significant Newtonian platoon and in that cases, we think that these non-DLV interactions. These non-DLV interactions are playing a fundamental role. And so, this poses a nice question to experimentalists that to carefully and more accurately measure these interactions so that we can see if there is this nice one-to-one correlation between these interactions and various regimes here. And finally, friction, the role of friction, as I mentioned, is very well studied and. Very well studied, and the viscosity, basically, the magnitude of viscosity depends on the magnitude of coefficient of friction. So I've run simulations for various friction laws. So the first four, so the log law is from the experimental measurements. This exponential law is just a model, mathematical model. And then this finally, this cottage kind of law is from the Brismal model. From the Brismal model. And as you can see, if you have a higher friction, the viscosity jump is higher, and the viscosity in the second shear thinning is also higher. But if we have a constant coefficient of friction, then this second shear thinning regime is not present and we get another Newtonian play 2 after the shear thickening transition. So, again, as I mentioned, this is not this high. This high shear rate regime is not explored in many of the suspensions. So it might be helpful to explore these. I try to finish it up so we will have time for questions. Okay, yeah, yeah. So I'll skip this slide and go to my conclusion slide. So to answer the questions that I initially posed, can we unify? So yes, by carefully modeling all the interactions and we hypothesize. And we hypothesize that these non-DLV interactions explain the Newtonian play2. And finally, the elastic to plastic deformation leading to reduction in friction can reproduce the second shear thinning quantitatively. So with that, I'm open to any questions, and I'd also be happy to discuss more in the discussions session at the end of today's. Thank you. Thank you. Marco, you want to start with your question? Marco, you want to start with your question on the friction model? Oh, yes. My question is the following: so if you use, if you allow the friction coefficient to change in function of some local properties, for example, reducing in terms of normal load, etc. Oh, can you hear me? Yes, yes, I can hear you. Okay, okay. You will you. You will have this reduction in the viscosity. This is actually the model suggested by Lowbrey, I think, in 2000. My main question is the following. So, if you take this model of breezer, this plastic deformation where the friction coefficient decrease as increasing of the load, how does this model fit into the strip curve that you mentioned in the next video? Curve that you mentioned earlier in your slide because the tribute curves depends on the Somerphone number, which is inversely proportional to the load. So, therefore, the friction coefficient decrease inversely proportional to the one over n, where in the model of breather is decreasing with n. So, how these two pictures fit into each other? So, in most of these tribe curves, so all these stribe curves that I studied, they just report a high coefficient of friction. High coefficient of friction when the contacts come into boundary layer. But in those studies, I couldn't find that they go to higher normal loads and see what happens to the coefficient of friction. So I think it is consistent, right? The normal load is in the denominator. So as you increase the normal load, the coefficient of friction decreases. Yeah, well, in the boundary lubrication regime, it decrease increasing the zombie number. Decrease increasing the zombie number, which depends also on the sliding velocity, not only on the rhythm number. So I'm just thinking so here if you sorry yeah here if you look if if the if we increase the normal load the Sommerfeld number would also decrease right. So it is it is consistent. So as you go from right to left on the on this x on x axis the normal load is increasing. The normal load is increasing. So, from 1 to 0, even in the boundary lubrication, the normal load is increasing. Yeah, but here you are increasing the friction provision. Yeah, so this red line is the normal load. So, as you can see, it is increasing. So, it is consistent. But most of the uh studies for strabeck curve they they just they finish here and they they don't probe what happens. Okay, so you are saying that uh the black line is the your friction coefficient. Is your friction coefficient? Right, yeah. And the black line is dropping down as a function of the sum of the number. This is something I'm not sure whether this has ever been reported. Yeah, it's not reported. I couldn't find it. It's not reported. But I think from the experimental measurements of Chartitan, you can, for the particles that we see in these suspension studies, it might be true. Studies, it might be true for these particles. I think we need to move on because there's an hour talk coming up. There's a few more questions in the chat, and Job, maybe you can get to them and answer them offline. Thank you very much. Thanks to the three speakers. And this session is now over. Okay, thank you, Morten, the chairing, and thanks to all the speakers. All the speakers.
