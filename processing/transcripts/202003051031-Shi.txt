Thank you very much. So first of all, I want to thank the organizers for organizing this great workshop. And as many of you know, I'm actually from Calgary, so it's good to be back home being in the mountains, seeing all the deers around, eating great food, and doing math. So this work I will talk about today is joint with Annes Boldry, Mike Hill, and Ming Kong Zeng. Maitil, and Ming Kong Zhang. But to introduce our main theorem, there's some setting up to do. So to start, I want to start with Atia's real K-theory, Kr. So C2 is going to be a cyclic group of order 2, and I'm going to take its generator to be tau. And by a real space, X, I mean just a space X with a C2 action. So there's a tau action on X, and if I act by it twice, I get an identity map back. And now suppose I have a real space, what is Now, suppose I have a real space. What is a real vector bundle over x? Well, a real vector bundle consists of the following theta. So, E itself is a complex vector bundle over x, and e itself is a real space, and I want a projection map from E to X to be C2 equivalent. Now, there's a C2 action on X, so I get a C2 action on the fibers. And this is this is a map tau between complex vector spaces. And I want this map to be anti-complex linear. Be anti-complex linear. By which I mean tau of z times v is z bar times tau of var. So just note that this is not a C2 equivalent complex vector bundle. Because if it's C2 equivalent, then this Z bar would have been Z. So this is a C2 real vector bundle. And now once I have this, Kr of X is going to be the Grossman deconstruction of this. And this, just like classically, is going to give me a C to F a variance spectrum. Give me a C2X variance spectrum, Kr. And this is a Ts real K-theory. So, what are some properties of Kr? Well, Kr combines complex K-theory and real K-theory. So, what I mean is that if I look at the underlying spectrum of Kr, it's Ku, the complex K-theory. And if I look at the C2 fixed point, it's KO, the real K-theory. And suppose I want to compute its C2 fixed points. There are two spectral sequences that can do this. Spectral sequence that can do this. The first spectral sequence is the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, where the E2 page is the C2 cohomology with coefficient in pi underlying homotopy group of Kr, which is just pi star of Ku, and some differential happens and it converges to the homotopy group of KO. So that's the first spectral sequence. The second spectral sequence is the C2 slice spectral sequence. And the C2 slice spectral sequence is invented. C2 slice spectral sequence is invented by Dan Duggar in his thesis. So, Dan Duggar invented the C2 slice spectral sequence and he used it to compute the homotopy group of K from K. I'm going to show you some pictures. So, this is the chart for the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for Kr. This is the E2 page, and you see some D3 differentials. And this is the slight spectral sequence. And if you do either of these computations, And if you do either of these computations, what you're going to find is that at the E infinity page, you can read off the eight-fold periodicity for pi-star KR. So the normal Z2Z20Z00Z package. Now, it turns out, you know, Kr is a C2 echo variant spectrum, and the spectral sequence is actually ROC2 graded. So both the homotopy X-point spectral sequence and the slide spectral sequence has a ROC2 grading. And what I'm showing you is just the Z-graded part. And what I'm showing you is just the z-graded part of the spectral sequence. Now, if I actually do the full ROC2-graded spectral sequence, I'm gonna find that Kr has two periodicities. The first periodicity is the row periodicity, and it's corresponding to the complex bot periodicity. And the second periodicity is the eight-fold periodicity, and it corresponds to the real Bach periodicity. So in this sense, Kr has both Ku and KO in it. Okay. Okay. So that's one C2 equivalent spectrum. So there's another C2 equivalent spectrum I want to talk about, and that's the real coordinate spectrum. So let's look at a case non-equivariant first. So if I have BUN, I'm going to let gamma n be its universal bundle. And I'm going to take its time space. Now, suppose I have the universal bundle over BUN plus 1, and suppose I pull it back to BUN. That bundle is going to split as the sum of a one-dimensional trivial bundle. Split as the sum of a one-dimensional trivial bundle and the universal bundle over VUN. So, what that means is that if I take the time space, that's going to give me a map from the two-fold suspension of the time space over VUN to the time space over VUN plus 1. And if I piece all these maps together, I'm going to get a time spectrum. And that is the complex coordinate spectrum, Mu. Now, C2 equivalently, it turns out that Vu is a real space under the Real space under the complex conjugation action, and this gamma n becomes a real vector bundle. And if I take this Tom space and do the same construction as before, this map from the two-fold suspension is going to become a map from the row-fold suspension of the Tom space over view and to the Tom space over view and plus one. So rho here is the regular representation of C2. So if you restrict this map back to the nine covariant world, you get the nine covariant world. Equivariant world, you get the nine equivariant. Now, equivariantly, if I piece all these maps together, I'm going to get a C2 equivalent spectrum. And that is the real covort spectrum, MUR. The underlying spectrum of MUR is MU. And if I want to look at its C2 fixed points, well, it's a little hard to describe, but its homotopy group has been computed completely by Hu and Kriegshu. And we'll talk about that later. Later. So classically, if I have Mu, there's a theory of complex orientations and formal group laws associated with it. With MuR, I have a theory of real orientations, something that Jeremy alluded to in his talk. So what is a real orientation? Suppose E is a C2 equivariant homotopic cumulative ring spectrum. A real orientation is a class X bar inside the rho cohomological. Inside the rho cohomology of C P infinity. Where the C P infinity I'm treating as a real space with the C2 action acting by the complex conjugation. And I want this X bar to restrict to the unit in Cp1. So that's what a real orientation is. It's something that refines the complex orientation. Now once I have a real orientation, Araki has computed the e cohomology of C P infinity and the E cohomology of C P infinity cross. And an equal homology of Cp infinity cross C P infinity. And he found that the same case holds in the C2 equivalent world as in the non-equivalent world. So once I have this, I can take the map C p infinity cross C p infinity to C P infinity that classifies the tensor product of line bundles and I apply E star to it and it's going to give me a formal group law over pi big star. So real orientation, just like the complex orientation, gives me a formal group law. Orientation gives me a formal group. Now, classically, a complex orientation corresponds to a homotopy tuning map from Mu to E. So an example of that is Ku. So complex K theory is complex oriented. For the real orientations, a similar phenomenon holds, is that suppose I have a real orientation that corresponds to a C2X variant homotopic kinetic map from MUR. From MUR. And an example of the real spectrum is KR. So there's a map from MUR to KR. So classically, if I look at the homotopy group of Mu, my equivalence theorem, it's the Lazard ring, classifying the formal group laws. So over pi star of Mu, it carries a universal formal group law. Now, suppose I have MUR, the underlying spectrum of MUR is still MU. And if I look at this homotopy, Mu. And if I look at this homotopy group equipped with the C2 action, it turns out it's going to carry the universal C2 equivalent formal group law, such that the C2 action corresponds to the minus 1 series. So there's a universal property that's carried by pi star, the underlying homotopy group of MUR as well. Okay, so that's all I want to say about MUR for now. And MUR is going to be one of the main players for this talk. The other main player for this talk is the lube and taste. Another main player for this talk is the Lubend taste spectra. So Ku belongs to a more general class of spectra, the Lube-taste spectra, or more commonly called the Moravi-E theories. So here's the setup. So suppose K is the perfect field of characteristic P, and gamma n is a formal group law of height n. Then Lubi and Pate showed that gamma n admits a universal deformation. So what it is, is a formal group law over a ring. And the formal group law is classified by a map from the Lazar ring, which is M. From the Lazar ring, which is Mu star to EN star. And this EN star is isomorphic to this. And it's called the universal deformation ring. Now, once I have this universal deformation, it turns out that this map from mu star to EN star is Lamb-Weber exact. So what I can do is I can input it to the theorem called a Lamb-Weber exact function theorem. And the output, I would get a complex-oriented homotopy. A complex-oriented homotopy cumulative ring spectrum, which is called EN. So that's the loop and tape spectrum. But what are some examples of this? So suppose the field I start with is F2, and the formal group law is the height one multiplicative formal group law, then the Lubente theory I get is Ku completed F2. And more generally, if K is FPN and the formal group law is the Honda formal group law, characterized by its P series. Characterized by its P-series equal to XP to the N, then the E-theory I get is more commonly called the Morava, height-N Morava E-there. All right, so this is a talk about equivalent homotopy theory, so I should talk about some group actions. So if I have this universal deformation ring E n star, there's a group acton. This is the Morava stabilizer group, and it's coming from the automorphism of the formal group law. Of the formal group law that I started with. So there's a group G that's acting on E and star. Now, this is just some group acting on some algebraic rank, but as algebraic topologists, what you really want is a group acting on a space or a spectrum. So a natural question to ask here is: can I lift this algebraic action to become a G-action on the spectrum here? So can we lift it? So, can we lift it? The answer turned out to be yes. So, Gores, Hopkins, and Miller showed that this algebraic action of G on E n star can be lifted uniquely to an action of G on the spectrum E n by E infinity ring maps. This is the, they proved it by using obstruction. And once I have this action, it's an action of G on E n, this is a naive G action, I can apply the cold-free functor to B E n as a genuine G spectrum. To view En as a genuine G spectrum. And works of Blumberg and Hill would ensure that as all norm maps, so I can actually treat En as a commutative ring object in the category of genuine G spectrum. Right now we can form the universal deformation in higher altars. Well then you don't have to do the almost two groups. We don't have to prove anything. Of course, Markets Miller proved all this. Smeller proof of all this. Okay, so from now on, so we have the Goris-Hawkins-Miller theorem. I can treat EN as a G spectrum. So from now on, for the rest of the talk, I'm going to focus at the prime 2. So at the prime 2, there's a special subgroup inside the Morava stabilizer group. It's C2, it's central, and it acts on E. Central and it acts on E n star by the minus one series. And what the Gores-Hopkins-Miller theorem gives me is that gives me a C2 action on E n. So here's the situation I have. So suppose I take the algebraic map from Mu star to EN star that I started with. That map is actually C2X ovarian. And that's because the C2 action on both sides is acting by the minus 1 series. And for both sides of this map, I have C2E condarmarivariar. Side of this map, I have C2 echo variant lips. On the left-hand side, I have the C2 action on MUR that's acting by the complex conjugation. And on the right-hand side, I have the C2 action on EN that's coming from the obstruction theory. But the thing is, the source of these two C2 actions are different. The left-hand side comes from geometry, and the right-hand side comes from algebra. And as Lars mentioned in his talk, if something is commutative, then it comes from geometry. That comes from Jung. So, a natural question to ask is: can we lift this C2 equivalent algebraic map to become a C2 equivalent map between C2 spectra? So can we lift this? The answer is yes. So Jeremy Hahn and I proved that the Lubenthase spectrum E n is real-oriented. So it receives a C2 echo variant map from MUR to EN. M-U-R-G-E-M. Or is that a map of ring spectrum? It's a map of homotopy community bring spectrum. Or do you hear that it's E1? It's E sigma. And so this is the real orientation theorem. And what I want to explain now is how this real orientation theorem, it really opens the door to a series of computations you can do in chromatic homotopy. You can do in chromatic homotopy theory that weren't accessible before. So, chromatic homotopy theory seeks to study the P-local sphere spectrum in stages. So, the chromatic convergence theorem of Hopkins and Rabnel showed that the P-local sphere spectrum sits at the inverse limit of this tower, called a chromatic tower. And each stage of this tower fits into a pullback square. Fits into a pullback square called a chromatic fracture square. And the idea of this chromatic power is that in order to study the P-local sphere spectrum, which is something that's supposed to be very hard, it suffices to study each of the k-n-local spheres and how they glue together. Now, to study each of these k-n local spheres, that's when the g action on En kicks in. So, Hopkins and Demonas showed that the K-n local Showed that the Km local spheres is equivalent to E and Hg. So here's an example at height 1. So at height 1, E1 is Ku completed at 2, and G1 is the units in the 2 atics. So by the Hawking-Devinauts theorem, the K1 local sphere is equal to E1, Hg1. But G1 is still kind of big. So it turns out in this case, there's a short. So it turns out in this case, there's a short resolution by finite groups. So this short resolution is due to Adam Sparrow Ravenel. So it resolves the K1 local square into smaller subgroups, these E1HC2s. And each of these E1HC2s is KO completed at 2. So the idea is that to study the KO local spheres, it suffices to study each of these E and H G's, where G is finite. Where G is finite, and how they glue together. So, for this reason, since E1HC2 is KO2 completed, these EAHGs for G finite, they're often called the higher real K-theories. And these will be the central objective study for this talk. Now, before I tell you how to study them, why are the ENHCs useful? Well, they can be used to resolve the Kn local spheres. And they capture And they capture large-scale periodicity phenomena in a stable homotopic group of spheres. And another application is that they're used in modern detection theorems. For example, the covariant mirror, the solution of the covariant mirror problem. And the modern detection theorems seeks to study fate of elements in the stable homotopic group of spheres by analyzing their Cori-Widge index. Okay, so how do we compute these guys? How do we compute the Compute these guys, how do we compute the ENHGs? So, for each of these ENHGs, there's a homotopy fixed-point spectral sequence. The E2 page is the G cohomology, the group cohomology of G with coefficient in pi star En and converges to pi star at ENHG. I've already told you the situation in height 1. So at height 2, these computations are often known as TMF and TMF with level structures. And it has been worked on by many people. Many people. And these spectra provide good approximations of the K2 local sphere. Now, one thing about these computations is that most of these computations rely heavily on the geometry of elliptic curves. And the reason for that is that you really need to choose a specific supersingular elliptic curve in order to understand exactly how g is acting at pi star En and to get differentials in. E m and to get differentials in the spectral sequence. So you need to choose a specific model of the Lupin-Tate spectrum. So that's the computation at height 2. But it turns out when the height is greater than 2, height prime 2, these ENHGs, they're very difficult to compute. And one of the reasons they're very difficult to compute is that this group action on EN is coming from the Gauss-Hoppins-Miller obstruction figure. It's coming from obstruction figure. It's coming from obstruction. And you lift a curve where they're not available at higher heights. There have been attempts to understand this using topological automorphic forms by Mark Barons and Tyler Lawson. Another approach that I would like to advertise today is to use MUR. The action of MUR, the group action, comes from geometry. So we can try to use MUR to study these ENHGs. So the real orientation actually establishes a connection between the geometric C2 action and this G action coming from obstruction. So it turns out, using the real orientation, we can achieve a complete computation of En HC2 at all heights. So here's roughly how it goes. I start with my real orientation, a map from MUR to EN. This induces a map of homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. Map of homotopy fixed point spectral sequences. The one on the left is in green, that green means good. And the right-hand side is red, red means bad. Why is it good? It's good because we know all the differentials in this homotopy fixed point spectral sequence of ME. And this is work of Huenkrish. And once I know this, I can use naturality to push these differentials over to the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence at EN. Topic fixed point spectral sequence E. And this will give me all the differentials on the right-hand side. So this is the theorem. Please don't read it, because I'm also a self-respecting person that loves to do computations. So I'm going to show you some pictures. So here's an example computation in E3HC2. The first differentials are D3 differentials. Then you get a D7 differential. Then you get the T7 differentials, and then you get the T15 differentials. Here's a loose cable. Check the connections, here's a loose cable. Okay. I think it's okay. That's worrying because there are more spectral sequence, so harder differentials going. And that's afterwards the spectral sequence collapse, and that's a uni pitch. So there are a couple. So they're coming. What's the D15 size? D15. That's the highest difference. This is 3 equals 3. For at height 3. So there are a couple of things you learn from this computation. First of all, this spectral sequence is periodic. It's 32 periodic, which means if I move everything to the right by 32, I get the same thing back. And in general, Jeremy and I proved that ENHC2 is 2 to the n. EnHC2 is 2 to the n plus 2 periodic for all n. So that's the first thing we learned is a periodicity theorem for EnHC2 at all heights. The second thing we learned is that as a C2 equivalent spectrum, En is strongly even. So this is a notion due to Hill and Meyer. So non-equivalently, En is even because it's odd homotopy, or homotopy groups are zero. This theorem saying that covariantly, something stronger is true. So the odd homotopy groups are. Is true. So the odd homotopy group being zero is refined to pi k rho minus one E n zero. So this periodist, do you know it's sharp? Yes, we know it's sharp for ENHC2. And the third thing we learned is that EN is real Lamb-Weber exact, which is to say that this map is an isomorphism for every C2 spectrum, X. Sorry for the technical difficulties. So here's the E infinity page again. And if you look closely, you see that some classes are labeled by names in the stable homotopy group of spheres. So these are some of the Huravich images for ENHC2. We obtained it by first studying the C2 Huravich images of MUR. Images of MUR. So this is a theorem proven by Gu Chan Li, Guo Zhen Wang, Jo Isu, and myself. So we proved that certain families in the stable homotopy group of spheres are detected by the C2 fixed point of MuR. And using that and the real orientation theorem, we obtained certain detection theorems for the C2 fixed point of EN. Now, here's a remark I want to make, is that we first notice how in this computation we first computed ENHC2. When we first computed E and H C2. What do you mean by the kappa bar family? The kappa bar family is actually defined by U as the H2N to the fourth. Sorry. Yeah, H2N to the fourth. H2N to the fourth. Yeah. So kappa bar is in 20, 4. And then kappa bar two is in 44. Oh, like the G I's or something? Yeah, the G I's, the G I's. Alright. So I was referring to their main names. Referring to their main names. So, note we first computed ENHC2 and then we proved this Huru-Wich images. Now, historically, this is actually done in the reverse form. So, remember the homotopy fixed-point spectral sequence I showed you in the beginning with the D3 differentials? Well, to obtain these differentials, you actually need to first know that E1HC2 detects eta. And then you also need to know eta to the fourth is equal to zero in the stable homotopy group of the spheres. And that would force the D3 differential. E3 differential. You just need to know that eta is the code. Uh yeah, yes. That that will do it too. Yeah. But you need to know it detects eta. And for the high two case, a similar, you need to know a similar thing. You need to hd2 detects both eta and nu. And you also need to know nu is nil potent in order to force a d7 difference. But this method gets hard at higher heights. And it's because, well, And it's because, well, these half-elements, they stop existing after 3. And each height is a brand new computation. So I could have computed E100HC2, and then I have moved the height by 1, and it's not clear how E11HC2 is related to E100HC2. So there are some difficulties if I want to carry out this computation. Now, having a real orientation, though, actually bypasses all these difficulties. All these difficulties. Because all of these theories are imported from MUR. So, to put it in Hammus language, MUR is like a central train station. It got a train going into each of these ENHC2s. And once I know this, it's very clear to see that as the height increases, that the lower differentials are the same. And when I increase the height by one, I get one more class of differentials from MUR. And the Housewives image also increases. Having the real orientation. But having the real orientation bypasses all these difficulties. Okay, so that's the C2 case. That's everything I want to talk about for C2. So you might wonder, well, if the Morava stabilizer group is very big, there are bigger subgroups than C2. What about EAHC, EAHG for higher groups? So for that, I need to use something called the Hill-Hoplin-Job in a normal functor, which Thomas also talked about a little bit. So if H is a subgroup of G, So if H is a subgroup of G, then the Hill-Hopping's Rabinel norm functor takes the H spectrum and spits out the G spectrum. A homotopical version of the norm functor first originated in the work of Greenlees and May. So this norm functor has many nice properties. So for example, it is symmetric monoidal. And if the input is an H representation sphere, and then the output is a G representation sphere with an induced representation. And here's an example. Suppose x is a C2 spectrum. Then what happens if I norm it up from C2 to C8? Then the underlying spectrum of norm C2 to C8X is a smash product of four copies of X. And if I imagine X as a space, roughly saying, this is how the C8 action is acting. It's sending the point A, B, C, D, it's sending A to B, B to C, C to D, and it's sending D all the way to the front, but together. All the way to the front, but together with this complex conjugation action. So, very roughly saying, this is how the CN actions act. Another nice property of the norm is that if I restrict my attention to commutative spectrum, then the norm functor is left adjoint to the forgetful function. So now, suppose g is a group that contains c2, then I'm going to define mug to be the norm from To be the norm from C2 to G of Me R. So this is now a G equivariant spectrum. So for this talk, I'm going to focus on the case when G is a cyclic group of order 2n, and I'm going to let its generator be gamma. Then the underlying spectrum of MuC2N is a smash product of 2 to the n minus 1 copies of Mu. So recall when I was talking about MuR, if I look So recall when I was talking about MER, if I look at its underlying homotopy groups with the C2 action, it carries the universal C2Ecker formal group law, so that the C2 action corresponds to the minus 1 series. There's an analogous universal property for the underlying homotopy group of MuC2N, equipped with the C2N action. So this carries the universal C2n equivariant formal group law, such that the C2 action corresponds to the minus one series. To the minus one series. So there's some universal property that's carried by the underlying homotopic root of this as well. Okay? Alright, so having the norm functor allows me to upgrade my C2 real orientation to a G orientation. So here's the G orientation theorem. It's that suppose G is any finite subgroup that contains the central C2 subgroup in the Morava stabilizer group. Then there's a G equivariant. Then there's a G equivariant map from MUG to EN, now treated as a G spectrum. And the proof is actually very easy. So you take your real orientation, which is a map from MUR to EN as a C2 spectrum, then you apply the norm functor, and then use the adjunction. And this is how you obtain the G-equivalent orientation and the real orientation. Alright, so this MUCT. So this MUCTUN, MUG, it was constructed and studied extensively by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel in their solution of the Kavari-Neron problem. So in 2009, they proved that Kerberian-Marin elements theta J do not exist for J greater or equal to 7. And here's a sketch of their proof using MUG. So the G they started with is C8. You take MUC8, and then you invert a certain class D in its equivalent homotopy groups. In its equivalent homotopy groups to get D inverse Mu C8. And then you let omega to be its C8 fixed point spectrum. And then given this omega, they proved three theorems about omega. The first theorem is the detection theorem, which says that if the Kerari-Mary element exists, then their Hori-Wich images are non-zero. The second theorem is the periodicity theorem, which is to say that pi star omega is periodic. Is periodic. And the third theorem is the gap theorem, which says there's a gap in its homotopy. I'll give you a schematic picture of how the theorems fit together. So this is a baby omega. It's 32 periodic. It's not 256 periodic, but it gets the job done. In terms of explanation. So the periodicity theorem says that this spectral sequence is 32 periodic. So that class there is a So that class there is a permanent cycle, which means it doesn't support any differentials. And the gap theorem says there's a gap. So suppose I know that this spectrum detects some class in pi 30. I don't have to do all these computations to show that class vanish. All I need to know is that there's a gap here, which means pi minus 2 is 0. And then move it 32 to the right. Then I can deduce that pi 30 is 0. Pi 30 is 0. So I can get away with all this computation, and I would know that that element is 0. And the gap theorem is obvious from the E2 page. And to deduce the periodicity theorem, you actually only need to do computations on this part, which is a lot more sparse than this part. So that's the idea, their proof. So it turns out originally, Hill Hopkins and Ravenel didn't actually plan to use NUCA to solve the problem. And you C8 to solve the covariant problem. So it turns out the detection theorem works for E4 and HC8. So there's a C8 action inside G4, and E4HC8 also detects theta J. But the problem is that if you want to compute this homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, it's really hard. There are a lot of room for differentials. There are a lot of possibilities. You really don't. So in the end, they had to settle. So in the end, they had to settle with MUCH. So here's a comparison between MEG and these ENHGs. So to analyze MEG, they invented the slice spectral sequence, which uses genuine equivalent homotopy theory. And it's rigid. So by rigid, I mean that if you look at a slice spectral sequence, there are some gaps, there are some sparsities, and there are not many rooms for differentials. So there are less possibilities, which makes the slice. Possibilities, which makes the slight spectral sequence accessible to computations. On the other hand, if you look at ENHG, it's the homotopy fixed point. So it's the homotopy fixed point. It's a Borel equivalent homotopy theory. It's non-rigid. So basically, in the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence, there's no sparsity, there's no gap, and there are many possibilities for the infractions. But nevertheless, the ENHGs, they're perfect for doing chromatic. For doing chromatic homotopy. And what the real orientation does is that it combines the pros and gets rid of the count cons. So it allows us to use the slice spectral sequence to compute ENHG. Where can we buy this real HG? Sorry. So, I want to take a moment to discuss what kind of finite subgroups we're going to use. So, the Morava stabilizer group, so Hewitt and later Berjard classified all finite subgroups of the Morava stabilizer group. So, it turns out the maximal finite 2 group depends on the divisibility of the height by 2. So, if my height is 2 to the n minus 1 times n, and n is odd, then the And n is odd, then the maximal finite 2 group is a cyclic group of order 2 to the m if m is 1 or greater or equal to 3. n is q8 when m is equal to 2. So for example, if I'm at height 2, then m is 2 and n is 1. Then I get Q8. That's essentially TMF. And if I'm at height 4, then m is 3, n is 1. Then the maximal finite two group is C8. So for this to So for this talk, we're going to focus exclusively on the cyclic groups. I think it's independent. Okay, so if you focus your attention on the cyclic groups, all the theories I've talked about fit very nicely into a tower called the detection tower. So this tower is due to my kill. To my kill. Unfortunately, it's not here. So, the idea of this tower is that as you go up the tower, the group increases, and more and more Hurubbich images are going to be detected. So, as you go up the tower, you're taking fixed points with respect to bigger subgroups, and the Khoribje increases. And the real orientation tells you that all of these fixed points are related to the fixed points for the Moravi-E-thereas. So, the goal now. So the goal now is to analyze this detection tower as much as possible to find everything we can about it. And that will give us a lot of information on the Hariwich images and these fix points. So here's one approach that you can study this tower. So classically, while I'm working too locally, I can restrict my attention to BP, the Brown-Peterson spectrum. And I have a tower consisting of the truncated Brown-Peterson spectrum. Brown-Peterson structures. And each of the BPNs has a homotopy group up to Vn. It's truncated. And BP1 is the connective complex K-theory. And if I invert the Vns inside BPN, then I get En, the Johnson-Wilson theories. So this is the case classically. C2 equivariantly, I have a similar counter. So C2 equivarially, if I'm looking at MUR, then 2 locally also splits as a wedge of suspension. 2 locally also splits as a wedge of suspensions of BPR. And I can build a similar tower. And for each of these BPRNs, the underlying spectrum for BPRN is BPN. So it has the same homotopy group as BPN. And this has been studied by Huen Creesch and by Leonard Meyer and John Greenis. If I look at the first spectrum, BPR1, it's the connected KR. Now, each of these VNs classically Now, each of these Vn's classically in pi star BP lifts to the Vn bars. So now when I lift them to the C2 equivalent world, they live in 2 to the n minus 1 row of BPR. And when I invert these Vn bars, I'm going to get something called the real Johnson-Wilson theory, ERN. So the C2 activariant versions of the Johnson-Wilson theories. Then the ERN has been studied extensively by Hu Krish, Kitchru-Wilson-Norman, and more recently by Gu Chuan Li. And more recently, by Gu Chuan Li, Vitaly Lorman, and J.D. Quitle. So, this is what happens at the C2 case. Now, in general, when the group is bigger than C2, it turns out there's a similar tower. So, here, BP C2M is going to be the norm from C2 to C2M of BPL. And two locally, MUG splits as a wedge of suspension to these BPs. And I can build a similar tower, but now if I look at the homotopy group for each of But now if I look at the homotopy group for each of these truncated theories, it's still a polynomial rank, but I get a bunch of generators. I get more generators than BPN. So by this symbol, I mean it's actually a bunch of generators. And the G action is sending this one to this one, this one to this one, and all the way to the last one. It's sending last one to the minus of the first one. So I get multiple generators in each degree, but I have a good G-action. Each degree, but I have a good G action on them. And what's really cool about this tower is that remember how I said MUC8 detects the covariant random elements? It turns out something much smaller also detects the theta j's. So if you look at, for the C8 case, if you look at the very first piece of this tower, the BPCA1s, its CA fixed points also detects the theta j. So I can actually get away with doing computation for a much smaller spectrum. Smaller spectrum. So, here, I'll now like to, and I would close to introduce the theorem finally. Is that classically, how are these towers related to Lubentate theories? Is that I have this tower and I have these Johnson-Wilson theories. The formal group laws for these Johnson-Wilson theories is going to give me models of Louvre-Pape theories. So, this is what happens classically. C2 echavariantly, I have this BPR tower. I have this BPR tower, and I have the real Johnson-Wilson theories. The formal group law carried by these real Johnson-Wilson series have an extra C2 action. And these are going to give me models of loop and take theories equipped with a C2 action. And if I move up the group, for example, if I move up to C4, I have this tower. If I choose the D's carefully, I can move to the top. These carefully, I can define higher analogs of the real Johnson-Wilson theories. And their formal group laws are equipped with a C4 action. And the theorem we proved is that these formal group laws equipped with the C4 action is going to give us models of Moravin E theories equipped with the C4 action. So these formal group laws are going to give me E2, E4, E6 equipped with a C4 action. equipped with the C4 action. So you might notice that if I look at the case before, it's 1, 2, 3, and then the bottom is 1, 2, 3. But if you look at here, it's 1, 2, 3, but the bottom is like 2, 4, 6. This actually, if you think about it, it turns out it actually makes sense intuitively. Because remember the classification of the finite two groups? It turns out these are the only heights that emits a C4 action. So for example, E1, E3 doesn't have a C4 action. Doesn't have a C4 action. And he said, intuitively, that's why the height jumps. Because this is the first height that has a C4 action. This is the next height that has a C4 action. The height jumps by 2 in this case. Can you remind us what a circular line means? A circular line basically means the formal group law associated with this. If you take these formal group laws, they will give you models for E3. So is there a map? Uh yeah. Okay, and you're you're saying that the map on the The map on the induce push-borne the formal group from the one, gives you the formal group on the other. It's like a completion process, just like a complete process. And it's a landwever exact form to sort of optimum to construct. I haven't thought too much. I thought a little bit about like Equivariant Landwever exactness, but not too much. So in general, if my cheese. It is, you thought a lot. Yeah, I did. So, in general, if my group is C2M, then the height is going to jump by 2 to the m minus 1 each time. And these are the heights that emit a C to M action. So, here's the theorem. So, what Anis, Mike, and Ninko, and I proved is that at all heights that emits a C2M action, there exists a good Action, there exists a good formal group law gamma h and it's defined over F2 such that its associated Lubente theory has a very good homotopy group. So which by a very good homotopy group I mean there are specific generators that behave very well with respect to the C2M average group. So K is going to so K is going to be any field with characteristic two. With characteristic 2. It could be F2. Yeah, it could be F2. And so the C2 action on these generators are essentially the same thing as B4. So it's acts by sending one to the next one, together with some formulas. So that's the theorem. Why is it useful in computations? So here's an alternative statement for our theorem. So before, I stated in terms of generators, where all the generators In terms of generators, where all the generators are in degree zero. Just like how people would describe the homotopy group for the Moravian heat theory. It's classic. Excuse me, is that first, can you go back to the slide number one, the second, should that be minus RI on the right? Minus, whatever that is? This one? Yeah. No, because they're now in degree zero. So the RIs are in degree two times an odd number. So that's why this one is going to be minus. That this one's going to be minus Ri. But in degree zero, the last ones. There's no minus. So here's an alternative way to state our theorem. As I recall, the homotopy group for the BPGs is a polynomial ring with these generators with a good C2 action, C2M action. Another way to write this is that you can write it in terms of compatible generators with respect to the BPGs. And the advantage of this is that if you take this equivariant orientation from BPG to the E-theory, it induces on the underlying homotopy group a C2M equivariant map from pi star of BPG to the homotopy group of the E-theory. And this map is essentially a quotient map. It takes out all the Ti's for I greater or equal to N, and for the lower Ti's, And for the lower Ti's, a mass by the identity map. And having a quotient map is great because it will be very easy to analyze the induced map of spectral sequences. Because on the E2 page, it's essentially a quotient map. And this makes it great for doing computations. So here are some examples of how you would use this formula to do computations. So here's the C4 tower, and this is the first stage of the And this is the first stage of the C4 tower. And this computation is the computation about E2HC4. So here, the element D1 you need to invert is in pi 4 rho 4 of EPC4. And this computation was first done at the same time independently by Behrens and Wormsey using the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence and Hillhop and Zravenel using a slight spectral sequence. Using a slight spectral sequence. And more recently, Anis Baudry, Rina Bavkova, Mike Hill, and Vensionowska also used the computed Mackey functor, homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for E2HC4. So here's the, great, it didn't crash. Here's the slice spectral sequence for BPC41. And that is E infinity page. Now, it turns out once I know the slice spectral sequence for BPC41, I can recover. I can recover the slight spectral sequence for these higher real Johnson-Wilson theories and the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence for E2HC4. And the reason for that is that there's a map from the slight spectral sequence to the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. And this map is the isomorphism under the line of slope 1. So this is a theorem proven by John Allman, who was a student of Mark Behris. So the idea is that once we have this map, we can Is that once we have this map, we can transfer data between the slice spectral sequence and the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence. So the idea is that, so that's the slice spectral sequence. You see how underlying slope one, it looks exactly the same. So we can just transfer the data, propagate it over. So once you know the slight spectral sequence, together with this isomorphism theorem, it will recover pretty much everything you want for the Home Taupi fixed point spectral sequence. So that's the idea. The next piece of this tower is the computation related to E4HC4. So here, the element I need to invert is a specific element in pi 24 rho 4 of BPC4. And Mike Hill, Guojenwang, Joe Li Xu, and myself computed the slide spectral sequence of BPC42. That's the part. And that's the V infinity edge. There's a vanishing line of filtration 61. And if I invert this D2, then this spectral sequence is 384 periodic. So this is a, to me, this is like the first non-trivial height 4 computation at the prime 2. Because E4HC4, the pattern was kind of straightforward. Oh, how high does that go? How high does that go? How high does that go? Like, what do you mean how high does that go? That's 400. This is 400 over 400. I can zoom in if you want. Yeah. So here's the general, so these are very specific computations for specific heights. So you can actually ask more general. So, you can actually ask more general questions. So, for example, we learned from the real orientation for the C2 case, ENHC2 is periodic. You might wonder: well, what is the periodicity for ENHG for all finite G? So, here are some low-height examples. These are all the periodicities you get for E2s with different finite subgroups. So, the last one, the last two, E2HQ8, this period 64, E2H324. E2HG24, that's TMF. That's period 192 at the prime 2. So using this specific model for the Lubentate theories, and together with the Ecker-Vrander orientation, we can prove a generalized periodicity theorem for all heights that emit a cyclic group of action or a QA action. So what we proved is that if the height is n times 2 to the n minus 1, so the maximal cyclic group is C2M, then it's periodic with this period. With this period. And if my height is 2 times the odd number, so the maximal finite group acting on it is Q8, then it's periodic with this period. Here's a sketch of the proof. From our construction of EH, we have a factorization from, so this equivariant orientation factors through D inverse of DTJ. Now, Hero Hopkins-Raum now proved the family of differentials in the slice spectral sequence for the Bchj. In the slice spectral sequence for the Bp. So they call this the slice differential theorem. And knowing this family of differentials will deduce a periodicity theorem for d inverse of BC2. And then what you can do is that you can analyze the map on the homotopy fixed point spectral sequence induced by this map and do some work, and then you can deduce the periodicity theorem on the previous slide. So, this is a sketch of proof of how you prove the periodicity theorem. Okay, that's all. Thanks. Questions? Did you take that photo yesterday? No. There were, I found that I did yesterday. This is Lake Louise in the summer. So can you uh construct these BP? You constructed these BP C2TN pointy brackets, something. How do you construct those? So it's using a method. So HHR had a technique. It's called method to twist in mono rings. So basically, it's a procedure that, so normally if you have BP, how would you quotient out these kind of BNs? You form the co-fiber sequence and quotient out them one by one. So equivariantly, there's a similar procedure you can do. So I I noticed you mentioned that the periodicity for turning a for Q8. Have you done computations with Q8? Nope. So for Q8, the real orientation, if you norm out to Q8, it will actually give you a map from MUQ8 to these E-theories as a Q8 spectrum. But we tried for a long time. We tried for a long time. We got a little stuck and then we started working on other things. Yeah. So just to, you know, the twisted monoid brain method, if I tried using the regular sequence, I mean, it's sort of, I mean, like, not equivariantly, it's like just equivalent to the regular sequence method, right? Just botting up a regular sequence. But am I right that equivariantly, the regular sequence method? The regular sequence method wouldn't work. It wouldn't work because once you kill a generator, you have to kill all the G's. You have to kill the G. Oh, so you can kill like a G's orbits at a general. You have to kill a G orbit. It's just a Tom, use the Tom spectrum trick instead. And then it doesn't have to do regular stuff. Okay. But you have to kill G warm at a time, so you two. The cold the usual cold by one. Okay. I I think you said the the periodicity was 384. The 384 and that's because uh so that's divisible by 3. That's divisible by 3 and that's because there's an extra C C3 action for B P C 4 2. So if you take E4HC4 is actually a period 128 but if you further take a there's actually an extra C3 action and then the periodicity got multiplied by 3. I can fall so long on one side, yeah. Yeah, falls along the one side. Yeah. Thank you. That would be. That would be like a little bit of a test. Because that's pile and pi check. Oh just going back to the market. Yeah, we're gonna watch it.
