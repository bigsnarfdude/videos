What I'm going to be talking about, so the joke of the title, well, you may decide that it is. In fact, whether it can be described as research is another question, but the question really is all to do with averages and how we should take averages in not just a biological context, but a wider one, and what's the appropriate thing to do. The appropriate thing to do. And it arose out of a discussion between myself and a couple of colleagues who are doing quite similar types of foraging models and both were reasonably convinced that they had the right approach. And reasonably enough, because they both did have the right approach, it just didn't look like their approaches were the same. And so that then got on to all sorts of issues about how to write these things properly and how to. These things properly, and how to recognise them. But you'll see as we go. Well, if it loses right. Okay, so it's based upon a paper a while ago now. So, I mean, and that's not quite true. The first bit is based upon that, but the whole topic keeps coming up. So, this little paper here from a few years ago, which is talking about this issue of, at least an issue of what's called the fallacy of the average, and I'll tell you what that. The fallacy of the averages, and I'll tell you what that is in a while. So here's the scenario. So we've got you're imagining an ecological situation where we're considering fitness and individuals are doing different activities to get this fitness. So I've got different things that I can do, and each of these things is going to take me some time, and hopefully, I'll get some reward while I'm doing them. And then you have to work out what's the Doing them, and then you have to work out what's the appropriate measure of fitness. And whether, of course, the thing we're calling fitness here is an appropriate thing to measure is not a question that I'm going to talk about. We're going to assume that it is, and what's the right way to calculate this? And the bottom point is the crux, is the start. So, if I've got these different number of activities, I can get a certain amount of gain, and it's going to take me a certain amount of time. Is this thing, the expected value? Is this thing, the expected value of gain divided by time, the same thing as this thing, the expected value of gain, divided by the expected value of time? And of course, if you're a mathematics, a mathematician or know a bit of mathematics and know about averaging, you'll know that formally these two things will be different things. But the question is recognising what's the right thing to use, and in fact, under what circumstances can you really think that these two things are in fact? Really, I think that these two things are, in fact, the same. So, here's an example. So, I've got a foraging situation, and scenario one is very easy. I go to patch one, I stay there for eight minutes, I get five units of food. That's it. That's the foraging scenario. Or my patch two is, I can go to patch two, which is empty. I can stay there for three minutes, and so I get nothing. But that leads me on to go into another patch, and my second patch. Another patch and my second patch, so patch three, it tends to be five minutes while I'm there, but I get six units from that. So I get six units from this second patch, but I had to go through this patch two to get to patch three. And so for the first choice, I can work out my expectation in two different ways. Gain divided by time, well, five units, eight minutes. Gain divided by time is five over eight. And there's only one patch I'm going to. So the expected value of the gain is five, the expected value of the time is eight. And so it's five over eight. Is eight. So it's five over eight both times. There's only one thing. Obvious. So the second choice, though, you have two different ways of thinking about it. So I can either think of a gain divided by a time in terms of what so there's the gain divided by the time and if you if you look at the the the the the first one I've got I've got I'm sorry so the first of these cases so I'm there for three These cases, so I'm there for three minutes, and I get nothing, and then the second one, I'm there for six minutes, and for five minutes, I get six, so I'll get six over five, or zero over three, and take an average of those, and I end up with three over five. Or if I just work out the total gain, well, that's that's six, and the total time is eight, and so I get three over four. So these two things are different. And if I was to ask what's the best foraging choice, it's going to depend upon It's going to depend upon which of these I calculate. Because here, if I think about this one, I get 5 over 8, which is bigger than 3 over 5. And in this one, I get 5 over 8, which is less than 3 over 4. So there'd be different choices based upon which of these. And so clearly, these two things are different, and then choice one or choice two is optimal depending upon the way I'm. Upon the way I'm calculating. And of course, something is a bit wrong here because really there should be one optimal way of working out foraging in this kind of simple scenario. And so the fallacy of the averages was confusing these two things. Or the question that was the fallacy of the averages was using this when you should have used this effectively. Or that was the crap. So. So, this dated back to works of the 70s and 80s in particular, works from Charnov and onwards. And there was a claim that many of these papers had actually committed this particular fallacy and made the wrong kind of calculation. And so, interestingly, when we published this paper in 2019, it was good to see that Eric Charnoff was still paying attention to all this kind of stuff, it's a very nice. To all this kind of stuff, because I have a very nice email from him following the publication of the paper that this kind of issue was still being crowned economically visited. We looked at this in a... So the question I'm looking at here is very much a brief part of what we looked at, but it was the core start plant. So the problem is actually, there was no fallacy committed in these earlier papers. It was just the case that the people That the people interpreting it had interpreted it wrongly. And this is a common kind of thing to worry about: when you're interpreting correctly or not. So, the previous property distribution for calculating this expected value of g over t was just the wrong thing to do, as it turned out. So, what I did in that calculation was think of, well, okay, there are two possibilities. I'm either here or here, I get zero or five over six, and so zero times a half plus five. And so 0 times 1 half plus 5 over 6 times 1 half gives me the 5 over 8. But that was a silly thing to do. The right calculation is if you're thinking work about the expected value of the gain over time, the rate of your gain and reward, then you shouldn't be doing it per event, but it should be how long you spend in each patch. So there was actually eight minutes spent in total, and I wasn't spending half my time in each of the two situations. I was spending five-eighths of my time. I'll be spending 5 eighths of my time in the bigger patch and 3 eighths in the other one. And so the probabilities then weren't half and half, but 3 eighths over 5 eighths. And if I do that, then I get the expected value of gain over time is 3 eighths times 0 plus 5 eighths times 6 over 5. And this is 3 quarters, which is the same thing as you would get the other calculation. So all you needed to do to make sure that you were doing the right thing in each case was just adjust your probability distribution to the appropriate one that you should have considered, given the One that you should have considered given the problem that you're doing. And that's the crux of all of the things I'm going to talk about: is when approaching a particular average, make sure that the probability distribution used is the right. So in each case, here, the expected value of gain over time is the same as the expected value of gain in the expected value of time. So the problem of using the wrong one is kind of related to Jameson's inequality. Related to Jensen's inequality, where there's an inequality relating to functions. So the expected value of a function of x is not the same thing as the function of the expected value of x in general. And if you have concave, convex functions, there's a particular order in between the two. And that's what's happening with our comparison of the calculations, depending upon whether the longer times are the ones with the bigger rates. Times are the ones with the bigger rates or not, then the biases are in each one. And so that's the similar kind of thing that's happening in this equation. So if you just look at this in a general case for, well, general for two states, of course, in the paper, it's easy enough to generalise what I'm going to put here to many different activities and put them all together, which we did. And we also can sort of consider things like Holling's. See the things like Hodding's functional, sort of Hodding 2 functional response and so on, and how to write these in this kind of scenario. But let's just look at this, just two cases. So I've got a time interval, T1 and T2, so I spend T1 of my total time doing activity one, and T2 total time doing activity two. So the probability distribution between the two is T1 over T, T2 over T. That's a probability I spend. That's a proportion of time I spend in activity one. I spend in activity one. If you walk over and watch I'm doing at any particular point, that's the problem because you'll find me doing activity one rather than activity two. So the fitness that we're going to do here, this particular calculation, we just divide it into particular two times. And so then the expected value over the time is just, well, it's the proportion, this is the proportion of time I'm in activity one, and this is what I get. This is the rate of gain. So my payoff divided by. My payoff divided by activity that I do. So I spend, however, I'm peeling an orange this time, and then that's the reward of eating the orange. And so then that's the total time I spend activity two. And so then this is my expectation of my reward over that particular time, over a long period of time. So that's one way of calculating it. If I go to the other way, If I go to the other way, I can think about the number of events, but I just need to count these events in the proper way and attribute them the proper way. So if I've got M1 times of doing the first event, M2 of doing the second, then M1 over M capital M, which is the total amount, is the proportion of events of type 1. These are the proportion of events of type 2. But if I'm then going to do the calculation in terms of doing the times, Doing the times properly, then I need to work out how much time I'm spending in each case. And so, this is the total amount of time that I'm spending in the first activity, this is the total in the second. So, the proportion of time I'm spending in activity I is this one. And then I do the calculation, and then starting from the first case, you go from the first calculation, and then you substitute in this time. In this shooting from this time, and it immediately comes up to this one. And so, here, this is just the expectation in terms of the time probability distribution. This is the one in terms of the event probability distribution. And then, this calculation is the same as this one. In general, you just need to make sure you use the right probability distribution. And here's a figure just to illustrate it. So, here's I'm spending one unit of time here, another two units of time, so I'm doing Another two units of time, so I'm doing three activities of type one, I'm doing two activities of type two, but they take three units each, and you do the calculation. I won't labour the point over the figure because I've got a few other things to say. So that was a foraging-related example, but I wanted to talk about more general aspects of these different kinds of concepts, because these kinds of things turn up all over the place. So, averages more widely. Averages more widely. So that was foraging. But in general, how do we do the right measurement? What's the right kind of averaging? So imagine that you're a commuter, or there's a commuting route between a dormitory place and where you commute to. Now, what's the average number of cars on the road? Assuming that in the morning, there's a great big pile of traffic driving into the city, and not much the other way around, and then the other way when you leave. And then the other way, when you leave the city, there's a lot of cars coming out, and not many coming in at the end of the day. So there's two different patterns. Well, what's the average number of cars on the road? Well, if you're the guy who's in charge of road maintenance, then you can just look at from your helicopter or whatever, so empty, sort of light traffic, heavy traffic, average is somewhere in between. Each row gets the average number of traffic. But if you're actually a commuter, that kind of calculation makes no sense. commuter that kind of calculation makes no sense at all because you're always on the full road why am i always why am i always in the traffic in the road with lots of trafficking um when you see a road that's empty next to you well you're part of the traffic you need to weight it by how many cars there are so always you're going to be in the or more often than not you're going to be in the one that's got the that's got most of the traffic so the average traffic density on the road what the what the answer is depends upon whether you on who's asking the question and On who's asking the question and why they're asking it. And that's just the general message. And so we will look at a couple of things related to this kind of table. So let's have a look at the renewal process, because the renewal process is a classic probability scenario, and it relates to the simple scenarios. It's a sequence of events. So each event takes Of events. So each event takes a certain amount of time, and then when that finishes, you throw another one in. So I've got a light bulb, I always keep my light on, so I'm never going to switch it off. Every so often the light bulb breaks and I have to put in another one. Some of them last a short period of time, some of them last a long period of time. How do I measure how long my light bulbs last on average? So what I'm really interested in is a random one from the box, but maybe I come along and measure it wrongly, and I just look at some. It normally and I just look at say, okay, let's check what's the total lifetime of the bulb that I'm currently using, and what's the comparison between those two. So, depending on how you take the samples, then you get different kinds of answers. So, this is, of course, also related to things in ecological questions as well. I mean, of course, this is long, long, long, long known, but of course, if you're just observing species, then you see. Species, then you see big, obvious things and you miss small, hard-to-see things. And if you don't adjust appropriately, you make a mistake in what the balance of the number of individuals are. And this is just a similar kind of thing. So here's our example, my first light bulb. There's two types, one that lasts time one, one that lasts time four. This lasts a quarter of the time, this lasts three quarters of the time. Sorry, that's not right. There's a quarter of the time. There's a quarter of the proportion of V's in the box, there's three quarters of the proportion of V's in the box. So, if you put a random one at the box, you get this one a quarter of the time, this one three-quarters of the time. If you walk along to have a look at the bulb that's in use at any particular time, assuming it's got type one and type two written on the bottom so you can identify it, then the actual proportion of time that you actually see this one is 12 to 13ths of the time. And so you see this one. So, you see this one more often than not. You pick a random thread out of a box, you pick a long one more often than a short one. And so, sampling in that kind of method gives you the wrong thing. This is what's called length bias sampling. So, as I say, it's a common problem in renewable theory. And if you're doing that, so here's a general distribution. So, this is my density function. So, imagine that g of t is the is the P D F of the actual item. The actual items, then the density function of the thing that I pick in this kind of method is actually not proportional to g, it's proportional to g times the length of the thing. So if it lasts twice as long, I'm twice more often to see any particular individual one, and so then f is proportional to g of w. And so then, so this is, and then so then, of course, this is just the expectation, and so this is my new density function of the thing that's in use. I work out. Of the thing that's in use, I work out the expectation of this and I get the formula: not the expected value of t, but the expected value of t squared divided by the expected value of t. And of course, these two things are very different. In fact, this you can write in this form, so the expected value of t plus a bit, and that bit is the variance divided by the expectation. And so the plus a bit can be plus a lot, depending on what the distribution, what's the variability of your items. Of course, if they're all the same, this variance is zero, and these two are the same thing. But the bigger the And these two are the same thing. The bigger the variance, the more the discrepancy, and the more you're biased you can. Of course, you can adjust for this bias as long as you know that it's there and you know what it is. And so given this is a very simple scenario, you can make an accurate adjustment in what it kind of works. So that's what's called length bias sampling. And if I had a prisson renewal process, for instance, so it's So the pr so if it's just Poisson or gamma one, then the item, then the observing, the item that's actually observed is not that, but you can see that it turns out to be gamut. So group sizes are related to this. So light of road traffic, if your group is, so if you're talking about what road am I going to be on, or what's the random individual from a ticket, Or, what's the random individual from a particular group? So, what's a random size of a family? So, if you think about what's the random size of a family of people, how many siblings are there, how many children are there? If you pick a random family, you get one answer. If you ask a random person, of course, you get a different answer, because anyone who's got 10 children, 10 brothers and sisters, there's 10 chances of getting that one kicked out. Similarly, if you're in a, and so this is for a lot of the evolutionary models. Is for a lot of the evolutionary models I talk about, I'm interested in what group a random individual is in. And that's not the same thing as a random group. So you need to pick your group appropriately. So an observer can count the number of groups and take a simple weighted average. And the big groups have more participants. And so instead of having an expectation that's as before, the expectation is this one: expectation of group square divided by the expectation of the group signs. Expectation of the group size. And so, again, this is different, but this is the appropriate one. So, are you telling me I've got out of time? Right, okay, let me quickly then summarise. So, there's also an interesting one in terms of a pure birth process. And so, this is if you have a random individual, if if you're talking about sort of picking a a birth process and a random branch, that's very different to picking a random individual in the population and say what's the rate of the branching process that happens. The rate of the branching process that happened. The rate, the birth rates here was going to be lambda, and so what's the number of randomly chosen, what's the number of events for a randomly chosen individual at the end? Well, maybe it's not going to be that, it's going to be twice as much. And so, following similar kind of branching processes, you're going to kind of make errors. You can estimate the branching rate wrongly in a similar kind of way. Okay, so a very quick discussion. All I'll say is, well, first. All I'll say is: well, firstly, we talk about foraging issues and there was a general issue with how to measure those appropriately. But secondly, when considering averages, what you need to do is to develop the correct perspective. What's the average for who's using it? What's purpose? Find the right probability distribution and you work out your average correctly. Many situations it's just Situations, it's just doing that wrongly that leads to problems. And that's it. Thank you. So our next speaker is Brandon, but while he sets up, if there's a quick question from Mark. I'm going to do the first more comment than a question, if I may. This one is so important for the U.S. News and World Reports, which reports the average number, which reports the average class size, which is relevant for the professor. Size, which is relevant for the professor, but not relevant to the student, because the students are most likely to be in big classes. But the U.S. News of World Reports uses the wrong number there when they evaluate schools for their quality for students. Interesting example. Thank you. I'll follow that one. That was interesting. I guess from like an educational perspective, it's like how do you recommend that you teach? How do you recommend that we teach these? I mean, in probably you learn that the expectation of ratio is not equal to the, this is not equal to the ratio of the expectations, but how do you teach these to like why like I mean thinking about the right probability distribution always makes sense, but how can we understand it? I think, I mean, sorry, so yeah, well one example I think is the family. One example, I think, is the family sizes. You can actually ask them in terms of scenarios that they will know the answer to, or you'll be able to demonstrate quickly what the right answer is. So I did actually ask a coursework question to one of my classes, and out of 165 students, well, I had two more difficult bits related to this at the end. Sorry, I couldn't slide. Sorry, I took the slides. Yeah, definitely. So there was maybe 10%, 20% of it got one of them, but one at the end, which wasn't that much more difficult, one person out of 165 got it right. And this is a probability class. And I hadn't been teaching it. It was just something I throw in at the end as a more difficult thing to see if anyone could work it out. But it's not as appreciated as it is. It is as I would think. All right, with that, thank you.
