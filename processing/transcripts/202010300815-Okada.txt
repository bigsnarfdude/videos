Thanks for coming to this talk. We have as our speaker today Soichi Okada from Nagoya University and he's going to tell us about the proof of birational phylohomomesy for minuscule postets. Okay, thank you. Okay, thanks for the organizers for giving me a chance to speak here. Chance to speak here. So, today I will talk on some proof of the vibrational biohomecy on the minuscule posits. So, this talk is based on our plateplain, which is I put on archive on this April. So, let's start. So first we recall the bilational toggles, which was introduced in Plopland and Einstein and also mentioned in the Thomas talk. Mentioned in the Thomas talk. We started with a poset, finite poset P, and we adjoining extra maximal element one hat and the extra minimal element zero hat. So then we obtain our new posit P hat. Okay, so and we fix the positive real numbers A and V and extend a map F from P to the real numbers. F from P to the real positives to our map from P hat to the real positive by assigning A to the extra maximum element and B to the extra minimum element. Then for each element in the positive P, we can define the variational toggles tau v by these formulas. If x does not equal equal is not equal to v then we assign fx itself if x equal to v the toggle point then the new value is equal to the less of two things the numerator is the sum of the values f has a w where w runs over all elements which is covered by v and the denominator By V and the denominator is F times the sum of all the spokes of Fz, where Z runs over all elements which covers V. All right, so this is a formula, and we try to check several examples. And if P is a 2 by 2, the product of two chains. Chains then the original positive p is the whole element positive here and the p hat is obtained by joining the L hat and one hat here. Then the initial value is set x y z and w capital ones. Then if you apply tau x tau at x then we change the values at x so the a the a y plus z So y plus z divided by oh here is so here is so here is x so here at y so a times x is 1 over y a times x in the denominator so you get here and you then apply tau y and tau y tau z and then tau w you get this value here. Value here. Then, by using the toggles, we can define the birds row motion as a composition of toggles by toggling from top to bottom. So, the birational motion row is composition tau v1, tau v2, and so on, tau vn. Tau V1 up to Vn is any linear extension. This composition is independent. Conversion is independent of the choice of linear extensions. So, this birational toggle and also birational raw motion are the lift of the combinatorial toggles and raw motion on the posit of other ideals with P. So the combinatorial toggle is defined in these ways. So, if P is not in I and you can adjoin V to obtain all the ideas in order ideas in you define here i union b also if b is in i and you can remove we from i you get all the alias and you remove it otherwise we do not nothing on the i also the all i is a communatory toggle is a compression community actually communatory row motion is a Is a combustion of combinatorial orthography, and it can be defined in this way, which is an order idea generated by the minimal element as a complement. All right, here's one example. Also, these are two by two posets. If you start f value x, y, z, w, and you first apply the combinatory rule. Apply the combinatory row motion, then you get here, and then twice, then you get here, and several times, then you get here. If you are four times low applied to F, you obtain the initial value X, Y, Z, and W. So this has should be low here. So in this case, posit P is 2 by 2, then the raw motion has a finite order of 4. Order of four, and so you also can recognize some nice homomessy result here. So, for example, if you multiply the values of x and w's, so there is this row and this row, there's four elements here, four rational functions, and this is four rational functions. Then you multiply these eight rational functions together, then you get a to the fourth times e to the fourth. A to the force times z to the force. This is independent of the choice of initial value, x and y, z w's. And also, you can see that the product of these four values in this row is equal to a square times b square and also for this row here. And also, we can see that the value of f here and of fx here and log fw here you get x times ab over x is equal to ab and similarly you can multiply this value and this value and also this value and this value and also this and that value. So you get AB. This is also independent of the choice of initial values. Initial values. Okay. So the aim of this talk is to generalize this to the minuscule posit in general. So what we recall, I'll review a one-page review of the minuscule posit. So let K be your finite dimension simply ageable over the complex numbers and And for given dominant integral weight lambda, we denote V lambda as a reduced representation with highest lambda, and L lambda is a set of all weights in this representation. This dominant weight lambda is called minuscule if this set of all weights is a single wire group of it. Then, if lambda is mutual, it is known that this L lambda is a distributive lattice. So, we can consider the positive joint reducible here. In this talk, we define it in another way as the sub-posset of the collutralatis. So, again, lambda is should suppose lambda is a minuscule. Suppose lambda is a minuscule, then the minuscule possible corresponding to lambda is defined in this way. So the set of all positive core roots satisfying this condition. So the pairing of the vector check with lambda is equal to one. So then P lambda has a natural positive structure with respect to the collateral ordering. Then Then, and you can show that the old ideal posit of this P lambda is isomorphic to this possess of all weights. This correspondence is given in here. So, then there is natural coloring unique coloring map C from the post unique positive parameter to the set of all simple roots satisfying these conditions. Satisfying these conditions. So if I is an old ideal here, then which maps to the lambda minus the sum of the old colors in I, then you get some weight in here, then this gives a positive isomorphism. All right, so here is a classification of mini-scale poset and with colorings. So this is a type A poset. A type A posit. The any fundamental weights are minuscule plot weight, and this in this case is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. This is case A7 and the minuscule weight pi all is pi 3. Then the coloring is given by the files. So each column here has the same color. And in the type B case, the And in the type B case, the spin node is a minuscule weight, and the corresponding minuscule poset is this triangle. And if type C and is a first node, corresponding vector representation is a minuscule weight, and the corresponding poset is a chain. And if type D, then there are three minuscule weights here. And if the first one First fundamental weight is minuscule weight, and the corresponding positive is called W tail to diamond. And if you take our spin nodes, then you can get obtain an isomorphic mini-secure posit. And type B and the type D here is that you have You have isomorphic positive, but the coloring is different. So, the coloring on the main diagonal are different here. So, in type B case, the main diagonal has the same color, but type D case, there are two colors appearing. And also, E6 and E7 has many skew weights, and but the other Exceptional loot system, the G2 and F4 and E8 has no minuscule weights. All right. So the first result is the following cell. And this is summarized by several people: the green bulk lobby and the musicalobi, and the Eisenstein probe and the mice. So let PVMESQ repository. skill possess uh associated to the mini skill weight lambda and c be a coloring from poset to the set of simple root and in our setting p is a subset of the colluter collude process so p has a natural height function if height is one then it is a simple root and also we have a birational law motion corresponding to Law motion corresponding to a positive real number A and V. So the first result of periodicity, then the raw motion, birational law motion has a finite order equal to the Coxeter number H of the corresponding Rie algebra. And also we have a viscosity here. So if you apply the virational law motion height times, Law motion height times and evaluated V, then you get a reciprocal of AB over F of the W lambda V. So this W lambda is the longest element of the stabilizer. And this correspondence, the Mars-Page application of David Reynolds gives a poset or anti-automorphism of the poset. Posit. And the side result of Pyrohome Messi, each simple root alpha, you multiply these things. So the locate F of V here's V has colour alpha. Then you multiply all these things from K equals L to H minus 1. You get some constant independent choice of So, a choice of initial value F. So, the exponent is a Coxeter number times the pair length of the pi check with W minus W naught lambda, and the exponent V is H times pi check with lambda. Because a pi check is a fundamental covate corresponding to the simple root alpha and W naught is the longest element in the wild group of G. Element is a wire group of G. So the first periodicity was obtained by Greenberg Lobby, except it E7 case. Then but we can use the another variable changed to settle that case E7 by using a computer. As a proof of And the proof of the reciprocity is based on a case-by-case analysis. And the type A was proven by Greenberg-Lobby and also Music and Lobby. And also, Homassi results for type A was proved by Musike-Lobby and Einstein plot. And this Homesi result also appears. Periodicity was in the combinatorial setting proved by rational one in a uniform way. And also, this product phi alpha is by rational left of the refined order ideal cardinality, I intersections P alpha. P alpha is a subset of P with colour alpha. So, we give a proof of sketch here. So, we consider this quantum. consider this quantity psi alpha of f of the phi alpha alpha this quantity behaves nicely more nicely than this phi alpha with respect to the action flow so we consider the p alpha in this case is for example this a CN node here then this is P alpha then we start P node P naught, multiply the value of p naught, and multiply the value of low squared v naught. So there is the language of finance of four, so divided by two is fourth. And this is low cube and row fourth and row six here. So we consider this product. So this psi alpha behaves nicely Psi alpha behaves nicely in this kilometer. So the psi alpha f times psi alpha rho f is equal to in this space. So fair the alpha max and alpha minimum is the color of the maximum and minimum of the minuscule posit and m alpha data is one more cell according to whether the minimal element of this colour alpha is less than Is less than that of a minimum element of data colors and otherwise zero. So this behavior stated, can be stated in uniformly, but the proof is case-by-case analysis. So it is considered the value on the neighborhood of the p-alpha. So we can analyze this the We can analyze this, the structure of the neighborhood and prove the claim in a case-by-case way. So, once this such key lemma is proved, then the rest of the proof is a new form. So, we consider the product of these things. We want to prove that phi tilde alpha is independent of the choice of the F. And we consider generating function, which is an element of the. Actually, which is an element of the Carlton subversion. Then the key layman shows that this equality, and you can show that the computer the action of S alpha on this mutual dive, and which is given in this way. So, by using this formula to compute the action of the Hoxhat element, and we can show that. And we can show that the difference of this mutilated alpha and this guy is fixed by the cockstar element. So, but in general, the cost element has no fixed point other than zero. So, we can conclude that this mutual diox is equal to this element. So, this shows the homomess out. Okay, so the final part we consider is Coxstorm motion, which is the generalization of the flow motion. So again, P is a mini square repository with current P as C. And then for each simple root alpha, we consider the sigma alpha with a composition of the toggles at the element of At the element of colour alpha, then the vibrational cost term motion is a composition of this sigma alpha. So, for example, p is a two by two poset, then this gamma is a birchal coxstone motion. This is just a usual throw motion by toggling from left to right. Yes, first we apply tau y and then. First we apply tau y and then apply tau x and tau w and finally we apply tau z. So this is a flow motion. And also here is an example here. So if you start x y z and w then at the first times after applying the first times gamma at f then you get the initial values. So, also, we have a similar result for the coxset of motion. Let PVMISQ reposit and see the color and the height function, and the gamma be any bilateral coxetermotion. Then we can show that the gamma has an order equal to the costetarm number h. And also, the similar homology. And also, the similar home message is out holds in this cockstar motion case. So the value is the same as the right rational law motion case. And the Einstein proved that omission is out to his holding the type A case. So, our proof of the periodicity is by showing that the gamma is conjugated to the bilateral law machine in the birational toggle group. And the phylohomasy can be shown as follows. Let's consider this product, phi alpha, and the generating function here, mu f here. Then we can compute the can compute the product of this phi alpha and the phi alpha sigma alpha here so this can be in this way so by using this formula we can compute uh compare the action of sigma alpha and the usual simple s alpha on mu f so the difference is here so this is a multiple of alpha so by using this formula we can compute Formula, we can compute the action of this rational cockstar motion and the cockstar element here. So we get this identity and summing up by changing gamma to the gamma k and k line ch is from zero to h minus one, you get this formula. And this shows the bilateral also, a bilateral A birational homometry for the cocceta motion. I finish with some conjecture on the visposity or say half periodicity. Let be a mini-curposite and we decompose pi into the two piece of set subset pi one and pi two such that the each pi. Each pi consists of a pairwise organized simple root. So they can consider the composition of gamma 1 and gamma 2, which corresponding to this composition. Here's pi 1, here, the pi 2 here. And we define this composition, gamma 1, gamma 2, and gamma 1, and gamma 2, gamma 1, and so on, with h factors. So we know that this gamma one times gamma two is the Coxstarter motion, and we know that the Coxstarter motion has the order H, so delta alpha B has order two. So the conjecture is that delta AB is just flipping one, sorry, it should be AB time AB here. B time A B fear. So F over Yota, but Yota is the reversing evolution, which is induced by the longest element of the stabilizer, the lambda. So if we can show this conjecture, then we can derive the periodicity from here. Okay, I will stop here. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. All right, let's thank our speaker. Are there any questions? So this IOTA map you've just defined in the type A case that corresponds to just the antipodal points, right? So this is the antipodal reciprocity analog. Yeah, right, yes. Just a 180-degree rotation. Right, right. So, is that proved in the type A case, or is this conjecture even for type A? It's still a conjecture in type A. All right, any other questions? Yeah, so the way that I like to sometimes think about these homo messy results when they're related to reflection groups is that, for example, in the minuscule case, you're keeping track of maybe like inversions or something like that. And the cocktail element is kind of spinning you around. And so you spend as much time sort of in any segment of space as you do in any other. And this is why you're getting these sorts of homo messies, at least in the At least in the combinatorial realm. And it seems likely that that works at the level also of any parabolic quotient or even for the full group. I suspect that that would work. Is there any way that you could use this sort of geometric thinking to think about it in the birational or the piecewise linear realm? No, I don't know. Not oh no, I don't know. Connection to geometry or something. No. All right, well, any other questions? Yeah, so it seems like your proof was case by case. Do you think there's By case, do you think there's hope for a proof that would use the representation theory more intrinsically? Some more uniform proof, or does that seem far away? Oh, I hope so, but well this, for example, this last conjecture is some single Think resemble to the periodicity or half-periodicity of the Y system proof. So it might be possible to give a uniform way. Another question I had is: Is there any chance that some of this could generalize to decomplete post-sets? Complete post sets? Is there any nice notion of what the files or the same colored elements would be? Yeah, decomplete poset has a notion of colors, so you can define a file, but the order of the bilateral law machine is very Bilational law motion is very large, I think. Ah, I see. So, periodicity is not enough. Even in the case of a communatorial level. Uh-huh. And do you have analogs of the musicer R path formula for these other situations? For iterates. For iterates of birational romotion. Oh, well. No. Type A is your formulas with Mazika, and also type B is obtained by folding osmetry argument. And type D is easy, for the diamond. The type for the exceptional E and E6 and E7. E6 and E7, I do not print out the formula the computer gives us. I see. What software do you use to do these computations? I use Maple. And is there a package in Maple that helps with this particularly? Which seems to be better than the Sage or. No, but just no, no. Just use it, just a computation of the rational function in many variables. I see. I see. That's good to know because Sage chokes on a lot of these things. That's why we didn't do the E7 case. And I guess the last question is: oh no, maybe that was. Yeah. All right. Well, let's thank our speaker again. Yeah, thanks. Our speaker again. Yeah, thanks. See, the second time I could ask even more questions.
