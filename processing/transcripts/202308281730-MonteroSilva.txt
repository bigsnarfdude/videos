Our next speaker will be Pedro Montero. Thank you, Pedro, because I'm at some problems with on the limit and Pedro was correct. Pedro was very kind to help us give his talk today. He will talk about sooth and similar the phase of technical asymbol compactivity in vector groups. So thank you very much. From the Universidad TÃ©cnica Federico Santa Maria Valparaiso. Thank you very much for the introduction and the organizer for inviting me. So it's a very long title. Sorry. So, it's a very long title, sorry. But essentially, I will explain you. I mean, I will give you a motivation about why it's interesting to compactify algebraic groups. So it's the algebraic geometry version of Lie groups, if you want, and how the pets of varieties appear. And of course, then I will speak about two main cases: the smooth case. And since we're here, of course, the singular case is also very important. So this is a joint work with Adrian de Boulot. So this is a joint work with Adrian Dubulo at Dijon and Takashi Kishimoto at Saitama in Tokyo region. So let me start with the historic motivation. It's a very old problem, actually, it's very, very, but very nice, which is a problem by Hirsuruch on his famous paper, what he, I mean, he stated a lot of problems in complex and algebraic geometry the year 54. And one of these problems, which is still Which is still widely open, I will have to say to begin with, is the following. So you fix, say, a smooth projective variety of dimension n. So let me draw this variety. And you are looking for pairs X and Delta, where delta is a bunch of hypersurfaces, which is the boundary device. Which is the boundary divisor. So you remove this closed subset of codimension one, and you get an open subset. And you ask, you want that this subset, this complement, is the finite space. So a n. And so the boundary is delta is, as I said, a bunch of hypersurfaces. It doesn't need to be irreducible. So this is delta. Okay? So it's a very, very naive question. Classify all. Very, very naive question. Classify all possible varieties. Ah, we have an earthquake? Okay. See, the Sadimos actually invoked  No, it's very true.   No, no. No, one, but very much. But in France, one, but very good. And we will be able to do it.  But the problem here, when you explore, the veto because one is what minimal form of compactifier is minimal.  Can you feel the same thing? Well, at least we were just starting. Thank you very much. We continue movement. Okay, so no, thank you. So anyway, I was just at the very beginning, so I think it's not a problem. Think it's not a problem. So let me restart by telling you: okay, that you have this problem by Hirsu Rook, which asks for classifying all possible ways to compactify the finite space. Okay, that's a short way to say it. So you are looking for n-dimensional smooth projective varieties. Very soon, this smooth assumption will be dropped off, of course. But for the very beginning, a smooth projective over the complex numbers also that will disappear. Complex numbers, also that will disappear in a few minutes. And so you have this a finite space inside, and the complement is a bunch of boundary divisors. And we do not assume anything about them. They can be extremely singular, not simple normal crossing. I mean, it can be a mess, actually. And of course, if you are in dimension at say at least two, if you have a point on the boundary, you can blow up this point and get. You can blow up this point and get from one example, get another one. So it is natural to impose some minimality condition. So the minimality condition that we impose or that the Hirsu imposes is that the second Betty number of x is one. Or if you want, since we're all the complex numbers, I mean, this is equivalent to the Picard rank of this variety is one. The rank of the Picard group is the same. Group is the same. So, but Betty, I put Betty too just because it's more topological way to say it. Yeah, compact. It's more projective, yes, all the time. So, yeah, no, no, no, that's actually a very good question. And because in that case, Codaira actually observed that the variety has to be very, I mean, has a very rich geometry. It is a fun variety. So, this is a, I mean, I mean, I don't know. People in algebraic geometry essentially divide this in three types of like different varieties. So where fun varieties which have like a positive curvature, Calabillao varieties which are flat, and hyperbolic varieties of general type, if you want. Most varieties of this type. And here we're interested in fun varieties. interesting in fun of variety so since it's very important and it will be uh i mean it will appear during the whole talk let me just recall that what is fun of variety so x is a fun of if if the anti-canonical divisor is ample so let me just recall you also that this anti-canonical divisor which if you want can be think as a line bundle the the do line bundle the the dual of the the canonical line bundle if you want it's just the determinant of the tangent bundle okay and by ample uh i'm sorry i want it in spanish uh an ample it means that a multiple can be used to embed this variety into a predictive space right so it's a very positive line bundle and these varieties are called funo varieties and codaira observed that in this case the the anti-canonical divisor The anti-canonical divisor is actually a multiple since divisors can be think also as Bayled divisors, otherwise as formal sums of hypersurfaces, right? You can ask what is the anti-canonical divisor as a sum of hypersurface surfaces. And actually, it is a multiple of this boundary device. So, this was an observation by Codaira. So, an example of this situation. So an example of this situation where you can compactify the projective space, sorry, the affine space is the projective space, right? If you take the projective space, you pick your favorite coordinate. This coordinate, when you take it different from zero, gives you an affine space, and the complement is a hyperplane inside the predicted space. So this is the most basic example. And I should also mention that these fun varieties, well, Fan varieties. Well, there is a whole business in order to classify them. Okay, this is like a huge project for many people, I would say. And Kobe Yashenyoshai somehow started also this business. And you can prove that if the anti-canonical divisor has to be ample. But the question is, I mean, this guy, the anti-canonical divisor, lives inside the Picar. General divisor lives inside the Picard group, and you can show that this is actually Z to some power, which is the power is actually the Picard number or the Betty 2 number. So it's, how to say, pre-module over C, finally generated. And so it's a lattice, essentially. So if you have a point with integer coordinates, then it's. point with integer coordinates than the canonical divisor, you can ask yourself, okay, this point may be some multiple of another integer integral point, right? So the quantity that measures how primitive is this point in this lattice is called the Fano index. And you can show that this index is in between one and the dimension of your variety plus one and plus one. And you can show One and you can show that if you are in the case m plus one, then of course there is a very classical example. The anti-canonical divisor of the projective space is m plus one times a hyperplane. It's a very classical computation, and it actually characterizes the projective space. So this is equivalent to x being the predictive space. And similarly, when the final index is n, then actually. index is n then actually x is a quadrat quadric inside pn plus one and there is a classification uh in the in the case where the final index is n minus one and n minus two this case n minus one is by Fujita I will speak about this in a few minutes and n minus two is essentially Mukai okay so and that's it but in practice That's it. But in particular, if you, if you, because it will be important for the rest of the talk, when the dimension is two, when x is a surface, then essentially the first three cases are automatic. I mean, they are covered by just because of dimensional reasons. Okay, so any surface has to be in the first three cases. That's why this last case is called Del Petrovaritis. Del Petzo varieties. And this will appear later because Del Petzo surfaces are the same as Fano surfaces. So Fano is a high-dimensional extension of Del Petzo surfaces. Okay, this is the problem. So as I say, this is a very classical problem for the intimation one. We know all fun overheits is only P1. And you can show. And you can show, for instance, by playing with the fundamental group, that the only possible way to remove points from the sphere and get an affine space is to remove exactly one point. It's a very good exercise of topology. And from the projective space, in general, for higher dimensional ones, you can show that if you have a projective space and you have a hypersurface of degree. And you have a hypersurface of degree D. It's a very good exercise. It's also encouraged that the Picard group of the complement, I don't know if you know the answer, is a finite secret group, Z modulo DZ. So since the complements, you are imposing that this the affine space, the affine space has a trivial Picard group. So D has to be one. So in the case of projective space, the only possible thing that you can remove. The only possible thing that you can remove is actually a hyperpoint. And in dimension three, things get more interesting. And there is a, I mean, a lot of people working on this problem. And the final answer is by essentially Furoshima, who classified the possible ways to compactify the affine space, the three-dimensional affine space, into four varieties: P3, the quadric, B5, and B22. 22. So it's not very important what is V22 because it will disappear in a few minutes, but it's very important for the rest of the talk that I explain to you what is V5. So let me find an eraser over here. So what is V5? Let me tell you. So this is very classical. It's very, I mean, classical algebraic geometry. What is V5? Okay. So you have the Grasmanian of Grasmanian of two-dimensional subspaces on C file, the Grassmannian two file. You can embed this Grammanian into the Pluker embedding, which is a P9. And okay, this guy, the Grasmanian 2.5, is of dimension 6. Okay, you can compute it. And you're inside P9, so you can. And you're inside P9, so you can take a general hyperplane section, you get a five-fold, you take another general hyperplane section, you get a four-fold, and then you take another hyperplane section, and you get a three-fold. And this tree-fold, this guy, is V5. So it's inside this P9, take three general hyperplanes, cut it, and you get a V5. By the way, just for fun, if you want to take another one. For fun, if you want to take another one, but it won't appear in the rest of the talk, but since it's nice, I will tell you. You get a surface, which is the quintic del Petzo surface, which is the blow-up of P2 at four points in general position. If you want to do it, if you want to do it. But I will stop on V5 this time. Okay. And just a very important remark, which is a quite recent result by Kuznitsov, Prohorovan. By Kuznitsov, Prokhorov, and Shramov, is that these four guys are exactly the only phanotrifles with the Picard number one that have infinite many automorphisms. So they are very, very symmetric. These are the most symmetric phenotrifles with Picard one. And actually, it's not a coincidence, as we will see in a few minutes, that these varieties arises from equivariant geometry. So looking at algebra. So, looking at algebraic groups acting in these varieties. And in particular, we will see that P3 and the quadric are actually very special for a reason that I will tell you in like one minute. Okay, so to summarize, the problem of compactifying the final space is actually solved in dimension three. And in dimension four, there are only like two examples of final four-folds compactifying the final space. The final space. And actually, this four false also arises from varieties which have a lot of automorphisms. So, this is very natural to tackle this problem by looking at this kind of funovarieties. And this will give us the main topic of the talk, I will say, how to compactify algebraic groups. Okay, so what's the deal with algebraic groups? Is that we can use We can use not only the projective geometry, the varational geometry, but also we have all the theory of algebraic groups, of Lie theory, if you want, at our disposal. So this is also, I mean, this is very known, well known for the case of the algebraic torus, for instance, C star to some power. As you may know, toric varieties are precisely equivalent compactifications of C star to some power n, right? C star to some power n, right? So this is a very interesting kind of varieties. It's also very useful for study singularities, right? Tauric varieties are very important, and these are examples of geostructures. So a geostructure for a connected linear algebraic group is just let me tell you in a few words, is an algebraic group which acts on a variety x with a dense open orbit. That's essentially. Open orbit. That's essentially the whole point. So, and the stabilizer of the general point is trivial. So, the action is essentially faithful. And at most points, right? So, the whole picture that you have to have in mind is that you have a variety, and inside, as an open subset, you have your algebraic group. For instance, for a toric variety, you have the torus. But since we're looking But since we're looking for equivalent compactifications of the affine space, there is a very natural group to look at, which is the vector group, which is the AN seen as a vector space with the sum. So this is GAN. So good news, okay? We have like a lot of tools from algebraic group theory, from Lie theory, if you want. But the problem is that unlikely the case. Problem is that, unlike the case of toric varieties, where everything is encoded by combinatorics, I don't know if you have seen it, right? The cones, fans, and polytopes, everything is very, very combinatorial, which is super nice. Here, we don't have the same kind of properties, but it's actually a very natural framework for our problem. So, we have to look into these new kind of varieties, the additive analog of Tori varieties. So, let me call them additive varieties for sure. Additive variables for sure. Okay. So the first result concerning the classification, which is very, I think, fun for people from commutative algebra, is the following. Already for the projective space, a lot of interesting things happens. So, Tauric varieties, which we are not in that case, right? But for Tauric varieties, there is essentially a unique way to be Tauric. In other words, if you have a In other words, if you have two torus, big torus, acting on a toric variety, by a change of coordinates, you can move one to another. So all toric structures are equivalent, actually. So you can be toric essentially in a unique way. However, for the vector group, this JN, that's not the case already for the predictive space, because the different structures up to isomorphisms are in correspondence with some crazy. Correspondence with some crazy algebra, commutative local algin algebras of the such that the underlying vector space is of dimension m plus one. And it's actually very concrete, this correspondence due to Hassett and Chinkle, because you have the following. So all of these algebras, since are commutative and finite-dimensional, you can realize them as the quotient of a polynomial ring, but some idea, right? Okay. Right, okay. For example, uh, and and the vector space or the length, if you want, has to be three of three-dimensional, right? So, there are two nice examples. For instance, you take the ideal x, y, you power it to the square, right? And you quotient, and you have a three-dimensional vector space, right? Generated by one, x, and y. But you can do the same thing with this i2, this is another crazy ideal. I2 is another crazy ideal, and you mod out by this ideal and exercise, you get a three-dimensional vector space. So you have two algebras, which are actually different. You can see it from the Hilbert-Samuel series if you want. But now you forget that they're algebras, and you take the projective space associated to this vector space. So there are three dimensionals, so you get P2. Okay, so you get two different P2s. And now you remember that this is. And now you remember that this is an algebra, and you take the exponential. So typically, the exponential of a1x plus a2y is an infinite series, right? If you write it as a series. But since you are on an artin ring, I mean, you are modding out for something such that the equation is finite dimensional. So the series has to stop at some moment. So in other words, the exponential series is actually finite in this case and gives you for free. And gives you for free an additive action because the exponential of the right the properties, the basic properties of the exponential gives you the GA2 action in this case, right? Because the exponential of x plus y is just the product of the exponential. So in other words, if you take a basis, you can express this action in matrices, and these matrices commutes, right? Just because of basic properties of the exponential. You have commuting matrices. Commuting matrices, and you can see it's a very good exercise to that the first idea gives you this action row one, and the second gives you this action row two, which is weird, right? They have some quadratic terms, but it's actually an GA2 action on P2. And they are really different because the first action, if you look at this action, you take the so X. So x2 is essentially the key variable for the first action. If you take x2 equals zero, then you are doing nothing. You have a line, a p1, and observe x0 plus 0, in this case, x1 plus 0. So all the points in this line are fixed. You have infinitely many fixed points. And on the open chart, x2 equals 1, then you have the naive action on A2. And the second action is most... The second action is most different. You have actually three orbits. You can compute it by hand. So the first action is really different from the second one, unlikely the case for Tauric varieties. So you have a bunch of different structures on the predictive space. And actually, Supronenko, not using this language, only using commuting matrices, proved, I mean, classified all possible commuting matrices. And they showed that in the main. And they showed that in dimension 2, P2, these two actions that I just showed you are the only possible ones. And in dimension 3, there are four, in dimension 4, there are 9, in dimension 5, 25 different structures in the practice space. And this is crazy, but from P6 and higher, you have infinitely many ways to be additive. It's crazy because you have a lot of algebras, actually. And that's just because you have a lot of computing matrices. Just because you have a lot of computing matrices. And this was the key ingredient for Schassett and Chinkle to classify all additive smooth final varieties. So now we are not only looking at compactifications of the affine space, but equivariant compactifications of the affine space. So you are taking into account the group structure. Okay? This is the problem now. And the answer is only P3 and the quadric are the... And the quadric are compactified this algebraic group. Let me just show you the previous result. So in general, without this algebraic group action, you have four possible varieties. I'm telling you that the variety V5 and V22 are not equivariant compactifications of the fine space, only compactifications. So you cannot endow these varieties with a Endow these varieties with a GA3 structure. Okay. So let me just sketch the proof because it would be very important to, first of all, extend this result to higher dimensions and to extend it to the singular case, which is our main business today. So the key ingredients. First ingredient is that the boundary divisor, as I draw before, has a bunch of components. Okay, you have a lot of components. A miracle happens. Components, a miracle happens is that actually the Picard number or the VT2 number, if you want, is exactly the number of components that appears. So each component gives you one, how to say, independent topological sub-variety. So you have one for each on the boundary. And the antinicanonical divisor, exactly as in the case of Of Codaira is a multiple of the boundary, but here you can be much more precise. And this is actually really important. The anti-canonical device over here is not only a multiple of the boundary, but is a sum of these boundary components. And this is the most different feature for this kind of varieties: is that this integer is actually at least two. If you know the theory of toric varieties, and you Theory of toric varieties, and you can easily show that for toric varieties, all these numbers are actually equal to one. The anti-canonical divisor is exactly the sum of the boundary device. But in the additive case, the anti-canonical divisor is more positive, more positive. So, if you are in Picard 1, in other words, where you have only one delta, what tells you this? That the Fano index The Fano index is at least two. In other words, if you want to study equivalent compactifications of GA3 in this Furuchima classification, the last case V22 does not appear for free. So you are only reduced, you are reduced to rule out V5. And what's the argument? Let me sketch it for you. The argument is very, very It's very, very, how to say, geometric. And it comes from an idea from Furushima and Nagayama. They were very interested in this kind of treefolds, and they showed that there is a variational map into a quadric. And the whole point is that for the quadric, everything is extremely explicit. And you can actually show that there is a unique way to be equivalent compactification of. Equivalent compactification of the affine space, actually. In other words, you know everything. So if this can be composed at blow-ups and blow downs, since over here this is extremely explicit, you can do the reverse, how to say, you can follow up the blow-ups and blowdowns and convince yourself that you are not blowing up the right thing in order to get a compactification over here. This is the more or less the same. Over here. This is more or less the sketch of the proof. Since on the target, everything is explicit. On the source, you cannot have a GA3 action. I will explain this in higher dimensions, but this is the key tool. Okay? Perfect. So with this in mind, let me show you our results. So how to extend these kind of things for higher dimensions? Kind of things for higher dimensions. The dimension three problem is completely settled. So, in higher dimension, as I just told you, we have classifications for higher index fanovarieties. So, we actually studied all these, I mean, the Mukai varieties and Fujita varieties, but for the sake of this talk, let me focus on the Del Pezzo case. So, as I So, as I just mentioned, there are Fano varieties of dimension, whatever you like, okay? And with the Fano index n minus one. So, since for dimension n equals two, this is kind of for free. And since Fano surfaces are actually called del petso surfaces, Fujita, who studied these varieties, called them del petzo varieties. It's the natural extension of del petso surfaces to higher dimension. Surfaces to higher dimensions. And in the same way as del pizzo surfaces are classified by their degree. So, what is the degree of a del pizzo surface? So, most of them are surfaces which are the blow-up of nine minus d points in p2. So, this is the degree. For instance, here we have four points. Here we have four points, so the degree is actually five. In the same way, we have a classification of these varieties in terms of the degree. And in the same way as the petro surfaces can only have degree between one and eight, look at you cannot blow out more than eight points, right? The same thing happens in higher dimension. This is a very nice result by Fujita, and it actually Uh um it actually can be extended to singular variety. Fujita did a really complete work, studied the whole geometry of this variety, not only in the smooth case. Okay, so we have a clear picture of this kind of varieties. And together with Ba Hua Fu, we studied these varieties and we asked the natural question. So what Bahua Fu, yeah, at the Beijing, I should say. A Beijing, I should say. We ask ourselves which of these varieties, there are a bunch of them, which of them are compactifications of the fine space? And of course, the very first things to look at are equivalent compactifications of the fine space, because we have, besides the geometry, we have also all the algebraic group theory at our disposal. And the answer is very neat. There are two cases. There are two cases if the Picard group is, sorry, the Picard rank is two or higher. These are very explicit varieties. The product of P2 with itself is of dimension four, the blow-up of P3 at one point, and the product of P1 cross P1 cross P1. Very explicit. And by the previous examples, as I told you in the case of the projective space, you can actually say a lot of things. You can classify everything in this case. Because on the projective space, everything is. Because on the projective space, everything is explicit. And the other case is over here at the top of this blackboard. In the case where the second Betty number is one, picar rank one, the only varieties that can appear are hyperplane sections of linear sections to be more precise of the graph manual. So let me write. Me write it so this six-dimensional Grasmanian is an equivalent compactification of the vector group. This five-fold is an equivalent compactification. This four-fold is an equivalent compactification, but as I already tell you, this one is not. And actually, you can show that the surface is not as well. You're just curious. And however, the problem is the following. Okay, this is a very nice result. We're very happy. But the problem is that the technique that we use is based on a purely analytic method. I mean, from complex geometry, using something, some tool which is called the variety of minimal rational tangents. I want to explain what it is, but it's extremely analytic. It's based on some results by Kwang, Jung Muk Kwang. Kwang, Jung Muk Kwang, anyways, and Mok. But these are, how to say, it's very, very transcendental stuff. And because of that, first of all, we cannot use it for other fields than the complex numbers. Secondly, it's crucial for the argument that the variety is smooth. There is no variety of minimal rational tangent for singular varieties. And it's not explicit at all. I mean, we can only show that there is. Can only show that there is an structure, there exists one, but how many, and what, and most important in regard of the Hirsbruck problem, what is the boundary divisor, right? We're only showing that there is a compactification. So, because of this, we decided to revisit the situation, but from another point of view, from the point of view of the minimal model program, of the bar. The minimal model program of the virational geometry. So, in a glimpse, what is the minimal model program? It's a series of results that essentially says the following. If you have a variety, you're looking for another variety which is virational to the original one, which is as simple as possible. And typically, when you do that using, I don't know, blow downs or flips, some stuff from virational geometry. Some stuff from virational geometry, you end up with a way more simple variety. And typically, a way to, how to say, to ensure that you are at the end of the minimal model program is to look at the Picard rank. If the Picard rank is one, then you won. The MMP is finished. You are very happy, and that's it. And that's the kind of the problem because here where the PR rank one, so we are at the end of the minute. Rank one, so we are at the end of the minimal product, minimal model program. So, how to proceed? And for, I mean, there is another, how to say, it's not hidden part of the minimal model program, but it's a like a secondary part of the minimal model program that tells you, which is called, by the way, the Sarkisov program, that tells you, even if you are at the very end of the minimal product program, how these minimal models are related. And this is the tool that we use for study this minimal. Use for the study these minimal varieties in the first line. So, our result is using these techniques. Let me just say to you, these varieties, Grasmanian, rifle, and fourfold, are actually additive in a unique way. There is only one way to be additive for these varieties. And moreover, we can solve the Hirsebruff problem in this case. We can show what. In this case, we can show what is the boundary device. And moreover, and this is the, I think, the funny part, and since why I'm here, is that these techniques, which are from variational geometry, actually allow us to attack the singular case, which wasn't accessible using this transcendental method. And moreover, and this was actually quite surprising for us, with a huge Was a huge surprise for us: is that our techniques are so explicit that actually we can extend our results to any field of characteristic zero. So you can do actually, you can take into account the action of the Galois group, the absolute Galois group in the whole process, and actually have some results over any field of characteristic zero, which is also kind of impressing because. It was kind of impressing because, uh, I mean, I will tell you afterwards what are the results, but essentially, we are able to show that for the Grassmannian, as you may know, and the same as in the same case of the projective space, there are so-called forms of these varieties. For instance, if you're over the reals, you can consider the iconic without points, right? x squared plus y squared plus z squared. Plus z square. Over the reals, you cannot solve this equation, right? On the predicted space. So this is a form of the predicted space, of the predictive line, actually. So after passing through an algebraic closure, the complex numbers, you have points. But over the reals, no points. So this is a form of an algebraic variety. And in the similar way as projective spaces have forms, Lasmanians also have forms. However, we showed, and this was. However, we showed, and this was kind of surprising, that five-folds and fourfolds that appear in this construction, all the forms are trivial. In other words, they have plenty of rational points of their field of the rational numbers, if you want, for example. So let me give you a sketch of the proof. First of all, let me give you some ingredients that will appear both in the smooth and singular case. So the first ingredient is actually really amazing. The first ingredient is actually really amazing, is geometry for the very old classical projective geometry. This is an extremely nice paper by Todd, the same Todd that Todd classes, you know, Rimarov and so on. Todd spent some time studying lines on P4. Lines on P4 is actually the Grasmanian 2.5, right? Projective lines in P4. Lines and before. And he showed that there is an explicit way to describe all the linears of spaces inside this guy, inside the Grassmannium. These are called actually Schubert variety, if you know this terminology. But for the sake of this talk, let me just show the more important ones. So you fix a flag. So you fix a point. You fix a line. Uh you fix a plane and you fix a a volume. More or less good and um and you have three important linear subspaces inside this Rasmian. So, for example, let me let me give you some details on the last one, which people. One, which P3s inside this six-dimensional variety. Let me give you an explicit example. So these varieties are associated to this data. So you fix a point inside the projective space, P4. Remember that the Grassmannian can be seen as lines in P4. And look at this variety, sigma 3, 0 of P0 of. Of P0, oh, I call it P0, which are the lines in P4 passing through this point. Sorry. So let me convince you that this is a P3, okay? So imagine you are in P4 and you have a point here, P. And for the sake of concreteness, imagine that this is the first coordinate, right? First coordinate, right? And you have the orthogonal hyperplane, which is this coordinate equal to zero. This is a B3, right? And there is, of course, if your line passes through this point, there is a unique point in the associated hyperplane. So every line passing through this point corresponds to a point inside this hyperplane, which is P3. So this variety is actually this P3. This P3. And in the same way, you can show, it's a very nice exercise from linear algebra that this sigma 2, 2 and Ï 3, 1 are actually linear P2s inside this six-dimensional guy. And studied a lot of these varieties and the variational geometry of this Grassmannian. And we revisited this work. We revisited this work and we actually, for instance, we studied how the automorphism group act on these guys. And in many cases, in the cases that are interesting for us, the action is actually transitive. You can move these guys as you want. Okay. Okay. So the key idea of Fujita, actually, in order to classify these varieties, was to Was to prove abstractly, you are looking at these final varieties, you prove that there are some linear subspaces inside, and you take some projections. And then you try to reduce the problem to lower dimensions. That's kind of the big picture of the thing. And we did the same thing. However, we need to do that with a group acting. We need to do it in a compatible way with the group. And this is the so-called Blanchard's lemma. Let me want. Blanchard's lemma. Let me don't get into the technical details, but essentially it tells you that if you have a nice morphism X to Y, if you have a good action on X, then you can cook up a unique action on Y in such a way this map is equivalent, is compatible with the action. This is unfortunately unfortunate. This is unfortunately not enough to say that if you are looking at a variety that compactifies your favorite group, for instance, GAN, this is not enough to say that this variety compactifies the same group, because this variety can have lower dimension. This can be four-dimensional, and this two-dimensional. So, there's no way that you can compete something of dimension four. So, do you need to do something? For so, do you need to do something more precise? And this is our first technical result: is that you can, if you are compactifying something upstairs, then actually you're compactifying the same group, but with the right dimension, downstairs. This is the main technical issue. And sorry, the main technical point. And actually, this is a, I mean, for toric varieties, for the algebraic tours, this can be done using the technique of fans. The technique of fans. This is well known. But for the additive case, this was the, I mean, it was new, and it's actually an important gadget to run the minimal model program to simplify varieties and go to a simpler one. So this was an intermediate result that I think is kind of nice to mention. And let me sketch now the proof in the smooth case because it's really, really nice. And there's a lot of classical projective geometry happening. Happening. So let me start with the Grassmanion. So, how to produce an action on the Grassmann? So, you start with your Grasmanian, it's this six-dimensional guy. And as we saw, we have volumes inside. You have this P3 living inside your Grasmanian. So, you can project, and once you have a linear projection, you can. Once you have a linear projection, you can actually compute the dimension of the target, right? Let me. This is just an exercise that every student I think should do is that if you have a variety, sorry, for instance, you have this Grassmann living inside P9, which is the practication of a 10-dimensional vector space, right? If you're looking at a P3, which You're looking at a P3, which is the prioritization of a four-dimensional vector space. Then the projection can be done without using coordinates and is given by the following. It's a good exercise to show that the projection is actually the projectivization of the quotient vector space. So 10 minus 4 is 6. So this is a 6. Six. So this is a six-dimensional vector space, and proactivizing you have P5. So you had amorphisms to P5. And actually, Fujita showed that the image is not anything, it's a quadratic. And so you have this diagram. Let me write it maybe over here. Sorry. So you have the following diagram. So, you have the following diagram. You have the Grasmanian, and you are projecting onto a quadratic inside P5. But this projection is not defined everywhere because, I mean, it's undefined exactly in this P3 that you are using to project. But you can resolve it by blowing up. And you get a well-defined morphism everywhere. And the thing is the following. For quadrics, thing is the following for quadrics the the situation is super clear there is a uh an already old result by charoiko that tells you that on every smooth quadric there is a unique additive structure so the quadrics are are very are extremely explicit they are quadratic forms and you can use this explicit description to actually show that there is a unique way to be additive okay and now the geometry comes and Now, the geometry comes, and this, what is this map C? G twiddle is a six-dimensional guy, and the quadric is a four-dimensional guy. So, the fibers have a dimension two. And actually, you can show that this is a P2 bundle over the quadric. So, and actually, you can show that this is the projectivization of a rank three vector bundle over the quadric. And moreover, this vector bundle is extremely explicit. Explicit is there are some vector bundles that are called the spinner bundles that were studied and introduced by Ottaviani. And this is this vector bundle extended by the trivial line bundle. I won't enter into the details, but so the only thing that you need to keep in mind is that it's extremely explicit. And it's so explicit that you can say essentially everything. You can, how to say, describe the transition functions. Everything is extremely explicit. And in such a way, you can cook up explicit. You can cook up explicitly an action, an explicit JA6 action on G Twiddle. So you can show by hand that G Twiddle is additive. And now you use the gadget that I just told you. You have a variety, G Twiddle, and you have another one, G, and a nice action on the target, sorry, on the source, can be pushed to the target. So you get a structural. Get a structural Tigrass manual. That's the way to produce one action. And the unicity passes through the theory of algebraic groups. So you did all this construction, picking one P3 inside this Grasmanian. But as I told you, you can move these volumes in a transitive way using the automorphism groups. Transitive way using the automorphism group. So the action is transitive. You can pass from one to another using the change of coordinates. And by the Borel fixed point theorem, if you have any action on the Grassmannian of this J6, sorry, by the Borel fixed point theorem, there is a volume which is stable, which is invariant by this action. This is a general theorem for algebraic groups. So since you have something which is So, since you have something which is fixed, you use this volume to project. Why is this important? Because since you are taking something which is fixed by this action, everything can be done in an equivalent way. So, when you're projecting, well, you're going to this quadric, right? We already knew that. But so you have one possible structure, additive structure on the quadric. However, as I told you before, on the quadric, everything is so. On the quadric, everything is so explicit that you have no choices. You have only one possible structure. And using this fact and using once again that the resolution of singularities is also explicit, you can show by hand essentially once again that this action that you produce using this fixed volume is actually unique. Is actually unique. There are no choices because downstairs on the quadric, the structure is unique. However, as I told you, this special volume that you use is actually not special at all, because by change of coordinates, you can go to any volume that you want, because the action of the automorphism groups on these volumes is transitive. And that's it. There is a unique way to be added. Just a small remark, very quickly. Just a small remark very quickly: is that actually using that the Grasmanian is a flag variety, you can explicit this action in coordinates, by the way. You can actually write down equations and I won't do it because it's very big, but you can do it if you want, to convince yourself that you have an affine space inside, which is nice to get your hands dirty. And this is the nice part. This is the new part. We did all this. We did all this business taking a volume, a V4. But if you take a P2 inside, this nice Schubert varieties, if you want, this is the projectivization of a three-dimensional vector space. And once again, the quotient is a seven-dimensional vector space. You projectivize and you get into P6. And actually, right now, And actually, right now, you get a surjective map onto P6, and the blowing up of the plane gives you this diagram, this resolution of this map. It's very explicit, and this is amazing because you can compute everything. You can actually compute that on P6 on the right, the way to go to the Grasmanian is actually by blowing up something. Is actually by blowing up something which is amazing. Is the following. If you remember your first course in algebraic geometry, you learned about the segregated embedding. You take P1 cross P2, the segregated embedding gives you an embedding on P5, which is actually the linear span of this variety inside P6. So this is the, and this P5, which is given by the second variant, is the boundary divisor for the GA's. Boundary divisor for the GA6 action here. So everything is extremely explicit. And a surprising fact is that among all the structures on P6, I told you there are infinitely many structures. This is the most naive one, the toric one. In other words, pick one variable, your favorite variable, and use this variable to give the naive additive action that I showed you in the case of P2. Remember when we spoke about. Remember when we spoke about this line with all the points fixed? The same thing, but in more variables. So it's extremely explicit, and this is actually the corresponding action on P6. And for the lower dimensional cases, just take hyperplane sections of these Sarkisov links. Ah, these guys, by the way, are called Sarkisov links. And this is one of the main gadgets of the Sarkisov program. So let me just do the first one. So you're on the One, so you are on the Grasmanian, you go to P6 and you are blowing up P1 cross P2. This is a treefold. You take the hyperplane and you get a surface. Actually, this treefold you can compute it is of degree 3 inside P5. And now you get a surface of degree 3 inside P4, and you can show that this F1, the blow-up of P2 at one point. And you do it once again, and now you're not going. And now you're not going into P4 P5, sorry, you're going onto P4. And the hyperplane section of this surface is a curve inside P3 and it's the twisted cubic, which is also a very classical object from classical projective geometry. By the way, as a fun fact, Andre Veil, in an anonymous paper, he didn't put his name on it, classified all varieties, projective varieties. Uh, varieties projective varieties of degree three, which are not hypersurfaces, and that they are precisely p1 cross p2 inside p5, f1 inside p4, and the twisted cube. They are exactly this one, these varieties, and they arise in this situation. It's very just a funny coincidence. I think so. And sorry, and the similar case to finish. So, in this case, as I told you, we used a lot of tools. Told you, we use a lot of tools from the minimal model program. Okay, this is our main tool to do the computations. And in the minimal model program, as I told you, you pick your favorite variety and you start to do these modifications to end up with something which is way simpler. But on the way, you have to produce singularities. It's impossible to avoid singularities. And the singularities arising from the minimal model program are these varieties over here. Varieties over here are canonical and terminal singularities, among others. So these are defined in the following way. You take your favorite variety, such a way the canonical divisor is Q-Cartier, a multiple is a Cartier divisor, and you pick a resolution of singularities, Y. So you can compare the divisors on the singular variety and on the resolution, the canonical divisors, and the And you have some exceptional varieties appearing, exceptional divisors, but there are some weights in front of them, which are called the discrepancies of the divisors. And if the discrepancies are strictly positive, you say that the variety is terminal. If the discrepancies are non-negative, you say that the singularities are canonical. The singularities are canonical. This is a very common slang from the minimal model program, but the two important things is that for terminal treefolds, you have isolated singularities. You have finally many singularities. And for canonical surfaces, you have exactly Gorenstein singularities. What are Gorenstein singularities? Are Coin-Macaulay singularities and such that the canonical divisor is Cartier? In other words, this multiple that you're In other words, this multiple that you are taking about is actually one, m equals to one, if you want. It's already Cartier. And it's amazing that they coincide with very classical singularities, with ADE singularities, Duval singularities. For instance, you have the ordinary double points. It's a subclass of these canonical singularities. And we use this classification. This classification to classify, to study the case of surfaces. So, very quickly, the pets of surfaces with canonical singularities were classified by Dual, actually. And very recently, Derentan and Lurgan studied which of them are additive. But once again, they didn't touch the problem of unicity of the additivity. The additivity in how many ways they can be additive. So, this is what we actually did in this case using a very recent result by Ivan Chen Sheltsov and Yuri Prokhorov. They actually gave projective models of these guys. So, these are very abstract guys, but you can write down equations. So, like this, you have a very explicit equation of this surface. And using these equations, we were able to study the variational geometry and produce an Geometry, I produce an explicit contraction onto P2. And once again, let me recall you that on P2, everything is explicit. You can show up the two possible additive structures with equations. So you follow up this blow-up and you show that, for instance, in this case of this explicit surface inside P2 plus P1, only one of the two possible structures lift to the minimal resolution. Minimal resolution, and therefore, only one can appear on this XL. And similarly, in the other case where is one singularity of state A4, you can show that both of them actually lift. So both of them goes to the singular one. This is essentially the tool that we used. And to finish, let me sketch the case of tree faults and the last five minutes. So for tree faults, So, for tree faults, we have actually a very nice result which I think is interesting by its own, which is concerning vector bundles. Everyone loves vector bundles, right? So we show that if you have a simple vector bundle, in other words, the only endomorphisms between the vector bundle E and itself is the homotasis, right? Only lambda times the identity, right? Like the chorus level. For this kind of vector bundles, we show that the variety associated to it is never additive. And this is a consequence by this refinement of the Planchard's lemma that I told you before. And this is actually useful because Prokhorov classified all three faults, all V5, which are terminal but not smooth. So the interesting case because we are writing. The interesting case because we already know that for the smooth case, this guy is not additive. So, what happened in the singular case? So, it showed the proclub showed that there are essentially three types of trifles, and they are classified by looking at the rank of the class group. So, the linearly independent Vale divisor, not Cartier, but Veil divisors. And there are essentially three possibilities. And actually, he showed that the variety has only rational double points. The variety has only rational double points, and the number of singularities is this rank minus one. So you can only have one singularity, two singularities, or three singularities, and they are all nodes. And in the case of one and two singularities, you can show that there is a virational morphism, which is a small, in other words, the seceptional locus, the thing that where this map is not an isomorphism, is not. This map is not an isomorphism, it's not a divisor, but it is a curve actually. In this case, that means small, and it's a Q factorization. It means that X hat, on X hat, every V divisor has a multiple, which is Cartier. Okay, so this is like a, it's not a dissimilarization, but it's a nice property that you like to have in order to use intersection theory, for instance. So let me just tell you that this X hat is. This X hat is nicer than X. Okay? And using this and this result before, we can show that X hat is actually the predictivization of a stable vector bundle. But by the general theory of vector bundles, stable are simple. So we are done. The predictivization of a simple vector bundle is never additive. And in the case of two singularities, x x hat is the blow up of the projectivization of the tangent bundle of P two. activization of the tangent bundle of p2. And once again, if x hat has was additive, then using Blanchard's lemma, if x hat is additive, then said is additive, but you can show that the tangent bundle of p2 is simple by hand. So it's not the case. So we are left to analyze three singularities. And once again, and let me just show you and finish with this. As I told you, With this, as I told you, but in dimension six, we're blowing up a threefold, right? In dimension four, we're blowing up a surface, and dimension, sorry, in dimension five, a surface, in dimension five, four, a curve, a degree three curve, the twisted cubic. So if you take another hyperplane section, what do you get? Three points. However, if you do the blow up and then the blowdown, you arrive to... Up and then the blowdown, you arrive to something which is singular. And this is the guy that we got at the very end. The sorry, oops, the X is essentially the same as the blowout, I mean, can be related to the blowout of P3 at three points. And once again, on the projective space, everything explicit on coordinates, and we are done. And well, just in the five last 40 seconds, let me just tell you that everything. That everything that we used to prove these explicit links, to produce these links, is so explicit that we can actually show that all these singular guys, all these treefolds, have plenty of rational points. Actually have a, if you're looking k to be the field of rational numbers, q, you have actually a q to the power 3, a finite space over q inside. So you have. Space over q inside. So you have a lot, a lot of solutions. And this is amazing because for the smooth case V5, there are forms of this tree for V5 without solutions, like the conic without points. And this is not happening in the singular case. And that's it. Thank you. Rational coefficients very good question. Yes, actually, yes. And yeah, they're explicitly obtained by using the pre-current. Using the Pluker embedding of this grass manion, you can cook up actually equations for all of these varieties. And so, I mean, it's not evident at all that once you have the equations, you can show that there is a solution. It's actually quite hard because mostly quadrics, right? Because the Plugin Betics is given by quadrics. So it's not that easy to say that there is a solution. But a posterior, using all this by rational geometry, you had a lot of them. You had a lot of them, but there are, yeah, they have interior coefficients, by the way. Ah, this is a really nice question. Actually, the problem of characteristic P, which is things that for the projective space. If you want to study additive structures on the projective space, you have to study the exponential. The exponential, and that's the point. You have to divide by p factorial at some point, maybe. I don't know. It's actually a very nice question. I don't know the answer. It would be very interesting to create this space and grad ASIC P. Already P2, I don't know. That's the whole problem.   Then the number of solutions should be encoded by the geometry of the variety. By the geometry of the variety, by purely algebraic geometric terms. And it is well known, I mean, it is known, it's a result by Chamberloir and Schinkel, that for additive varieties, this conjecture is okay. On the other hand, it's also known that for Tauric varieties, it's okay. So actually, our initial motivation was to produce new examples, non-Tauric examples for this conjecture. But at the end, at least in the higher Picard ranking. At least in the higher PCR rank, they're all Tauric, which is very sad. But it's just a coincidence. I don't really know why they are Tauric. Yeah. Great. So now, using this slide. So giving this correspondence, are there algebraic proofs of all the results you were mentioning? For instance, classifying local artlin algebras. This is very actually, yeah. So actually, there is a So actually, there is a well, the original proof is by Supronenko. But only on the algebraically closed case, where the field is algebraically closed. However, there is a very recent classification by Punen, I think, for these algebras in the for k non-algebraically closed. But we didn't pass through this classification. But we didn't pass through this classification actually. But it should be possible, I think, to use this purely algebraic thing to do maybe the same thing. But we use it purely geometric method at this point. Thank you. Thank you. More questions online? Do we have no Well, thanks again to Pedro and for this energy, contagious energy. And thank you, everyone, for today's presentation. Tomorrow we
