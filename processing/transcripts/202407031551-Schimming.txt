That's a great speaker. The introduction done and thank you to the organizers for inviting me to talk about my work. So and also thank you to the previous two speakers for introducing, doing a really nice job of introducing the system that I'm going to be talking about some of our theoretical work on. So I'm going to be talking about active pneumatics, but particularly But particularly the topological defects in these systems. And so, as you saw in the previous two talks, oh, sorry, I should mention my collaborators. So, Jorge Vaneles was my PhD advisor at the University of Minnesota. He worked with me on the theoretical formalism that I'm going to talk about in the first part of the talk. And then Charles and Cynthia Reichardt are my mentors at Los Alamos. Reichardt are my mentors at Los Alamos, and their expertise in particle models and non-equilibrium systems has helped a lot with this with the specific results of this project. So yeah, as I was saying, as we saw in the previous two talks, active pneumatics are interesting because one of their primary phenomenological features is the nucleation of topological defects. The nucleation of topological defects. And the dynamics of these topological defects is intrinsically connected to the dynamics of acyphymatics. So, again, just to remind you all of what one of these systems looked like, this is a microtubule kinesin system. The black dots here are all topological defects and they can be tracked as they were in this movie here. The dynamics of defects in these systems is important for our. It is important for our applications and understanding of things like optimal mixing, microfluidic transport, colloidal assembly, and morphogenesis, among others. And the primary picture that we've had for the motion of topological defects is that plus one-half winding defects are motile and Are motile and minus one-half winding defects are passive. And in previous sort of particle models of these systems, the plus one-half defects have been treated as essentially active Brownian particles. This means that they are self-propelled and they just move towards their comet-shaped head with a stochastic updating of the The orientation with some interaction between the defects. While this isn't complete, this isn't, I'm not going to say that this is the wrong picture, but it's sort of incomplete in the sense that there is a coupling between the orientation of these defects and also a hydrodynamic coupling between the flows that these defects. Between the flows that these defects produce, which this active Brownian picture doesn't take into account. So what I want to do is essentially create a model that takes these features into account and with the goal of eventually getting to the point where we can just model the motion of topological defects without worrying. Of topological defects without worrying about the structure of the entire pneumatic. So we can go to a picture like this. So to give you an overview of what I'll be talking about, first I want to review the theory behind the topological defect kinematics, which I'm going to be using for the model. This is, the name for it is the Helper and Metro. This is, the name for it is the Helper and Mesenko formalism. And it actually relates to topological defect, it gives you topological defect motion for even passive pneumatics. So it doesn't have to be applied to just active pneumatics. Then I'll talk about the analytical approximations used to get our analytical equations of motion. Of motion. And I'll show you our results for the sort of simplest, non-trivial case, which is two topological defects. And then finally, in the last couple of slides, I'll talk about our efforts to scale this up for a full particle model of these topological decreases. So, if there are any questions throughout the talk, please interrupt me as I'm going through questions. Okay. So the Helper and Mazenko formalism for pneumatic defect kinematics takes advantage of two properties of really any broken symmetry phrase. So the first that we take advantage of is that the location of the defects corresponds to zeros of the order parameter. In this case I'm talking about the liquid crystal tensor order parameter. A liquid crystal tensor order parameter. But it can be a continuum order parameter for any local symmetry phase. And keeping this correspondence in mind, the first thing we do is we write down our topological defect density, which is just the sum of a delta function over defect locations, which are weighted by the topological charge. So m here is either going to be plus one half or minus one half, the one number. Half or minus the one number. Because of this correspondence between zeros of the order parameter and defect locations, we can rewrite this in terms of a delta function over the order parameter itself rather than delta functions over defect locations. And because we are transforming from essentially real space to order parameter space here, there is a scalar. A scalar field that comes along for the ride that's related to the real space-to-order parameter space Jacobian. And importantly, this scalar field can be written in terms of the order parameter itself. You written in terms of Q. So the second. Any questions? Okay. Sorry. Yeah. This is a 2D. This is 2D, yes. What I'm. What I'm talking about can be generalized to 3D as well. We've done that. But to keep things simple, I'm going to just do D. Thanks. Okay, just to be clear. So for instance, if you had a complex scalar field, psi, you could say, I want the magnitude of psi in the mantra. And then you would say, oh, the defects are wherever delta of psi is proportional to. Delta psi is proportional, and then you have to put this determinant. Yep, that's exactly right. Actually, the complex order parameter is what Zenko applied this to for like superfluid vortices and superconducting vortices. Good. Okay, so the second sort of feature that we take advantage of is the conservation of topological charge. So we take a time derivative of everything here. Everything here. And the time derivative of the density has to be related to the flux of some topological current because of conservation of topological charge. It turns out that if you take a time derivative of this scalar field D, it also can be related to the flux of a current. And this current can be written again in terms of the order. Written again in terms of the order parameter q. So to get the velocities of defects, right, you take a time derivative of our defect density, that's going to give you velocities of defects because taking time derivatives of the positions. And you relate it to this flux, which is just whether we're talking about signed topological charge or number of defects. This is. This is sine of topological charge in this case. But then you're assuming something about a first line with regard to the sine of topological charge, right? Which line? Which one? The remote team line. Yeah. Well, the M is the topological charge. Oh, this one. Yeah. Yeah, so this D will be negative if it's a negative defect and positive. It's a negative defect and a positive defect. That's a positive defect. Yeah, yeah. Right, so once we relate these two things and you do some manipulations, you end up with a velocity for the topological defect in terms of derivatives of the order parameters. So this looks kind of like an alphabet soup with all of the tensor indices. The epsilons here are. The epsilons here are Learning Turtas or anti-symmetric tensors in two dimensions. And this is supposed to be the ith component to the velocity. So you can track all of the indices if you want. As a couple of notes here, this derivative is a time derivative. So this t is not a tensor index, it's time. The other indices on the derivatives are spatial. The derivatives are spatial derivatives. The second feature of this is that you only compute this at the location of the defect core. So we don't have to worry about taking these derivatives away from the defect core. That's going to be a very useful fact. A couple of other notes on this equation. This equation that I've written is exact in the sense that if you know how to take all of these derivatives exactly, then Take all of these derivatives exactly, then this is the velocity of the defects. This is a useful fact, say, if you have a continuum simulation or potentially even, yeah. The velocity of defects that we have at some specific location, cumulative velocity, the velocity of a well, it's the velocity of a defect at location or not. So you have. So you have a defect at R0, and if you want to, yeah, then you take all these derivatives at that location. It comes from the Caldera equation. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. But the fact that this is exact can be useful in continuum simulations where you have these fields and you want to, say, measure the velocity defects. I use this in analyzing my continuum simulations. Also, this can be generalized to three-dimensional disclinations. It's a bit harder to generalize, and the equations are a little bit messier. But I'm only going to be talking about 2D today, but if you're interested in 3D, then talk to me afterward. I can show you how this works. Okay, so of course, to get analytical predictions, we need to know how to take these derivatives. And so for that, we need to make some assumptions, and we need to make approximation. Assumptions and we need to make approximations as well. So the first assumption we're going to make is how the Q tensor evolves in time. And for that, we're going to assume the Barris-Edwards equations for the time evolution of Q. This includes a term for advection. So U is now the flow field applied to the liquid crystal. S is a tensor that. S is a tensor that relates the rotation of the pneumatic to shear flows, and then the variation of a free energy is just thermodynamic or elastic force. Now, Dan, I think, showed this equation on Monday. It can get very complicated. Luckily, for defect motion, there are only a few terms that actually matter because Q goes to zero at the location of the defect port, and we're only computing it at the Location of the defect core, and we're only computing it at the equation. So, for the terms that I'm going to use for the model, the only terms that matter are the proportionality of s to the strain rate tensor, where lambda is a parameter that is just the coupling parameter to the strain rate tensor. And then the elastic force is the, where we're assuming a one constant elastic for any. Elastic free energy. It doesn't matter which bulk free energy you use, so you can use Landovijin, you can use Magza. All of those will go to zero. Okay. So the other thing we need to know is how do we take spatial derivatives of Q? And to do that, we make some approximations. The first is we use a linear core approximation. So here I'm showing the scalar order parameter or the magnitude of Q as a function of distance from the core. A function of the distance from the core. Here, the black line is computed from energy minimization. The dotted line is our linear core approximation. Of course, since we're taking the derivative only at the core of the defect, we only care that it matches up there. And then the second approximation we make is what the director field looks like in the presence of other defects. In the presence of other defects. And what we assume is that if we have a defect and we add another defect to the system, that this other defect rotates the director field by some small amount proportional to the azimuthal angle facing that defect. That sort of makes sense. And we just take this linear perturbation. Okay. Okay. So, with these are the only approximations we need to get analytical results. If there's no flow field, we get that the velocity of defects is just the Coulomb interaction, which is what we expect. So oppositely charged defects will attract one another, here the black lines are the velocity we predict, whereas like-signed defects will repel one another. If there is an arbitrary If there is an arbitrary flow field, there are actually two more terms for the velocity. The first is just simple advection by the velocity. Again, we expect this, so it's good that the model spits this out. So here, if you have some flow field in some direction, both plus and minus defects just get affected by the flow field. The other term is more complicated and relates to interactions with the shear flow. In this case, if you have some If you have some shear, well, here, let me go through it. It's the E is a vectorized form of the strain rate tensor, and P is the orientation of the defect. So shown here, it's the red vectors for both of these plus and minus defects. What's interesting about this term is that it actually depends on the charge of the defect. So the y-component here. So, the y component here, notice there's an m here for the charge of the defect. The y component will change depending on whether or not it's a plus one half or minus one half. Okay, so all of this was for an arbitrary flow, and all of this actually applies to passive pneumatics as well. Now I'm going to make the jump to active pneumatics and assume that. And assume that the flow field in the active pneumatic comes from the topological difference. And what we're going to use are solutions to the Stokes equation with an active force. So there are a couple parameters in this equation. The first is the hydrodynamic screening length, which is the ratio of viscosity to substrate friction. And then the second parameter is the activity, which is the strength of the active forces. And so this divergence of Q is the active stress that makes this an active atom. So there was a really nice paper by Jonas Ronig and collaborators, which actually found analytical solutions to this for single defects. So just to show you what these flow fields look like, for a plus one. For a plus one-half defect, you get a dipolar flow, which is maximal at the core of the defect. And for a minus one-half defect, you get a six-fold vortex structure, which it's hard to see in this picture, but it goes to zero at the core of the defect. And so, this is where that idea behind motile plus one-half defects and passive. Passive minus one-half defects come from. But of course, the flows that occur away from the defects are important for their interactions. Because, for example, the flows away from the plus one-half defect will invect the minus one-half defect, won't just interact the equivalent function. And one nice feature about these solutions is that at long distances from the core, From the core, mainly when the distance is much, much larger than the hydrodynamic screening length, the magnitude of the flow just goes like one over a half, which is the same order of magnitude as the Coulomb force. So when they're very far apart, you sort of just update the Coulomb direction. Although the angular dependences are still different. Okay. So any So any any questions so far? Yeah. So there's this classic picture from Luca Giolmi's 2015 paper with sort of the same symmetry as this, but some quantitative differences maybe. So how did they sound in my comparison? So this is, I don't remember if there were boundary conditions and what could show me this. Yeah. This is for an infinite system. So that's, so these don't quite So, these don't close on themselves. Yeah, so that's a good point. I'm going to be assuming for now, because I haven't worked it out yet, that these will be an infinite system. But working on implement ways to implement copies for Q, if I remember correctly, there is a copy with the voltage here. In the equation for Q, for the time derivative of Q, yes, there's a coupling with the vorticity. So that term goes to zero when you plug it into the velocity equation for the defects. So it doesn't contribute to the velocity of the defects. Yeah. But yeah, that that is there for the That is there for the okay, so we're going to take advantage of now the fact that Stokes' equation is linear. So when we have a lot of these defects, what we're going to do is just add up, say if we want the velocity of this defect, we add up the contribution now from each one. So the total velocity of the Jake defect in the system is the sum of the Coulomb interaction. Of the Coulomb interaction, the self-advection if it's a plus one-half defect, advection from all the other defects, and then this pretty complicated shear flow interaction, but again, it's just the sum of all of the shear flows from all of the other defects in the system. So there's another assumption we're going to make, and that is that the orientation of these defects is, or the structure of the director, is given by the energy minimizing quality. Given by the energy minimizing quasi-static solution, which makes this a little bit simpler and more analytically tractable. But this means that the defect orientations are determined by their positions up to some global phase, which you can think of as the orientation of the liquid crystal at infinity in this case. So, this is an assumption we're going to make. Okay. Okay. So let me start now talking about what we find for just interactions between two defects. So these are two defects in an infinite system. It's sort of the first non-trivial case, right? So now, given a global phase, we can actually write down what this orientation is. We can actually write down what this orientation vector is. So for one defect, it's cosine 2 phi sine 2 phi. For the other defect, it will always be minus this if you only have two defects in the system. The velocity is pretty complicated, so I'm not going to go through it in detail. The functions beta relate to the advection from one defect interacting with another, and the functions chi interact. And the functions chi have to do with the shear flow interaction from one defect to another. But what we can do, given this velocity, is integrate this in time and get trajectories for what we expect. And what we find is that two plus one-half defects, if they're isolated, will rotate around one another. However, there are two sort of cases. One is if this global One is if this global phase is greater than pi over 4, so this means that the two defect comet heads are sort of pointing away from one another. Here I'm going to show a movie where the dots represent the topological defects, and I apologize that the lines here represent their orientation vectors, but they're small unless I had to zoom out. And you'll see why I had to zoom out. In this case, they rotate around one another, but they get farther and farther apart from one another. And so in an infinite system, And so, in an infinite system, they'll end up just going away. However, if the global phase is less than pi over 4, now the comet heads are sort of pointing towards each other, what we find is that the topological defects will rotate around one another, but they'll get closer to one another. And actually, they will find some, if there's only two defects in the system, they will find some stable distance between the two. Distance between the two. And this stable distance between the two actually depends on the activity. And we can calculate that from the velocity, what this distance should be. So here, as a function of activity, I'm plotting the stable distance between two plus one half defects. Of course, at zero activity, this goes to infinity because they just want to repel. And the And by the way, the blue line is the analytically calculated distance. We compared this to a few continuum simulations where we can find two defects. There's some issues with comparing this to continuum simulations, one of which is that we have to put a boundary on the continuum simulation, and that affects the flows in the system. The other is that if the activity gets too high in the continuum simulation, If the activity gets too high in the continuum simulation, more defects will start to nucleate. And that then we can't compare. But we do find the same trend for the confined simulations. And this, even though we're looking at just the case of two plus one-half defects, we actually find in continuum simulations these bound states appearing at least. At least from time to time. So, this is a time snapshot of a continuum simulation of an actinematic. The color here is the scalar order parameter. So, the blue dots are topological defects. And the white lines are the director. And I've highlighted several states where two plus one half defects tend to rotate around one another. In the continuum simulation, if the activity is high enough, they'll actually merge with. Activities high enough, they'll actually merge with one another. They don't always merge with one another at lower activities, but we find these bound states they don't stay forever because of interaction with other defects. This was also observed in recent experiments done at Argonne in an acoustically driven active pneumatic with an acoustically actuated lyotropic harmonic liquid crystal. And what they found. And what they found is similar bound states where they had these vortices where two plus one-half defects rotated around one another. So these are time snapshots from the experiment. So this is just to say that even though we're looking at a much simpler case, we can get some insight into these states that you can see in continuum simulations and its balance. Yeah. The relative orientations are different. Right, aren't they? Right, aren't they from your situation? Yeah. Sort of pushing in toward each other? Yeah, that's a good point. I didn't look at that. I don't know if it's contractile, maybe. Yeah, that's a good point. I need to look at that or ask them about it. Yeah, I didn't look at the orientations of there. I know measuring the director field is not. Not exact in their experiment, or it was like a little bit tricky at these points in particular. But yeah, that's a good point. Other questions? Yeah. So how opposed to these bound states to changing the tumbling parameter? So I thought that. I thought the tumbling parameter was important for them. And it turns out, I think, so in the continuum simulations, the tumbling parameter seems to be pretty important. For just two defects in the analytical model, it is not. I haven't looked at it in detail for many more defects. So that's something we're still trying to compare. But that's a that's a good question. Compare, but that's a that's a good question. So, is this like a usual um like sort of parameter set myself? Oh, just because yeah, I was just thinking of that paper. Um, I think I told you about it before, uh, by Christian Tyson, quite something parameter effects and analysis. I think it was quite like a small regime of effective tokens. Um so I just wondered if that was, I mean it was a different simulation method. I mean, it was a different simulation method. Yeah, I'm not sure if I'd have to look at the paper again to see if how close the parameters were. This was at a pretty high activity for the continuum simulation. Also, there are periodic boundary conditions, so I won't show it. Okay, other questions? Okay, so now let me show you what. Now, let me show you what happens with 2 minus 1F defects. So, again, really messy equations for the velocity, but they are somewhat similar for the positive, two positive one-half defects. We find that if you set the global phase exactly to zero, so it's this situation here where the two minus one-half defects are sort of back to back, the hydrodynamic and Coulomb interactions compete. So, the hydrodynamic interactions want to The hydrodynamic interactions want to pull them closer, while the Coulomb interactions want to repel them. And again, we can measure a distance that they want to sort of sit at, where the velocity equals zero as a function of input activity. We did compare this to some confined continuum simulations. For the minus one-half defect, it seemed to be much harder. I think because the flow I think because the flows that are generated by minus one-half defects are much smaller, so the boundaries have a much larger impact. And also, we found that even at lower activities for this geometry, more defects would nucleate. We're still trying to find a good way to, like a good set of parameters to measure this in continuum. But we also find But we also find that this attraction is dynamically unstable in the sense that if this angle is slightly off of zero, then they won't stabilize. So here's an animation where I've set the global phase to just slightly above zero, and they begin to attract, but because they move slightly off of each other and rotate. Slightly off of each other and rotate, they eventually will pull away and start to push away forever. Okay. Yeah. Did you see any of that behavior without activity? Well, no, without activity, they would just repel. Yeah. So there's no orientation dependent dynamics without activity, yeah. Okay. So then the final case that we looked at is plus one half and minus one half defects. In this case, the interaction is non-reciprocal, right? Because in the plus one half, the equation for the velocity for the minus one half can't just be minus the equation for the velocity of the plus one half, because there's self-propulsion and the flow fields are different that are produced by each of them. Are produced by each of them. So, just an interesting fact: what we find in general is that plus one-half defects can get deflected by minus one-half defects. So, here's an interaction where the plus one-half defect looked like it's going to annihilate the minus one-half defect, but then deflects. And so, of course, if there was no activity, we would just expect them to annihilate. One of the things we can To annihilate. One of the things we can measure or compute is this critical phase between them. You can almost think of it like an impact parameter for the where if the phase is less than whatever this is, it depends on activity, the two defects will annihilate. And if the phase is greater than this, then it will deflect. And this is much smaller as the activity gets larger. As the activity gets larger, so you expect a lot more deflections for larger activity. This also will depend on the initial distance that we choose, which I'm only just picked a distance here to compute this, but we're working on characterizing it for all distances. Any questions? Was there any continuum simulations for that? We I did. And I just tried them last week, and they didn't work as I thought they would. So I'm not including that here. But yeah. That's another thing that I have to do. Yeah. I don't know what I'm going to do to say can we have the nucleation on the pair? Oh, nucleation on the pair? So I am assuming that there's no nucleation. Assuming that there's no nucleation here. So here, I just initialize this with a defect here and a defect here, and then let it, and then integrate the velocities in time. But if you make the plus one half so that there are no configurations as if they just had mitigated. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I see, I see. Yeah, yeah. Oh, I see, I see. If you sort of rotate the phase by pi, yeah, in that case, then the plus one half defect just sort of swoops out the other way. That's why I'm not trying here. Again, there's no boundary conditions here. This is just, it just goes out to infinite. Okay. Good. So the last thing I want to show you is our very recent attempts. Very recent attempts to scale this up and some interesting phenomena when we simulate more than just two particles. We're still characterizing this. None of this stuff is published, but we're working on that. So this is a simulation where we had five minus one half defects and five plus one half defects, all just randomly Randomly with random initial positions. And there's actually some interesting phenomenology that we found where, if you look in this region here, these three plus one half defects will come together and sort of start to sort of look like they're braiding one another for some time until that sort of breaks apart and then they form a bound state, which eventually breaks apart again, which is Breaks apart again, which is something that we do see from time to time in continuum simulations as well, where you have these localized regions of bound states that end up breaking apart. Another feature that you can see in this animation, which happens after this breaks apart, is the two There are two minus one-half defects here that will actually start to be attracted to one another, just as in the case if you only have two particles, and then they'll rotate. So what we want to do is run a lot of these simulations and compare them to continuum simulations and potentially even experiments. But there are other ways that we can use this model and compare to some previous continuum simulations that we've been able to do. Previous continuum simulations that I've done more recently. So, one of the things that I've done recently is looked at continuum simulations of a lattice of obstacles. And so in this case, what we find is that the flows essentially ratchet or pump in one direction, and the defect motion also has a Also, has a mainly moves in the asymmetry direction. So, this is the flow-velocity distribution for the simulation. The way we can sort of model this with the particle model is by assuming that these obstacles are just minus one-half topological defects and fixing them. And fixing them in space and time. So we don't integrate the minus one halves, we only integrate the plus one halves. And so I'm going to show an animation here where we randomly initialize the positions of plus one half defects, but had this array of minus one half defects. And I'm going to add trails to the plus one half defects. Of course, again, there's no boundary conditions here, where there are boundary conditions, there's periodic boundary conditions here. So eventually all of these plus one half defects will go off. Eventually, all of these plus one-half defects will go off to infinity, but the directionality of them is along the asymmetry directions. This is promising that we can get sort of this ratcheting behavior in this particle model as well. So, we're going to look at this within the particle model. Is there a band theory of this? A band theory? Well, sure, you got a periodic. Uh well sure, you have a periodic lattice of of the minus halves those are the protons, right? And then the other plus one halves, they're the electrons, they move. Yeah. And so the plus one halves are in a periodic potential. Right, yeah. I haven't done that, but that is interesting. Masked up your periodic boundary conditions. Periodic boundary conditions. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, so that's if he had made the periodic boundary conditions so there was no blank space. That's right, that's right. It would fall out forever. Right, right, right. Then you get dance. Yeah, that's interesting. Oh, I I didn't think about that. Thank you. Yeah. In that simulation on the right, the same number of of positive defects as the negative defects that are fixed. Is the negative DPAC that I fixed? Yeah, I chose the same number for that. Any other questions? Yeah. For the bound states of 2 plus 1 halves, just when you said you've observed them in continuum simulations, do you observe more than one full rotation? Uh sometimes. Okay. Yeah, sometimes. Yeah, sometimes. It it depends on the activity level usually, but for how long they stay stable. And actually, speaking of the bound state, so this is sort of the extent of what we've done with the particle model, but another system that I would like to apply this to is instead of the minus one-half defects, you can think of minus one defects here. And this is another. And this is another work that we did where instead of having unidirectional flows, we found a lattice of topological defects and vortices in the system. And so what we would like to see is if we can get this behavior also in the particle model where we have these bound states centered. For here, I think the periodic boundary conditions are very important. And so one of the things that I will be working on is implementing periodic boundary conditions. Will be working on is implementing periodic boundary conditions for the particle simulations. But in particular, if it works out, one of the interesting things to simulate would be, so this, by the way, this can be tuned from ferromagnetic to anti-ferromagnetic, where the rotation is either all in the same direction or nearest neighbors are in opposite directions. If it's in the anti- If it's in the anti-ferromagnetic phase, you can actually arrange these so that they're in a triangular lattice and have frustration. And this type of a system, when we did the continuum simulations, some of our measures, I was told by experts in spin systems that this is similar to, some of the measures were similar to spin glass. And so, but we'd need a much larger system size. So the particle model. So the particle model would be able to provide a much larger system size than these continuum simulations. So these are ideas for the future. So with that, I'll conclude and save some time. So just to conclude, the Help Rem is Enco formalism. We use that for active chromatic defects. Use that for active pneumatic defects, but can be used for passive pneumatics, it can be used for three-dimensional pneumatics as well. And the analytical approximations we make, I think, can give us a better understanding of defect interactions in approach and maybe a better framework to analyze them. And of course, I have a laundry list of things for the future. One is to scale up the model. I would like to somehow incorporate defect annihilation. Like to somehow incorporate defect annihilation and nucleation, including more terms in the model. So, one of the useful things for particle models is you can apply like a drive very easily or uniform fluid flow and see or uniform shear flow a little bit easier than you can in a continuum simulation. And of course, boundary conditions and 3D defect lines in active. 3D defect lines and open active members as well at some point. So, thank you all for your time, and we will find altitude mapping, for example in Animal Office, we have seen that the close to the walls detect special especially minus one. Maybe you have tried. Maybe you should have tried the way for example they can they can't eat buttons such as they can make them I wonder whether you incorporate some kind of effect of a wallet maybe formula what patterns there and different patterns in the topic yeah I was thinking of ways to incorporate a wall I my my best idea is to Idea is to use image charges. For that, I think you could only do like flat walls or circular walls, but that's probably where I'll start. Yeah. Yeah. I have a philosophical question for you. Sure. Well, your particle model, the plus one of the effects, I would imagine them as a bias. I would imagine them as a vector, and the minus one artifact I would imagine them as little octopoles. But these two objects, if I just forget about the fluid around, and I forget about the interactions, they suffer through whatever is around them, these two objects are subject to forces, but also to torques. So I would have expected equations for the velocity and say. For the philosophy and say the animal. But I'm wrong. So you're not wrong. I have made a simplifying assumption that the director structure is just given by the energy minimizing solution at any given time. But I think in the actual systems, the orientation does change somewhat independently. And that is something. And that is something that I didn't add it to this laundry list, but it is something that I want to also incorporate into the model. Even at equilibrium, even if you consider the equilibrium configuration of the director and the effect, there are torques. The X and Tensor is not symmetric. It's a torque operating. But even I think in your approximation there should be an equation for the So in so without any active flows or if the defects are if the defect structure is given by the minimizing solution, they just interact via Coulomb. There's no rotation. Coulomb. There's no rotation of the if they're properly oriented. If they're not properly oriented, then there is a torque, yes. And that was worked out by Selinger, Tommy Selinger, I think. And that's something we've actually looked at with this model. We do get transverse velocities because of the torques, but it's not something I implemented here. But it is actually something I want to implement in the future. One of the issues with One of the issues with that is that you have to also solve the Stokes equation for the active part, right? For the additional rotation. But yeah, we can get the transverse velocities because of torques, because of non-optimal orientation. And that Tom-Tellinger theory has the third-rank tensor description of the minus half defects, as you're saying. Right. Yeah, sure. Exactly. All right. All right. Any one last quick question? So I was going to mention about the minor question, but this little assumption of zero multi-state defect. So that obviously is the case for isolated defects, but with particularly if there's multiple defect defects, is that something that you think we should use? So if there are multiple defects, the vorticity definitely is non-zero at, like if there are even two defects, I think the vorticity is non-zero at the defect core. Are you asking about the impact that has on the defect dynamics? Yeah, because the conversation is on you just to use the Right, yeah. Yeah, so I don't actually neglect it. When you have that prorotation term, because it's proportional to the Q tensor, right, in Barris Edwards, at the location of the defect core, that term just goes to zero. And we're only computing things at the location of the defect core. Okay. Is that with banker speaker again?
