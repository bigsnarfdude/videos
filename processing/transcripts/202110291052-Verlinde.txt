To the organizers for the invitation. Again, I would, of course, enjoy being in Banff right now, enjoying the beautiful surrounding. But again, it's been a, we're still in the middle of the semester. It's been a busy week. And again, I apologize if this talk seems like I'm giving it a little bit on the fly. And actually, I'm kind of giving it a bit on the fly, but it's a set of But it's a set of ideas that, again, I've been discussing with people over the years and it connects still with things that are currently sort of of interest. And indeed, the topic of bulk reconstruction from conformal field theory has, of course, has been around for a little while, but the questions are still kind of the same deep ones, and there's still. Deep ones, and there are still certain insights that I think will sort of clarify the discussion that hopefully will come up in what I'm going to talk about. So, again, we've learned a lot, certainly also in the last few years, about the black hole information paradox. And one of the things that, and it always sort of creates the tension, is that when we think about a black hole as a geometric object, then indeed it's Then, indeed, it's literally a black hole in the sense that we, from the geometric side, you basically get very little information about what it's made up from and what the Hilbert space of the black hole literally looks like. And of course, ADS-CFT has sort of given us a very important tool of actually associating a Hilbert space to a black hole. But then the downside from the CFT description has always been that the geometric description becomes less clear. Description becomes less clear. And today I'm going to sort of emphasize a point of view where the geometry of the CFT itself actually will give us a laboratory and actually in some sense, even sort of a rather concrete dictionary of essentially putting the two things literally in the same space, meaning that the CFT and the black hole to some extent should be thought of as really kind of sharing their geometric properties. Their geometric properties. And then a number of the issues that we've been talking about in holographic reconstruction. Again, when we talk about entanglement watch, if we talk about sort of is the horizon a smooth region of space or not, at least there's going to be a new perspective on that. And the basic topic or the basic object of study that I want to introduce is essentially the operator product expansion. Essentially, the operator product expansion in the conformal field theory. But let me first sort of introduce a way of looking at two-dimensional conformal field theory that will make the link with the bulk black hole physics a bit more manifest. So, let me make sure that everyone is seeing the blackboard. So, I think you can see most of it all the way down from here. So, let me write. Here, so let me write. Um, so again, if we draw a black hole, let me start with this. Um, so in ADS space, a black hole has a Fenros diagram like that, if it's an internal black hole. And I want to make a relationship between this black hole and indeed a state in the CFT. And let me just denote that state by some big delta. The node that's stayed by some big delta. Can people see this, or should I writing be writing even bigger? Looks good. Looks good. So delta again is some heavy state in the CFT. And indeed, let's talk, at least I'll be mostly talking about ADS3 and CFT2, but a number of the ideas I'm sure will carry over to more general dimensions. And this delta. And this delta, indeed, if it's sufficiently bigger than C over 12, then this should be a state that we can associate with a black hole. If it's a pure state delta energy huge state, then it's a pure state black hole. But more generally, I'm going to use this delta also as a proxy, potentially for a collection of states that could even be entangled with something else. So this could also be a mixed state. Be it also be a mixed state later on, but any we have this particular dictionary. Um, now, of course, as we all know, uh, if you state create a state in the CFT, you can imagine performing essentially a radial quantization picture where the state would be associated with putting an operator O delta at the origin of a disk, say, and you do the path. Disk, say, and you do the CFT path integral, and then that state would correspond to the thing that specifies the boundary condition on your CFT at the boundary of that disk. The boundary of the disk could be at infinity, but it could also be conformally mapped to maybe a finite boundary. But again, I'm representing this as a state. Now, at the moment that we're doing this, we're actually introducing a coordinate system. Using a coordinate system that I can denote by little z and little z bar. Again, I'm writing it small here, but anyway, these are my coordinates. And what I can do is I can take another operator and probe the neighborhood of that operator, O delta. And by basically acting with some other operator. With some other operator, and let me give it an index A just sort of to be able to give a name to that thing besides O. There's an OA, and let me abbreviate the position just by Z that sits in the neighborhood of that other operator. And basically, I want to start probing as a function of that coordinate z that sits here the properties of this particular operator product. The product. And what I'm going to claim is that there's going to be a natural location. And again, sorry for using this thing here. I'm going to make this disk a little bit bigger. What I'm going to claim is that there's going to be a rather natural location, a certain distance away from the heavy operator, where there's a certain sense in which this particular Sense in which this particular other operator, which I'm assuming is going to be light. So this thing will have some conformal dimension HA, which will be much less than C over 12. That indeed, there's a certain sense in which we can think about this as creating some particle. And there's indeed going to be a dictionary, I claim, between this description and creating some excitation on this side. Creating some excitation on this side. And there's going to be some natural location at a certain distance away from the black hole, sorry, from the operator that can be thought of as being the horizon of the black hole. So basically, what I'm going to argue is that the black hole horizon is actually a location in the path integral of that one would introduce in. In computing a state in the CFT, where this disk here again is the disk on which the CFT lives. And we can talk more about how this compares with the more standard ADS-CFT dictionary, but let me argue first why this is the case. Okay. Unless there are at this point questions. Question, Haran? Usually we think of that disk as being an Euclidean signature if we're doing real quantization. Signature for real quantization. But you're going to explain why we have a horizon in Euclidean signature? I'll explain. Thank you. At least it's a good question. So this is the Euclidean. And as we know, one of the reasons for why we can think about this thing as a state is because we can do radial quantization. And we can take a mapping of this disk basically to a cylinder. And indeed, since it is. And indeed, since it is Euclidean, there's a let me not draw the cylinder like that. I'm going to draw the cylinder horizontal. So the radial direction here is exponentially mapped to a radial direction here. And let me already immediately do one other thing, which, because otherwise, I'm going to take making too many drawings. I'm going to give this cylinder. Thanks. I'm going to give this cylinder, which is obtained through the exponential mapping. I'm not going to draw it like a regular cylinder. I'm mainly going to draw it like a hyperbolic cylinder because I'm going to argue that this cylinder automatically has an hyperbolic metric induced on it. Now, allow me to do one thing, at least for me. Often, actually, ADS lives on the right, the CFT lives on the right of ADS. Maybe because I've explained some of this to other people and I often got myself in trouble because of an inversion between left and right. I'm going to put the CFT on the left. So, this is where my CFT lives. And now I'm going to think about this particular state as a geometry. Then, indeed, we can take this particular spatial slice here, which is the constant time slice that goes through the horizon here. Now, this is the two-sided black hole, which normally would be the thermofuel double state. Would be the thermofuel double state in a two-sided CFT in two CFTs. But since we now have a pure state, one way I think achieving the pure state in a picture is to introduce this end of the world brain. Basically, that sits here that cuts away this region. So, this is my end of the world brain. And I claim that the CFT, if I give you a state in the CFT on the left, I should be able to reconstruct the spatial geometry, not just only until the horizon, but in general, and certainly if the state is not maximally mixed yet, if it's a pure state, I will be able to go farther in. And one way of seeing that is as follows. Seeing that is as follows: is that so? This site here, sorry, this side here is where the end of the world brain sits. And I can think of this as basically being a place where the boundary condition, the state delta, determines the boundary condition of this thing, and it determines the state of that end of the world brain. And the metric on this spatial slice, I claim. I claim can be written indeed in the following form where the spatial slice itself is actually a negative, a constant negatively curved space. And I can write down the BTZ metric. Let me squeeze it in here in the following form, where I have a radial coordinate that I call R, I have an angular coordinate that I call theta, and then there's some. And then there's some let me make it a sine function sine squared of some the radius r divided by some critical radius. This is actually an ADS2 metric. It's the metric on a hyperbolic cylinder. And then if you add to this Then, if you add to this a metric, sorry, a time component, which is cotangent R over R C squared times D T squared. Then this, I claim, describes the BTZ black hole. Okay. This particular ADS2 metric is naturally associated. associated to a constant, sorry, to a state with a certain conformal dimension in the CFD through the following procedure, which is pretty well known, which is basically a step in the monodromy method of discussing conformal blocks, for example, in the CFT. Namely, what you do is you take this extra. Do you take this excited state or delta and you take the expectation value of the stress tensor in that background state delta? That expectation value is big delta over z squared. But then you recognize that this state That this state that the CFD is actually a CFD with a central charge. And then you can find a special coordinate system such that, and I often denote that coordinate system by C over 12 times the Schwartzian derivative, which is the expectation value of the stress-energy tensor. Of the stress-energy tensor relative to another coordinate system, if in the other coordinate system you would have had the vacuum state, you can find a coordinate big Z, which is called the uniformizing coordinate. That effectively means that in the coordinate big Z, the stress tensor actually has zero expectation value. And this is an intrinsic procedure that you can perform in the CFT, and that will introduce that coordinate. And that will introduce that coordinate big z. And it means that actually the metric associated with that uniformizing coordinate system is the standard Poincaré upper half plane metric that you can write now down. That if you write down ds squared, dz dz bar to the over z minus z squared or s squared. And you impose that this z is the uniformizing coordinate, I claim that you get a metric that looks exactly like that. The formulas, I can tell, write down a few more formulas, but actually I don't want to necessarily fill up the blackboard with too many formulas. Basically, this z, big z is little z to a power i alpha. It's a power of the little z that will arrange. Z that will arrange this formula to be true where this alpha, which is actually related to, I think, one over RC, is related to the conformal dimension to a formula like delta is C over 12 times 1 plus alpha squared. So there's some relationship between this uniformizing coordinate and the conformal dimension. And the conformal dimension. So, this is all old stuff. And it's a way of actually associating a metric to a conformal field theory state. Sorry, Herman, quick question. So your state is an energy eigenstate. It's a primary state that you're considering? Yes, although I'm sort of more open-minded, meaning that the The state I could imagine could also be a linear superposition state, a superposition of many states with approximately the same energy. Yeah, that's what I was going to ask. Because sometimes people draw the same type of drawing, but not for a primary state, but for a boundary state that's been involved some amount of Euclidean time. Can you say whether that's important or not in what you discussed? Right. So, so, Anita, I Right, so indeed, I'm aware of this. So, what I could have done indeed is I could have started literally with the thermal field double state. And indeed, I could have taken the thermal field double state and then viewed this end of the world brain as actually taking the inner product of the thermofield double state with a certain state on the end of the world brain. And then the fact that I started with the thermal field double state means that I'm multiplying this thing by e to the minus. This thing by e to the minus beta over two times h. Now, if I'm sort of taking some shortcuts here by assuming that the energy window is very small, and then e to the minus beta over two times h is just a prefactor e to the minus beta over two times the energy, which I just absorb in the normalization of my state. But if you wish, you can think about it that way. You can think about it that way. And we can talk more about whether these factors of e to the minus beta over two times h are important or not. In my mind, if you would go to a micro-canonical ensemble and just be in a small energy window, that's a sufficient starting point for my story. Can we make a quick comment? Yeah. I think you want the end of the world brain to be on a constant R slice, given that it's an energy eigenstate, hence it must have time translation symmetry. Time translation symmetry. Thank you. We have to expect a boost. Yeah, right. It's true. Sometimes I get confused whether I have to draw them like this, or you're saying, well, I should probably draw the thing in the other direction. Thank you. Correct. That's right. So by the way, I should say that there's an element to the story that was already actually mentioned in a paper I had with Lauren McGough and Steve Jackson like eight years ago. Steve Jackson, like eight years ago. And then recently, basically, we recognized that one can make some of the ideas there more explicit by using results of actually Alex and Scott. And I forgot the third collaborator, Maxfield, and a fourth collaborator, where you can actually compute OPE coefficients because I'm going to, in a moment, I'm going to write down the OPE expansion. Expansion, and I'm going to claim that as a function basically of the distance z to this thing here, that I can really start sort of probing this particular geometry. And that indeed there's going to be an important qualitative difference between points Z that are inside or outside this critical radius. And the location of this critical radius is precisely going to be the location essentially. Going to be the location essentially where the horizon is supposed to sit. So the horizon is going to be basically mapped in this way to a location on the plane on which the conformal field theory is defined. Since my blackboard is filling up, I probably am going to erase a couple of formulas. Keep in mind this cotangent squared, that cotangent squared is the, indeed, is the G00. The g00 of the metric. And indeed, the fact that it's equal to zero at the horizon means indeed that that's the location where naturally the time flow will change sign. So indeed, if I follow Ahmet's advice and draw this thing more like a constant R thing, then maybe I should indeed do it like that. Because I indeed. Because I indeed claim that if this is a static metric, that indeed this time flow can also be recognized from the point of view of the CFT. And we'll see actually a bit later that this pre-factor cotangent squared R over R C indeed can be derived from the CFT as well. So the whole metric basically is encoded in the data of the CFT. Okay, so this is an initial story. And let me still make one small last comment. This coordinate little r is the logarithm of z times little z times z bar. And that logarithm to some extent is important because you could actually be surprised that if I'm in a CFT, that there's a special distance away from a given point, that's a special radius. Radius because it's a conformal field theory. How can I suddenly have a special distance? And it turns out that the special distance is specified by giving a certain value to the logarithm of Z times Z bar. And then I need to introduce some kind of dimensionful quantity to make the logarithm of Z times Z bar dimensionless. And that's always what you do in conformal field theory. Basically, the scaling laws that we've Basically, the scaling laws that we write down for OPE expansions need always implicitly presume that I'm choosing some kind of UB cutoff scale that I put into my expressions. And therefore, once you've done that, then there's going to be a specific location where something special is going to happen. Okay, let me give myself a little bit more space. So let me write down the OPE expansion. I notice I still have a little bit of space on the right of my backboard, so let me make use of that space. Where I'm going to indeed sum over a set of final states that I'll denote by big delta plus. Big delta plus little delta, so that's the conformal dimension of my final state. I'm going to have OPE coefficients that depend on A, on big delta, and on this energy shift they'll call little delta. And then if I just write down the sum over delta, I means really the sum over all possible states. And then I can take that absolute value squared little z for. But I'm going to ignore spin in this for now because otherwise my formulas get a little bit complicated. And then here there's two times HA minus delta. So delta for me is the total performal dimension. HA is just the left moving performance dimension. That's why there's a two here. But there's an obvious observation now, namely, we're summing here over. Namely, we're summing here over indeed a set of states. But if I look at basically this particular object here, let's think about this as a transition amplitude between the initial state with energy delta and a final state with delta plus delta that's obtained by absorbing some particle with location with created by this object. But then, as a function of the distance z, it's clear. Z, it's clear that if Z gets very small, that if delta becomes negative, it's favored over delta positive. And if Z is very large, then delta positive is going to be favored over delta negative. So if I look at when is this amplitude the biggest? The biggest, there will be a certain location where first positive delta will be have the dominant contribution far away and negative delta will have the dominant contribution nearby. Since I'm going to be focusing on the nearby region, let me switch the sign of delta. Let me put a minus sign here and a plus sign here. And then it's a And then it's a bit more obvious again that if delta is now a positive number, but it means I'm subtracting energy from the original black hole, then this one over z will become very big if z goes to zero, if delta is positive. So, and I claim that this is really a very important quantitative switch. And the reason for why that's the case is for a very black holy. Is for a very black holy reason. Namely, that if I would give you this particular state on the right, one question I could ask is the following. Suppose I put this delta actually indeed in some kind of mixed state or in some random state of superposition of states with approximately the same energy as delta. Energy is delta. Then this state carries a certain amount of entropy, say von Neumann entropy. And that von Neumann entropy, too many things going on at the same time. Okay. That von Neumann entropy here is bigger than the von Neumann entropy on the right because I'm actually going low, going down in energy, which means that I'm lowering the entropy of basically the black hole system. Basically, the black hole system. I'm lowering the mass of the black hole, I'm lowering the entropy, which means that if I give you this particular state, in the situation where this thing was some random state with larger density. So, let me make the drawing here. If this is the spectral density at delta, and this is the spectral density at delta. And this is the spectral density at delta minus delta. Then, if OA maps me from here to there, and I have some random state over here, for sure this state will look completely random. So if I give you the state on the right and I ask you what was the operator OA that I acted with, you won't be able to decode the operator OA. So the OA will have been scrambled completely over here. Have been scrambled completely over here because I started with a state with higher entropy and went to lower entropy. Of course, the opposite is true if this had been a state with higher energy, then I would have gone from a sparser spectrum into a more dense spectrum. And then my target state would be a special state within the higher energy spectrum. And therefore, the operator OA would still be visible. So there's a certain concrete sense in that if I give you Concrete sense in that if I give you that state, that your entanglement spectrum, if you wish, sorry, the entanglement wedge, and it ends at that point, where you go from positive to negative energy. So a calculation that we started doing again with Scott a couple of weeks ago was a needed conjecture that we formulated something like seven, eight years ago, namely that. Ago, namely that if I take this particular OPE expansion and I fix Z, and I need to ask what is the maximum contribution. And then what we literally need to do is sort of look a little bit more at probability rather than at amplitude. So what you do is you write down what is the probability of making this quantum transition. So you have to use Fermi's golden rule, essentially, and you have to ask. And you have to ask when is the quantity, I guess, if we still have the rule there, 2π, rho delta, in this case, delta minus delta, times the absolute value squared of this thing, c over this z to the power 2 h a plus delta. When is that quantity, when does it have a maximum as a function of delta? As a function of delta for given z. And then you can compute the location where delta goes from positive and negative. And you can find a critical location, Z critical. And that critical location is indeed precisely the location that sits at this location, at this point here in this geometry. So that's indeed an indication that the OPE expansion is really probing this spatial geometry of the BTC black hole. Is there a question about this? Okay, how am I doing with time? I'm at half an hour. I still have 10 minutes, officially. You can take, yeah, you have 10 more minutes total, but we leave some time for questions. Okay, good. Question. It question: So, are you finding? So, for fixed z, you're you can find a saddle point in little delta in that expression and using the asymptotic formula, and then you're looking at the value of z where that is maximized. Yeah, so what we did, the first calculation that I've done with SCOP was indeed sort of, and yeah, some students was indeed to identify the location where delta switches sign. With delta switches sign, and that matches indeed with the critical location that one could also identify by just doing this geometric mapping. There's a second calculation that actually Ahmed, so we had some discussion with Ahmed, and Ahmet had a very insightful note that he sent a month ago that where he basically looked at the same calculation, but indeed from the point of view of essentially looking at the corresponding conformal block, essentially by taking the overlap of this thing with itself. The overlap of this thing with itself. And then basically asking, as a function indeed of that distance z, what is the expectation value of the energy in the intermediate channel? I could make the drawing, and I'll probably make the drawing in a second. And then it turns out that you can compute that energy indeed by basically doing the contour integral of the stress tensor. And you can compute that energy as a function. And you can compute that energy as a function of that distance. The only thing that the thing that sort of is assumed there is that if I take the overlap of this thing with itself, it's basically the heavy, heavy light, light four-point function. And that indeed, if you assume that it's dominated by the identity channel in the light-light OPE, and you then compute that particular energy as a function, then of that distance, it will actually precisely match with. It will actually precisely match with the redshift factor of the BTC black hole. So it indeed means that literally, if I think about these two operators really as things that I'm creating in the book, that initially it has positive energy and it goes through the horizon and turns negative energy. And what's very useful about this is that it's not only keeping track of the energy, we can now also, through the OPE expansion, keep track of the entropy. Entropy. We actually know the states, we know the spectral density of the states as a function of that thing. And therefore, you can see basically you can see the firewall. By the way, this example is basically an example of the firewall argument. That if this thing is sitting in a maximum weak thermal state, then by the time that this thing sort of goes into the black hole, it kind of gets disappeared from the outside. From the outside view, from a quantum information perspective, you can no longer basically decode this operator. So, there's these two things. So, let me, in view of the time, sort of give you based on this a model of black hole evaporation that sort of clarifies quite a bit the quantum information theoretic conundrum in terms of an identity, which is actually true in the conformal field theory. True in the conformal field theory. So the idea is the following, and let me just do it in pictures. So I start with my state still O delta, but now let me draw the OPE, basically the thing that I have on the right-hand side. Right-hand side, as follows: is that I have an operator A which are labeled by A. This thing is labeled by delta. And then I get a new state, which is delta minus delta. So let me just call this thing delta. So that's my OPE here. And I give it some Z dependence depending on, and that will determine what delta is. What is delta now? If I'm in this situation where this thing is bigger than that, then one way of drawing this thing would be as follows: is that actually I have more information, quantum information sitting here than I have sitting there. So this A actually extracts quantum information from delta. So this is my OPE coefficient in this particular setting. Of course, I could also have the opposite. Of course, I could also have the opposite where I would be raising. And what I can do is, I can actually have a pair of operators A and A star, where I go back to the arm, I think. And this thing here. And this thing here is related through a fusion matrix to a situation where I take A star and A, and I fuse A star and A first. And then I basically keep delta and delta on both sides. And if, so this is a situation. So, this is a situation where I'm acting both as an operator OA and an operator O star A. If those two operators are close enough to each other, then this is dominated by the identity channel here. The equality between the two requires doing a sum over delta here. So, this is basically the fusion matrix, it's the duality transformation between two. Duality transformation between two conformal block decompositions of the heavy, heavy, light, light of the four-point function. And indeed, if it's dominated by the identity channel, this thing looks exactly like a Hawking pair. So let's think about this really as sort of the model for evaporating a black hole. I have my heavy state, I'm going to sit exactly at the critical radius. Exactly at the critical radius, and I'm going to pair create two operators: an O and an O, an OA and OA star. And I can do that with no energy cost and with no information. So this looks exactly like the Hawking evaporation process. But now I use the fusion matrix to decompose this thing into an expression that looks like this. In the process, this in the process what i've done i've moved a closer to the to the to the operator and a star farther away from the operator but since a is now close to the heavy operator it will lower the energy of the thing which is indeed what happens in hawking evaporation the black hole lowers its energy it also lowers its entropy which is indeed indicated by this figure so now what is the black hole information paradigm black hole information paradigm Information paradox, black hole information paradox is that it's very hard to imagine here that measuring this thing, which is the particle that escapes, can tell me anything about the black hole. Or another way of stating the information paradox, it's very hard to imagine that if I keep doing this thing, that I'm not increasing the entanglement between this side and that side. Because if I draw this line here, the Hawking, this pair seems to be increasing the entanglement. Seems to be increasing the entanglement between the two sites. So, this is just increasing entanglement, it's back creation. But it's also apparently lowering the energy of the black hole. And that's the conundrum, is that how can you have an increase in entropy, apparently, and a decrease in energy? But now I'm going to just look at this thing, which is an identical object in the C of T. identical object in the CFT and here I can see that the intermediate channel that the entropy is actually being decreased by this thing so therefore if I would be able to do a measurement over here I'm extracting the quantum information from the black hole on this side but here on this side is actually mysterious how is it possible that a star is actually entangled with a because Because it now looks that A is actually entangled with the black hole and A star is entangled with this. So, how can A and A star be entangled? Because this is basically the starting point of the firewall paradox, where you say, hey, if information comes out, A star cannot be entangled with A. But it just means that you have to do basically a fusion measure. And by the way, if you look indeed at the fusion. And by the way, if you look indeed at the fusion matrix, effectively what it is, it's actually a quantum teleportation protocol. Because basically, what the fusion matrix is, it has six indices. And effectively, it means that you're doing a joint measurement over here. Now, these two things were actually entangled in some ways, because if I think about it in terms of the This side actually is more as the Hawking radiation. Now, I'm jumping a little bit. And indeed, it's true that the OPE coefficients that one can extract indeed from the work of Alex and Scott and Max. And tell me who the fourth person is. Yeah, it was Scott, me, Henry, and Yanis Tsiaris. Anyway, so if you take the relevant OPE coefficient in this case, it's actually the OPE coefficient. In this case, it is actually the OPE coefficient for the two-point function, at least extracted from the two-point function on the torus, indeed, in an appropriate identity block. And basically, what it means is that one should be thinking about these two sites actually as being indeed sort of in a mixed state. So, basically, this is sort of what it looks like from the point of view of starting instead of starting with the Fulbright function, if I basically trace over these two steps. Over these two states. So now I'm taking your thermal expectation value. Then what you can see is that actually an entanglement between A and A star is now being created like this. So I guess just a long story short, just studying what an OPE expansion does in a holographic CFT as a In a holographic CFT, as a function of the distance of a light operator with a heavy operator, is a perfect analogy basically for studying what happens to black information when you throw it into a black hole or try to extract it from a black hole. It can even model something like the Hawking evaporation process. And I think there's some interesting lessons to be learned by just thinking about it in this way. So let me stop there. Thanks very much. Thanks very much. Questions for Herman? Yeah, I see Henry. Go ahead. Thanks. Nice talk, Herman. I'm just let me know if this is a bit off base, but staring at your picture you have in the top left with the torus, it looks like your transition when you do this two-point function on the torus should be indicated by whether you take the identity block where you directly fuse things and have the identity block. Directly fuse things and have the identity running, or whether you first will take them back around the torus and then fuse them. And whether which one of those blocks dominates. So it's sort of roughly whether the you know which branch of the torus are your particles connecting up in? Is that yeah? So actually in the computation also that Ahmed was doing, it was pretty clear that this transition indeed happens, I think. Transition and it happens, I think, is it at beta over four? At least, certainly, when you move this distance, beta over four, you can kind of see it. It happens sort of when once you pass halfway. So, once you've done this gluing, this hyperbolic picture, by the way, is a little bit less clear, although it may still be clear from the two-point function on the torus. As we all know, again, the torus is special from the point of view of hyperbolic geometry, because this thing is a neck in a hyperbolic geometry, but that might still. Of all geometry, but there might still be a way in which the stories perspective sort of has some geometric meaning for the black hole story as well. It's somewhat reminiscent. This part of the Taurus is somewhat reminiscent of the replica wormhole type story. Personally, I think there's still insight just by talking about the pure side, the one-sided story initially, because this almost goes towards the two-sided story. But I think that especially this. But I think especially this particular duality transformation, I think, will have a useful sort of rephrasing, at least, of some of the relationships that we're studying when we're talking about the two, yeah, I should say, the tension that comes out from the black hole information question. Yeah, well, thinking about the one-sided case was why I asked, because if you think that sort of in the thermal case, you should be fusing these the identity around the back, it suggests. These to the identity around the back, it suggests to me at least that in the four-point function sort of pure case, that it's really not the identity but some other light stuff that's running there and it's sort of a transition between whether it's really the identity or it's I understand your point. So let me see if I can rephrase sort of an answer. So one of the questions that you could ask is whether indeed this lowering of the energy in the middle can really be In the middle can really be fully understood based on just having the identity block here. Exactly. Yeah. And actually, there's slightly conflicting evidence on that point. It turns out that essentially one can extract and need this energy dependence of the way the energy depends on the position from just looking at the identity block. But I agree that, of course, if I would look at the full four. Of course, if I would look at the full four-point function, that there's going to be a point here where the identity block will no longer dominate when I start moving these things farther away from each other. And that doesn't undermine the story that I'm telling you, because essentially the whole idea is that in this case, I can still probe the geometry in the CFT just like you would normally probe the geometry in the CFT. And that's, of course, one of the main messages. In the CFT, and that's of course one of the main messages here: is that the fact that the spatial geometry now is really the geometry of the CFT allows us to really think about what it means to say go into the interior of the black hole. But it could be that basically in the process of going between here, where initially the identity channel dominates, and then moving them farther away where you move to this particular thing, that there is indeed some non-local transfer of information. Of information between here and there. Because indeed, there's information escaping from the black hole. And then people say, hey, this has to be non-local physics. But in this case, it's just sort of the non-local physics that the CFT is doing basically during an adiabatic process where I'm just moving these particles, these operators away from each other. Then the other feature you'd have, if it wasn't the identity, is you wouldn't care. If it wasn't the identity, is you wouldn't care if it's A and A star, whether it's two different operators. So we'd sort of that would fit into this story as to the information being sort of scrambled. Right. But of course, the fact that it's A and A star and the fact that you locally get the identity OPE is the analog of the reason for why we need entanglement at short distance. And that's sort of part of a property of a CFT as well. Alex? Okay, I'll assume it's this, Alex. So I guess. So, I guess it's pretty natural that OPE asymptotic formulas derived by, for example, Taurus two-point functions can be thought of in terms of stuff in black hole backgrounds and small perturbations of black holes. But there's another, there are other interesting sets of asymptotic OPE formulas like light, light, heavy. And it's tempting to think about the light, light, heavy OPE coefficient as like an amplitude for a heavy black hole to spontaneously decay. Heavy black hole to spontaneously decay into two light particles, or the reverse process. But the challenge is that there's no real geometry, like that's hard to describe using semi-classical geometry. But I don't know. I was wondering if you had any thoughts or comments. Yeah, I think that's still that's literally a high energy process. Yeah, it seems a hard thing to study. That's sort of a very quantum gravitational process, whereas this is sort of much more closer to Q of T in curved space. Q of T in curved space because we're basically doing everything with light operators. Yeah, the heavy operators are providing the background, and the light operators are the probe of the background. Maybe I can also ask another question. So here you're using the fusion transform to sort of, I don't know, solving the monogamy of entanglement paradox, if I understand correctly, because there's one channel where it looks like A and A star are entangled with each other and a different channel where it looks like Each other and a different channel where it looks like A and the heavy state and A star and the heavy state are entangled with one another. So, because those are related by a fusion transform, is your interpretation then that there is no sort of monogamy paradox? It just depends on the two different
