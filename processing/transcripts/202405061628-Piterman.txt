A bit faster, and okay, so the basic preliminaries are the following. So, S would always know the whole set. Recall that the order complex, it's a complex group whose sympathies are the finite chains. So, we can understand S as a topological space via the topology of its order complex, in particular its multiple. So, we will say that S is a spherical if it's some of the equivalent to a range of spheres of the maximal possible dimension. This is the dimension of the order complex. Order complex, okay? And the positive is called Macaulay. If its order complex is homotopically called Macaulay, which means that the links of the sympathies are spherical, so right-dimensional or equivalently, the only possible intervals are spherical. And finally, we say the positive is bounded if it's fast and unique, minimum at element zero, and we need maximum element one. So the goal is to establish high connectivity properties of complexes like this, or sphericity, or even common coordinates, in the case of where finite dimension. We are in finite dimension. So, the motivation for our work is the following. It comes from mostly from group convolution and from combinatorics. So, this is our basic example. We have a vector space of finite dimension of a field, and we are going to take the positive of proper non-zero subspaces or the paradigm. So, it's a well-known theorem by Solomonis that this posit, the order complex, is related to the t-s building of C7K. So, in particular, this one is a spheric and you call matoli of dimension n minus 2. So, this means. So this means that the homology of this complex is concentrated in top degree, namely n minus 2, and the representation here gives rise to this timer module of S and A, which is a well-known model. So this model is very important because this is the dualizing module in the following sense. So Bouret and Ser proved that if we take the ring of integrals of a number field, we get the following isomorphism in the homology. So BCD here stands for the original homological dimension of this group. So if you take the homology, Of this group. So, with the homology of SNNO with coefficients in M, this can be computed as a homology with coefficients in the tensor product of the Schmidt component. So, these guys help us to compute the homology of the second coefficient. We also have some other results relating homology. So, for example, quiller proved that if the field is not f2, we have these isomorphisms in the homology group. So, this means that we fix a degree, and if we go large enough with the n here, the dimension of the linear group, we get an isomorphism. Of the linear group, we get an isomorphism. Okay, so it's homological stability. So, to prove this kind of results, what one usually does is to construct a family of highly connected complexes arising from this positive proper non-seal subspaces, and these are mostly related with the ways that you can decompose your vector space at direct sum of subspaces or even taking linearly dependent subsets. So, the most question is: you can generalize this kind of things to You can generalize these kinds of things to other groups or even more generalized race structures. So, for example, we have here free groups, automorphisms of free groups, mapping class groups, and for example isometry groups, and even linear groups, but over other kind of rings. So, examples to have in mind, we say, okay, we have the positive subspaces, as we said before, and we want to have the compositions to be direct. Compositions to be direct sample compositions. If we take now more discrete options, for example, we take just a set, so we take the lattice of subsets, this is, and the composition should be the partition lines, right? All the possible partitions of your set. But now if you take a free group, you don't take all the servers, because this process is too big, but you take only the free factors. Okay, so this is that decoupled with the free complement. And here you And here you want the decompositions into three factors, so decompose at the free parallel of samples. If you take now finite generative model, for example, a PID, you don't want all the sub-positors, but those that are complemented. I mean, the sum once here and the composition, that are example compositions. And finally, if we have a vector space with some non-degenerate form, we don't want all the subspaces, but only those which are non-degenerate, and we want to take the And we want to take the compositions which are orthogonal decompositions here, not only direct. So, the idea of our work is to try to encode all of these situations and more with one definition that helps us to prove general properties for all of them at the same time, and then to construct these related structures coming from the decompositions. So, we propose this categorical approach. We are going to start with an Approach, we are going to start with an initial symmetric monological theory where we have an initial object which is also a unit for our product. So we should interpret this guy as a coproduct, but it won't be a coproduct in general. We fix an object and we take the posit of all sub-objects, which are classes of monomorphism, but this might be too big. For example, it can be all the subs and we don't want it. So this posit is bounded. Okay, the initial object is the minimum element, and x itself is the maximum element here. Itself, this the maximal element here, and now we define what is the decomposition, the proposed definition for the composition. So it's just a subset of sub-objects which satisfies this property. So I take some representatives here, and then I take the shoin in the posed sense. This is not a lattice, but still we can think if the shoin exists. We ask the shoin to exist. It is the top element, but it also coincides with a class like this. Right? And we have. Like this, right? And we have some compatibility math, as a short. So this basically means that x is the square cap product of the y i's. Now we have a notion of decomposition. We have a posit of all these decompositions and we give the order of perfinements. We can also produce a coset of partial decompositions, which are subsets of decompositions. And here now the current object we need are those. Object we need are those elements, those objects that appear in some decomposition, basically. So this basically means that have some common elements, right? So now with this frame of in mind, we come back to example. So for the vector spaces, we take the category of vector spaces, our field, and this product, the Monoli approach, just in our example. So this guy now is the positive of all subspaces, which we know is called Macaulay. This is what we want. The decompositions are exactly the same. The decompositions are exactly the Daredevil decompositions with this definition. So, this was proved to be called Macaulay independently by Cherny and Belker, who proved it for finite fields. And now let's go to the positive parts of the compositions. So, this guy is harder to control. So, this was proved by Carnot's current transition that for finite fields, this is called Macaulay, but this is unpublished. It's a very long paper. And we recently proved that the proper part of this poster, because this has Part of this poster because this has a minimal element which is the empty partial decomposition and a maximal element which is just X itself as the composition. Removing the bottom and top element, this is most equivalent to something called the common basis complex, which is related to stable buildings. And this one was proved to be highly connected. And since this guy has dimension 2n minus 3, it's a multiple equilibrium sums in dimension 2n minus 4 connected, sorry, this one is a For connected, sorry, this one is a spherical. But we don't know if this is common colony because the upper intervals are very hard to control here. So now let's go for the free groups, category of groups. We take the free product here, we take our free group, and let's dispose it of complemental objects that are exactly the free factors that we want. The decompositions, again, are the decompositions into free factors with this definition. And it was proved by Hatcher and Falkman that these two posets are called Macona. And these two posets are common macauli of the correct dimension. Well, let's go back to the question of the dualizing model in the first slide, so this result of origin zero and linear groups. So it was asked by Pachel and Frankman if the Steinberg model here, which should be like the homology of this guy, that's the positive free factors, is indeed a dualizing model for the ontomorphism group of the P group. And this was shown very recently. It is not the case. So it's not this guy is not a dual this guy is not a dualizing module. This guy is not a dualizing model of the automorphic group of the three groups. So, this is synonymous question. And this is an open question: what is the amount of type of the partial decomposition, which is even harder to control here. So, finally, vector space equipments, now we take some designerate vector space and the category of vector spacing with forms, and isometries, now for our maps. And now we take the orthogonal sum, which is not a vector product. So again, the positive complemented are exactly the non-decent subspaces. The compositions are exactly the orthogonal decompositions into non-decenary subspaces. And now the partial decompositions retract to the full decompositions, removing the top element, because we basically have unique complementation. So to every partial decomposition, we can add the orthogonal complement, and we land here in the decompositions. So this guy is the So this guy is Tebron Spheric and is never called Macaulay because it collapses to something smaller than each. And finally, one can also prove that the compositions are called Macaulay if and only if this positive of non-decent subspaces is called Macaulay. So the question here basically reduces to understand the positive of non-decent subspaces. Here we have only partial results for known forms, unitary spectrum orthogonal forms, and even for finite fields we get bounds of the style and it's small respectively. Is small with respect to the size of the filter. So, open questions here are a lot. For example, if we can remove this bound here if the dimension is thick enough and the size of the field. So, that's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. So, there are other questions. What about other algebraic structures? Yeah, that's one question. That's one question. Yeah, I mean, for example, one of our motivations was to consider matroids. Matros also fit this context. You can just think of matroid as a category, the lattice of flats, just category, pulsed category, and the product is just the joint. And then you recover the notion of the compositions in the lattice of flats of the paper, for example. But you can take any ashrade structure that you like, where you have a notion of products or whatever the composition you want to regard. The composition you want to regard, and if you can fit that categorical framework, you can produce all these objects. For example, you have groups and direct products, you can think what are the compositions into direct products. More or less, we are more weird products as well. Early on in your presentation, you mentioned this amount of technological stability for GLN. Yes. So the does the stable rank of the coefficients rule play somehow a role for this type of question? Sorry, does the stable rank of the coefficients play a role for the homological stability? Yeah, the coefficients? Yes, but it's more specifically the stable rank, the coefficients. The theoretical invariant that says that if you take the sequence of GLNs into each other, when it is somehow stable, at least you are ranking for the you're asking for the slope of this. Of the stabilization, basically? I think I am asking if the stable hand is a certain given number, does it influence the homological stability? I'm not sure we can speak about it. I think this is related with the slope, usually it's a linear slope, which expected most groups, both family of groups. Yeah, I don't know if you changed the coefficients. I'm not sure, I'm not an expert in homological study. I'm not an expert in what you guys study. It's just one of the main motivations to study these programs.
