It online. So today I will talk about the solitone problem for a Sahara water wave system with a non-flat bottom in a non-flat bottom domain. So before I start with introducing the problem, I would like to start with a mathematical formulation, design hypothesis that we do. So we will start considering a fluid containing a domain with a rigid body. Domain with a rigid bottom that is described by a function a and a free surface that we called eta and is and it is an unknown. So here h is the constant reference depth. Epsilon is a parameter that we check so that we in a way can control how the bottom is changing in space. And here we have the domain omega t. And here we have the domain omega t is in R2. So we have two variables: x, which is the horizontal variable, and then z, which is the vertical variable, and then of course, time. So we make assumptions on the fluid. The first of all is that the fluid is homogeneous, inviscid, and incompressible. This will mean that the motion of the fluid is actually described using free surface. Described using free surface Euler equations. The flow will be rotational. Both surface and bottom can be parametrized as graphs above the still water level. No particles of the fluid should cross the bottom nor the surface. There will be surface tension, and in fact, it's going to be large. The fluid is at rest at infinity, which means that the surface elevation, which here is noted by eta, is By eta is zero up plus and minus infinity. And then finally, the water depth is always bounded by below by a non-negative constant. So here a quick remark is the fact that hypothesis 9, 8, and 4 are related in the sense that we are nowhere near any coast. And in fact, as far as we know, the coast doesn't exist. Okay, so this hypothesis turns into equations. We denote here u, the velocity of the fluid. And so the first thing that we know is that since the flow is rotational, there exists a scalar function phi, which is the velocity potential such that derivated in space, we recover the velocity of the fluid. So I mentioned before that That the motion is represented by a free surface Euler equations. So here we have H1 and H2, which are in fact those equations, but when considering the unknown as the velocity potential and not the velocity of the fluid. So here we have derivative in time, of the velocity potential, derivative in space, a gravity term here, G. Gravity term here, G is gravity constant, and Z is the vertical variable. Here we have a pressure term. So rho is the density, P is the pressure of the fluid, and this is the atmospheric pressure. The fact that the fluid is incompressible gives you the equation H2. Now we said that the fluid doesn't cross the bottom, so this gives you a boundary. So, this gives you boundary conditions. So, in particular, if n is the unity, the normal unity vector pointing upwards, then on the bottom, we have that the normal derivative of the velocity potential is zero. And something similar happens with the fact that the fluid don't crosses the surface. So, over the surface, we have We have a boundary condition for the surface elevation. And then finally, the fact that we are considering surface tension implies that this pressure turn that we had here in the right-hand side of H1 on the surface become, let's say, tension term. So we have here the pressure and it becomes this. It becomes this formula, which is the beta is the surface tension coefficient. And then this is the mean curvature of the free surface elevation. So I said before that the system that we are considering here is the Sakharov water wave system. And so it actually arises, as Sakharov notices, that it in fact. Notices that it, in fact, is enough to consider only what happens on the surface of the fluid instead of considering the whole domain omega t. So here eta is again the surface elevation. It's already happening in the surface. But then instead of considering the whole velocity potential, we consider a strace over the surface, which is denoted here by bar phi. And so what's that? Phi. And so what Sakharov notices is that these new variables, these new unknowns, which are eta and bar phi, can fully determine the flow. So in particular for the formulations that we work on today, we need to introduce also a directly nominal operator that was first presented by Craig, Suleim, and Suleim. So this is an operator that is in fact defined using the free surface. Free surface and the description of the bottom. It is applied to bar phi, which is now the trace of the velocity potential. And with that, you recover this formula. So the idea here is to find a link between the trace of the velocity potential and the velocity potential itself, because it is important. It has information about what happens in the rest of the domain. About what happens in the rest of the domain. It also has information about how the bottom is interacting with the solution. So, how do you recover the velocity potential? Well, now this is going to be the solution to an elliptic equation, which is this one. So, if you see here, now you have here the fact that the fluid is incompressible. Here, the fact that Barfa is a trace, and finally. And finally, the boundary condition over the bottom. And in particular, it tells you that the description of the bottom is actually interacting non-linearly and non-locally with the solution through this elliptic equation. So now we are ready to present the Sakharo waterway system, which is this one. And I know it's a bit of a monster, but Monster, but um, let me try to link it with the equations that we had before. So let's take a look at this one. So you have here that derivative in time of this surface elevation equals the Diracli Nomin operator in var phi. So if we go back a little bit, we have, well, these two are part of the elliptic equation. Are part of the elliptic equation, so we can forget about those, those. But this particular boundary condition on the surface, if you take a look at this formula, this is in fact the Dirty dynamo operator by definition. So this is the first equation of the system. And then the second equation of the system comes from taking this H1 and taking into account the fact that we are only considering. Into account the fact that we are only considering what happens on the surface. So now, this pressure term, because we are considering surface tension, becomes this surface tension term. So if we go back to the system, we have the first one, very nice. And then the second one, you have here the derivative in time of what before the velocity potential. And the first two terms in the right-hand side of the second equation. Hand side of the second equation are coming from derivative in space, the velocity potential. This is again the gravity term, and now the pressure term that becomes the surface tension term. So again, here G is gravitational constant, and beta is a tension surface coefficient. In particular, in a more compact way, we can denote it by d t. denoted by dtu equals fu. Fu is actually the right-hand side of the system, and u is going to be the unknown with two variables, eta and bar phi, with two components, eta and bar phi. So this system, it has a Hamiltonian structure. Its Hamiltonian is defined by the total energy, which is given in this formula. And about the world possess. And about the well-posedness, it's actually a very good, difficult question for this system. When there isn't any surface tension, you can find global existing results. Of course, for very regular initial data, I think it should be something like age 53, I think. But they exist. However, in our case, which is considering surface tension, only local existence was proved. system was proved in the space hs plus one half times hs for s larger than five over two so i said at the beginning that i was um that we were interested in solitary waves so what do we know about those now for this particular problem uh when the bottom is flat and there there is um solitary waves there are solitary waves Solitary waves. There are solitary waves. This was proven back by Ami Kish Kazner back in the 80s, I think, or 70s. So for that, for them to exist, first of all, you need surface tension, and it should be something like larger than one over three. They are denoted by QC. They have two components, eta C and Bar Phi C. Both components. Both components, eta c and bar phi c are described by exponentially decaying profiles. And this solitary wave has a speed, constant speed of C that is almost like the root square of gh. So I think in this slide, the information is more simplified. So again, flat bottom problem. You have the solutionary wave of speed almost like screw. speed almost like root square of GH, G, the gravity constant, H, the constant reference depth. Because we are considering a surface tension instead of having something like this, probably, which is maybe what you would expect, it's in fact a depression. And again, both eta and bar phi C are exponentially decaying in time and space. So, what are we dealing with here? So, if I were to explain this to my parents, I would say, okay, we know that the solitary wave exists for a flat bottom problem and it's traveling, minding its own business. So what if at some point it encounters a change in the bottom? Now, that's how I would explain it, but mathematically it's a bit different because the bottom is interacting non-locally with. Is interacting non-locally with the solution. So even if you are away from the changing point of the bottom, it can still affect your solution. So if we want to know how to interact with the changing bottom, we first need to prove that there exists a soliton-like solution for a non-flat bottom problem. So we want to do is consider what we call slightly changing bottom, which is something like this. Bottom, which is something like this, like you see in the sketch, and prove that for a large, safe distance, capital A, away from the changing point of the bottom, we can construct a solitone-like solution that behaves like a solitary wave of the flat bottom problem as time goes to minus infinity. So, for that, I need to maybe give a few more details. Maybe give a few more details of what we consider a slightly changing bottom. So, the bottom is inscribed using the function a. A should be non-increasing or non-decreasing. It should be between 1 and 1 plus kpa, where kappa is a constant that is smaller than 1, between minus 1 and 1, actually. It should have exponentially. Exponentially decaying first derivative, and it should go to one for at minus infinity and to one plus kappa at plus infinity. So it should be something like a hyperbolic tangent to have a more graphic idea. And so for this kind of bottom, what we were able to prove is that in fact you can find solitary waves. You can find solitary ways, solitone-like solutions for this non-flat bottom problem. So, you need to take epsilon small and you need to take a safe distance from the change point of the bottom large, which is a capital A. And then we were able to construct a solitone, a solution that, as time goes to. That as time goes to minus infinity, for every HS norm, it becomes like the solitary wave of the flat bottom problem. Okay, so now I would like to give you a few ideas on the proof, main ideas. But before that, I need to introduce this norm. So, this is the ES norm, and it's in fact the sum of every L2 norm. sum of every L2 norm of derivatives in time and space up to the order s of the solution of any in fact any any two component function okay so again you have two things right you have on one hand the non-flat bottom problem on the other hand you have the solitary wave and this doesn't leave here so the first thing that you need to do So, the first thing that you need to do is to plug it in the non-flat bottom problem and see what happens, right? And so, what we do, once we did that, we find that the remainder that we call here R, it has two components, R1 and R2. R1, it's actually coming from the first equation, and it's the difference between the Diracle nominal operator with the flat bottom problem. With the flat bottom problem and the decline of an operator of the non-flat bottom problem. This remainder is actually exponentially decaying in time. So what I mean by that is that you can find a delta zero, which depends on the decay of the bottom and the decay of the solitary wave, such that for every s larger than zero, the ES norm of The ES norm of R is actually smaller than a constant, depending on this delta zero and this safe distance A, times an exponentially decaying function, which is E to the power delta zero C T T smaller than zero. Okay, so once we did that, you need to You need to find an approximate solution. And so, for that, we need to make an answer. So, we need an approximate solution in the sense that it approximates the problem so that when you plug it into the system, you obtain an exponentially decaying remainder. But we also needed it to be a soliton-like solution in the sense that it behaves like a solitary wave. It behaves like a solitary wave plus a correction term that is actually going to zero as well. So we made an answer. And so take delta, sorry, rho here, the constant accompanying the decay of the remainder from plugging the solitary wave into the system. Right, so this is the raw. And so we redefine the remainder that we had before so that now it's only exponentially decaying without the constant here. And so we define the correction term as the sum of some functions that we need to define, that we need to construct, VL, multiplied by rho L, which in fact rho L is small. Is small, right? Here A is large, so this is a small quantity. And so, with that, what you can make is you do a Taylor expansion on F about the solitary wave QC, and you obtain a system like this, which has different terms of different order with respect to this. With respect to this small constant rho. So combining the terms of the same order, you obtain equations, linear equations for each one of those BL. So for instance, for V1, we find that it should solve a linear equation like this, dt V1 minus derivative of F at the point QC evaluated in V1. Evaluated in V1, it's actually the remainder of plugging the solitary wave into the equation. And then you have something similar for V2 with a source depending on V1. And for each one of those Bj, you have a linear equation with a source depending on the Bj's that came before it. So we need to study the homogeneous linear system because take a look. Because take a look again at the equation of B1. So we know that this remainder is exponentially decaying. We proved it, right? So if we were able to prove that the fundamental solution of this linear equation is in fact it would be nice to prove that it's decaying, but if it was growing slower than the decay of this source, then The decay of this source, then we would be set. So we need to study that. So we need to study the homogeneous linear system, which is TTV minus the derivative of F at the point QC evaluated in B equals zero. And so we ask ourselves, how fast does the fundamental solution grow? And if we define a fundamental solution, And if we define the fundamental solution as SQ, what we found is that it is in fact growing and is growing exponentially, which is not very nice, but the exponential growth is actually slower than the decay of the source. So let's go back to the equation for, for example, for V1. So what we have here. So, what we have here is that for V1, the equation was this one. So, again, we had exponential decay for the source, and it was decaying like Ct, delta zero Ct. And we said that the fundamental solution is actually growing, but it's growing, if you take a look at this, like delta C, like minus delta C T over two. So, this is in fact weaning, you know. So, this is in fact winning in a way. And so, if we define V1 as the solution to that equation, we find that it's exponentially decaying as well. And so, doing this in an induction argument for each one of those VJ, we end up finding exponential decay for every one of those VJ. So, with that, we were able to prove this theorem. So, what we say is that for each N in Is that for each n in each n natural number, you can find an approximate solution that it's constructed as the solitary wave plus a correction term, correction term given by rho j v j. Each one of those vj are exponentially decaying and have in the norm ES, but additionally, the remainder. Additionally, the remainder of using this approximate solution, it has an in S norm exponentially decaying as well. And so here, a quick comment is the fact that, okay, here you have something that you can control, and it's the safe distance that you take away from the changing point of the bottom. So this is going to be like. So, this is going to be large. So, that's not very, that could be tricky. However, this number here is actually saving you because it's raw, it's actually exponentially decaying with respect to A. So, it is controlled, this quantity is actually controlled for a growing A. And so, once you did that, you're practically set because the next thing. The next thing that is left to do is actually construct the exact solution. And the exact solution is actually constructed as the approximate solution plus the difference between the exact and the approximate solution. And so for that to happen, UR should be a solution to this equation. And so this is actually a consequence of the fact that we have a very nice decaying approach. Very nice decaying approximate solution. And so, for that, you not only are able to find the solution to this equation, but you also can prove that UR is also the gain for negative times. So, with that, you're almost set. So, you have the exact solution. Exact solution, the modulated solitary wave, the correction term plus UR. Now, this correction term is exponentially decaying, ur is exponentially decaying, so in fact, you are able to prove that you find a solution of the non-flat bottom problem that behaves like the solitary wave for the flat bottom problem as time goes to minus infinity. And so, what we are doing right now, I think it's the natural questions to ask once we did this: is what happens in the interactual regime? So up until now, we were staying a safe distance away from the changing point of the bottom. And so, let's now define the interaction regime, which is the dangerous place with minus t epsilon t epsilon or t epsilon. T epsilon, or t epsilon is something like epsilon at the power minus one minus alpha for alpha larger than zero. So, what we are studying right now is what happens when the solution-like solution enters the interaction regime, and more importantly, how the bottom and the shape of the bottom can influence what comes out of the interaction regime. What happens if the bottom is increasing instead of decreasing? Increasing instead of decreasing, what happens with the speed of the solitary wave? And so, with that, I think I'm all done. Thank you for the session. Thank you very much, Mario Feniac, for this crystal clear talk. Any questions? Any question to her also from the online participants, the online audience, of course. Assume that the bottom is on a tone, right? Why is that? I'm sorry, I don't I didn't understand very well the question. So so sorry about uh But be next question. Uh you assume that A is monotone, right? Either increasing or decreasing? Yes. Yeah, why why is that? Or what happens if or not? For this part, for the first part, it doesn't really affect the result. It could be something like a bump and it will have the same, I think it would be pretty much the same idea. Same idea. The problem is when you enter the interaction regime. So then you need either increasing or decreasing bottom. Another question. So did you need the surface tension to be different from zero to get the energy estimates? To get the energy estimates, To get the energy estimates, um, well, the thing without about considering this problem without surface tension is that it might not behave as well, the soliton-like solution. But it's not particularly necessary, I think, for the energy estimates. Any other comments, questions? Let's thank Mariam Pena again. Excuse me, one little thing.
