We are in for our last couple of talks. So, we've got Mark Powell here talking about map and class groups of one connected four manifolds. Excellent. Take it away, Mark. Okay, thanks very much. Yeah, so I want to talk about map and class groups of simply connected four manifolds and everything you've joined right with Patrick Orson. So I'm going to mostly be talking about the topological mapping. The topological mapping class group of homomorphisms up to isotopy, up to topological isotopy, because that's kind of the situation in which we can give a complete answer. But I'll also try and compare with the smooth category and so to give you some some maybe some some questions that we think are interesting uh that uh that one could also try and answer in the smooth category. One could also try and answer in the smooth category. Okay, so I want to start off by telling you the theorem. So here, so X is the one connected is just a short way of writing connected as simply connected. One compact form and a folder. And the important thing is, I didn't say closed, so. I didn't say closed, so the new thing is going to be that the boundary can be non-empty. The boundary does not have to be connected. Then there are groups on this. So I'm going to state that theorem is going to be a lot of symbols that are not defined, and then I'll go on to define them. Go on to define them. So, the mapping class group, what I mean is I take the topological group of homomorphisms, orientation-preserving homomorphisms of the four-manifold, which fix the boundary point-wise, and I consider the connected components of that. That's the topological mechanical group. And so, get C number one. Sorry, there's two cases. I should Case, I shouldn't, I should go away and write this too fast. So X, non-spin, and this thing is isomorphic to the group which I call V. So this is the group of Poincare variations, which I'll explain. It depends on the second homology and the intersection. And the intersection form of the form unifold. So I use lambda x to mean the ordinary intersection pairing on H2. So that's the answer in the non-spin case, and I take a homomorphism and I send it to something called delta F, which I'll define. And then in the case that X is spin, there's a slightly different answer. There's a slightly different answer. So this is kind of the algebraic part which shows up in both cases. And then there's also a contribution from the first harmology rel boundary with Z two coefficients. Two coefficients, because we're dealing with simply connected, this is isomorphic to Z mod 2 to the power number of boundary components minus 1. So if the boundary is connected, this is trivial. And this goes to, well, these are just random symbols at this point, but I want to give them names so I can refer to them later. So the delta F and then the obstruction in here is going to be called theta F. So I just wanted to start off by giving the statement, which I'll then discuss. So let me first of all compare this with the closed case. So this is due to quid. I'm deliberately writing these alphabetical order because for now the Order because somehow the main part of this is the injectivity, which was Quinn's theorem, and the surjectivity of what I'm about to write was due to freedom. There's also some very nice papers by Peron and Crek on this topic. So, yes, this is now X is just going to be closed. So now I just think of orientation preserving homomorphisms of X. Homomorphisms of X, and that's isomorphic to. So, this is, this, maybe none of you have heard of this, this is just isomorphic to the automorphisms of the intersection form, and I just send F to the induced map on the homology. So, this is saying if two homomorphisms induce the same map on the second homology, then they're topologically isotopic, and in every isometry of the intersection pairing is realized by a homomorphism. So, So but this is not what we're going to call this. And so I think there was sort of people were wonder well we were wondering anyway whether this is true in the this extends to the case when the boundary is non-trivial and the answer is that it it doesn't exactly because you have to you have to remember more information to just to be able to decide whether or not two homogenes are isotopic. Two homogenes are isotopic, and this is permanent. But I'm going to compare with this theorem as well, so you can sort of see the difference. Okay. Read all the possible topics. So here's the plan. Define the symbols. I'm going to give some examples. I'm going to give some examples compared with a smooth category and hopefully discuss the truth. And then there's some more topics which I'll just mention now so that I've sort of Which I'll just mention now so that I've said them, but there's a good chance that I won't actually get to them. So one thing is that in this theorem, the homomorphisms have to fix the boundary point-wise. But you can also ask for the mapping class group in the if you didn't have to do that, if you were allowed to move the boundary. And you can. Boundary. And you can deduce. The point is, you can deduce this from this computation plus the fact that there's a lot of, we, as a collective, not necessarily, particularly three manifold topologists, have an extremely good understanding of the diffeomorphism type of the mapping. The mapping task of diff of three manifolds. So this is in particular pi zero and pi one of diff of a three manifold are very well understood and that helps you to deduce this. So I won't say too much about that, but just to point out, you can also think about stable mapping class groups and this can also be deduced from the topological one. Uh from the topological one and um there are applications uh to s to multi-services. In particular, one wants to, as we sort of heard a bit about this this morning, you might want to compare whether or not there's an equivalence of pairs of two surfaces versus whether or not there's a topological isotope. And to do that, it's often very helpful to know about the macro class group, whether your homeomorphism is. Whether your homomorphism is isotopic to identity or not. So, yeah. Any questions so far? Stable means adding on S2 cross S2. Yeah, so that's sort of the other case where you have a chance of being able to figure out the answer.  So I'm just keeping this so that we remember that. And then, yeah, so now I want to define this thing, so what it what it would What is the answer? So, for this, I just need to explain a little bit about what's the algebraic structure of the what is this thing. So, this is what we call concrete variations. And this is due to Seiki, who defined this group. So the lens of given But let's suppose we're given x boundary x is a compact format for then a variation is just a word for a homomorphism from h2 of x well boundary to h to x. So we're going to remember homomorphisms from this group to this group. From this group to this group. And what we want to do is we have a map from this thing to homomorphism as a plan where, so this is this is the image of a homomorphic The image of a homomorphism F is delta F, which is a homomorphism. And what this does is it sends, it takes a relative class in here represented by X, and it sends it to, I just look at the difference of X minus F of X, and then consider that as a horizontal class. So I think about what's sort of going on is I have a, I think of my relative class as like a surface Like a surface in my formula fold with boundary on boundary, and then when I map it under f, I get a different surface, but because f is the identity on the boundary, it stays fixed, and then just the union of these two gives me a closed class, and that's the thing I'm going to remember here. So here's x, here's fx. Is that a little bit of a mess? And so that gives me the information I want. And then this is just this is, I should think of this as a set and a set of all homomorphisms, and then there's a subset of that, which And then there's a subset of that, which is the things that I want to call V. And I'll explain what that is. So this is a subset of this. But the point is that this has a group structure, but it's not the correct group structure for thinking, because I want this map to be a homomorphism. So this one, I'm going to want this to be a homomorphism. And if you just use, this has a group structure from composition, and if you just Has a group structure from composition, and if you just use the standard group structure on home, then it's going to be wrong. But say if you define the group structure that's the correct one on this subset. So, this equals the set of variations such that, so I need to tell you that, yeah. So, to do this, I take h2 of x-rail boundary, that by proper edgeability, that's h upper two of x, and then by universal coefficients, that's h2 of x star, in other words, on h. In other words, homes go to x to z. Here I'm using that it was simply connected. And so now I'm just going to replace h2 of x-row boundary with the dual of h lower2. And then when I have a a variation, I think of it as a map. So now I think of variations as a map from h2 of x star to h two of x. Star for h2x is under this identification. And then there's a condition which is that this equals delta lambda x delta star, which happens, I think of the map from edge to x star to edge to the x. So what you should think about this is two things that it only depends on. Is two things that it only depends on the interception form and on the H2. And I won't go into any details about this, but every time you have something from here, and X is a... I can define this notion for a CW pair, but if X has point graduality, then when I look at the homeomorphisms, I get something that satisfies this equation. That's for sort of so this is this is sort of the right subset of these to look at for manifolds with boundaries and did Psychi define V or only point I definitely defined well the notion of a variation is an old one just it's just if you have a CW pair and you have a map which which fixes the subcomplex. Which fixes the sub-complex? Well, he just meant this, this. Yeah, he defined this and the. Well, yeah, this is by definition what we call Punk RAI variations. The name is. We changed the name because I wanted to sort of indicate that it's the thing that you get because you have Punk RAJ. And I thought I'd actually name my advisor if you stream. So yeah. Now there's it. So to explain this, draw the picture for the sake. So to say I'll do an example to sort of explain how this structure gives you something new, but I just wanted to compare it with the So it has one cool feature, which is that you can recover the induced automorphism on the intersection form from it. So this one I call epsilon, this one I call epsilon. And this is, so this is the map f goes to f. F goes to F goes to F star. And this triangle commutes. So this is F goes to delta F. And now down here, if I take some variation and I send it to E minus delta composed J, where J is just the J is just the standard map from H2 of X to H2 of X r boundary. Then this triangle commutes. Then this triangle commutes. That's sort of easy to see because if I take this on some y in h to x, this is y minus y minus f of x f y, which is f y. So If you start with something here and you did delta F, you eventually get back the induced map on the second topology. So you can recover this and then say you define a group structure such that psi and epsilon are So you get this map that you sort of, it was the sort of original guess, or the naive guess, factors through this thing, and this thing I claim gives more information in general. And in fact, there's an exact sequence which this thing has a kernel, which is the second exterior power of H1. H1 of the boundary dual. This thing is exactly the kernel of this map. So I'll explain how to sort of realize elements in here, but there is a difference. It's not enough to remember the induced map on H2, you have to remember this slightly more sophisticated variation data. And let me just note if If the rank of H1 at the boundary of X is 0 or 1, then the kernel is trivial. Because if this, it doesn't matter if this has torsion, you're taking the dual, so you'll only see the torsion. And if this has rank 0, then of course that's 0. And if it's rank 1, then the second exterior part is trivial. In many cases, if you have rational module-sphere boundaries, Like if you have rational multi-sphere boundaries, then there is no kernel, and this is an isomorphism. Well, sorry, this is an injection, and then there's a particular subset of this that we can define that this maps onto. For many applications, what you really care about is whether it's an injection. I mean, I know there's a particular subset of this that we define that is the image. I don't understand. No, I don't understand the code kernel very well actually. Yeah, that's that's something I'd like to understand better. But it's not a it doesn't have as nice a description as this, unfortunately. I'm gonna ask you that question in the smooth category. I can say things about that. Oh, yeah, no, I guess I mean anyway, we'll come to that. Okay, so that's the data that you, given a homeomorphism, that's the algebraic data that you want to associate to it, is this concrete variation. And yeah, it refines the data that you get from. Um the data that you get from the measuring the induced map on technology. So example So I think it's good yeah it's sort of helpful to have a nice example. Um so this is a this is a three torus, I'm sure you'll agree. Um though I of course I can't draw a three torus but So, of course, I can't draw three torus, but so what I mean is I want to consider a simply connected formula fold with bounded three torus. And so, this is of variation in the kernel of this vertical dialogue. So, what I want to do is sort of consider is sort of consider um a nicer diffimorphism also homie well will be a diffimorphism of this manifold given by taking considering a loop in in the diffimorphisms of t3 just by given by just given by rotating so I just want to rotate this around in along one of the s1 factors that gives me Of the S1 factors, that gives me a loop in the different morphisms of T3. And let's just pretend it's this factor that you can see in the board. There's the extra S1 factor that you can't see. But the two that we can see will be sufficient to understand this symbol. So I take this, and then this gives me a diffimorphism of the product, just because as I go down the internal direction, I rotate. As I go down the internal direction, I rotate more and more. And then I want to insert this into the colour of boundary X. And so then I'm going to draw my picture again. And now I think about a I think about a relatively important thing. About a relative homology class. So, what I need to do is take a relative homology class and this curve in the torus, well, this is simply connected, so it bounds some surface down here. And then I want to think about the image. I'll just say extend by the identity. So I think about the image under the F. And what, I mean, this is going to be a slightly You see how good the picture it turns out. But what I'm thinking is, this, you could just think of it as being kind of a product in this colour, but then as you send it round, it goes around in this direction. So you'll think of it as going around here, the other side of there, and then coming out down here, sort of the same curve it started with. But it's gone, that circle has been sort of sent around one of the T2 frames. Around one of the T2 factors. And then it just continues like before. Or something. It's very easy. The red is not easy to see. Okay. Interesting. Quite green. It is pretty nice. Sorry, I need better classes. I'll screen it. I didn't know that it was a little bit more. I mean, you're going to be very disappointed once you've actually seen this picture. Just imagine a circle being around them. So this is what I call Y, so F sends Y to Y. Sends y to y plus, and I just write t2 for the class of this two torus that you see in the in there. And so y minus f y is minus this class. And this class has to be non-zero just because if you have a simply connected manifold, then we have a connection. Simply connected manifold, then if we had a second moduli class on the boundary, then this h3 is the same as h upper 1 of x, which has to be 0 because we're simply. Okay, so it doesn't matter which curve you're kind of ding twisting around, it's still going to give you the whole T2. It doesn't really matter. Yeah, it's a different T2 then. But which T I mean it's just some as a I just kind of drew I drew the T3 as a t as a as a Taurus and then but I guess I'm just like there's only like one. But I guess I'm just like, there's only like one, that's one factor that you're kind of spinning. I guess I'm not sure. Yeah, I picked a different one on I spot it round. And then just the circle that I started with, and then the direction I spotted it round gives you a two Taurus and a three Taurus. That's the class that I call it. My point is that this class, it's non-trivial in homology of the boundary. It's also non-trivial, it's automatically non-trivial under this map. Automatically non-trigger under this map because the kernel of this map is zero from the long settings of the pair. So, this variation is a non-trivial thing. And note that any segment tomology class in X, you can just consider it as supported away from the boundary, from the column of the boundary. So, the induced map on segment tomology is going to be trivial, but this thing is non-trivial. It's not trivial. Well, there were these two elements in the homology of the boundary, and that's sort of why you had this exterior power for those two elements. So you're sort of saying this is the essential example, right? Essential example. You need the two classes. Yeah. This is going around the other. This is this is my favorite example. Yeah, you can. But I mean you're claiming that's the kernel kind of sort of saying well yes and no. I mean yes in the case that your three manifold on the boundary has a nice loop and hybrid morphisms then you can realize these things with very nice smooth ways These things in a very nice, smooth way, but there are some weird homeomorphisms that aren't obviously realized by that this kind of construction. But yeah, I think it's good to have a nice smooth construction that you can understand to sort of say, okay, this is really a this is really a feature that arises. So now I have to tell you another thing, then the definition of theta f. So remember that in the spin case, I still had the same algebraic data, but then I've also had an abstraction thing here. Construction in here, and this is f goes to delta f minus theta f. So theta f is supposed to be some element in here. So let's take x, x spin, and let's fix the spin structure t on the boundary max. Now let's cons a set of spin structures Structures on X. So this is spin structures on S on X, such that S restricted to the boundary of X is T. So the isomorphism classes of those things. And then the key fact is that this group acts on here. On here and freely and transitively, and this thing is the number, this is the number of bounding components minus one. And so given This is definition. So I claim there exists this theta f in here such that theta f acted on s is f upper star of s. So given the spin structure, we can pull it back to a different spin structure, which agrees with this other one on the boundary. Which agrees with this other one on the boundary, and there's a unique theta f which sends one to the other. And I claim that this is sort of a proposition because it claims that this is independent of the choice of S. And we picked this auxiliary S, but then it didn't actually depend on that choice. And so this defines the So let me do an example of that. So the example of this one is much easier. What this is saying is it's sort of spin structures are, roughly speaking, something to do with thinking about frames and rotating them. And this is saying, is this, as you go along, As you go along, roughly speaking, I think of it as you kind of have an arc from one boundary component to the other, and you want to know, is there some rotation happening as you go along that arc? I mean, that the homeomorphism. Imagine the homeomorphism fixes this arc, and then think about the rotation from what's happening to a frame as you go along it. As you go along it. So it looks a little bit, but that's one of those precise definitions. So EG and X equals just take a three sphere across the interval and then again twist it R. We just take a full rotation in SO4 and then F to be the game tweak. To read to read the game twist, x, t backstar t x on x, t. So of course I don't know how to draw a three-dimensional game to it, so I'll just draw the two-dimensional one. The point is that that's doing a full rotation in your tangent vectors as they go along in the interval direction. So then theta So theta uh theta cache is uh is common zero in this which is zero to in this case. So we can make something like or an ultra cake. Uh yes. Is it easy to see why it does what you do? Is it easy to see why it does if you do that? Um it it it depends on on the way you on what you mean by easy. It's a consequence of the of the fit on our main theorem. So, yeah, let me state that. Um this is the s non-spin case, right? No, this I got mixed up. Spain, we're we're in the spin case. Spin we're we're in the spin case. Yeah, actually it doesn't yeah, so it doesn't it doesn't in the spin case well it doesn't matter. I mean in if you've got connected either one right you can you can find it in all of them if you've got connected boundary so this group is zero so you're just asking about the intuitive variation album also the cut the kernel here with the exterior algebra thing was also trivial because the boundary is S3. So it's really just actually isomorphism to Actually, isomorphism to control water morphology with a intersection. So, yeah, so that's a theorem that I was going to state. So, I'll do that now. So, let's take n closed, one connected, and let me define Tn to N minus T42 to the punching point. So, I'm not doing spin or non-spin. So I'm not doing spin or non-spin, I'm just any any uh form then uh TA is topological is topic to the identity. So this is this is this is Dane twist in colour off the battery, which is S3. And yeah, and I think this is one of the first points where I wanted to compare with the smooth category because I'm not quite sure who to attribute this to, this is a bit confusing, but I I I saw it in if there's something in paper paper of Bragg Conno and Conan Rovko about T of K3. About T of K3 is not smoothly isotopic to identity, which I guess is what you're asking. So it's known, the smoothie piece is non-trivial, but topologically it is. Actually, the K3 surface, there was already an argument for that before Al Paper, but it is also a consequence of that thing. I wanted to also mention GM Sirikisa proved that. Proved that T C B two is smoothly acid object to get into the. So sometimes it just happens if you do this, you do this rotation in the column of the boundary, but then kind of the rest of the three manifold back dissipates and you can sort of undo the rotation using the rest of CP2. But this argument very special to CP2, so there's a question. What about um other M? Shouldn't we just die for all odd ones? Well, that would be nice. Sorry, what did you say? I think it should be topologically trivial for all odd. So for all non-spin forms. Simply connected non-spin regime twist should be topologically unsimple. Moogly, it's moving. Smooth, yeah. Can you say simple? That's what there was a talk about. Peter Crony. There were third talks by Peter Kronheimer and which Karen and I were looking at and which he says that. That statement, but we didn't know. We couldn't figure out why. Amazing comment. I can probably go for mathematics function. Yeah, physical recognition. Well. Yeah, that'd be cool. I'd like to know that. Yeah, so I think what happens is if you take a strange proposal. No, it's a two more. Oh yeah, more generally, suppose that boundary of X is connected cipher fiberspace, then also then there's an analogous So then there's an analogous TN, because you can just rotate around the fibers, the S1 fibers of the silent fiberspace, and that gives you also a loop in the different orphans of the boundary. I just call it TX now. So rotate fibers. And this is And this is topologically I suppose to be identity, um, but then also uh smoothly it'll be good to know. Um yeah, so checking work in problems. Yeah, okay, so if people are thinking about it, that's good. So it seemed to me that there's a So it seemed to me that the gauge theorist should be able to say something about these questions. Yes. But, you know. I could retrain as a gauge theorist or I could let you guys do it. That's my philosophy. Maybe I couldn't retrain. Anyways. We won't test it. So what did we do? Oh yes. First of all, how what how I don't have the time. How long am I talking? About five minutes. How long? Yook, so. Okay, okay, that's weird. Okay, let me ask you another question. Suppose I have a format fold with, again, simply connected, it has two boundary components, and the wire lies the hyperfold. So pi one of diff of y is triple. I understand. Then I want to know, then our theorem says, okay, so suppose x is spin, then there exists a homeo from x to x. From x to x with vt and f not zero. That's a consequence of the theorem. But it's a purely topological construction. And does there exist? So here's a special case. Does there exist a diffier with e to f non zero? So that's, I think there's lots of questions you can ask about. People have been focusing on if you have two diffimorphisms, are they smoothly isotopic or not? But I think there's some also some good new realization questions for does there exist a different morphism realizing this invariant with this, especially with this theta f invariant that might be something that people I don't have a thing about how easy that is, but it's a question. I'll tell you one more theorem. So if I've got if all my YIs are Hedi genus and most one, then there exist There exists a diffimorphism realizing any theta f in, I mean this is supposed to be as many Y I's as you like, I just don't do four of them. So we can show that you can actually find a diffimorphism by doing this collar rotating in the collar construction. In the case of these are all lens spaces or S1 plus S2 or S3, and for those S1 plus S2 or S3, and for those, there is a rotation of them that realizes all the things. Okay, so I better say for all cipher fiber, it's just tricky. Problem is, yeah. I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but it sounds cool. Yeah. Um I I tried I I mean we tried to come up with a formula for the um if we're all certified with spaces. Um If we're all sophisticated spaces, but you have to understand, so your manifold has a unique spin structure, and then you get some induced spin structure on the boundary. And your sci-fi fiber that you're rotating along might be non-trivial in homology. So you sort of have to understand what the induced spin structure is on the boundary. And then you want to know, again, trying to figure out my rotation that's happening around the neighbourhood of the cypher fiber. Around the neighborhood of the cyber fiber, in terms of the cyber variance, but you have to, there's this extra complication that you don't know exactly what spin structure on the boundary you've got. And it sort of depends on the formula for it. So I found it quite hard to make a general formula for that. For these, there exists a cipher fibre structure. Lens spaces have many cipher fiber structures. So we're able to find that, it's just show that there is a cipher fiber structure such that the rotation using that one. It could be that you use the wrong cipher fiber structure and then you get. The wrong cycle file structure, and then you get doesn't work. There's another subtle um okay, um, so the proof. I've only just got one minute. Um, I'll say something. So I need to just use a say what it is. So uh there's a definition about um two homomorphisms. Two homeomorphisms from x to x are pseudoisotopic if there exists a homomorphism from x cross i to itself, where g restricted to x cross zero equals f, g restricted to x cross one equals f prime, and g restricted to boundary x. And g restricted to boundary x cross i is the identity. And so every isotopy gives you a pseudoisotopy because an isotopy is a level preserving pseudoisotopy. But this map might not be level preserving, but like our concordances aren't necessarily isotopies, but this is sort of like the opponent's version of concordance versus isotopy. And so the proof consists of two steps. Consists of two steps, very simplified version. Classify homios up to pseudo isotopy. So this is the main thing for the especially for the ejectivity. Yeah, this is this is the ejectivity. Activity. I should mention that the surge activity surge activity follows without too much difficulty from work of Boyer and Stakey. So there's some extra arguments in there, but the key arguments, you can sort of realize things by homeomorphisms were done. Things by homeomorphisms were done essentially done before. So the main thing that we're doing is trying to do the injectivity, that's the hardest part. And the key part of that is classifying homeomorphisms after pseudoisotopia. And this is something that you can attack with surgery theory. And then we apply this theorem of Quinn that for X, one connected Connected topological formanophold, formanophole pseudoisotopy Did Perome do that? Did what? Per Peron. He he did it in some special case. I can say Peron as well, but he did it for smooth manifolds. It for smooth manifolds without one handles. I find mentioning input, but the full result was we apply this theorem to get to then get the isotopy. And I think then Slam is going to talk about this. Uh then I'll s the the buzzer went so I'll stop. All right, are there any questions for Mark? How does the hyperbolicness come from? Where does it? I mean, I just, this was an assumption for the question. But the reason why, do you mean the reason why I made the assumption? Yeah, but just because that's Yeah, but just because that's a I want to say that there's no interesting loops of diffimorphisms. So there's no sort of obvious way of constructing a of doing this construction, inserting that loop into the column to get a smooth realization of the map. So I know by the by the theorem that there exists a homomorphism from all of this well from from this part. Well, from this part, but I don't know whether there's a diffimorposum. And what I'm saying is, I'm making assumptions so that the kind of obvious way of trying to make a diffimorphism won't work. Does that also extend to graph manifolds or other three manifolds? Is hyperbolic that's sort of the thing that's not understood? thing that's not understood in this room? The point about the cipher fibered is that there is some interesting limits to the organisms for graphics. The topological isotopic, anytime you do something interesting in a column of the boundary, you're oh, wait a minute, sorry, I think I just missed it. I just realized I did something that was speaking. Maybe first my question asks: What do we know about pi one of the few Marxism groups of graph mathematics? One, collectively, collectively, what does one know? I told me. What does one know? I don't know if I'm going to have to tell you that right now. I don't have to quit. This is so sad. It's quite a lot. Graph manifolds, you have the second hard group blocks where the fundamental groups are. There's quite a variety of little upgrade WP control spaces. But then if you have a complicated JSJ decomposition, you get a semi-direct product decomposition. It's sort of understood, but it's not there's a procedure, yeah. Is it known whether like Is it known whether, like, if there are two different three manifolds in this group of diffeomorphisms that are homotopy equidal? I'm not a mathematical. I actually know cemeteries and don't do what type of a point. Oh, okay. So any two generic hyperbolic three manifolds do the job of state. Because a generic hyperbolic three manifold will have enough symmetries and all of the higher homotopy groups looks like the isomatopy exists. I don't know, I guess I was preparing to talk about four manifolds. All right, let's take Mark and take a three five-minute break.  I feel like I'm not sure if you're not sure about it. I mean, you just draw a calendar and everything on the screen. But why is that? So boundary curve. Now I'll just keep it. So one thing we should do is what's the difference? Yeah, it's up to be nice now. Yeah, I think you can just show us records and have a lot of emails or something. No, I just wanted to jump. I mean, there must be one source. Yeah. So first, there's something else. Oh, yeah. Something is great. Harder. I was going to say, I scared people too. I don't know where he's supposed to give it out. But it was red to the dark. I feel like Deadflook is just
