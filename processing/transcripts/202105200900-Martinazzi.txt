Shall we start, Luca? Yes, yes, yes, we can start. Okay. So our final speaker in the second session of today is Lukta from Padova. And the title of his talk is Local and Non-Local Singular Review Equations in Euclidean Spaces. In Euclidean spaces, please. Thank you. Thank you very much for the introduction and to the organizers for the invitation. This is a joint work with Ali Heider, who's now in Zurich, but he just got a professorship at Tata Institute in Bangalore, and Gabriele Mancini, who got a professorship at the University of Bari recently. So let me start with something that now is okay. Something classical. Classical, semi-classical. So let's consider this partial differential equation. It corresponds to prescribing the Q curvature in the Euclidean space in the sense that if U is a solution of this nonlinear PD, then this conformal metric, to U times the Euclidean metric, has constant Q curvature. And this constant, 2n minus 1 factorial, is chosen because it is the Q curvature of the sphere. And this V here is just the volume. V here is just the volume. So, if you use the stereographic projection, you can pull back the metric of the round sphere and you obtain a solution of the equation, which is exactly this logarithmic solution. And then you can translate it and rescale it with various transformations. So, you call these functions here spherical solutions of the prescribed Q-curvature equation. Okay, so a natural problem is whether there are also non-spherical solutions. Whether there are also non-spherical solutions. In dimension 2, which corresponds to m equal to 1, the answer is no. This was proven by Chen and Li. All the solutions are spherical, but Elise Chang and Wen Xiong Chen proved that in dimension 4 and higher, here we are in even dimension in R2M. There are always also non-spherical solutions for every volume below the volume of the sphere. And so to separate spherical and non-spherical solutions, Spherical and non-spherical solutions, there are various results depending on the behavior at infinity. For instance, Ellis and Paul proved that if you can pull back your conformal metric, you can pull back it to the sphere and extend it to a smooth metric on the sphere, then the original metric, conformal metric in the Euclidean space is spherical. Or younger and shu, they prove that if at infinity the behavior of u is less than quadratic, then again you have a spherical metric. Then again, you have a spherical metric. But in full generality, if you don't assume anything at infinity, it was Chanchulin in dimension four who gave a complete classification. He proved that either the metric is spherical or it can be decomposed as a logarithmic part, let's call it V, it behaves like a logarithm, and the polynomial part, and the polynomial has degree at most two. No, in fact, it has degree exactly two. And then if you compute the Laplace, And then, if you compute the Laplacian, the Laplacian of V goes to zero, while the Laplacian of P will be a constant from zero. So, this condition separates spherical from non-spherical, because spherical metrics are logarithmic at infinity. So, all the derivatives go to zero. Non-spherical metrics have derivatives which do not go to zero. And so, a few years ago, I extended this result to the case of dimension six and higher. You obtain a similar result if the metric is non- If the metric is non-spherical, it is v plus p, where v is logarithmic and p is a polynomial. There is a difficulty, though, here that these polynomials now have degree at the most 2m minus 2. So in dimension 6, it could be 4. This creates some technical challenges that we will discuss later. Let me remind you just that this kind of classification results are useful when you study compactness problems, for instance, in the prescribed. Problems, for instance, in the prescribed Q-curvature equation. Imagine that you have a closed manifold of even dimension, and on this closed manifold, you have a conformal metrics with Q-curvatures that are uniformly bounded in C1 or even converging in C1 and bounded volumes. And you ask whether these metrics are compact. And the answer is sometimes it could be that they converge, a subsequence converges in a good norm, or the series blow up at finite limits. Or the trees blow up at finitely many points. And at each of these points, you have a spherical metric appearing, and therefore, you have the amount of curvature that concentrates is precisely this quantity. I call it lambda spherical. It is the total Q-curvature of the sphere. And this is an argument of blow-up kind. Like you rescale the metric near a blow-up point, and you end up with a solution of the previous. With a solution of the previous equation on the Euclidean space. And this has a long history, this kind of blow-up results, starting with Brezi-Smerle, Linchafried, and then Andrea Chechnya. These kind of results, for instance, are very useful to prescribe curvature results like the uniformization result of Zindin Jadli with Andrea Malchioli, and so on. A bit surprisingly, similar compactness results holds. Results hold also in the case of the Adams Moser-Trudinger embedding. For instance, if you take critical points of this embedding, it's an embedding in which you bound this integral on functions that are in a certain Sobolev space with norm in the Soble space bounded by a geometric constant. This constant here is the lambda spherical that we saw before. Then, if you have a sequence of critical points, Points, they satisfy this non-linear equation that comes from just the Euler-Lagrange equation of this problem. Then, either you have compactness or you have blow-up at finitely many points. And each point will carry an amount of Dirichlet energy that is equal to the total Q-curvature of the sphere. And the reason for the appearance of the Q-curvature in this non-geometric problem is that if you do blow up of this non-linearity, Of this non-linearity, after blow-up, you obtain the Louville non-linearity into the 2mu. So, even if the equation here is non-geometric, you can see that asymptotically it becomes geometric if you do a good rescaling. And also, this kind of compactness results are useful if you want to study, for instance, the existence of extremals of this problem, like in the famous result of Elise Chang-El-Lenar-Carlezon, or the existence of critical points for higher energy. There is a lot of work that is being done. Energy, there is a lot of work that is being done, so it is useful to curvature also in this setting. You can also go in the odd-dimensional case. In this case, the equation in Rn will be non-local because you have a fractional power of the Laplacian, but the result will be the same. Every solution is either spherical or d plus p and p is a polynomial. By the way, the degree of the polynomial, the maximum. Way the degree of the polynomial, the maximum degree of the polynomial, is such that the polynomial belongs to the kernel of the operator, in this case, minus laplacian to the n over 2. So it's not so mysterious. This was done, I did it with Tianlin Jin, Alimalui, and Xinjiang Xiang in dimension 3. It was fairly easy. Much more difficult was the higher dimensional case done by Ali Haider, because you have to do a lot of elliptic estimates. Have to do a lot of elliptic estimates for a non-local operator. So, that was subtle work of Ali Haider. And these kind of results can be applied, for instance, if you want to prescribe the Q curvature on a three-dimensional manifold. It could be, for instance, the boundary of a CCE manifold that has been discussed in several talks in this conference. So, we did a model case with Azara de la. Case with Azara, De Latorre, Mar Gonzalez, and Ali Haider in dimension three, but a lot more work can be done on these lines. Okay, so that's somehow the classical situation, pretty well known. Instead, in this talk, I would like to talk about what happens. Oh, sorry, sorry, bad timing. I still want to conclude by giving a sketch of the proof. A sketch of the proof of Shang Xuing's result. Chinese wing result. So you define the function v, this decomposition v plus p, by taking the convolution of the fundamental solution of the Laplacian to the right power, which is this logarithm, with the nonlinearity that you have in the equation. So if you do that, d has the same Laplacian to the n over 2 of the function u, and it's not so difficult to prove that it is. And it's not so difficult to prove that it is lower bounded by so what we would like to prove is that asymptotically V behaves like a logarithm times a constant alpha minus alpha which is determined by the integral of the nonlinearity times a constant. So the lower bound is fairly easy to prove. Then the fact that u is d plus p where p is a polynomial depends on the fact that the Laplacian of P is zero. So you can apply a So you can apply a Leuville-type theorem. And so it will be a polynomial of degree less than n. The tricky part here, in dimension 6 and higher, is to prove that P is upper bounded. Because in dimension 4, the polynomials will be of degree 2. And then up to a translation, they're all quadratic forms. They are very explicit. In dimension 6, or even 5, you start... Or even five, you start having polynomials of degree four, and they are much more complicated to control. It's much more complicated to study their asymptotic behavior. In fact, here I had to resort to a result of Goring about asymptotic properties of polynomials. It's a very strange thing that you need to use a result that has to do with elimination of variables of polynomials, something that I do not really understand, to be able to do the necessary analysis for this. Necessary analysis for this problem. But once you have this result of Goring, you can prove that these polynomials are upper bounded. And once they are upper bounded, in the elliptic estimate, they do not create any problems because they will appear in the exponential here, but they will just contribute a constant. And so now the main difficulty in Lin's paper is to prove that the nonlinearity cannot concentrate in small balls near infinity. In small balls near infinity. So you can do that if you are able to prove that for some q greater than one, you have a little bit more integrability than just L1. The original assumption is that the nonlinearity is in L1. We would like to have an estimate of this form of ball of radius 1 e to the n q times u is uniformly bounded as x goes to infinity. And this is done by elliptic estimates. And so once you have this upper bound with an elder inequality, you can prove that V cannot have peaks near infinity. So V is also upper bounded. And so this completes Lin's result and the higher dimensional generalizations. Okay, now I really want to talk about what happens if we put a singularity in the equation. So now we write this equation here. Write this equation here, it's like the prescribed Gaussian curvature in dimension two in R2, where the prescribed curvature is one because in front of the exponential we have one, and this beta delta zero corresponds to a conical singularity at the origin, okay, and we require finite volume. With this transformation, we can actually reduce this equation to this other equation, which is prescribed Gaussian curvature equation, but with no constant. With non-constant Gaussian curvature, which vanishes at zero, and now we remove the delta of Dirac, and the finite volume now becomes a finite Gaussian curvature. So we know pretty much everything about this equation. We know that there are some explicit solutions, radially symmetric, for which the total curvature is 4π times 1 plus alpha. Channel Li proved to be the curve. Channel Li proved that actually, for every solution of our problem, of this problem 7, the total curvature must be this 4 pi times 1 plus alpha. But I couldn't prove that every solution is radial. And the reason is that this is false. You cannot apply the moving plane technique here because the curvature is increasing. In fact, surprisingly, Sagoun, Chanilo, and Michael Kiesling proved that if alpha is an integer, If alpha is an integer, you have also non-radial solutions. They are given explicitly by this formula that Chanil and Kiesling found. And if you observe this formula a little bit, zeta will be a complex number. If zeta is equal to zero, then you are back to the previous formula. If zeta is non-zero and you let lambda go to plus infinity, you will find solutions that blow up at alpha plus one points. At alpha plus one points, which are the vertices of a polygon with alpha plus one edges. And finally, Prajapat and Gabriele Tarantello proved that these are all the solutions you can have. So if alpha is non-integer, then you only have the radial solutions. And if alpha is integer, you only have these solutions of Chenil and Kiesling, which contain also the previous one. Previous one. Okay, so we wanted to see what happens if we go to higher dimensions. So now start with n greater than or equal to 3, and you look at the same problem. Just instead of the Laplacian, you have this power of De Laplacian, which by the way, I haven't said it, but on Rn, this corresponds to the GJMS operator. Okay, we just don't see this just because the metric is flat. So the questions are: do we have solutions? Do we have solutions? For which lambda we have solutions, and how they behave at infinity? So, the strategy that we will follow to answer these questions is a little bit unorthodox in the sense that we will start studying the asymptotic behavior of the solutions before knowing that they exist. From this asymptotic behavior, we will obtain some compactness result for lambda below a critical threshold. A critical threshold, let me call it lambda alpha. It is lambda spherical, the total Q curvature of the sphere, times 1 plus alpha. This is the analog of this 4 pi, the total Gaussian curvature of S2, 1 plus alpha. So below this critical threshold, we will have compactness. With this compactness, we can prove existence below the critical threshold. So this is a new phenomenon because in dimension two, This is a new phenomenon because, in dimension two, we only have solutions at the critical threshold. Now, we also have subcritical solutions. And finally, from these subcritical solutions, we construct critical solutions for lambda equal to lambda alpha. So the first result is the analog of what I already presented before. Every solution of this equation is of the form V plus P, where V is logarithmic and P is a polynomial of the right uh degree. Of the right degree. And if p is constant, well, this corresponds to having total curvature, total q curvature equal to the critical value lambda alpha. In fact, we will call the solutions normal. They are the analog of the spherical solutions when we have constant q curvature. So if in this decomposition d plus p, p is constant, we say that the solution is a normal solution. Solution is a normal solution. So now the right way of saying problem four is: do we have normal solutions? Okay, now the reason why we follow this strategy is that we don't have any explicit solutions. So before we did the opposite, we started with radial solutions because they are explicit. And even in the case of constant Q curvature in higher dimension, you start with explicit solutions and then Solutions, and then which are the critical ones, the spherical ones, and then you move to more general solutions if they exist. In this case, we don't have any explicit formula, so we have to work in this way. Now, the strategy of the proof of this theorem, this asymptotic behavior of V plus P, partly is similar to the one of Chen Shulin. So we start in the same way. We define V as the convolution of the fundamental operation. The convolution of the fundamental operator, a fundamental solution of the right power of the Laplacian, times the nonlinearity. Okay, here is the curvature, the singular curvature, times e to the n w. Then we have the decomposition w equal to v plus p. p is a polynomial by Louville theorem as before. The problem is that now, even with the theorem of Gauding that I mentioned before, we don't have enough control on the Have enough control on the polynomial to have a good estimate, to have good elliptic estimates, to have uniform elliptic estimates that rule out the concentration of the nonlinear part here. And so we were stuck for quite some time until we realized that we don't need elliptic estimates. We can write everything in just playing with the integrals. So, what we wrote is this quantity. Uh, quantity. If you ignore this one over rho to this strange power, this is just the BMO semi-normal. So you take x very large, and then for rho less than one, you take the average of u minus the average. This is just the BMO semi-norm. Except that now you also divide by a power, a positive power of the radius of the ball. So this is a little bit stronger than the BMO semi-norm. And my claim is that you can prove that this quantity, the super. That you can prove that this quantity, the supremum of all this radius, goes to zero as x goes to infinity. And you can prove this, well, writing explicitly in this formula what v is, and then just using Fubini's theorem and Elder's inequality. So everything is done by hands without using any elliptic estimates or strange subtle results. Once you have that, you might remember about Campanato spaces. This is actually a Campanato semi-norm. This is actually a Campanato semi-norm that you've bounded. If you didn't have rho, this was the BMO semi-norm. If you add this power of rho, you have the campanato semi-norm L1 n plus sigma, where sigma is exactly this power, 1 over log x. And these spaces are isomorphic to spaces of elder continuous functions by Campanato's theorem. And therefore, you can bound the Campanato, the Elder continuous semi-norm of V. continuous semi-norm of v in a suitable with a suitable Elder exponent that goes to zero as x goes to plus infinity by a quantity that diverges less than log of mod x. Now this doesn't look a very good estimate but it is sufficient to bound the oscillation of w in a way that degenerates at infinity slow enough. And this is sufficient if you go back to This is sufficient if you go back to this definition of v to prove that e to the n w does not concentrate enough to create spikes in the function v. And so in the end, you obtain that v is well behaved at infinity. In fact, this approach with company spaces also gives, in the non-singular case, also gives a new proof, in fact, a much simpler proof of the result of Chan-Schulin. It's really a new approach. Really, a new approach. So, once you have this result, you prove the existence of subcritical solutions as follows. You construct them in the form v minus a polynomial of degree 2, let's take minus x squared plus a constant. Then you have to solve for v using a fixed point argument that is extremely standard. And in this fixed point argument, you need some a priori bounds. And the a priori bounds are obtained by the previous theorem. By the previous theorem, in the sense that if a sequence of approximate solutions in Shefford's theorem blows up, then you can extract a normal solution. You can extract a solution without the polynomial. And by the previous theorem, if you have a normal solution without polynomials, you must have that the total curvature is lambda alpha. But now you are in the subcritical case. Okay, so you get a contradiction. So you have uniform bounds, then you have solutions in the subcritical case. Then you have solutions in the subcritical case. And then you go from the subcritical case to the critical case by letting lambda k go to lambda alpha from below. So you take a sequence of solutions as constructed in the previous theorem. You prove that they blow up necessarily at the origin. And then you rescale these blown up solutions. You remove the polynomial x squared. You just consider the vk. You rescale this vk at the origin. This VK at the origin with a suitable choice of radii, and you prove that these rescaled functions converge to a normal solution. It should be a normal solution with lambda equal lambda alpha. Okay, so this leaves a couple of open problems. For instance, all the solutions that we've constructed with these methods are radial. But in the case of dimension two, when alpha is integer, Dimension two, when alpha is integer, we also have the non-radial solutions of Chanil and Kiesling. So it is open whether you can also have this kind of solutions when alpha is integer in this higher dimension. I would expect that it is at least possible to construct them via the Yapuno-Schmidt construction because we know how they behave in dimension two. They have peaks at the edges of a polygon. So maybe it is possible to do something similar. Is possible to do something similar here. It is not clear whether if alpha is non-integer, we only have radial solutions. And it is also open whether we can have solutions also in the supercritical regime, also for curvature that goes above the critical one. We have some positive partial results when n is equal to 3 and 4. And finally, let me mention that this is a little bit anortal. Let me mention that this is a little bit an orthodox way of constructing normal solutions by starting with subcritical solution was used by myself and Ali Haider also to study this prescribed Q-curvature equation in dimension 4, where here the Q-curvature changes sign. This sign-changing problem arises from prescribing the Q-curvature in a four-manifold when the Q-curvature changes sign. When the Q curvature changes sign, and let's say the maximum goes to zero from above, and near a maximum point, you will see one minus the H when you blow up. So, you might expect to have solutions of this kind after blow up. And so, we proved with Ali Haider that this equation has solutions if and only if lambda belongs to this range of values. So it must be less than the total Q-curvature of the sphere, but not too small. And it was a little bit surprising. And it was a little bit surprising because, in the two-dimensional case, Michael Struve, who actually introduced this kind of problem into dimension, Struve proved that this is not possible. In dimension two, solutions to the analog problem do not exist, but in dimension four, normal solutions to this problem exist. So maybe they could even appear in the blow-up of sign-changing Q-curvature. This is still open. So, anyway, I think the time is up. So anyway, I think the time is up, so I would stop here. Thank you for your attention. Thank you. Any questions, comments? May I ask a couple of questions? Sure. Yeah, go ahead. Have you studied the linearized equation for these normal solutions? For these normal solutions, because I was thinking maybe you could also get non-radial solutions by bifurcation theory. So if there is some kernel, yeah, right. No, we haven't done that. Yes, we haven't studied the linearized operator, no, but that's a very good idea. And do you expect also non-normal non-radial solutions, maybe with the same symmetries as quadra-paragrand? I think that should be much. I think that should be much easier in the sense that for non-normal solutions, I expect to be able to prescribe any polynomial at infinity of the right degree. It must be not such high degree. So, for instance, if you are in dimension four, you can prescribe any two-dimensional degree two polynomial at infinity. So, in that the difficult part is, for instance, if you prescribe a radial polynomial, is the solution necessarily radial? Radial, and you cannot apply the moving plane technique because of the fact that the curvature is increasing. So, with non-right, okay, okay, or maybe there could be non-radial solutions that are radial at infinity, asymptotically radial. Could we have non-radial solutions that are radial at infinity? That's an open problem, and not an easy one, in my opinion. Yeah, thanks. Oh, yeah. I want to say that, you know. I want to say that in other problems for the original Q curvature, not this with singularity, we frequently add an assumption like scalar curvature positive to force the solution to be normal. Is that the thing in this program? I haven't thought about that, but yes, I expect that because when the solution is non-normal, then there is this polynomial. Normal, then there is this polynomial by definition of non-normal solution. This polynomial goes to negative infinity pretty fast, and this forces the negative curve, the scalar curvature to go to negative infinity. So you expect in this case your polynomial will become constant? Yes, exactly. If you give a lower bound of the scalar curvature, not even positive, just that it. Curvature, not even positive, just that it is lower bounded, then the polynomial must be constant. This also applies to this singular problem. In my opinion, yes. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Any other questions, comments? Okay, let's thank Luca again and also all the speakers in the second session and all in the In the second session, and all in the morning. Okay, that ends the session for today.
