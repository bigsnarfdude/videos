And as you mentioned, the title is Regular F-manifolds and integrable hierarchies, because the main topic is this class of geometric structures called F-manifolds. And actually, here the name is not just used to denote these F-manifold structures, but a collection of several generalizations of the Frobenius. Of the Frobenius manifold structure. So, this will be done under some assumption of regularity, which wants to generalize the notion of semi-simplicity and in relation with some integrable hierarchies. The plan is to first recall the definition of a Frobenius manifold, as you saw in the past few days, and to give a quick overview on the theory of Frobenius manifolds. Then, to generalize the manifold, the Then, to generalize part of this theory to some of these F-manifold classes, and to introduce this notion of regularity, explaining how semi-simplicity can be seen as a special case of it, in relation with some integrable hierarchies. In particular, by the end of the talk, I will introduce, I will discuss some results in the Frobenius setting, in the regular non-semi-simple case, and in this more general setting. And in these more general settings, in relation with some integrable hierarchies. So, as promised, let me start by recalling the definition of a Frobenius manifold. These objects are also called Dubrovin Frobenius manifolds because they were introduced by Dubrovin by the end of the 80s. So, consider a finite-dimensional differential manifold M of dimension, say, M. The structure of a Frobenius. The structure of a Frobenius manifold on it is given by first a flat and non-degenerate metric, here denoted by eta, whose Levitu-Eta connection I denoted by NABLA. Then we have a commutative and associative product on the tangent bundle with structural constants here denoted by Cijk. This product has to be compatible with the flat metric by satisfying. By satisfying these two compatibility requirements, the first one expresses the fact that the metric is invariant with respect to this product. The second one, that the covariance derivative of the product is asymmetric tensor when considering exchanges in the lower indices. And then we have two vector fields, small e and big e. Small e is called the unit vector field, for it is required. Field, for it is required to be the unit of the product, and moreover, flat or covariantly constant. And then the second field, Big E, is called the Euler vector field because it satisfies these three homogeneity requirements, expressing compatibility with the product, the unit, and the metric. In particular, a constant called the charge of the Frobenius manifold appears here. These three conditions may be given slightly different in Be given slightly different in the course of the past few days, but it's they are the same notions. So, you also saw that these objects were introduced in the hope of giving a geometric interpretation to a set of partial differential equations known as the WDV equations, after the names of Witten, Diegraf, and the Berlin twins. And the relation between WDV equations and Frobenius methods. D D V equations and Frobenius manifolds go through what is called a Frobenius potential. More precisely, consider the Frobenius manifold of dimension and a set of flat coordinates where the first one is in particular associated to the unit vector fields. One can find a function f of the flat coordinates which satisfies this system for the third partial derivatives of the function. Of the function expressed by lowering one index in the structural constants of the product by means of the metric. This is called a Frobenius potential and gives a solution to this system of partial differential equations, which are precisely the WDVB equations. In particular, the second set of relations here compares the Frobenius potential with the metric, while the last one expresses the fact that the metric While the last one expresses the fact that Euler vector field rescales the Frobenius potential up to some quadratic term, which is here denoted by Q. And the first step expresses the associativity property of the product on the Frobenius manifold. For these reasons, these equations are also called of associativity type. So, starting from a Frobenius manifold, one gets a Frobenius potential, which gives a society. Aphrodite's potential, which gives a solution to the WDB equations. And conversely, actually, starting from a solution to the WDVB equation, this can be considered as a Frobenius potential. So it can be used to reconstruct by means of these relations, at least locally, the structure of a Frobenius manifold. And this gives part of the motivation behind the introduction of Frobenius manifolds. Something more can be told by Something more can be told by considering the tangent spaces at each point, which inherits the structure of Aphrobinius algebra. You also saw this notion as defined by a commutative and associative product which is unital and with respect to which some non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form called the Frobenius form or the Frobenius pairing is asked to be invariant. Asked to be invariant. So the structure which is inherited on the tangent space is quite obvious. I say that this lies, that this can explain also part of the motivation behind reintroduction of Frobenius manifolds, because Frobenius algebras can be phrased also in the language of two-dimensional topological field theories. I'm not going to define these objects, but for those who are not familiar with them, For those who are not familiar with them, just know that they can be expressed in terms of, loosely speaking, some surfaces which interpolate their own boundary, when both the surface and the boundary are meant to carry an orientation. In particular, you can think of these three objects here, where the first one is called the handle, because if one moves the right part of the boundary to the left side, sorry, by reversing its Sorry, by reversing its orientation, one gets the actual shape of a handzel. The second one is called the pair of pens, and the last one is called the cup. And these three objects are exactly playing the roles of, respectively, the Frobenius pairing, the product of a Frobenius algebra, and its unit. If you want to convince yourself about this, think of how the associativity property of the product can be visualized by this change. Visualized by these chains of equalities involving two copies of the pair of pens, or by how the invariance of the Frobenius pairing can be proven with respect to the product by this other chain of equalities. So this concludes the very first motivational part that I wanted to present today. Actually, Frobenius manifolds turn out to be quite ubiquitous in mathematics and physics, but to And physics. But today, I want to discuss just briefly the relation that they have with integrable hierarchies going through the principal hierarchy. I'll be quick as you saw it in the past days. And the relations that they have with some generalizations of topological field theories known as homological field theories. So, as for the relation with the principal hierarchy, you saw that if You saw that if you consider a set of flat coordinates V1 up to Vm for the Frobenius manifold, you can lower the indices in these coordinates by means of the metric into defining these functions theta alpha zero, where alpha goes from one to the dimension n of the manifold. And then, by means of these recursive formulas, you can also define n lists. Define n lists of functions here indexed by alpha and p going from one on, which can be in turn used to define n lists of partial differential equations which define pairwise commuting flows. So in this sense, an integrable hierarchy, which is called the principal one. You also saw some examples and the easiest one is provided by The easiest one is provided by the one-dimensional case where the Frobenius potential is of this form. And this is what, on a level of the principal hierarchy, produces the so-called dispersionless KDV hierarchy, which, as one may expect, can be deformed into the full KDB hierarchy. This is not just a peculiarity of the KDB, but it is something that can be. But it is something that can be done under some assumption of semi-simplicity, as was done by Dubrovin and John. So the resulting hierarchies more in general are called of topological type or Dubrovin-Jang hierarchies. This assumption of semi-simplicity can be phrased in the language of Robinius algebras first. So I briefly recall it. It is the requirement for It is the requirement for the existence of a basis of idempotent vectors, so idempotent elements of these satisfying these relations with respect to the product. You saw it as phrased by the requirement of the algebra not admitting the presence of some not idempotence elements. Sorry. Elements, sorry. Um, I just can't come up with the right work word. You just basically saw it as a requirement for the absence in this algebra of some non-zero element which admits some vanishing integer power. But basically, these two definitions are equivalent. So, this can be translated in the language of Robinius manifolds. Of Frobenius manifolds by saying that a Frobenius manifold is semi-simple if, at a generic point, the tangent space at that point carries the structure of a Frobenius algebra. And under such semi-simplicity assumption, Dubroving showed that there can be found some coordinates called canonical coordinates, which are related to the basis of identity. Basis of idempotent vector fields, which is guaranteed by the semi-simplicity assumption. In particular, if one denotes such coordinates by u1, u2 up to un, these are the formulas expressing the relations of the product. And in particular, the structural constants of the product are expressed in terms of products of chronicle delta. So they assume a very easy form. The unit and the Euler vector field are written this. The Euler vector field are written this way, and in particular, the operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field is represented in canonical coordinates by a diagonal matrix, where on the diagonal one can read the canonical coordinates. As for the relation with homological field theories, which were introduced in 1994 by Koncevich and Manin, as I mentioned to generalize topological field theories, I'm not giving the definition. I'm not giving the definition explicitly, properly, which is quite axiomatic. I'm just recalling that these objects can be defined as families of linear maps. These maps are here denoted by omega g n, where the indices labeling them g and n are non-negative integers, satisfying this compatibility requirement by which twice g minus two plus By which twice g minus 2 plus n is strictly greater than zero. The generic map of the homological field theory, labeled with g and n, goes from the nth tensor power of some base vector space, which is denoted here by v, and which is asked to carry the structure of a non-degenerate bilinear symmetric form together with some distinguished element here denoted by one, and takes value in the cohomology ring of. Value in the homology ring of the moduli space of stable curves of genus G and N marked points, Mg and bar, where the stability of the curves defining the space is reflected in this requirement on the indices. And among the axioms defining such a comological field theory, we have the compatibility with respect with three natural maps that one can define between these models. Can define between these moduli spaces. Together, they are called the tautological maps, and they are three. The first one is the forgetful map, which is so called because it is a projection that forgets the last marked point, where one may need to stabilize the resulting curve due to the fact that when dropping one marked point, the condition of stability may not be matched anymore. Anymore. And then we have two gluing maps, so-called because they glue together two marked points. The first one is called of non-separating kind because it glues together marked points belonging to the same curve. The second one is called of separating kind because it glues together marked points belonging to different curves. And to our perspective, homological field theories are Field theories are interesting for two main reasons. The first one is that out of a homological field theory, one gets a Frobenius algebra. In fact, some product, here denoted by star and called the quantum product, can be defined between any pair of two vectors V1 and V2 living in the Bayes space D, satisfying this condition. So it's defined as the unique vector. Unique vector such that for any other vector B3 in the space V, this can be expressed this way in terms of the first map, omega 0, 3, of the cohomological field theory, where this is the first map due to the stability requirement. So it is natural to say that the homological field theory is semi-simple when such a Frobenius algebra is semi-simple. Semi-simple. Okay, so the second interesting thing for us is that out of a homological field theory, one can get a family of numbers called the correlators of the cohomological field theory, which are defined by integrating over Mgm bar the maps of the cohomology evaluated at some tensor product of some elements in the vector. Some elements in the vector space V, together with some non-negative integer powers of some homology classes called the psi classes. These correlators numbers can be arranged together into defining a function, a generating series, which is called the potential or the homological field theory. What's interesting for us is that if one only considers the genus zero contribution, The genus zero contribution to this potential, one gets something that produces a solution to the WDV equations and in turn a Frobenius manifold. Conversely, so this way one can say that Frobenius manifolds encode the information about the genus zero of a comological field theory. Conversely, this is enough under the assumption of semi-simplicity to fully recognize. Simplicity to fully reconstruct the information about all genera, and this was shown by a reconstructive procedure by Gibental and Telemann. This completes the overview on the theory that I wanted to share. And it's now the time to try to generalize it a bit to some notions which are broadening the one of our Frovinius manifold. Continuous manifold. Starting from dropping the requirement for a flat metric and replacing it with the requirement of a corresponding connection, which is flat, one gets the notion of a bi-flatted manifold, where bi in the name suggests the fact that a second flat structure is there. This is true, and in the Frobenius case, this can be obtained by considering a connection which is associated Connection which is associated to the intersection form. By dropping the requirement for the second flat structure to be there, one gets a flat F manifold. And by dropping even flatness, one gets an F manifold. I will start defining these objects by the broadest one, which is F manifolds. So, as before, consider a finite-dimensional differential manifold. The structure Manifold. The structure of an F-manifold here is defined by a commutative and associative product on the tangent bundle, which is unital and which satisfies this condition involving the lead derivative of the product along the product of vector fields. This condition is called the Herkling-Manning condition after the names of Herkling and Manning, who introduced the F-manifolds in 1915. Introduced the F-manifolds in 1999. Later in 2005, Manning added to such an F-manifold structure the presence of a flattened torsionless connection, which makes this into a flat F-manifold when the unit vector field is flat and when the tensor obtained by considering the covariant derivative of the product is symmetric. Symmetric. And then in 2012, Paolo Lorentzoni and Alessandro Garcia defined the notion of biflatf manifolds when two flat F manifold structures are given on the same manifold, satisfying these three compatibility conditions. The first of which relates the two products, the second of which expresses the fact that the unit of the second structure The second structure must behave as an Euler vector field for the first one, the third of which expresses compatibility between the two connections. In particular, this last one condition is expressed in terms of this operator, the NABLA, which is called the exterior covariance derivative with respect to NABLA. This is basically an operation which extends the usual differential to vector. Differential to vector-valued differential forms. And is here defined for a generic k-differential form, omega, where the hat over the vector fields, as usual, denotes the absence of that vector field in the formula. So these are three instances of F-manifolds that I wanted to introduce. A last one will be introduced by the end of the talk. So, how to So, how to extend this theory to some of this setting? For instance, if one thinks of flat F manifolds, an analogous version of the WDDB equations can be provided. They are called extended or oriented WDDB equations, and they retain an analogous relation with flat F manifolds as the one that WDB equations. That WDBB equations present with respect to Frobenius manifolds. A construction of an integrable hierarchy out of a flat F manifold is possible as well in a way that resembles the construction of the principal hierarchy. And comological field theories can be extended as well to the notion of an F-chomological field theory, which is basically defined by dropping the axiom for the compatibility. The axiom for the compatibility with respect to the gluing map of non-separating kind, and which preserves an analogous relation with flat F manifolds as Cofty as homological field theories have with forbidden manifolds. As for the extended version of the WDBB equations, one can consider an n-dimensional flat F-manifold and a set of flat coordinates T1, T2. flat coordinates t1 tn then n functions can be found satisfying these relations which are similar to the ones defining the Frodinus potential. Now we don't have a scalar potential anymore. We have n functions which define a vector potential called the potential of the flat F manifold and which gives solution to this Which gives solutions to this system of equations, which, when an Euler vector field is provided, together with a third homogeneity condition with respect to it, define the so-called set of extended or oriented WDDV equations. And conversely, starting from a solution to this set of oriented WDV equations, one can define a vector potential and in turn a flat F manifold. Flattest manifold. As for the construction of the analogous of the principal hierarchy, one can consider, given a flattest manifold, a frame of primary vector fields, which are asked to be flat and which are called primary because they can be seen as the starting point for the construction of higher order vector fields by means of these recursive relations here. Recursive relations here. So, these vector fields can be used to define systems of partial differential equations which define pairwise commuting flows and in this sense, a principle an integrable hierarchy, which is called the principal hierarchy associated to the flat F manifold. Because when the connection is the Levitica connection of a Frobenius metric, this coincides with the construction of the principal hierarchy. Of the principal hierarchy of the Frobenius manifold. So, this completes actually also the extended overview on this theory that I wanted to share. And you are now able to understand the central part of the title, so F-manifolds, and you know some instances of them, but you still don't know what I meant by regularity. Now, the notion of regularity was introduced. The notion of regularity was introduced in 2017 by Liana, David, and Klaus Hertling. They generalized the notion of semi-simplicity, I'm sorry, where the operator of multiplication by the alternator field was represented in the canonical coordinates by a diagonal matrix. And they gave this definition of regularity in the F manifold setting. The F manifold setting, so in the most general setting, which applies to the other ones, under the requirement for an Euler vector field. An F-manifold is said to be regular if, at a generic point, the operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field admits a canonical decomposition in Jordan blocks, where each block is associated to a different eigenvalue. To a different eigenvalue. And similarly to what Dubrovin did in the semi-simple case, David and Herclin proved that around a regular point, one can find a set of coordinates which we will still call canonical and which are here denoted by a double set of indices in which the structural constants of the product are expressed this way and the unit and Euro value. Way and the unit and the Euder vector field can be written out this other way. Now, this double set of indices is such that the Greek indices label the Jordan blocks, and the Latin ones describe what happens inside each of them. In particular, if you look at the expressions for the structural constants of the product, we have this additional term that wasn't there in the semi-simple case. Wasn't there in the semi-simple case due to the fact that one may have non-trivial blocks. And to understand a bit more clearly how this double notation works, think of this formula, where the J-alpha index is just J when one considers the first Jordan block, while when one considers the next ones, one has to take into account the presence of the size. The presence of the sizes of the previous Jordan blocks, denoted by m1 up to m alpha minus 1. This can be summarized in this table, where the semi-simple case can be recovered out of the regular one as a subcase, when the number r of Jordan blocks of the operator multiplication by the Eulerberg field is exactly equal to the dimension n of the manifold. Of the manifold. In particular, if in the semi-simple case, the operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field was represented by a diagonal matrix, having on the diagonal the canonical coordinates. In the regular case, it is represented by a block-diagonal matrix, where each block is of this form. It is a lower triangular tuplets matrix. Triangular tuplets matrix where one can still read the canonical coordinates just arranged in a different way. So it's easy to see that when the number of Jordan blocks of the operator of multiplication by the olivetor field is the same as the dimension of the manifold, one gets the semi-simple case. So we now have all the ingredients to discuss about some results in this regular, even non-semi-simple case. Case, which I will present in three steps. So, first, I will discuss something about provenous manifold in the regular non-semi-simple case. And then, I will move on to biflat F manifolds and onto the other class of F manifolds that I still haven't defined, both in relation with some integrable hierarchies that can be constructed as associated. Constructed as associated to this operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field. Starting from the Frobenius setting, in the regular non-semi-simple case, David and Hertling showed that the metric is represented by a block diagonal matrix, where each block is now an upper triangular Henkel matrix defined in terms of some functions here denoted by overlines eta. By overlined eta. These functions can be particularly expressed in terms of some metric potential. What I did in my PhD, together with my supervisor, Paolo Lorenzoni, was to consider a shift of the canonical coordinates, which is here displayed by considering a special role for the first block of the operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field. By the Euler vector field. This is not restrictive because if we consider the non-semi-simple case, at least one of the blocks of that operator has to have size at least two. So we just assumed the first one to be so, but by picking another one to be of size at least two, we would get analogous formulas. So the result is here a list of expressions. Here, a list of expressions for the functions defining the metric in terms of some other functions f1 up to fn of these new z variables, which are explicitly given in terms of a function, small f of the z variables, which can be related to that metric potential h and in terms of two constants, c1 and c2, where the first one has to vanish when the First one has to vanish when the charge of the Frobenius manifold doesn't. To be more clear, in the case of one block, this is what we have. So these are the expressions for the operator multiplication by the Euler vector field and for the metric. You can read out of this clearly the structures of a lower triangular Toplitz matrix and an upper triangular Henkel matrix. The first of those functions. The first of those functions is the constant C1 that has to vanish when the charge doesn't, while the remaining ones are expressed this way. So it all boils down to determine the function small f, which we were able to do up to dimension four. And this is what we found. In dimension two, this is just a constant. And then it increases in complexity up to dimension four. Up to dimension 4, where it can be expressed either in terms of some polynomials or of some functions A and B, here not written explicitly, but which can be determined in terms of hyperbolic functions. Of course, here I used I changed notation calling Z and W, the Z variables Z1 and Z2. So this is what I wanted to tell you about the Frobenius setting. The Frobenius setting. And now we can move on to biflets as manifolds, presenting a construction which starts from considering the operator of multiplication by the Euler vector field L. This tensor happens to have vanishing Nylhois torsion, meaning that this quantity vanishes for any choice of X and Y being vetrophiers. Fields. This condition allows one to consider a twisted version of the Durham differential, which is here denoted by the L and which is defined in terms of a generic k-differential form, where the presence of L appears here and in this twisted version of the usual commutator. This is an actual differential in the sense that its square vanishes, and this is provided by the vanish. And this is provided by the vanishing of the Nyon-Hois torsion. Moreover, this differential anti-commutes with the Duram differential, defining what is called a bidifferential complex, which in this particular case takes the name of the Frohlicher-Nayen-Huys bi-complex. Paolo, together with Franco Magri in 2005, used this bidifferential complex as the starting point for the construction. A starting point for the construction of an integrable hierarchy. What they did was to consider a solution A0 to this function. This can be used to recursively reconstruct a chain of other functions, A1, A2, and so on, by means of these recursive relations, which generalize a Leonard and Adrie chain due to the presence of this additional term. And in turn, one can define, starting from V0 being the identity. Starting from V0 being the identity, a list of one, one type tensor of fields, V1, V2, and so on, where the generic term is just a polynomial in the powers of L. And in turn, it can be expressed as an operator of multiplication by a vector field, which is polynomial in the powers of the Euler vector field. These tensor fields can be used to define systems. Define systems, lists of partial differential equations of this form, of hydrodynamic type, and they provide pairwise commuting flows, so an integrable hierarchy. Now, if one thinks of a flat F manifold, for instance, one gets two constructions of integrable hierarchies out of that. First, this one, if one considers the regularity assumption, so actually the presence of an Euler vector. Actually, the presence of an Euler vector field, and the analogous construction of a principal hierarchy. And it is natural to wonder when these two constructions are related to each other, in particular when they define pairwise commuting flows. The answer that we found is encoded in a geometric condition for the exterior covariance derivative of the first non-trivial. The first non-trivial tensor fields constructed out of a generalized linear malicious chain, so one, and it can be stated as a result that I'm going to show, proving, well, leading to the construction of a class of regular, even non-semi-simple biflet F manifolds. So we consider, as before, a differential manifold M of finite dimension M and we fix a non- And we fix a non-negative integer r, which is less or equal than n. Then, for any linear combination of r variables, there exists a unique regular bifletive manifold structure where the operator L of multiplication by the Euler vector field has a canonical form consisting of exactly R-Jordan blocks and satisfies this condition. And satisfies this condition for the vanishing of the exterior covalent derivative of that tensor field, which is explicitly expressed by subtracting to L the identity times this function A0. In particular, if u1, un denotes the canonical coordinates of such a regular structure, this linear combination only involves the ones which Involves the ones which correspond to the first coordinate of each block. We call these structures Lauricella by flat F manifolds because at least in the semi-simple case they are related to the theory of Lauricella functions. More precisely, the flat coordinates for the first connection can be obtained by considering the function A0 itself and n minus 1 Laurichello functions. And since I spoke Functions. And since I spoke about uniqueness here, let me briefly show the expressions for the Christoffel symbols. Luckily, some of them vanish, and I say luckily because we want to construct a flap structure. In particular, we have the vanishing of all of those christophal symbols whose indices correspond to pairwise distinct blocks and the vanishing of some other ones. The non-vanishing ones are now. ones are now first the ones where the indices correspond to exactly two distinct blocks which can be determined by these formulas recursively extracting from the first line and by means of these first set of formulas while the remaining ones which are the ones where the indices belong to the same block can be determined by means of these formulas first These formulas first. And starting from this tiny formula here, recursively one can determine all of the remaining ones, which complete the list of symbols that we need and define uniquely the structure. So I should have about 10 minutes to go. And this is the time that I need to introduce the last class of F-manifolds, which is the class of F-manifolds with components. Class of F-manifolds with compatible connection and flat unit. These objects are defined out of an F-manifold structure when a connection is given with the properties of being torsionless, of defining a flat unit, of defining a symmetric tensor when considering the covariant derivative of the product, and of satisfying this additional condition, which is cyclic. Which is cyclic in the first three vector fields, and which is expressed in terms of the Riemann tensor of the connection NABLA. In particular, it is immediate to see that if the connection is flat, this third condition vanishes trivially. So flat F manifolds fall automatically into this broader setting. These objects were introduced in the study of some. In the study of some integrable systems of hydrodynamic type, which are expressed as multiplication with respect to an F-manifold with respect to some vector field. And in the semi-simple case, well, actually, semi-simplicity of this product can be reflected in the existence of Riemann invariants, so in the property of the system to be somehow diagonalizable. In the regular set, In the regular setting, what we found together with Caroline van Gemst, who is attending the conference in presence, is that regular F-manifolds with compatible connection and flat unit turn out to play the role of geometric counterpart of this type of integrable systems. This can be stated more precisely when considering the integrable hierarchy that can be constructed out of a general. Constructed out of a generalized Lenard Magli chain as before. So if one considers an n-dimensional F-manifold, which is assumed to be regular, and a solution A0 to this equation, ddl A0 equals 0, one can consider the first n vector field produced by that generalized Leonard-Magris chain. And we know that. And we know that these define pairwise commuting flows. We prove that they are linearly independent, and moreover, that there exists a unique connection, here denoted by NABLA, satisfying this condition for the vanishing of the exterior quarantine derivative of the operator of multiplication by the first non-trivial vector fields among these ones, which makes the regular. Which makes the regular F-manifold structure into an F-manifold with compatible connection and flat unit. More precisely, if one starts from a linear expression for A0, the resulting structure is a flat F-manifold. And conversely, if one wants flatness of the connection, one has to ask for a linear expression of A0. zero. To see that linear functions are valid choices for solutions to this equation, let me show you the expressions that we found in general for any solution of this equation. In the case of one block, this is the expression. So it is a polynomial expression in the variables u2, u3, up to u1, where the coefficients of this polynomial are functions of the first variable u1. Of the first variable you want. And this can be quite easily generalized to the general setting, where, by means of this taking formula, where the generic expression for A0 is given as a sum of R terms, where R is the number of Jordan blocks of the operator L. And each of these terms only depends on the coordinates which correspond to that block. To that block. So, this way it's easy to see that linear functions can be obtained, and in particular, special linear functions, which are the one providing the Lauricella bifretz structures, can be chosen too. So, to summarize this picture, this is the table that one may need. So, for a generic expression for A0, one gets F manifolds with compatible connectivity. F manifolds with compatible connection and flat unit. And one specialized, when one specializes to a linear function for such a solution, one gets flatted manifolds. In particular, we conjecture the presence of a second flat structure, making this into a biflated manifold. We check this up to dimension four. And four special linear solutions only involving the coordinate. Involving the coordinates which correspond to the first coordinate of each Jordan block, we get Lauricella by flat F manifolds, which we conjecture, having proved this also to dimension 4, to be related with the presence of some Riemannian metric. This is all I wanted to tell you, and I leave you with some references. So thank you for the attention.
