And thank you very much for the invitation. I sort of miss being in Oberwolfa, especially on Thanksgiving week. It's nice. There's usually the first snow and everything. Maybe another time. Sorry, not a bravo parbon, of course. So what I want to discuss. So what I want to discuss very, very briefly today is a follow-up to our result with DDA on compressible Navier stores. And so what I want to start is explain a little bit the goal of... We cannot hear you, or at least I cannot hear you. Sorry. I hear him. I'm on mute. I'm on mute, so. Still not? I do hear you, so I think there's fine. It's not on his end. Sorry. I think it was just my problem. Sorry for that. Well, if Erika cannot hear me, then you know, at least I will escape the questions, the nasty questions from the chair of the session. I didn't tell you, but I hacked your computer. So, and now you cannot stop me either. I see, I see. All right. So the end goal is to get global weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes Fourier system, which most of you are probably very familiar. Probably very familiar with, so I'm not going to spend 10 minutes on that slide. So it's just compressible Navier Stokes with, of course, an equation on the temperature. It is a very delicate system to handle. It's much more physical than the compressible Navy stokes without temperature for reasons of entropy. Reasons of entropy. But we have very few existence results on that. A lot of that are due to Edouard and Antonin, of course, so Perisel Norbatni. And I will mention briefly one of them later on. And so as usual, the big question is which kind of pressure law one should take. Of pressure law, one should take here. And that's sort of the whole problem is there. And I'm just writing some of those super classical ones here, right, from the ideal gas to Vandervas and to viral type of equations. And the ones that we would really like to be able to do are the viral. So it's the last one. Last one. It's reasonably close to what people call real gas, which I encourage you to go and have a look. And you'll see the kind of crazy things that are used by engineers, for example, for compressible fluids. And it's complicated, truncated expansions that look a little bit like the variable. Look a little bit like the variable. And of course, the way I write it, you have this B minus one, right, which is a radiative term. So it's a pressure term that is independent of the density. And then the other terms behave in a classical manner. The next one is just ideal gas, and then you have corrections to this. So, how to control the behavior of such a fluid is, of course, a very, very old problem in physics. If you do thermodynamics on compressible gas, what you see is that the stability of the thermodynamical equilibrium is connected to the mental density of the pressure model and to the fact that it is increasing in the density more. Density more precisely. That has been noticed already very early in the 19th century. The same monotonicity shows up if you look at the Euler system. So if I forget for a moment the temperature equation, I just look at compressible Euler without diffusion, then the sign of the derivative of the pressure with respect to the pressure. The derivative of the pressure with respect to the density is directly connected to the high parabolicity of the system. So, if we are talking about compressible Euler, it doesn't seem very reasonable to look at laws even like Van der Waals or to any kind of variable where all coefficients would not be positive. On the other hand, you do have plenty of physics. Other hand, you do have plenty of physical models that use a non-moton. And we are looking at Navier-Stokes, not earlier. So diffusion could help. And second, sure, there are going to be stability problems at the limit, but before you reach the limit, it's not immediately clear why you would need a thermodynamical assumption to get existence. So it's a relatively natural question to ask what we can do without having a P that is increasing. And one last comment in this introduction. Of course, I'm focusing on weak solutions here. And this is not to say that there is no point in having strong solutions. Very big point in having strong solutions when you... Big point in having strong solutions when you can, but as you very well know, the theory is even more limited for strong solutions than it is for weak solutions. And there is a little bit of an advantage in considering solutions only with initial bounds on the energy. Now, of course, there are other type of issues with the Cauchy problem for compressible solutions. Cauchy problem for compressible solutions. And we've seen examples of non-uniqueness for compressible Euler already in this conference. So there are drawbacks. Now, let me try to make a little bit more precise the kind of truncated aerial that we would like to consider. So I would like to look at the formula like this. To look at the formula like this, and you see that here I'm putting the classical row gamma, and that will give the dominant order in everything. So gamma will be larger than any of the n, and you see here the assumption between gamma and capital N, right? So it's way above. So the whole thing is controlled. The behavior for a fixed temperature is controlled by this rho gamma. Is controlled by this rho gamma. There is no doubt. And once you choose a formula like that for the pressure, then you have a typical formula for the energy, which reads like this. And that's because for thermodynamical reason, the pressure and the energy are connected. Moreover, I do want to point out that we will be taking a radiative part here. So something like this. So, something like this for the first coefficient. And that will avoid essentially any kind of degeneracy, potential degeneracy in the pressure by saying that it doesn't vanish even if there is no density. So technically speaking, that's a big help and it makes the whole formula here relatively Look relatively nice. Now, the question of the known monotone pressure is something that we had looked with DDA in the case without temperature, in the barotropic case. And we had a method, a new method to get compactness, and it turns out that this method to get compactness also applies here to that case. And this is the kind of theorem that we could obtain. So you consider the previous formula, and then I need a little bit of assumptions on the growth rate of B and things like that. I'll come back to those assumptions in the next slide to try to explain them a little bit. And with those assumptions, what we could And with those assumptions, what we could prove as a sort of semi-direct corollary of our method is the weak stability for the Navier-Stokes Fourier system in a slightly different formulation that is not unusual. So essentially, we replace the energy equation by an equation on entropy S. I'll give the formula again on the next slide. And you have an energy equality to Have an energy equality to help recover the total energy. So, this formulation was already used by Eduard, for example. So, it's not something that we've come up with. And you replace the energy by the entropy because it has better integrability property. So you can actually pass to the limit into the entropy equation. But since it only has an inequality, here you see the larger or equal, right? Larger or equal, right? You hope to recover any potential defect in this inequality by having the energy equality. And in a sense, larger equal here works in the other direction from a lesser equal that you could have there. All right, so this is so this was again a direct consequence of our result. Now, just a few comments. So, why is there a talk and why is there another paper? Well, there is a talk and there is another paper because this is only a weak stability result. And the big question is, if you want to use something like that to get the existence of solution, you need to start from some sort of approximate solutions. And this is a huge problem. The construction of approximate solution for the Navy-Stokes Fourier is extremely complex. Antonin and Edouard basically wrote a book just on that. So you need to start from something that will let you use the method and And you need to start from something that does not require the pressure to be monotone, because otherwise, this is it. And we were a little bit naive when we first found out the result, but it didn't take long to realize that, well, there is not the right notion of approximate solution that would allow us to essentially apply quickly a modified version. Quickly, a modified version of the previous theorem. And this is the motivation for all further studies and for the whole talk. Now, I'm adding here the assumption on the entropy that you can see. And in case you're curious, this is the kind of rate of integrability and generally speaking, regularity condition that we could get of the density. And the last remark, so those are bounds. Are you know bounds? This assumption here is actually connected to the specific heat, which is this guy, and that for physical reason has to have a sign. So let me very, very briefly show one previous results by again Edouard and Antonin. An antenna. So, this is the kind of things that they could do. You can have a pressure that has a radiative part and some non-radiative part. And the non-radiative fault has to satisfy appropriate assumptions. So, again, here you see the monotonicity of P, and the energy has to be increasing also with respect to the temperature. With respect to the temperature, which is relatively reasonable again for a physical point of view. Now, there are plenty of other technical assumptions, and I just refer you to their papers, but I want to emphasize this general form. And this kind of result could be also extended to a truncated variable, but provided that you keep a sign on every coefficient so that in particular the monotonicity of p. So what we did so far is the first step in all of this. And that first step was to say, let us forget for a moment about the temperature equation. And let us wonder if you give me theta. So if you give me So, if you give me the temperature and I take the truncated variable, can we solve the compressible Euler with that pressure? So, what we get is a solution to the compressible Navier-Stokes, sorry, not Euler, but compressible Navier-Stokes, not Navier-Stokes Fourier, but with a pressure low P here, which is inhomogeneous in T and X. So instead of being So instead of being the classical barotropic assumption P is P of rho, we have a P that is a P of T, X, and Rho. Now, the next step will be to use this in some sort of fixed point argument to get existence to the full system, of course. But we need the first step, and it's not uninteresting because there are other applications where the pressure is not homogeneous. Is not homogeneous. So it has some spatial or temporal dependence. And it works. So with the truncated virial assumption that I showed you before and this particular choice of pressure, we can actually get existence of a weak solution with regularity assumptions that are pretty much the standard one. And we also get an energy inequality that I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you after. So, just a few comments. Of course, we don't particularly need to impose that P has this particular form. What the result has is a list of technical assumptions that some P of T x rho has to satisfy. And they are a bit long, so I didn't want to show them to you in this briefology. Again, the weak stability part was done. Was done. The point is to actually construct the approximate solution and then pass to the limit, and that is a big challenge and a big new challenge. And if you're curious on the energy inequality, what we can have is if you separate P into a smooth part in T and X and a remainder, then you can get this kind of energy inequality out of the system. Of the system. And this would be compatible with the right energy inequality of the Vanavier-Stokes form. So just a very quick word about the approximate solution. So there are various stages, but this is the main one. So we look at the following system, and what are we doing here? So I'm adding an artificial pressure, no surprise. The form of the artificial pressure is a little bit more complicated than what people were using before. It's not just one row gamma, it's a sum of several row gammas. And it's not very difficult, but I'll explain why we need this. And we go with a convolution on the normal pressure, right? So L. Normal pressure, right? So L epsilon is some nice convolution kernel at scale epsilon. And we need some sort of correct range on those artificial pressure terms. So, what can we say about this system? Getting the existence of the approximate system is easy. Right, uh, it's one step and it's a shadow fixed point. So, this is easy. Then you take the limits, and of course, the order of the limits, as usual in this kind of business, is very, very important. Not a big surprise. First, we want to pass to the limit in epsilon, right? So, that's the whole point of the artificial pressure. You don't touch it in the first step. First, you pass in whatever else you have. First, you pass in whatever else you have, pass to the limit in whatever else you have. And this limit, epsilon, goes to zero, is super hard. And that is really the main new technical contribution here. It is super hard because you need to keep using the structure of the pressure. And it's not a very simple structure, right? Because truncated varial. And it's not pointwise. Because what the convolution does is that now, of course, instead of having the pressure at the right point, right, so at rho of x, what you have is you have the pressure at rho of y for all y's in a small ball around x. And you have to deal with this. There is absolutely no way that I can give an idea of how we are solving this problem in 20 minutes, so I'm not even going to try. Again, I'm just emphasizing that Again, I'm just emphasizing that this is the big, big technical issue in the paper. Now, doing this limit forces you to have very, very large integrability on rho. So I need rho to be in an LP space with P super big. And because of that, I need the artificial pressure to have a very large exponent. But that exponent is too large with respect to the gain of integrability. With respect to the gain of integrability that I can have if I'm just using the rho gamma, the final one. And this is why you have this series of guys. And what happens is first we pass to the limit eta one tends to zero. And that works because gamma one is actually reasonably close to gamma two. So we can use the usual gain of integrability to pass to the limit here. To pass to the limit here. And then you're going to pass to the limit in e2 tends to zero, and so on and so forth. And you have a finite jump every step. So, of course, you can get now gamma one as large as you want. So, this is a very simple idea, and it's very straightforward to implement. It just gives this slightly scary form on the artificial pressure. And as a general As a general conclusion, there are advantages and drawbacks to such an approach. The big advantage is that obtaining the approximate system is simple. And you don't have to go through the Galerkin construction, which for Navier-Stokes Fourier is extremely technical. It's simple and it gives you a range of Simple and it gives you a range of pressure that honestly I'm not sure I would know how to do if I had to get them from the Galilean construction. On the other hand, it is of course less precise and there's no direct connection with numerical methods, for example, which was kind of also big interest of the Galician construction. And using the approximate solution, because it is a delocalized pressure is a big challenge. Is a big challenge. This is it. Thank you. Thank you very much.
