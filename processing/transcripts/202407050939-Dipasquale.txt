And another result, the Sabien Sarou. Now, as you see in the title, I will speak about a two-dimensional variational program. Variational problem whose genesis is, however, in a three-dimensional manner, which is precisely the following. Suppose we have a very, very long, smooth cylinder, modeling, for instance, a micropyle. This is a slab, we rotate a slab around the vector axis, you can see this is modeling, for instance, a micropile, and this is filled by animatic. As we have seen, As we have seen many, many times during this talk and during this workshop, pneumatics are best described by Radal Gaussian theory, which describe the logarithm, the logarithm state of the system by associating with each point omega attribute. That is an element of the space S0. That is to say attribute Symmetric traceless matrix, right? Now, this is a linear space of dimension 5, and therefore, upon the choice of a dotted magnesis, it is asomorted for 5. On the other hand, by a wise choice of the basis, we can write it in an advocate way as Get way as R plus C plus C. Okay, so next, the Ranhadogen energy that we will consider will be the simplest one, with one elaston constant and a plusive aquatic potential. However, you can rewrite this energy simply by gathering constants and grouping the term differently than usual. In this alternative way, In this alternative way, which is more useful to our purposes, there is the elastic part plus a path which penalizes back side. I'm going to tell you what is this function meta tilt. Plus this other term reminding us of the Ginz-Bule-No function. Now, uh if one works uh deep in the pneumatic phase, as you know, essentially the Q-tension doesn't vanish. Essentially, the two tensor doesn't vanish. And moreover, is pointwise normal, is a almost temperature constant, more or less. So, as a mathematical idealization, we will assume that it is precisely constant. Here the normalization is so that the constant here is 1. Or in other words, that Q belongs to S4 but twice. S4 is the unit sphere inside this five-dimensional space. Once you do this, Once you do this, so you assume this at the beginning as a mathematical idealization, you work with this assumption, you derive some result, at the end of the talk and we relax a bit with this assumption, entering asymptotic regime which reminds the deep thematic phase. So we will assume, however, this assumption throughout the talk. Throughout it all. And if you do this, then this term is not present in the energy functional. So you reduce the energy functional to this one. Here, lambda is a positive parameter. Actually, it is a material constant related with the Baraxian correlation. And so this is the energy function that we will consider during this talk. Now, you also have to define You also have to define the spa to find the space of functions in which this energy function is well defined. And of course, if we assume that Q is square integrable with the square integrable, of course, the derivative is that Q belongs in this space, the energy function is well-defined, right? Okay. But in order to have a well-defined minimum To have a well-defined minimization problem, I also well, there are still two things that I have to do. I have to define this beta tilde, and I have to define a bold condition. I also have to have a way to find the condition from. Now, beta tilde is the so-called maximum parameter. This is known from the physical literature, but we use a slightly different parameterization which allows to distinguish between positive and negative. Between positive and negative x. So we define it in this way. Of course, this definition makes sense if q is not zero, but we are working on these assumptions, it's not a positive assumption. And if you define it in this way, then at the range of this function is the closed interval, minus one. The situation minus one corresponds to the negative unit side. The situation plus one corresponds to the positive index sign and anything in between is a bioxial thing. Now, uh of as you see from uh here and from here, negative uh unaxide and positive unique side are very different from the point of view of implication, of course. From the point of view of the potential, of course, because only positive unixial matrices pay zero potential energy, right? While negative reaction matrices pay a lot of potential energy. Okay, next I have to tell you which is the body condition that I will consider. And during this talk, I will always consider the so-called omotropic anchoring. The emotropic anchoring is a body condition constructed out of Constructed out of the normal sphere to the boundary. So this is the normal to the boundary of the state of x. And the rhetorical frame is defined in this way. This is only a normalization part of the romanization that we are using. The important part is that this boundary condition is n of x tensor n of x minus one third the day. Minus one-third the name. Now, a body condition like that, besides being geometrical in a sense, has the property of being a positively reactionary vector. So it pays zero potential energy. In other words, it belongs pointwise to the real projecting plane, right? The real projecting plane is exactly another way to call the set of positive linear DCC3. Positive linear sum of ACC3. Okay, so now to this space, I add the condition of agreeing with the QB on the property. So I have these other constraints, and now I have a well-defined minimization total. However, in this talk, and again I will relax at this assumption and get all the total, I will also assume. I will also assume an assumption that I will call symmetry or is one invariance, which means that if you evaluate Q in a rotated point around the axis of the cylinder, this is the same as rotating the configuration in the target space. This program rotation around And I want this axis, and for every all almost every point axis. So, here I have also another condition that is I will minimize the energy in this setting. Okay, now uh what's the point essentially? Um okay, so this is the missible cast letter to consider now the uh the main idea that uh now the the the the the the the problem that we we have to face is uh the one of is the following one. Suppose the lambda is given, so the material speaks. Is given, so the material speaks. We want to understand if a minimizer in this cylinder, in this class, is singular or not. Singular or regular. Why this is important? Well, suppose we found that the minimizer has similars. So we are necessarily on the ax on the axis because of symmetries, there are some similar points. Symmetries, there are some singular points. Okay, suppose this is the case. Now, suppose that I relax this assumption. I remove symmetry. If I remove symmetry, it turns out that all minimizers must be completely smooth. Similarities are not present. And what does it mean? It means that if you relax this assumption, then your minimizers have to break the symmetry of the population. And this is a fact which is observed numerically. Which is observed numerically since some time, since the at least since the numerical simulations by the Lucari at the end of the 2009, something like that. Okay, so, but for now on I will move in this section now what's a heuristics bizarre. What's the heuristics behind this program? Well, if the cylinder is very, very long, okay, so it's very, very long, and you have a very, very long part of the boundary, on which the boundary condition is always the same, right? It's the regular boundary condition that is given by that. Then it should be clear that minimizers want to minimize. That minimizers want to minimize the restriction of the energy to a perception. Right? Because if this does not happen, then I minimize it pay too much energy. So across section of on the cylinder is a disk. I want to Uh huh to scaling, you can always assume that this case is the unique piece. Okay, so if you lambda minus lambda or assume that it wants It wants to minimize the restriction of the energy with respect to the restriction of the body condition. And the restriction of the body condition is this map of H, pairing the body of the disk into positive reaction matrices that maps the body of the disk on which you have a divider field. into a circle in the sphere score that now I'm looking as the sphere in R class C class with the vertical direction now it turns out that the image of the map of the of the body of the disk through a H lives at constant Leaves at constant eight minus one half. So, in particular, it is contained in the southern hemisphere of course we have to prove uh that these heuristics uh is uh really satisfied. Uh we have proven this uh this heuristics is really satisfied. That these heuristics is really satisfied in a precise sense. And what I'm going to do in the remaining time of this talk is to analyze this two-dimensional ratio cover. So I will try to understand if the minimizers of this energy with respect to these value conditions are biaxial or positively reaction. That's the nice thing. Why this is important? Well, because Because if they are positive unix, well, I will explain this in a moment. So, as I was saying, now I consider this two-dimensional ratio. To deal with this problem, it's better to change uh slightly population and to pass kind of population in terms of q tens. So it's A formulation in terms of cutensals, to a formulation in terms of variables in alpha sequence. So we started with this knot, the spheres for its ant and the kitettes. And we switch to U, which is a map whose component R U naught and one two belonging hotwise to R a C. To a C. The symmetry of Q is reflected into a symmetry of U now according the variable here in the disk. And if you rotate the point, then you are actually acting in this way. U0 stays in parad, u1 rotates by degree 1, and u2 rotates by div2. For any rotation r that I can write in this way, of course, below 1 and for every z in the list. Next up, the boundary condition HZ of Z with explicit expression is Uh with explicit expression is this one. Can be rewritten in terms of these variables in this way. simpler address. And our visible class then becomes the class of vacuum 0 belonging to vacuum 1 to satisfying the g of the body. G of the body and the similar suction from the list with values of this. So this is an equivalent formulation for our programme, but it is more convenient to move it. Okay, now remarks about it. The first remark is that because of symmetry, we can rewrite each concurrent UK of Z as in a polar form essentially. So as a regular function which multiplies at base, where k is at zero one of text. Text because of symmetry and software embedding and the square value constraint, we have that our viscos class actually embeds into continuous functions up to the body of the disk. What does it mean in particular? In particular, this entails that our maps in the missible class have a well-defined value at the center. Have a well-defined value at the center of the disk. So, u of zero is well-defined, okay? And because of symmetry, continuity, and that's provided constraint, this can only be either 100, which is the north pole of the sphere spoil, or minus 1, 0, 0, which is the south pole of the sphere spore. These yells are decomposition into two disjoint components, AN and AS. Well, here we have the disk, here we have the sphere. Max in AN are those sending the center of the disk to the north pole, and max in AS. Not point and maximus are those the center of the disk in this. Now, decomposition will be crucial for this talk, but it brings with itself a very important problem for the world of view of mathematical analysis, because these two classes have been defined by a constraint at a point, and a constraint at a point is not W12 E groups. Is not W13 groups, which entails that when we follow minimizing sequences, we may have a lack of components. We can switch from one class to the other. And this is a very important problem for the quantity of the analysis of this program. Okay. I have enough technology and terminology to state our main theorem about this two-dimensional code function. And our theorem asserts the existence of a special value of lambda of the star, strictly larger than zero infinite. Oh, let me do an observation here. Observation here. I told you that lambda is a material dependent constant, right? So it is fixed if the material is fixed. But now I'm kind of moving lambda. This is not physically easy, but because the material is fixed from the beginning. However, I also told you that we work in a disk of fixed size. This comes at costolary scaling. The scaling is precisely moderated. Precisely modulated by the size of the disk. But moving is equivalent to moving the sides of the disk up to a scale. And moving the size of the disk, that is the size of the cylinder, is physically meaningful. But it is more convenient to work with a varying lambda rather than with a varying size of the disk. This is only a mathematical simplification of a lambda. Okay, so the first thing the first state the first statement tells us that if lambda is larger than star, then the only two minimizers of Uh yeah, I think over the class A are the maps G of the of class Z and minus Z. Now, these two maps belong to the class A N and they are positive uniaxial and UN. So if lambda is large, there are only positive unaction in my sets. Moreover, they are expensive. In the other regime, lambda smaller than lambda star, then any q lambda minimizer of the energy. of the energy of a ray belongs to the other class belongs to the maps that are valued in a that belongs to the to AS and are completely biaxial meaning that if you take the vaccined parameter of K lambda and you evaluate it for each point in the curve For each point in the closure of the domain, then you obtain the Walker's interval minus one one. Note that if you have a map that belongs to this class sending the central disease to the south pole, it is negatively in the action of the central disk. Portal of this. Finally, if lambda If lambda is lambda star, then the minimum of the energy is exactly 6π, but most importantly, we have coexistence of uniaxial and biaxial minimizers. Now, what this theorem is telling us is that if This theorem is telling us is that if you start with a very large value of lambda and then you reduce the value of lambda, you have at the beginning only uniaxial mid values. When you reduce the value of lambda, at a certain point you encounter lambda star, and here we have a sharp transition through a biaxial script mechanism, which is triggered to web towards a biaxial minimization, which is triggered only by reasons of energy efficiency. Also, of energy efficiency. Even though the body condition that we are considering it is trivial in the fundamental group of the water mass. Sorry, does it phase separate inside the disk? Sorry? Does it phase separate inside the disk? So I could imagine having a boundary layer where having a very lambda. It's the same thing as changing that. You get on the outside you get uniaxial and on the inside it's worth by axial. On the inside, it's worth by axial, or vice versa. Well, on the boundary of the disk, you have a uniaxial body condition, right? Right, and then is there a sharp line between the uniaxial region, the shell of the biaxial region, and so on? That's like the array lamp. Well, this is not totally clear from our analysis. I could I could say I couldn't say this from I couldn't say this. This is a verified result that I cannot tell by our analysis. What I can tell you is that in this case, minimizers are completed by axial. So you start from positive unaxiol on the boundary, and you will attain all the values of the batch side. But I do not can't tell if there is a league here. Yeah. It is a really this is a method. Okay. Uh however record that moving lambda is the same as moving the size of the center, of course. Okay. Okay. Now uh heuristics for this theorem. Well I think that we all agree that when lambda is very very large, that third is very very strongly variableized. Is very, very strongly minorized, while positively linear is very, very strongly favored. So, minimizers want to be as positively unaxial as possible, right? The important part of the theorem is that, of this part of the theorem, is that I'm asserting that already at finite lambda, and not only asymptotically, minimizers are completely posi uh purely positively reaction, already at finite lambda. Or rated final. Okay? However, at least for this case, there is a clear distance. For this other case, things are much less clear because if back surge is not so strongly metalized, it could be convenient to pay a bit of potential energy to save the original energy. So it is not clear at all what is uh heuristics to be expected in this case. And for this reason, it is uh most convenient to deal first to deal with Deal with first with the case in which there is no potential energy, which is the case in which lambda is here. Once you have only the direction energy, perhaps you can analyze this case in more details. And when you have refined results in this case, then you can bring these results over to Results over to positive lambda, essentially by a continuity method. That's essentially the strategy. So now we have lambda zero. This is the first case that we have analyzed. And in this case, our minimizers are harmonic maps, right? Because the result is the digitalization. Harmonic maps with values into the sphere score, and so this is find the simple. This here is four and satisfying the symmetry constraint. So they are harmonic maps and in particular they are minimizing solution to the harmonic map system for maps with values to transform, which is this system. Now, any solution to the system by a theorem of Red Lamb is reality up to the boundary because we have an analytic boundary condition. Moreover, because of symmetry, I could rewrite it. The system of PDs has a system of ODs, which is obtained simply by taking the previous polar decomposition of U and putting it into the system. You obtain a system of ODEs, which is important because you can work with the system of ODEs to extend any solution you want, which in principle is defined only. Is defined only on the closure of the disk to the wall plane, keeping harmonicity and keeping the sport value constraint, and also the finite energy. Now, in the case of zero, we have two. We have two sub cases to deal with, right? Max in AN and MAPS in AS. Let us start with the maps in AN. Let me also give a bit of terminology that will be useful. If we have harmonic mapping, we will say that this map is small if the image of the disk through map does not escape. Does not escape from the small spherical cap containing the image of the vanilla dish. But recall, in our case, there is the southern hemisphere. And it is large otherwise. Okay. Now, let me deal with larger money mass. Maps in the class AF. In this case, the most important fact is any such map is explicitly classified. And anyway, we are formed there for that. And by the explicit characterization, one sees that the value of the energy is exactly six five for any such. For any such map. Now, how are these maps classified? As I told you, we start from you, right? Then we can extend using working with this audio system. We can extend you from now capital U entire, the final node planning, which is still as one equivalent harmonic with. With kinetic energy. And this can be further extended to a map defined also at the point at infinity. So the whole sphere estimate, which is still as one equivalent and body and finite energy. These objects turn out to be very, very, very rigid. Very, very, very rigid. And this rigidity allows to classify all these objects. This has been done in a previous work with Vansan and Daniel. We have explicit formulae for these maps that are expressed in terms of two complex parameters. However, we also have a boundary condition on the body of the disk, that is on the equator of the sphere, and this reduces the two-complex parameters to only one complex. You can write the energy in terms of this conflict. Write the energy in terms of this conflict parameter. You realize that it depends only on the absolute value of this parameter. You can differentiate with respect to it, and you can differentiate at the integral sign, because everything is smooth. And from here, you see immediately that the energy does not depend on the parameter. Then you can evaluate it for your third map, and your favorite map is G, of course, because it is totally different. And you see from this that the energy is expired for any map in this class. In this class. Okay. Next, we pass to minimizing maps in the class AS. Here, first of all, we observe that any minimizer of the energy in the voltless A belongs. To the class AS. Why is this true? Well, suppose I have a minimizer that I write in the now usual form. Out of it, I can construct this other noun. Still compatible with the boundary condition, so it is admissible. And by general properties of sovereign functions, So the functions, we are this. However, u is a minimizer, hence we have equality, hence utility is a minimizer. But it is a minimizer. It satisfies the maritime system. Projecting this along the direction zero, the direction of U naught, you see from the maximum principle that this function cannot cross zero. And if it cannot cross zero be since it is continuous, it must continue to leave. It must continue to live in the southern hemisphere. So, any minimizer of the energy must belong to this class. Moreover, in this case, we have an explicit candidate minimizer, which is this one. Now, this can't be the same. Now this comes uh as the W one two equal limit of larger multi-parts in the N when you send a parallel to the however already is found we have an explicit formula right from the explicit formula we see that the energy of this map is exactly two pi and the image of this map is strictly contained into the southern sphere. into the southern sphere. But now you may remind of another result of Schenebeck telling you that if you have a harmonic map with value into a sphere, taking values into a hemisphere, then it is minimizing even without the symmetry constraint. It is minimizing among all markets. And you can you can recall a skill order result by Jaeger and Karl telling you that there is only one solution to this system Only one solution to this system which satisfies that the image is strictly contained in the Jodesi Revolt, as for marks. Isn't that stereographic projection? Yeah, it is a strict relative of the stereographic projection, yes. That obvious that those two in fact is the stereographic projection a composite meets just fine. In fact, it is. Was it obvious that those that that works? Without without inserting that into the equation, could I could I give pure thought to do the stir group? In a sense, yes, but I should tell you how we classified all these mappings. I if I tell you how we classify all these mappings, then it's clear that Classify all these mappings, then it's clear that this is a struggle. Otherwise, I agree that it's not totally evident. But it would be if you can see the old construction. If I had time. Okay. So putting all these things together, US is the only fascist. Minimizer of the energy in the full casing. The only one. And now that we have these, we arrive at the most important result for the case in Apple-Wazimo, which is a totally explicit energy gap between maps in AS and map in AF. Yeah, so we have just seen that the minimum of the energy in the class A S is achieved, its value is pi, and it is strictly smaller than the minimum of the energy in the class i n. I am also asserting that. The class n, I am also asserting that the minimum is a cheat, and the value of this minimum is 6π. Now, these two problems are actually very different because we have just seen that this problem is compact. If you have a minimizing sequence in a S, it reads in a S because you can always see the energy as before and gain energy, right? So the program is compact and the minimum and Compact and the minimum is achieved. Why? This problem is in principle non-compact. Although I am asserting that the minimum is achieved. In principle, it is not. Because if you follow a sequence of large harmonic mappings, it could be that in the limit will happen a bubbling off of harmonic sphere. Of our mic sphere. And there is enough energy to expel our mic sphere in the region. That's the problem that we have to face. In other words, the problem that we have to face is a possible lack of compactness. Now, to deal with this lack of compactness, the key point is constructing an enhanced minimizing sequence, which allows us to follow the possible lack of components. The possible lack of components and describing it specifically. The main problem in doing this lies in the fact, as I told you at the beginning of the talk, that this class is not W12 eggs, right? It's not W12 equals. But we can approximate this class by classes that are W12 eggs. So, it appears to regularize the problem in a sense by replacing the constraint at a point by a constraint in a small disk around the center. These are, in fact, very closed because it is unconstrained and not inside. And moreover, and this means that for every n in n, we have a minimizer, u n, belonging to the class a n1 over n. We take one over n, we have a minimizer of the energy in this class A and one of the Moreover, since these classes are actually W12 strongly dens in the class here, it follows that if we follow the energy of these minimizers Um, we obtain in the limit exactly the infimum of the energy. The infimum of the energy in the glass layer. Okay. Now, this sequence UN that we are constructing in this way is our favorite enhanced minimizing sequence. The point now to prove this average gap would be rescaling the map μn at an upper-bit scale that at the map. That are the notes are random in such a way, approbate means in such a way, that in the limit you obtain a map, let me call it Lutilda, the analytic, astronomical violence, harmonic, with finite energy. But again, as before, we extend them to the whole sphere. To the whole sphere. By the gasification that I mentioned before, we know that the energy of utilda is at least 4π. But if you pair this with the fact that the minimum of the energy in the Olcal say is 2π, it follows that the minimum of the energy. Of the energy in the class AM is at least six pi, but it is at most six pi, because any larger than equal to a m base six pi, and the minimum is achieved, and its value is six pi. Okay, so this completes the proof of this energy up. And now we use it to derive a result at finite number. Okay, now number is larger than zero. In this case, things are reversed with respect to V is one in the sense that I am easier in the class A n and then in the class B is indeed for the class A n it is now immediately immediate that That for every lambda large gender zero, g of plus z and minus z are the only minimizers of the energy lambda over the class A L, right? They are harmonic, so they pay six pi as the Dirichlet energy. No other map can pay less than six pi because harmonic plus side. Less than 6 pi because the multipolars are the minimum. Moreover, these are positive reactions, so they do not pay the potential. Their energy is extracted by 6 pi. And you can prove by the explicit formula that these are the only two positive reactions. These are the only two minimizers in this class. For the problem in S, let us set instead, you know, the star has the equimum. As the equimum of the energy of the radius. Then we first prove that this number lies always between 2 pi and 10 pi. This is not obvious, this is something that we cook. Next, this for every lambda larger than zero. With 2 by if lambda is 0 for what appears to be. Is lambda is zero for what we assume before. Moreover, the function associated lambda with this number is continuous, a continuous function, and it is non-decreasing actually also concave, but it's not really important. Uh actually it is increasing strictly. It is increasing strictly for lambda in the range of lambda 0 lambda substar, where lambda substar is a number larger than lambda sub star, strict reactor, with the previous reactor for any lambda larger than lambda sub star, e lambda star. Is exactly temporary. Yeah, we have continued bounds. They are not really insightful if you write them now, but we have explicit bounds. Now, once there are these everything success, we cover them with the last ingredient, which is the following for every lambda larger than smaller than lambda substar, there exists two lambda. lambda in AS minimizer of a lambda over AS On the other hand for a lambda larger than lambda star there are no minimizers of a uh of a lambda. Of lambda over the class AS. Now that we have these three propositions, we have the proof of the main theorem that I mentioned at the beginning. Because the star, consider this assertion. For any lambda larger than lambda star, you do not have minimizers in this class. But if you have minimizers, then they must belong to the other class. And then these two markets, right? When lambda is much larger than the star, your energy is. Large lambda star, your energy is tempi. Your infinite energy is a tempi. But the energy is decreasing if you lower lambda star because it is increasing this energy. So when you lower lambda and you reach six pi, at six pi you have coexistence because the map is six pi. And at a certain point you will have here six pi, but minimize that existence at six pi. So you have the frequency. So you have the coexistence. But if you lower lambda, since this map means phase 65, then they cannot be minimizers in this class, but there are minimizers in this class. So the only minimizers are in this class. Moreover, they are completely biased. I forgot. Right. Okay. Okay, now that we have this result, I can briefly explain perhaps how it is applied to the original problem. Okay. Okay. And how is this applied? Well, now suppose that our cylinder is thin enough, right? Thin enough means lambda small enough. Lambda small enough, if you remember. Lambda small enough means that the only minimizers are maps in A S. If they are maps in A S, as I told you, they are negative reactions at the center of the disk because they send the center of the disk to the sub one. But then, what does it mean? It means that. What does it mean? It means that uh here we have negative inexit for uh uh the largest part of this cylinder. Here we have negative inexit minus one. But here and here we must be positively reaction because this is the boundary condition, right? But you cannot pass from negative reactivity and positive unaxiomy with continuity because of the constraints, hence you have to jump. Hence, you have to jump. You have to jump at least at the points that, in fact, are situated near the top and the bottom boundary. So, there are at least two singularities, more or less here around. And they are unavoidable if you minimize a long symmetric configuration. In particular, they are unavoidable if you have a symmetric. Bottom, if you have a symmetric minimal. But now relax the assumption of minimizing the energy among symmetric configurations. As I told you, in this case, no singularities are allowed. If no singularities are allowed, it means that minimizers cannot conserve the symmetry of the boundary location. They cannot be as one equivalent. And in fact, this is what the Lucan Ray found in the This is what the Luka environment found in the wave assumption. They are not as funny. Moreover, if I now relax the assumption of the constraint, on the non-constraint, but I enter at the diplomatic phase, an appropriate regime which similar to the diplomatic phase, then the same results form. And with this like closed talk As I can tell also the conference. Thanks, Carlos. Um so uh how many class from S two into S four? You show the I mean you explain there is a classification standard. Is there some? I mean, can they be classified how many maps from S2 into S4? In general? Citate, sorry. How many maps from S2 into S4? Without CD. Yeah, is there some classification? Yes, sir. Yes, there is a classification. There is However, I never understand the details. Oh, okay. In fact, we did all the details explicitly. However, the classification in that case is much less rigid than we are using. Also, there's one equivalence who have a very, very rigid classification and a very, very explicit description of all possible variants. So, there is more. So there is more in this classification than uh and uh direct directly from the DSA. Thanks for bringing in. Thank you, organizers, as well. It's a really nice experience.
