So the next speaker is going to be Hita Kim talking about community influences, the synchronization and stability of jobs. And today I'd like to introduce some of my research. And maybe some of you have already know to know about know about some part of this, but I would like to focus more on the new faces of here. So if you know everything, please understand it. So before I start, I'd like to introduce my experience that I happened to have with the biologists. So I had an experience of introducing, of doing my work with my friends and biologists, and I applied my network analysis. And I applied my network analysis to the photosynthesis. So we analyzed the energy transmission between chlorophylls and we understood the photosystem as on network. So I believe that for you guys, this makes sense because we are all already familiar with the network analysis and this. and it's very common to apply to various topics, right? For them, this was new, so they were not convinced that this doesn't make sense. So I meant this analogy. So my major part is power grid, right? There is a lines and electricity goes through the lines. And in the photo system, through the fluorophase, electric state. Chlorophys, electricity, or energy are transmitted. So, photosystem is a kind of micro scale power grid. So, they were convinced. So, now today I'd like to argue that the brain network is a smaller power grid. So, thanks to Samuel so he gave me this idea. So, through the neurons, again, signals flows. So Lows. So I hope that my talk could give you some insight or some idea that we can apply to analyze the brain networks for you. So let's start. So we live together and because we are together, we can be happy, we can be moved up, right? Because we talk each other. Because we talk each other and if there is some stress it can be re relaxed by talking together. Because we are connected. So then when there are more connections, maybe it could help because it can boost up the communications. And when we have a larger connection or in a larger network, maybe it could have more. I mean the screen. Maybe should I sneak here? No, it's okay. But I think the problem is not as simple. For example, if we have more connections, then how to release our stress or to be relaxed, or it just there are too much noises through too many connections, it's not clear. It's not Korea. So I found that there is a saying that too many goods for the both. And in Korea, we have very similar saying for translating like if there are too many captains in a boat, the boat goes after nothing. So that is not an easy question, but when it comes to the case that the sparse network, sparse connection and dense connections. And dense connections together, like this case is. Some parts of the networks are clustered, but some parts are not. In this case, it is not easy to know that if this kinds of structure will help their in harmonized state. So for those who are not familiar with these kinds of structures, it is called a communities. It is called a communities. So it's not a micro scale or major scale structure, so called sorry, the macro scale. It is so called major scale because you don't think about each single node, not whole structure, but some part of it cluster together. So my talk today is focusing on those kinds of structure, so-called community structure, and I'd like to make And I'd like to make a connection between this community structure and the dynamic behavior of a network. And specifically, I'd like to focus on the synchronization stability of a network. And the conclusion first, it influences. So we found that from the electric power network, but I believe that it is. But I believe that it can be applied for different kinds of networks. The power grid, I would like to introduce power grid because that is the main topic. The power grid is simply a line connection. The transmission line connections carrying high voltage electricity. It passes through all the way through the continent in length, so it is literally the world. Is literally the world's largest engineering system. We can convert this power grid structure into a network structure. The node can represent a single generator or a power plant or aggregated regions. So it depends on if the nodes generate or consume the electricity, we can give some attributes, like the plus or minus values. Philosophy values, and of course, the links actually represent the transmission lines. So, on top of this network, the electricity goes and they interact. So, there are interactions on power grids. So, the role of power grid is to supply quality electricity. The quality means two things mainly: the voltage and frequency. The voltage and frequencies. In Canada, I guess the rate frequency is 15 and the US, but in Asia mainly is 60. Anyway, in probably the frequency should be maintained as a certain numbers. If we consume much, it can be decreased. If we generate more, it can be increased. So, So they changes real time and very frequently. Frequency changes frequently. So we can analyze it by so-called swing equations. And for the equation, we represent, we vimit the interaction between the oscillators in the power base. The most important variable is The most important value of reserve P, for example, Q means the amount of power generation or consumption, and K represents the transmission capacity or coupling strength. So the larger K means we can transmit electricity much or they can interact each other. And Sera means their face, and here with everything is Is according to the reference frame. So the ideal state over here is the omega is 0, meaning that they are synchronized. Because the difference between the frequency of each node to the rate frequency is 0. So here omega 0 is the desired state function. So from this equations we can simulate We can simulate their dynamics. For example, when we have two nodes, they are synchronized basically, and we give a perturbation, we shake the system. And depends on the size of the perturbation, they can recover their synchronized status or lose their synchrony. And when it comes to more complex connections, the story is not that easy. The story is not that easy, but anyway, they interact on top of their network. So sometimes they can recover and sometimes they are not. So to analyze the stability of their synchronization, there is a concept called Bayesian stability. So the idea of the Bayesian stability is very simple. Let's measure the size of the Bayesian of attractions, precisely the proportion of the Bayesian attraction. The proportion of the basin of the objection for example here this is the kinds of a window for their state and according to their dynamics they can recover or cannot recover. So you just can measure their Bayesian of attraction and the relative volume of the Verit volume of the Begeloc attraction can represent their probability of coming back to the synchronized state. In practice, everything can be done by computational simulations and we can count the number of initial states that can recover their synchronized state. So, that is the basic concept of the basic stability. And using this, we can. And using this, we can measure the stability of the synchronization of each node. Things that the value can change according to the k. Again, k represents the transmission capacity or the strength of the interactions. So larger k means that their interaction can be reinforced, then their stability. Then their stability can increase. So basically, when we have only two nodes, it is known that the Bayesian stability increases bridges according to the K and at certain point they reach two units because it is considered that the structure is very strong, so any perturbation can be melted down. melt it down. So from the status window, the size of the page and obtrusion can expand and finally everything is below here. Our idea is that in this situation, measuring the Bayesian stability at certain cake could not mean anything because it changes. For example, here we have a net. Here we have a network and we have the result of aging stability of nodes at this k and we have another one from this k and their relative trend varies. So we come up with to measure the width of their transition, meaning that we record of the k values when they start. When they start to get any value of basic stability, and another k value, which is k high, when they reach to the unity. So the larger, the wider range of k means that they need more larger k values to get the very synchronized status, the very stable status. So we measured it from the Chilean network and again. And again, when we change the k values, the value stability can change it. But it's not that simple. I mean, for example, here we have most of the nodes have a very low basis stability at this k, but here most of the nodes have very stable synchronized the synchronization stability. And the difference between those two case are not the most. Between those two cases, there are nothing much. So we wanted to understand how to analyze this. So we analyze the width of the range of the K changes for the nodes. And here is the result. So most of the nodes have very sharp transitions, meaning that Transitions, meaning that with only a few k they can be very stable. But we found that some nodes requires very wide range of k changes, meaning that they need larger and larger k values to be very stable. And it happens only a few nodes that are located in between two looks like a cluster areas. So what? That was our So what? That was our questions. And you see there are some nodes. A, for example, they change very sharply. In BC, they require more wider range of K. So that was a mistake. A should be indicating one of those very light colored nodes. So is the community structure related with the stability? With the stability. To know this, we came up with some ideas. So let's start from how to measure the community. So there is a very popular measure known as modulity. And the idea is that we compare their connection or partition with the random connections. So for example For example, from this example network, we made any partition from it. And if the edges crossing different communities, if there is an edge between two nodes crossing different communities, then we don't give any points to the scores. And if the partition is very clearly separated to their innated community, then we give a point. The idea of the modularity is very simple, and we can get we can their partition that makes the larger value of modularities. And one of the And one of the popular measures to analyze their modulocity and get the community structure is called Ruban algorithm. So from this robot algorithm, they try to change their community identity to the community identity of their neighbors. So they change their identity and decide if this changing increases. Changing increases their modularity over now. So the community identity expands to the neighbor nodes on the networks. Problem is that this process requires a random selection of the nodes in the networks, meaning that it's not a deterministic process, it's a stochastic process. So the results of this The results of this robot algorithm can vary. So, this was considered as a kind of a disadvantage. But JY introduced that the bias of the work can be an advantage also. Why not take advantage of this stochasticity? So, for example, we measure their community structures many times and analyze their co-currency. Their currency between nodes. So if two nodes are identified as the same community many times, maybe you can consider that the node has very strong community identity. So that's the key idea of this community consistency measures. So you can measure from all nodes. And for example, here the central three nodes has very high value of Has very high value of community inconsistency or low value of consistency. So this can give you some new information because, for example, based on the between S definition, they only consider the shortest path. And the two top nodes are not in the shortest path in the network. So maybe only one node will get very high score between the centrality. If you just Centrality. We just use the method. But since we consider the whole structure with commuting consistency, we can pick some nodes in the whole network that they are somewhat in similar locations. So we measured it from the Chilean network. To do so, we measured many times of the rubbing. We measured many times of the roban and then analyzed their community consistency. And we found that community consistency is very correlated with the synchronization stabilities. So that was one finding about us. And to compare with this, we use the Bayesian stabilities. And again, the concept of the Bayesian stability is to The concept of the Bayesian stability is to measure the size of the Bayesian obstruction. But technically, it is a nodal measure, meaning that we can measure Bayesian stability from all nodes one by one. But it doesn't mean the stability of each node, it's a stability of the network. So considering the process, it goes like this. We perturb one node. We perturb one node. You can see these figures. We perturb one node. When they are all synchronized, we perturb one node and watch the network all if all nodes recover the synchronization or not. So that's the idea of AG stability. But we were curious of the partial synchronized status because in PowerPoint, partial synchronization status status status status In PowerGrid, partial synchronization also exists and it makes sense. So we can measure the Bayesian stability considering the partial synchronization as well. So here we recall it as a functional robustness. The difference between Bayesian stability and functional robustness is that if we consider the partial synchronization or not. And there is another aspect. For those Aspects. For those measures, we perturb only one node, like a target node, and then watch what happens. And we can do another thing, we can perturb all nodes or random nodes and then analyze the node of interest. So they are like uh slightly different concepts over there. Concepts over there. For basic instability or functional robustness, it is like to see what happens if we make any changes to the target nodes. For the functional secureness, because it is to see this target node when anything happens. So there are two different perspectives. And actually, it is. For example, from this example network that has 23 nodes. Network that has 23 nodes, we can measure Bayesian stability and functional security, both of them. For example, here, Bayesian stability goes down when we perturb many nodes. But it is understandable because when we perturb many nodes, it is hard to get covered. But in the perspective of the partial synchronization, still there are many nodes are synchronized, even when many nodes. Even when we perturb many nodes. So, we can read some different information when we consider partial synchronizations. And it's very interesting because here is a German network, German power grid network, and we measure the functional secureness and hoarseness and basic stability from the network. And there are some structures. You can see that the basic. You can see that the red nodes are on the right side and the blue nodes are on the left side, meaning that on the right, most of the nodes are less stable in terms of the functional secureness. And here, when we see the functional robustness, there are very low values in the middle of the networks. And in the Bayesian stability, you don't see those kinds of characteristics. And what does it mean? So let's analyze the community structure. We have five communities in German network and there are some edges shown as the pink color here. So pink color edges connecting two communities. So they are located in between two different communities. And we found that there are some errors. There are some areas where it has very low value of functional secureness. So for me, it looks like the pink nodes are bridges between the stable and unstable regions. And here, the very low functional robustness nodes are connected to the bridges. So why? I don't know. I have no idea. Yeah. No, it's a far eastern part. No, it's the former eastern part. That's where the model was. Yeah. So to understand this, we are analyzing further researches, but at least we found that there are connections between the stability and the community structure. And we tested with the benchmark network that has three communities and we set a community to produce electricity. Produce electricity to the whole network so the flow of the current flow is coming out from the blue communities. And in that case, those communities has very low stability. But instead, if the community consumes more, then the community is very stable. So again, I don't have any clue to understand this, but we are continuing analyzing this. So as a summary, we found that connection between The connection between the community structure and the stability of the power grinders. And hopefully, this can be a tool to understand the nuclear networks. So, thank you very much. Right, thank you, Fidel. We have some questions. Thank you for the presentation. Thank you for your presentation. I have a question. Have you considered, so there is the presence of community structure. There is the association with whether with the robustness of the dynamical behavior of the nodes. And there is this measurement of how often these nodes fall into different communities, which you're measuring as an inconsistency measurement. And you wonder what's the role of a more The role of a more basic network characteristic as of the presence of triangles? What extent this place is a role? For instance, you could have a two-dimensional regular lattice that has an extremely high clustering coefficient, but it doesn't have modular structure because everything is homogeneously connected through plenty of threads with everything. Can you consider what is the effect on that, this? Yes and no, because we we tried many structures basically basic structures called motifs. So like a six hundred motif that has four or six nodes, but it is too small. So what we found is just there is a correlation between the betweenness and the stability. But we didn't do any analysis, massive analysis for those clustering structures. That can be very interesting to be. Interesting. It was a very quick result of Serviceman, but it seemed to me that many times the red nodes will actually have little or no triangles in some of your examples. So there might be an association between that, the impossibility to characterize the community belonging because there is not a clear variable association and the role it may take in this. Yes. I always agree. Thank you. I have a question. I have a question from Davor online, Decorate. Thank you, Dave. Thanks for the talk, Reidovi. I'm curious, are you able to apply your analysis here to something like Japan's power grid network, where you have the two structurally defined 50 hertz and 60 hertz structures, but they are weakly coupled to one another. I'm wondering if you can, if you can, like. If you can use this as a model and then change the coupling between the two power work systems and see what happens, if you think about doing that or have done something like that. Where do we come from? I think not Japan because not many people know about that. Japan has two different prequencies. Yeah, that's a very interesting feature. I think I can apply this method only if I have the Only if I have the network data of the Japan power base. And the idea of your question is that there could be two different ideal status in a network. So that can be a very interesting topic. Thank you. Thank you. Any other questions here? No, that's thank you again. Thank you. So now we're still doing a short break.
