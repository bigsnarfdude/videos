Thank you. Thank you very much, Christine. Thank you, Jarel. Thank you, Pierre. So it's a pleasure to present the work we were doing in our lab the last years. So it's a delocalized Banff meeting. And I was in Banff 10 years ago. And the souvenir is the freedom, the liberty, and to think about Banff when you are coming. And to think about Banf when you are confined, it's quite extraordinary and quite unexpected. You see the view behind a group of people from the conference. Of course, this is not what all of us would like to see. So I will speak about internal wave. I will start with a quite long introduction, introducing this internal wave. I know that most of you are mathematicians, and I will introduce this to these waves maybe, which are quite interesting. Which are quite interesting. Then I will introduce what are attractors, which are more beautiful mathematical objects, but I hope more than that. Then I will discuss an experiment that has been performed in our lab last year, has been performed by Geraldine Davis, her name is done there, who defended her PhD a few months ago and who has done most of this work. Then I will consider the regime. The regime beyond linearity, where you will see that we can see some first signatures of wave turbulence or since it. And then I will conclude and give some perspectives. So I will start with some simple points and a slow introduction. I will speak today about stratified fluids and the atmosphere and the ocean are two examples, two very good examples. Two very good examples in which the density rho is a function of the temperature or of the salinity or both. And we call these stratified fluids because the density is a function of the spatial variable Z through this temperature and salinity. And so there are different strats. And I will speak today only about stably stratified fluids, which means that the dense fluid will be below the the lower density fluid. Lower density fluid. So we will not have convection or almost no convection. I will mention it when we will see this. So I will start with a very simple idea that has been studied a long time ago and which has been discovered by a Norwegian explorer. His name is Fridjotz Nansen. You have his picture. He seems to be a very nice guy. But if you agree with him, if not, you are not sure what will. With him. If not, you are not sure what will go on. So, in this time, he was very proud of his boat, which was called the Fram, and his boat was able to go quite fast for the time, six to seven knots. But in some situations, for example, in the case on this picture, in Norway, you have a lot of fjords where you have fresh water flowing onto the salt water, the sea. In this situation, his boat was not able to move. His boat was not able to move fast as it should be. So, this experiment has been reproduced by Ekman during his PhD. And the idea was to study a tank where you have fluids with different fluids, fresh water on the top, salt water in the intermediate region, and a very salty water at the bottom. And the idea is to play with a boat, to put a boat on this fluid, and to pull. Fluid and to pull the boat with a constant force and to look for the behavior of the boat as a function of time. And then, as physicists, you can play with different parameters, the weight of the boat, the depth of the layers, the different intensities, the tension of the rope, which means the weight of this mass. But today I will present only one experiment to show you what's going on, so that you will understand what are internal waves. So, this experiment has been performed. So, this experiment has been performed by a former PhD student of mine, Mathieu Mercier, who is now a CNOS researcher in Toulouse, and Roman Vassau, who is working in the US. So, the boat was originally the boat of my son. You are not able to see the rope, which is too thin. You have the fresh water in red, the very salty water in yellow, and in between, the salty water. And then I will start the movie. Salty water. And then I will start the movie, and you will see the boat starting to move. And if you see from where you are, from the camera, you see that below the surface, you have some waves which are generated by the motion of the boat. And you will see that the amplitude of the waves is quite large of the order of the depth of the different layers and is increasing. So its speed is going faster. And at some point, the boat is stopped as it was trapped. As it was trapped by the waves below the surface. If you are in the boat, you are not able to see anything on the surface. There are no ripples. Everything is below the surface. So these waves are called internal waves. And if you are on the boat, you would call this, and this is how it was called, the dead water phenomenon, because your boat is stopped and you are not able to understand why the water is like dead. You do not see anything. Like dead, you do not see anything. So, these waves, which could be very large in amplitude, do exist in nature. And this is the domain that I would like to discuss. Actually, if you look very carefully, if you go very close to the boat, you would be able to see some ripples, which are signature of the very large amplitude waves below the surface. But if, in this case, the amplitude is case the amplitude is of a few centimeters the ripples are a few millimeters so if you look if you go to the to the to the to the planet earth and if you are able to see satellite images or for example this domain which is the south china sea you are able to see so this is china taiwan philippines you are below the what is called the luzon strait you have a very important bottom topography which is which is Which is interacting with tides and which are generating waves which are propagating as internal waves below the surface of the ocean. And at some points, you see these very long straight lines, a few thousand kilometers large, but very thin in the other direction, which are propagating as solitons, are trends of solitons, and which are very important. They are very important for several reasons. Very important for several reasons. They are very important for whales because these whales are able to extract planktons from the deep ocean and are providing whales with very good foods. They are very important also for this island where you have a coral reef on the east part, which is provided by planktons, which is a very lively, important food for them. It's important also for, you know, for geopolitical reasons that there are a lot. Geopolitical reasons that there are a lot of submarines in this region because of different interest, political interest. And for different reasons, this region is very well studied, especially by different naval research laboratories. So these waves do exist. They are below the ocean. And last time I went to the Gugeven Museum in New York, I was quite interested by this nice painting that you... Nice painting that you can maybe see for those of you who are in New York, where you have this, I was told, very expensive painting, and you see that it was written to the sea, from the sea, bordering the sea, at the sea, on the sea, but not beneath the sea. And today we will clearly speak about what's going on beneath the sea. So the physical waves that I will discuss are in a more realistic situation or set. Situation or setup, instead of considering the three-layer system, which is a simplified, quite interesting, but simplified version, I will consider a case where the stratification is inner. So you have a pure water on the top, very salty water on the bottom, and you have a straight line in between. In such a case, I can explain with a few words the physics of the heterodynamic waves below the surface. At a given density, so this is. At a given density, so this is the vertical density, you have larger density at the bottom, lower density at the top. If you consider a fluid particle at a given depth, if you move it towards the top, it will be surrounded by lower density. And as you know, there will be a competition between gravity and buoyancy. This is the law due to Archimedes. And so there will be a restoring force and actually an oscillation with a given frequency. With a given frequency, which is due directly to the gradient of density. If you move a fluid particle to the top, if the density is the same, the fluid particle will stay there. But if there is a gradient of density, there will be a restoring force and there will be this oscillation. And the frequency is called the brain-based electric because of these two meteorologists between the two world wars. It's interesting to discuss about numbers. In the ocean, these In the ocean, this system, these waves are very important. For example, in the South Channel Sea, the solitons are typically every day, actually twice a day, 200 meters per day. It's the typical amplitude of these solitons. They are huge underwater tsunamis. They are very important, but they are very slow, typically thirty minutes. In the laboratory, the typical amplitude are a few centimeters. Typical amplitude are a few centimeters, few millimeters, and the period is typically 10 seconds. So you have large amplitudes, but rather slow. From the mathematical point of view, usually we describe the physics of these waves using the velocity field, actually, that I will call U, and there is a Nadistox equation. So the incompressibility condition is quite accurate, especially if you speak about the ocean. You can discuss it. Ocean, you can discuss it if when you apply it to the atmosphere, which is also an important domain of application. But today I will consider this simplified version. And then you have the right-hand side where you have the term due to the pressure, and you have a term due to the gradient of density, which is written in the term of the buoyancy. And you have here the buoyancy, which is a difference between the static buoyancy, the static density and the instantaneous density. And there could be some dissipation. Some dissipation. In the ocean, the dissipation is not very important and could be neglected. These waves can be propagating over thousands of kilometers without being damped. It's quite astonishing, but you can explain it quite easily. And then you have a mass conservation equation, which is coupled to this equation, and that you have to solve simultaneously. So I will discuss this two system of equations. To a system of equations restricting to the vertical 2D domain, introducing the string function, which is nothing but this string function psi, which is linked directly to the velocity field in terms of the two components, which are valid if you are considering only the vertical flow. So, using this two function, you can simplify these two equations introducing the Jacobian, and you have two coupled equations. And you have two coupled equations, which are not so easy to understand from the direct inspection. And then you can go one step further and combine the different physics into this equation, which is quite interesting to discuss step by step. So on the left-hand side, you have some linear terms where you are n squared, this gradient of density, which will tell you which is the typical period. See the typical period or the typical frequency of the perturbation within your stratified fluid. You have a viscous term, which will be not very important, as I was anticipating. And you have on the right-hand side, non-linear terms that are quite complicated and that I would like to discuss in a minute. Let me just first focus on the linear approximation, which is already quite interesting because it is unusual. It is not a D'Alembert's equation. It's a wave equation, but different. You see that. Equation, but different. You see that the Laplacian is here, the spatial derivatives respect to the horizontal x and vertical z direction, but you see that the spatial variables are on the square on both terms. So if you look for plane wave solutions, which are sine naught times exponential of this phase, if you introduce theta, which is the angle between the wave vector k with respect. In the wave vector k with respect to the vertical direction, you get just plugging this and that into this equation, this dispersion relation, which is telling you that if you oscillate an object at a given frequency omega, you will have a propagation along different angles if n is constant. So you will excite waves only in a given angle theta once you define omega. So let's remember this point. If you keep the If you consider now the second equation with respect to the mass conservation, if you forget, because we're discussing the linear approximation, if we forget the nonlinear term, you get a linear relationship between the bayonet C and the swing function. Nothing very exceptional. And you can't test in the linear regime what's going on. So you take a tug, you fill it with salt water, so you have pure. Water. So you have pure water on the top, you have salty water on the bottom, and you expect to be able to excite a boundary condition. So in our lab, we divide 10 years ago wave generator, which is only vertical planes, which are oscillating vertically, but at a given frequency omega, and with a periodic, with a boundary condition. And because you excite all the Because you excite all the plates at a given frequency omega, and as they are able to propagate only the direction theta, you are able to see what's going on. And this is a typical experimental result that, of course, you can get numerically. You see that the black region is more or less where is located the wave generator. You are exciting waves below downward with a color which is nothing but the phase. So, actually, you see that the wave propagation is. You see that the wave propagation is going away from the wave generator, but the phase are aligned perpendicularly to this value. Actually, the group velocity is downward, but the phase velocity is orthogonal to this group velocity. And it's not a surprise if you use this dispersion relation, you compute the group velocity and the phase velocity, you can easily show this orthogonality. So it's not usual for most physicists, and I guess for most mathematics. Most physicists, and I guess for most mathematicians, but it's quite interesting already for that. Let's consider now the non-linear case. Let's increase the amplitude of the string function. And so, let's switch on the red term, which were on the right-hand side. So, we have again, we are interested in the plane-wave solution, and so the Jacobian of this simple answer is quite easy to compute. It's quite easy to compute, and we get this interesting value zero because Laplacian of psi is nothing but minus k square psi. J is a Jacobian. Again, we just showed that the buoyancy is linearly proportional to the string function. So we get that the second Jacobian is also zero. So we get this very interesting result that for the string function for the plane wave solution, not only the left-hand side, but also the right-hand side is zero. Side is zero. So plane waves are solutions of the full nonlinear equation for any amplitude of the plane wave, which is not usual and which is already important and quite interesting. Of course, I will not say to mathematicians that we don't have to be careful. They are not necessarily stable. And actually, if we wait some time in the former video, so let's show again the video. You will see that. Again, the video, you will see that after some time at the beginning, the beam is very well collimated, but after some time, you see a perturbation here, for example, and you will see that there is some instability which is appearing. So, these plane waves are solutions, but they are not always stable. I should add that I was discussing only plane wave solutions, because it's faster to show this, but actually, for any Actually, for any uniform beam, for any beam which is propagating in a given direction with a given angle theta, whatever is the transversal profile, you have an exact nonlinear solution of the full nonlinear equation, which is quite interesting for nonlinear physicists. So, let's consider this nonlinear regime and let's study if we can say something more about it. So, experimentally, we have a signal, it's quite easy to make a Quite easy to make a Fourier transform and to show that if we excite, if the forcing is at a given frequency omega naught, which is given here, after the instability appeared, we see that there are three peaks in the Fourier spectrum. In that case, we just computed the Fourier spectrum differently, but it's really the same thing. And you get two different peaks, and you see that omega one plus omega two is. See that omega one plus omega two is nothing but omega naught. It's possible to go one step further using the Hilbert transform. It's possible to extract the phase of the different of the of this beam for the different frequency omega naught, omega one, and omega two. So you take your beam, you filter at frequency omega zero, for example, the forced frequency, the forcing frequency, and you compute the phase. And you get this nice result. And of course, because the phase is And of course, because the phase is Kx plus LZ minus omega t, if you are able to differentiate, you can compute the wave vector. And actually, you can do it for the beam filtered at omega naught, omega 1 and omega 2. And you are able to compute the three different wave vectors. And you get this second interesting law, this resonance condition that K0, which is a wave vector that you are sending into the tank, is the standard. Into the tank is destabilized and is giving rise to two different frequencies, omega one and omega two, but not any one, only the one with the wave vector k1 and k2, so that you have this resonance condition. So this is a very nice example of triadic resonance stability that you can check experimentally quite easily and quite precisely. So this was my long introduction. Now we've come into the main topic of the problem. The main topic of the problem and discuss this idea of internal wave attractors that may be interesting for some of you. So let's consider this simple beam, which are controlled by this dispersion law, where omega is directly linked to the sine of the angle of propagation theta. And you can see that you could be interested in the reflection on a ray on the vertical beam, on the vertical wall. Vertical beam on the vertical wall, excuse me. So you see that to follow this dispersion law, nothing very special, you obtain something which is analogous to the Snelleka reflection, nothing very interesting. Things are much more interesting if you consider the reflection on inclined wall, which could be defined like that, with an angle alpha. If you take the very same incident ray, you cannot take the usual standard cart reflection. The usual Slendercard reflection ray because it is not inclined at the given frequency omega, while the reflected ray has to follow the frequency omega. So it is not possible. So it will be different. And actually, if you think about it, the only one could be only the very same reflected ray, even if alpha is non-zero, as it was before for vector wall. Things are more interesting if you consider a beam. Now you have a beam, not a single way. Not a single way, and you see that the width of the beam, because of this reflection law, is larger before than after the reflection. There is a transfer, a linear transfer, because I'm only using the linear dispersion relation. There is a linear transfer to small scales, and actually there is a formula that you can check analytically, numerically, and experimentally. But what is important is that you have an energy focalization which is present. Which is present in the linear regime only because of the incline wall. So, this is the first ingredient that we have to keep in mind. It's a linear ingredient and that will be very effective in changing the wavelengths. So, some time ago, Leromas from Nurs Institute in Netherlands proposed the following idea. Let's take a simple tank where you have a vertical wall, an inclined wall. Wall, an inclined wall, and in between you have a fluid which is stratified at a given density ρ, linearly stratified. If you are able to excite a beam in such a tank, it will be propagating at a given angle theta, plus or minus theta, and after a few reflections, if you are able to follow the beam, it will end along this black limit cycle, as you will see in a second. If you take the very See in a second. If you take the very same tank but another point, exciting at a given at the very same frequency omega, but for example changing theta, you will end up along the very same black lines, which are, as you understand, the limit cycle. For any point on the left wall, if you are able to excite at a given frequency, the energy will eventually converge toward this internal wave. Toward this internal wave attractor. So it has been possible to show, and this has been it has been studied a lot by Leomas, that if you change the frequency omega or if you change the angle theta, you can have more complex factor. You could have two affections on the top and one on the left, or one on the top and three on the left, or something that we would like to call ergodic-like picture. And actually, it means that we And actually, it means that we don't have an attractor, or you could have cases where in which the beams are attracted towards this point, which are called point attractors. So you have a system in which you do not change the geometry, you only change theta or you change the frequency of the forcing, and you have a BR which has different rules with respect to the BR that we are used to study mathematically or to play when it's possible, but it's only a BR. But it's really a BR. So this study has led to this nice picture, which will take me two minutes to introduce, but which is a very good summary of the results derived by Leomas. In this plot, it is possible to show the Lyapudo exponent. Let's take two beams initially parallel, excited at the very same frequency in the stratified fluid, and you Stratified fluid, and you follow their path, and you are able to follow the divergence of the two beams. And you will understand that it's possible to compute the Lyapunov exponent. That you will plot with a frequency omega in vertical and with the geometry horizontally, which means that only the angle alpha, the depth and the length. The depth and the length of the tank cannot be changed, but you can modify the inclination of the tank going from a rectangular tank to a trapoisoidal tank or to a triangular tank. And you can move along this line. You will move along this line just by changing omega because n is due to the fluid, it's given and the geometrical parameter are given. So changing omega or changing alpha, you can have a point on this. You can have a point on this domain. And actually, you can show that in this system, all points have non-positive values, which means that attractors are really generic. And you have domains in which they are very attractive. And, for example, in this white tongue, you will see the one-one attractor with one attractor on the top, one on the left, and actually moving. The left, and actually, moving from the top to the bottom, you will move. Ah, there is a problem. Sorry, you will move to a very thin in one direction, in the middle you will have this square, and then at the bottom, you will would have a very thin in the other direction. And in these other tongues, you will get one, three attractors, or ergodic-like attractors, or all attractors that I discussed briefly earlier. Briefly earlier. So, on this plot, you see that attractors are generic, and this is important from the mathematical point of view, but even more for the physical point of view. And you can get different kinds of attractors that are of interest. So, it's possible to see this attractor experimentally, and this is part of our work in our lab. So, we have a tank which is typically one meter deep, then two meters wide. Two meters wide in length and very thin. So it's almost a Kazi 2D flow. And we have a generator which is able to move at the given frequency omega with a profile which will excite some modes, some vertical modes. So this is a typical experiment that has been performed by Geraldine Davis that was discussing, that they funded a PhD a few months ago. And the nice result can be seen hopefully. Can be seen. Hopefully, I hope your connection is good enough. So, she has prepared a tank in which the fluid is linearly stratified, the pure water on the top, very salty water on the bottom. And she has put some the wave generator in the left-hand side, and you will hardly see it moving. Remember that the width of the tank, the length is two meters, and the typical amplitude for this video will be a few millimeters, two millimeters, so you will not really see it. will not really see it and we have put some actually she has put some some dye to show the line of with the same density so which are what we call isopignals with our which are shown with pleurisy so this is the the the video which is starting hope you will see so initially you excite only the left hand side of the tank and you see what's going on so i hope you see something i don't have Hope you see something. I don't have any feedback, but on my screen, I'm able to see that if you are in the center of the tank, you hardly see any moving. But you are able maybe to see some motion along this pattern, which I will call in a minute internal wave attractor. And so you excite globally on the left-hand side the waves, the internal waves, but they are clearly converging towards the predicted internal wave attractor. So internal wave attractor. Wave attractor. So, internal wave attractors are not only mathematical beautiful objects, but are quite interesting and which are visible in labs. So, it's possible to make the comparison between the prediction and the experimental results. This is what is shown on this slide, where you see after 6, 12, or 30 periods what's going on. And this is the prediction, the theoretical prediction. And you see that there is a big difference with respect to the prediction, is that the widths of the attractor is that the width of the attractor was infinitely seen or is infinitely seen, while experimentally there is a a balance, there is a wi fa finite width, which is a balance, which is due to the balance between viscous dumping and focusing. The dissipation is quite important in the lab, not in the ocean, but quite important in the lab, and you cannot forget this. And for this reason, the focusing cannot go towards the infinitely seen attractor. Attractor. But you can play with a small tent, 40 centimeters or 2 meters, and you can see that the shape is relatively the same, but the width is smaller. This is directly linked to this equation. We do not change the viscosity, but we change the length. So we change the Reynolds number. And so it's possible to make some prediction and to study scaling laws and maybe be able to predict realistic applications. Predict realistic applications. Let me just say that it's possible to see experimentally two-one tractor, more complex attractor. This is a two-one expression. So this is what are attractors. And now I would like to come really in the core of the topic that I would like to discuss today is to use these attractors to go towards internal wave turbulence. So I will study here an idea which was really Which was really due to Geraldine initially. And the idea is a very good physical idea. So it's a kicked attractor experiment, as we call it. So the idea is to do as a musician will do. They are used to play with a tuning fork that you will hit and that will reverberate, emitting a pure musical tone, but you may have also other tones. The idea is that. The idea is the same, but to play with our system, so instead of having a forcing which is at a given frequency omega, we will start in the red position, move very far to the blue position, vertical position, and stop. So it's really one kick, and then we will see how the system will respond to this strong perturbation and what will be the how you could analyze this response. Response. So, to analyze the response, I will use the very same plot I was discussing a minute ago and using this Lapunov exponent. So, I told you that if initially we were working with the forcing which was the given frequency omega and the geometry which was given, here in that case, because of the kicked, the initial kick, we extract all frequencies. And so, with only one. And so and so with only one experiment, it's possible to excite all frequencies. So it's a very nice idea. Instead of doing all different terms points one after the other, using a very simple, very short experiment, you will have ideas inside for the whole vertical line. And so you you would expect to see the s signatures of the different posi possible possible attractors. Possible attractors. So I will start again trying to be pedagogic with a simple case with the rectangular tank. So the rectangular tank means the value alpha is zero, the vertical the inclined wall is vertical, and it corresponds in this uh pattern on in this uh plot on the right hand side, right right wall. On the right-hand side, right wall. So, this is a typical results that we obtain experimentally, in which we plot the spectrum content as a function of the density omega with respect to this value n. And what do you see? You see a few well-picked bumps at given frequencies, which are nothing but the discrete modes of the rectangular geometry. Of the rectangular geometry, and you see that the prediction is in very good agreement with the experimental results. So, this system is telling you that the rectangular geometry has discrete modes. Nothing very special, this is expected, but it's a good check before doing more interesting cases. So, let's consider now the case where alpha is different from zero. So, we are clearly an inclined role in the experiments. So, we have a domain which is this trapoisoid. Which is this trapozoidal tongue. And again, using this kink, we expect to explore the whole vertical line for this value of this parameter d, which is called which is related to the geometry and actually to the angle alpha. So in that case, you see that we are still bumps, but they are not well picked. We are clearly large bumps on very large domains, and the structure is quite different. And the structure is quite different. We have more bands than peaks or modes, clearly. And it has been possible to show experimentally using some movies. I don't show many movies, but everything is given in Geraldine's PhD manuscript or available directly by asking her or to me. So this is what we get using this spectrum. So you have the evolution of function of the frequency, you have Frequency, you have a different band. So let's take the first band. The different frequencies, you can filter the signal either close to the top or on the left or on the right. And this is what is shown here, omega A, omega B, and omega C. So if you are filtering along around omega B, you see that we have a very well-shaped attractor, almost squared. If you are before smaller frequency, you have elongated in one direction. You have elongated in one direction. If you are B after, you are elongated in the other direction. And actually, this band is corresponding to this white tongue. Then actually, this bumps is a sign, a signature of what's going on inside these white tongues. But you have more than that because you have a second bumps. And actually, you can see clearly that if you filter at omega E, omega D, or omega. E, omega D, or omega S, you can see the two one attractor which are more or less elongated, which means that you are more or less in the center of the second band, and so on. And you can go for a few bands, and if you are doing quite careful experiments, you can go up to four bands. So, the resume is the following for different experiments. You have on the right-hand side this quick moss. Right-hand side, discrete modes, which are expected for a rectangular geometry. But in the domain where you are expecting attractors, where you have these white tongues, you have different, you have something like which are called bonds actually, which are close to, which are not anymore discrete, and that maybe could be explained using the terms of casimotes that is discussed by Yves Column Zeradier and Lore Serremon. Yves Columbia Adier and Lour Séremon in their recent nice work published last year in communication on pure and applied maths. So, clearly, these internal aware tractors are not only mathematical beautiful objects, but are some reality in the physical tanks that we have in our lab. And we would like to use them and to see if we can get some inside of them to study wave terms. To study wave turance in the sense that we have a broadband frequency spectrum because of this trapezoidal geometry that we do for the rectangular geometry. And as you will see, it is very important to get this broadband spectrum to get internal wave turbulence. So time is going, so I have to continue and go beyond the linear regime. So this is the second experiment. So, this is the second experiment, not the same thing, but we just increase the amplitude of the forcing. So, now in that case, the excitation is not only two millimeters, but typically 12 or 15 millimeters. You see that it's still possible to see the internal wave attractor. In the center of the tank, you are able to see some oscillation. And close to this branch, clearly, you see some oscillation. Oscillation, something which are close to overtunings that could be important. So, if you do a careful study of the experimental results, you are able to see that clearly initially you have the formation of this internal aware attractor with the dissipation along the attractor. You see the dumping or the fading of the different colors, and then the focalization, which explains the Which explains the fact that we get a limit cycle despite the dumping. But if the forcing is too large, you have a destabilization, especially close to the branch after the reflection, after focalization, which is very reminiscent of the periodic resonance interaction that I was discussing before. And actually, it's possible to carefully study the instability and show that we have as before. Have as before and as expected, we have a large amplitude beam because it is after reflection, after focalization. So, we have a large amplitude beam which can be destabilized by this triadic resonance instability. You can measure the different frequencies, the different wave vectors, and you get the two conditions that could be checked experimentally. So, because of this, once you have an eternal attractor, you can get the first The first initiation of a cascade, or actually a succession of frequencies, because you force a system with only one frequency omega naught, and because of stereotypic resonance instability, you get two frequencies or two wave vectors, and so it's the beginning of what we would expect. So, the idea that I will discuss is the experiment that I will discuss was also performed Was also performed recently by Geraldine and Timote Jamin, who was a postdoc in our group. So, in that experiment, we have the evolution as a function of time of the amplitude in red of the forcing. So, initially, this is a linear regime, the first video. At the end, it's a large amplitude forcing, typically 10 millimeters. So, typically, the second video I was discussing. Second video I was discussing with the overtwinnings. And in blue, you have the evolution of the horizontal component of the velocity field in a given point of the top. So initially, you have a very nice oscillation, calm, then you have some perturbation, then you have something that in the loosey sense you could call chaotic, and then you have something which is clearly not stationary and that you have to discuss more precisely. And that you have to discuss more precisely. If you do some analysis, let me just show pictures first and then I will describe more precisely. It's possible to filter the evolution, to filter the signal in this region, in the intermediate regime, and in the non-linear regime. And you see that initially you have a quite nice internal web attractor, then you have something where you can recognize the internal weather tractor, but it is a good idea. Recognize the internal attractor, but it is a bit loosey. And then you cannot really defend that you see anything like an internal attractor. So the internal attractor actually is still present, and you can disentangle it from the perturbation, but because of the 3D resonance instability and other instabilities that I will discuss, it is hidden in a sea of other frequencies that I will be very interested to discuss with you. So, this experiment was inspired by some studies in vibrating plates, which was done especially by Cyril Touzet and colleagues in France 10 years ago. And the idea is really to follow the evolution of this amplitude of the forcing and to see the response of the system. So, this is a typical signal that you get. A typical signal that you get after some quite long analysis. So, this is a time-frequency diagram, which means the frequency content that I will discuss in a minute, as a function of the frequency vertically and as a function of time horizontally. So, initially, you excite only at a given frequency omega. In that case, it was 0.62. So, you excite waves because the system is at a given with an inclined. With an inclined wall at a given value of alpha, you excite an internal wave attractor at a given frequency omega. But when you increase the amplitude, you have to remember that I will increase the amplitude as a function of the time slowly, but the experiment is typically four hours, so it's a slow increase, but typically it's very important to increase. So at some point, there is some destabilization. You see clearly the generation of two different frequencies, which are nothing but the generation of subarbonic waves. But the generation of subarbonic waves. The amplitude of the main beam is too large. The beam is not anymore stable, and the traditional instability is taken into place. And you have this two-dispersion condition that have to be fulfilled and that are fulfilled, actually. And then the amplitude of these secondary waves is increasing also, and these secondary waves could be also destabilized. Waves could be also destabilized by this very same phenomena. So you could have a traditional instability of the superadominic waves. So you see that you have a succession of instabilities. And actually in this third part, especially in the nonlinear regime, there is a new mechanism, which is a tradick resonance interaction. In that case, you could have two different frequencies, typically omega one or omega two, generated by the different frequencies. By the different instabilities before, and omega one plus omega two, by the very same quadratic term in the Navistox equation, could provide another frequency omega three, and the same thing with the wave vector. And so you expect in that domain multiple interaction that will be the second step and a very important step to get some very large succession of frequencies interaction. Frequencies interaction. So, this third step, which is clearly a non-linear transfer of frequencies and wave vector via triadic resonance interactions and instabilities, is taking place at large forcing amplitude and presumably a very important ingredient for wave turbulence. An important way to characterize Way to characterize typical internal wave systems, especially experimentally or numerically. It has been shown in a few talks, for example, yesterday by Sergei and also Monday afternoon. It's possible to follow the evolution of the energy spectrum as a function of the wave vector with different amplitude of the forcing. So the blue is a linear regime, a very small forcing. A very small forcing, only an internal wave attractor. And the red is when you have this very wavy system where the attractor has disappeared and which is close to what we expect to be closer to be internal wave turbulence. And this is typical results that Timothy and Geraldine actually also together with Julie Deleuze obtain, where you see initially something which is Something which has an exponential form, which has been predicted by Beckbans, Felis Beckbans, and Leo Mas recently. But at larger forcing amplitude, it is clearly not anymore an exponential. It is closer to an exponential law. You see that it is compatible with a chi minus three exponent that would be would have to be confirmed. Have to be confirmed. You see also that the extent of the validity of this possible exponent is not huge, but definitely there is a transition between an exponential law to something closer to a power law decay with an exponent that will have to be understood theoretically. More recently, it has been possible to Recently, it has been possible to change the type of forcing and to study cases where we have a strongly focused attractor or weakly focused attractor or by tuning the frequency, what we call frequency-modulated attractor. And this is typical result obtained last June, especially by Julie Deleuze, where you get these results which are quite encouraging, where you see that also the domain, the extent is not used. The domain, the extent is not huge. It seems that the type of forcing is not important. We have something that is compatible with this behavior and that will have to be confirmed. So let me conclude by two different slides by saying that we have in parallel some we have studied different setups, especially internal aware attractors. So the first experiment, so there is a strong analogy, but also different. Strong analogy, but also differences between systems in which the fluid is stratified in density but not moving, with the cases where you have a rotating tank with a homogenous fluid. In that case, you have inertial waves due to the Coralis force, while we have this Archeminis flow, which we are giving rise to internal waves. So, when you have inertial waves and not internal waves, so when you have a fluid which is not stratified, but which is rotating. Stratified, but which is rotating as you see on the left-hand side. If you have able to have an oscillatory boundary condition, you can get some picture. So, this is which has been obtained by Maxime Brunet and Pierre-Philippe Corté in Orsay, in Paris, where clearly we get a pattern which is very reminiscent to what has been obtained using internal waves. There are some differences. There are some differences and that would need to be discussed and understood. Even more recently, this is a PhD stasis of Samuel Bury, and especially with his PhD advisor, Philippe Baudier, but also Evgeny Armanouk, who is also working on this problem, and Ilya C. Batoulin. So, in that case, we have an axisymmetric domain with a homogeneous fluid. Everything is rotating along the vertical axis. Along the vertical axis. There is also a top condition which is oscillating. So we are able to generate inertial waves. There is a domain with an inclined wall. So the system of internal wave attractor is giving rise here inertial wave attractors as the inertial waves were leading because of the trapezoid on the left hand side to inertial wave attractors. And in that case, it's possible to have a pattern. Possible to have patterns very close to what is expected to retoky. And in that case, it's also possible to study the transition towards the non-linear regime and to get insight and to study analogies and differences. And this is work interesting. So these are several systems which are not very different, but which have some diff differences in which we get similar results. We get similar results. So, let me conclude by this take-home messages slide just by saying, for those of you who are not aware, there are very important underwater tsunamis, which are called internal wave gravity waves. So, tsunamis of typically 200 meters every day in the South Channel Sea are very usual and very well known and very well studied. These internal wave gravity waves are very important. Internal wave gravity waves are very important for the studies of inertial waves and internal wave attractors in experimental labs, but also in numerical and experimental and theoretical studies. And finally, we believe that it's an experimental setup which is excellent, which is very appropriate to study the interaction of different waves, especially internal waves, in which the study of internal wave turbulence. The study of fentanyl wave turbulence is still starting, is only starting. So, there are many open questions. Why this k minus 3? I don't really understand. Could it be possible to consider a less restricted experimental setup, especially from the geometrical point of view? Yes, and we are trying to start a new geometrical domain. What are the differences between inertial waves and internal waves? Waves and internal waves, which are the same dispersion relation but clearly differences experimentally. These are these are interesting questions that I would be very pleased to discuss with you and especially with people belonging to the Simon Foundation. I would like to conclude my talk by some acknowledgements, especially the PhD students. So I already introduced Geraldine Davis who just Carline Davis, who just defended her PhD, and Timote Jama, who was very important also in the analysis of the data. Julie Deleuze, who was doing an undergraduate internship last spring with us. Christophe Bruze and Hélène Scullin were studying the internal wave attractor in earlier stages, but were very important. And my two very close colleagues, Evgeny Amanu from 3DC University. Manuel from 3DC University and Sijan Joubot from the lab, who is very, very important for the day-to-day work and for discussion of physics. I would like to conclude by some publication, and I'm really open to question if any of you have some of them. Thank you very much. Any questions for the speaker? I have a question. So I think the turbine theory for I think the turbine theory for the internal gravity waves is like the theoretical solution is in terms of the parallel for the vertical wave number and the frequency. Have you looked at the experimental result in terms of the spectrum of vertical wave number and frequency to see whether it agrees with the theory? So we have a preliminary result, which is an excellent question. It's not only an important question theoretically, but also Question: Theoretically, but also experimentally for oceanographers. We have some data that we can criticize, that we can discuss, but which are at least available as a function of the spectrum, as a function of omega. So, it's an excellent question. This is the first point. Thank you for you. So, we studied, and the preliminary results are still quite open. So, we need to work quite strongly on this problem. Strongly on this problem to have a clear understanding of what's going on. So, I can show you some plots, experimental plots, but they are not yet converged and it's still open. Yeah. And I think I saw some like k to the minus three result in stratified turbulence instead of internal gravity wave turbulence. So which probably also happens in this stratified fluid. In this stratified fluid. So, is it possible that this is due to the stratified turbulence? Yes, it's possible. So, there were some results. There are also some numerical simulations that I forgot to mention who showed this K-3 or results compatible with K-3 in this SM. Yes, you're right. Yeah, okay. But we should be careful not to claim too much. Not to claim too much too fast that it's the same thing because the geometry is not always the same, the dimensions are not always the same, so I don't want to go too fast. Yeah, and maybe it would be good to look at the dispersion relation to see whether the energy is on the dispersion relation of the internal gravity waves to see whether this is dominated by the wave turbulence or Earth-stret-fire turbulence. or earth-shat fire turbulence. So we are in a regime where the forcing is not strong. So we believe to be not to be in the internal in the stratified turbulence regime. But these are questions that we have to be careful to define. Yeah, thanks. Yeah. Any other questions? If there's no more questions, let's thank the speaker virtually.
