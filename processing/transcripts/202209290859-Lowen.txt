Finishing the new instruction, please take it away. Okay, thanks. Yeah, so this is actually joint work with Arne Mertens, who just graduated. He just obtained his PhD thesis on this topic. And so the subject somehow breaches between Somehow, it bridges between non-cummutative geometry and higher category theory. So, non-cumulative geometry in the sense where, well, I mean, categorical models are used for non-cumulative spaces. And so, typically, models that we're thinking of for today include DG categories and A infinity categories. So, these are models that are kind of inherently. Are kind of inherently based upon abelian groups. They're built from abelian groups somehow. And then, on the other hand, if we think about higher category theory, there models for infinity one categories include, well, there are several models by now with comparisons between them, but let's mention quasi-categories and secal categories. And this theory is. And this theory is heavily built upon sets. I mean, the base category in the background is just the category of sets, as ordinary category theory is actually built from sets, if you like. Okay, now there are some famous links. So one thing that comes to mind is the nerve functors, which will play an important role today in this talk. So the nerve This talk. So the nerve functor, the DG nerve, which turns a DG category or more generally an infinity category into a quasi-category. And then there's also an equivalence somehow between the theory of pre-triangulated DG categories on the one hand and stable linear infinity categories on the other hand. So what is linear? So, what is linear? So, I already said so, one side of the story is based upon abelian groups, the other side of the story upon sets. So, here we're getting on the category side, if you like, or the right-hand side, we get this linearity somehow. And this is linearity in the sense of Luri, for instance, where you should think of infinity endowed with an action. Endowed with an action from an infinity module category. So there's some module category acting in the background. And more generally, Gebner and Hausen, they established a very general theory of infinity categories enriched over monoidal infinity categories. So this is kind of model-free, if you like. And another approach to enrichment in higher category theory is Category theory is by taking a particular model and then wondering how we could make a similar model in an enriched context. And so one thing that has been done by Simpson and then Pellissier and then later Bacar is for the model of Siegel categories. So you can, in Siegel categories, the category of simplicial sets plays an important role. Simplicial sets play an important role, but if you can actually build a theory replacing this by some monoidal model category, and this works to some extent. And the goal of today's talk is to do something similar in spirit, but now for the model of quasi-categories. So can we come up with a type of quasi-categories? But we will take a little bit of different. will take a little bit of different approach also philosophically because we're going to work over a monoidal a monoidal category V. This is just an ordinary monoidal category, not a monoidal infinity category as in approach 3. And so you should think that what we're really aiming at by doing this is we're aiming at some kind of a weak enrichment in SV, so the category of simplicial V objects. Objects. And also, a good to keep in mind that our kind of prime motivating case is to take V, the category of K modules over some commutative ring. This is a motivation because this will allow us to relate the VG categories, etc. Okay, so what is the goal, the first goal to realize? Goal to realize to get some nerve functor that nerve functor that is kind of adapted to this enriched setup. So let's first recall kind of classical nerve classical nerves. How do they arise? So let delta be the simplex category. So this is a category of So, this is the category of finite ordinals with order-preserving morphisms. And then, the category of simplicial sets is, of course, the familiar functor category. And then we have the Yonedai embedding, and this realizes finite ordinals, a finite ordinal n as the standard n simplex, the standard n simplex, which is really just to represent. Simplex, which is really just a representable structure. And so, somehow, the whole importance of delta in simplicial sets, if you like, in algebraic topology, homological algebra, and so on, it has a lot to do with the possibility to realize this delta inside other categories of interest. So, if I have another category C of interest. C of interest, I can look at and I can come up with a functor row C, which goes from delta to C and realizes a finite ordinal n in some other way. And then this formally, in a canonical way, as it's written there, always gives rise to something that one tends to call a nerve functor. So here we will get a nerve functor, which then plunges. Nerve functor, which then plunges C into the category of simplicial sets. So you get a way of viewing C objects as simplicial sets. And of course, the prime example is what happens for topological spaces. So if we do this for top, then we have, of course, the realizations, the standard topological and simplishes, and then the corresponding. And then the corresponding nerve functor simply takes singular simplicial sets that are then typically linearized to take singular cohomology and so on. For us, even more important today, actually, is the example of cats. If we take C to be cats, the category of small categories, then of course there's a Then, of course, there's a very natural way of realizing n. Finite ordinal n, it's in particular posets. And every posset is canonically a category in the standard way where you have just one morphism if there is a comparison between two elements of the pole sets and there's no morphism otherwise. So, what is So, what is the corresponding nerve function? In this case, this is the categorical nerve, well known, where n simplices are simply given by a string of a string of n composable morphisms. So it's written there the u, it has an f1 up to fn, which you can in principle. Fn which you can in principle compose. And what are phases? Face maps. Of course, a simplic set comes with faces and degeneracies. What are the faces here? Inner phases are given by multiplying really two consecutive morphisms. And then the two outer phases are a little bit different. Here you eliminate one morphism. So you either eliminate the first You either eliminate the first one, F1, or you eliminate the last one, Fn. So these are a bit different, and this will become quite important. Now, this has been, so I mentioned there's this famous link of the DG nerve. Well, what can we do? We can take nerves not just from small categories, but we can extend this idea to DG or A-affinity categories and how does Or A affinity categories, and how does this work? You simply go from delta. So, delta go, sorry, the realization we had on the previous slide goes from delta to cat. And then we first linearize by, yeah, then we go to k-linear, small k-linear categories by linearizing all the homesteads. And then we can plunge k-linear categories into A-affinity categories. And taking this And taking this, this gives them rise in our canonical way to the DG nerve. So that there is a way of turning, and what we do somehow is we turn an entirely, well, not an entirely, but we turn an object with distinct linear features, clearly, into an object that is entirely in the set, in the world of Bayes-on sets. So what happens to this linear structure? Happens to these linear structures. This is kind of the starting point of our work. Because you can, if we turn back to the simple case where we do this, imagine we do this not with a well, with a very particular DG category, just a linear category. Then we're taking the nerve as if the linear category is, we don't take linearity into account. So in this nerve, I described the simplicious. Nerve, I described the simplices earlier on, but it really has, so to describe this formally, it really just has Cartesian products of homesets, as we have here. There's a big core product, and then we have these Cartesian products, a Cartesian product of homesets. And so somehow the question arises, why would you do this to a linear category if you have modules, if you have K modules rather than just sets? Modules rather than just sets for your home sets in the category, taking a Cartesian product is certainly not the most natural thing to do. So we wondered, could we make the nerve in such a way, can we adapt it in such a way that it preserves more of the linear structure? And there's a naive attempt, which is of course to replace the product, the Cartesian product of homsets. Product of home sets by a tensor product of HOM modules. Yes, and so here we have it, the formula, the candidate formula. We have a nice co-product in the Belium groups or K modules, if you like. We have this tensor product. And then, so now an N-simplex would be given by, or well, I Well, linear combinations, if you like, of tensors of morphisms. But if we just look at such a pure tensor to focus our thoughts, what would inner phases become? That's easy. You can still multiply two consecutive morphisms. But the problem arises if you want to take the outer faces, because now in modules. Because now in modules, I cannot project, so I cannot project on a bunch of factors of this tensor. And so we simply cannot make this into a simplicial K module in any way, actually. So that attempt now has failed. So what do we do about this? So we can So, we can observe that the problem really arises with these outer phases. So, a lot of the delta of the simplex category seems to work, but what if we get rid of these outer, so this since these have to be the outer co-faces, right? In delta, so we have to get rid of the outer cofaces. And this can be realized in a so-called finite interval category, delta F. So, delta F. delta f so delta f is the same objects as delta the same finite ordinals but now we restrict to for morphisms we restrict to order morphisms preserve the end points so there are two examples here of such morphisms you have to send end point to end point and so this eliminates the outer co-faces that would parametrize these outer phase maps in a simplicial set In a simplicity set. So we lost something, but it turns out we also gained something because the delta F is a strict monoidal category. You just take the sum of the numbers and the sum of morphisms is easy. You just identify what's in the middle there in the drawing. The two green arrows in the middle can be identified when you sum them. You when you sum them. So that's nice. And then in order to use this monoidal functor, this monoidal structure, we're going to work not just with functors, as in the case of simplicial sets, we're going to work with functors that also are somehow compatible with the monodal structure. This is what we will do. What we will do. So, the general definition for a functor between monoidal categories, functor h from u to v. You have to keep in mind that we want to apply this to some x from delta f up to v. This is our simplicial setup of, if you like. But so, for a general functor, you can endow it with a co-algebra-like structure. And this is called a co-aximonoidal structure. It consists of an Structure it consists of a natural transformation mu, a kind of co-multiplication, and then a kind of co-unit epsilon. It satisfies natural co-associativity and co-unitivity axioms. We call the structure a strong monoidal if the mu is an isomorphism and strongly unital if the epsilon is an isomorphism. And then it's we so this. it's we so this this idea goes back to work from tom lancers uh who actually observed proved that with this uh notion of collax monoidal functors at least in the case of of of ordinary simplicial sets you can model them in an alternative equivalent way using colleges functions so simplicial sets can be described equivalently Described equivalently as collects monoidal functors from our delta FOP to set. And this works more generally for any Cartesian monoidal category, so where the monoidal structure is just a categorical product. And we will be most interested in the case where the monoidal structure is not the Cartesian product. But to see, to get the To get the idea, let's just look at one direction you can go. So if you now look at such a collax monoidal structure rather than a simplicial set, the collax structure, I mean, remember the delta F, it has the same object, so it's still given by sets indexed by X, indexed by natural numbers. X and index by natural numbers. So just like we denote a simplicial set by sets X subscript n, we can still do it with our core lax monoidal functions. But now we have these core multiplications mu. And you see there in the display, there's a mu1n, for example, and then there's also a mu n1, and there are many other mu's. But so you can use a mu as an example, you can use a mu. mu as an example you can use the mu1n which goes from xn plus 1 to x1 times xn you can if you then project on onto the second factor you get a map from xn plus 1 to xn which which then can be the definition of your outer phase map d0 and similarly the dn is the other one that's written there so One that's written there. So, what is the idea? If you have projections, you can recover the standard definition of simplicial sets from this new proposal. And so in general context, you can view these co-multiplications as a kind of stand-in for outer phase maps, if you like. Now, remember, I mean, or maybe I didn't say it yet. I mean, our goal is to build and To make to build enriched higher categories. And so we're really looking for enrichment rather than internalization. So this means that we want on the zero level, we still want a set of objects. And it's technically convenient to build this into the story. So that's why we will work. So remember on the previous slide, functors always landed in V, but for our purpose, For our purpose, it's kind of convenient to have functors land in quivers on V. Well, or maybe I should say in V quivers on a fixed set S. So we're going to say from the beginning, look, our higher category is going to have objects or vertices, if you like to call them that way, S. And then you start building with some quiver, some V and reach. Some V-enriched quiver, meaning that you simply give V objects between any two vertices. And then the category of quivers, it inherits a tensor product from the category V, which is supposed to be monogamous. So this is basically just, well, the setup that is more convenient. So this brings us to kind of the central definition. That is the definition of a tensor simplicial or templic. Are templicial objects. So it's supposed to be a variant of a simplicial object, but compatible with a tensor structure. So it consists of a pair XS. S is this fixed set, thought of as a vertex set, and X is going to be a strongly unital collax monoidal functor from delta F up to this quiver category. And then, if you let the base vertex set vary, then we obtain a category of templatial objects in V that we denote by S tensor V. Yes. So, is a pointer visible actually? Yes, yes. Yes, okay. So, I didn't use it so far, but. I didn't use it so far, but there is a S tensor VR notation for the big category. Yes. Can I ask a question? Yes. If you go back to the previous slide? Yes. So if you take B to be the momental category of sets, I mean, just for clarification, what is with S V? Is it just? Yes, if you take for V C. Yes, if you take for V sets, then quiver S V, a V, then a set quiver on S is just going to be given by giving any sets. I mean, for any two vertices in S, I have to give a set. Any sets, and there's no categorical structure yet. That's why it's called a quiver rather than it's not yet a category. I mean, we're going to use it to build. Category. I mean, we're going to use it to build a higher category, or you can use it. I mean, typically, you would view quiver, you'd view it as a category without multiplications, right? The next step, if you're building category theory enriched over some V is that you're going to define multiplication morphisms, and that multiplication morphisms have to go. So, look, look at, I'll use a pointer. If you look at this here, so typically you're going to. Here. So typically, you're going to define a category by saying we need notifications from QAC tensor PCB. Well, P and Q are going to be the same, and then you have to land in Q A B in this case. Yes. And so if you do it with sets for V, you're going to build classical category theory from this. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. You're welcome. So we have this, as I already discussed, it should be thought of as vertices. So I just list the ingredients of our templitial object X. So between an A and a B, we're going to have not just one X A B, which would be the case if we're building. be the case if we're building it if we're building a category from a quiver but we have x n a b in v for for every n bigger than equal to zero and this should be thought of as the object of n simplicies really and then on the zero level as i said we have no new information we we we put the identity of the monoidal structure it doesn't add any anything new so uh i already So, I already mentioned that what we're losing when you compare with ordinary simplicial sets is the outer faces. So, we're still left with inner faces and we're also left with arbitrary degeneracies. Nothing goes wrong there. But the new feature is really the co-multiplications. And these co-multiplications, so I just said in a category, if we're building category standard way, we're going in the other direction, of course. The other direction, of course, we're putting multiplications, but here we're putting co-multiplication, and they go from xk plus, so a mu k L multiplication goes from xk plus L to xk tensor xl in the quiver meaning. And it should be thought of as some operation that pulls apart a higher dimensional simplex into Simplex into two lower dimensional simplices that are joined at a vertex, as in the drawing. Now let's look at an example that kind of illustrates the difference with classical simplicial sets. So what can happen? What can happen here? If we take V to be abelian groups rather than just sets, then you can make this templicial abelian. Make this templicial abelian group that looks a bit like a taco. And the idea is that you put here, there is room here for two simplex. I just call it simplex. Maybe I should call it templex or something, but we simply call it simplex. So there's room for two simplex W here. And so remember the interfaces that works, they're still there. So the D1 of W. Still there, so the D1 of W is this H in the drawing. H goes from A to B, it's one simplex. But now, rather than also having a zero phase and a two phase, instead we have this mu11. And this mu11 of W, it is a sum of two tensors. So in the drawing, you can see these two triangles. And if you look at the one triangle, you have F1 tensor. Triangle, you have F1 tensor G1, and if you look at the other triangle, you have F2 tensor G2. And to say what mu11 of W is, you take their sum. So this makes it clear that simply the D0 and the D2, they're no longer there. I cannot take them when I have this sum. This type of two simplex is something that is completely, that is non-existent in the classical. Non-existent in the classical set-based world. Now, this definition, this allows us to realize kind of our first goal about nerves, because I said we want to make a nerve that's better suited to enrichment, really. And this works. So if I have now not just a quiver, but a small V category. Small V category, so it's a category enriched in some base monoidal category V. Then taking tensor powers of this category considered as a quiver in our earlier sense, taking tensor powers for n greater than or equal to zero, I can put these all together into a natural templicial object. And the vertex set of this will, of course, Vertex set of this will, of course, be the object set of the underlying category. And the mu and M we have here, the mu and M, they are the canonical isomorphisms. The canonical isomorphisms, the fact that here, I mean, this is an exceptional situation, the fact that you have isomorphisms in general, that won't be the case. In fact, there is a resulting fully fatal enriched nerve functor, which Enriched nerve functor, which plunges categories, V enriched categories into templicial objects in V. So this is parallel to the nerve from small categories to simplicial sets, right? And actually, the fact that the mu's are isomorphisms, we call this strong monoidality, this characterizes the essential image of this. Image of this nerve factor. So these are precisely the ones with the ones with all isos are precisely the nerves of some actual categories. So the idea, of course, of higher category theory is that you're going to weaken this, you're going to relax this setting. I will come back to that later on. So next question I want to say a few words about is, so far we built a We built a parallel setup to the sets, to simplicial sets. But you can also wonder what is the relation with actual simplicial sets. And this relation is given by an adjunction. And here it's good to observe, it stems from the adjunction that you need some conditions on V. If you have some, if you have co-products in particular, you have this standard adjunction. You can you have this standard adjunction and then you can leverage it to an adjunction between simplicial sets and template v objects. The free functor is very obvious, you just enrich all the sets inside, but the other one is a little bit more intricate to get an idea. So, the kind of forgetful functor, it's not a forgetful functor, it's an underlying simplicity. Functor, it's an underlying simplicial set functor, really. To give you an idea, the case we already looked into, the case of nerves, here it happens to be the case that the underlying simplicial set of the enriched nerve is precisely the nerve of the underlying category. So, an enriched category in this setup has an underlying ordinary category, and so it has an ordinary nerve. But if we think about the general think about the general if we think in general what would this underlying simplicial set look like then you have to take into account that um i i cannot simply do with one element that that's kind of inherent to the fact that we're solving this problem that we cannot simply make a simplicial set out of out of modules in an appropriate way for instance um so we need a So, we need a bunch of elements to actually obtain an element in the underlying simplicial set. And if we look at the compatible elements that are, as in the display here, elements that are, so you need vertices, of course, alpha zero up to alpha n. If I start with an XS templatial object in the beginning of the first line of the proposition there, and it has an underlying significance. And it has an underlying simplicial set we denote u tilde, then to give an n-simplex alpha in u tilde, you need vertices alpha zero up to alpha n, but you also need compatible elements alpha yj in appropriate underlying sets, such that they are compatible with the co-multiplications. Yes, as is written there. And so, for instance, if we look at the tago example, this means that this remarkable means that this this remarkable if you like uh simplex w it cannot feature in the in the underlying initial set because its mu11 is not a pure tensor and as we see in the proposition the mus have to be pure tensors to be in the underlying sufficient set okay so now to the second part of the talk we want to take a next step to quasi Next step to quasi-categories, because this is really kind of a fundamental notion. These are the models, or these are the models we're interested in for higher categories in this case. So remember, quasi-categories are simplicial sets satisfying the weak canon properties. So inner horns can be filled. And if you just look at the basic example, basic illustration of this idea, the horn in the left upper corner. Left upper corner. If you use this to point at two elements G and F that I want to consider as a kind of morphisms and that I want to compose in some weak sense, then this is realized by looking at the entire delta two on the upper right corner, because by extending the natural transformation The natural transformation to eta bar, I am giving now a two simplex that I denoted F box G. And if I take here the inner face of this F box G, I obtain something, some one simplex that I consider as a weak composition of G and F. So this is kind of the basic idea behind quasi-categories in higher categories. Quasi-categories in higher category theory. So these objects go back to work by Bortmann and Vocht, but it's Joyel who started using them as models for higher categories. And then Lurie, of course, developed this theory very extensively. So we will be using the notion of necklaces in order to define enriched quasi-categories. Enriched quasi-categories. So a necklace is simply a simplicial set that looks like a necklace. So it's a standard simplicity joined in vertices. And then we will use them as in the bottom line on the slide. We will use them to extend a template object. The definition of a templitial object, recall it gives you some extra. It gives you some Xns, right? And I can extend this, I mean, at least using if I have a necklace there, delta N1 joined by several up to delta NK, then I can use a tensor product to kind of extend my formula to take values on necklaces. And this is useful. And this is useful because it allows us to adapt the notion of a quasi-category in an appropriate sense. So, the quasi-category, I illustrated before what it means. So, formally, you have to be able to complete any type of diagram with a horn included in a standard simplex. It has to have a lift in simplicial sets, but for inner horns, but what we're going to do is require that there is a filling. Okay, we have to take the quivers in. Filling, okay, we have to take the quivers into account, of course, but that's no problem, that's just a feature of the setup. But we're gonna require there to be fillers not in the world of templatial objects, but in the functor category on these necklaces. And this has to do with this observation that I cannot reach elements like the W in the taco, I cannot reach them. Taco, I cannot reach them by the type of natural transformation that I have in an underlying simplicial set. So we really need something a little bit different. Okay, so now some results with this notion. So one thing, if I have a quasi-category with this definition, if we have a quasi-category in V, so this is our definition now for quasi-category in monoidal category V, then the underlying simplicial set is a quasi-category in the ordinary sense. Category in the ordinary sense. And one question that we will answer today is: can we use the free functor to build enriched quasi-categories? Can we go somehow the other way around? So for enriched quasi-categories. For enriched quasi-categories, to answer this question and also some other questions, we will now go a bit Go a bit, we will now start rigidifying a little bit. So, as you've seen, multiplication in classical academies, you have multiplications, they are not in the picture, we're using some kind of co-multiplications in a certain way. But now, notice that, of course, I can, in this illustration we had before, if in the right lower corner here, to go a very obvious way to Way to point at this candidate-weak composition would be to use a kind of multiplication, but rather than going from x1 tensor x1 to x1, which would be a categorical composition, we could go from x1 tensor x1 to x2 with a map z, which is actually in the opposite direction from the mu. Remember, the mu goes, for instance, from mu11 goes from x2 to x1, tensor x1. X2 to X1 tensor X1. So we can reinstall, well, not really reinstall, but install maps Z in the opposite direction. And of course, if we're going to make them into an associative algebra type structure, this is going to ruin the whole plot of higher category theory and relaxation of the structure. Structure. So, what we do to prevent this in general from happening is we do not imply associativity. So, the notion we use is that what we call non-associative Frobenius templial objects, it's a templial object as before, so an X endowed with a mu and epsilon also in the background. And now we endow it with non-associative multiplications Z PQ from X P tens. From xp tensor xq to xp plus q unital for the inverse uh co-units because we required there that the thing is strongly unital and compatible with the mu kl in the sense that the whole structure satisfies the Frobenius axioms. Yes, so I just put a drawing there rather than writing it formally with compatibility because What the compatibility between μ and Z has to be. So these structures, you can think of an example to focus the ideas. So, okay, one thing to mention is that for the nerve, remember the nerves, they were strong monoidal, collax, strong collax monoidal. So I can simply take the inverses of cox. Simply take the inverses of co-multiplication maps to get at this structure. And if we look at the easiest example, we just have a K-algebra A considered as a one-object K-linear category, then taking nth, then this nerve, it simply amounts to taking nth tensor powers of this algebra, really. And then the multiplication, the co-multiplication you obtain on the nerve. So the nerve, this is a familiar This is a familiar tensor construction, the tensor algebra, co-algebra construction. And the multiplication and co-multiplication as a Frobenius functor, they are just the usual multiplication concatenating tensors and the usual co-multiplication of separating tensors. So this is the kind of compatibility you get there. Yes. So as a Frobenius function, so you really mean like Frobenius monoidal? Really mean like Frobenius the noidal functor? Yeah, sorry. Yeah, because so this notion of non-associative Frobenius functor is a relaxation of what they and Pastro call a Frobenius monoidal functor. Exactly, yes, thank you. Yes, so what do we have? There are now some, we use this non-associative Hobbinius structure in the following In the following way. An ordinary quasi-category always has enough structure. So this is, I mean, it is there in the classical theory. They're simply there in the background. And then second, so that's the first observation. So we're going to put three facts, list three facts, and then take a conclusion from that. Conclusion from that. So that's the first fact, that you would first result, if you like. And the second result is simply that you can imagine the free functor is compatible with such naf structures. That's not hard to believe. And then now we turn to the case of prime interest of k modules. And here we can show that a naf templial module is actually a quasi-category in k modules. So here in the linear setup, remarkably. Linear setup, remarkably, you can go in the other direction. This is the other direction from the first proposition. This is now enough templation module will become a quasi-category in the k-linear context. And then if we put the three facts together, because we're going in one direction first, and then the free functor preserve, we go in one direction from ordinary quasi-category to nourish structure. We preserve it by the free functor, and then we go in the other direction in the linear. Other direction in the linear world, the corollary will be that for an ordinary quasi-category, the free construction becomes a quasi-category in K-modules. So this answers our earlier question. I think I should take my time into account. How much time do I have? Is it about eight minutes? About eight minutes. So, yes. So I should go over this a little bit quickly if I want to say something about something. To say something about something about approval and something about DG nerve, as I promised. So we have all these nice compatibilities. We have the nerves, but we also have an underlying monotopic category in a linear setup. And all the functors inside, if you look at them between quasi-category categories, linear categories, linear quasi-categories, and ordinary quasi-categories, they commute in every thinkable sense. So this works nicely. So this works nicely. And before saying something about the DG nerve, I want to say a few words about the proof, because this last proposition, why does a naf templial module become a quasi-category, this is really something particular to the linear context. So I just want to show that linearity, how linearity comes into play here. So first step of the proof, you use the multiplications Z PQ. ZPQ to fill simply just joined in a vertex. So remember, this is a drawing that goes in the opposite directions from the mu drawing we had before. So we can now join simply just joined at a vertex. That's nice. And you can extend it to necklaces because necklaces are simply an iteration of joining simplicities at a vertex, if you like. So that also works. And now linearity comes into play in the next. The article comes into play in the next step. So, before going to horns, so ultimately we want to fill horns in the final step. There's an intermediate step, if you like, which is to fill wedges. So, wedge is drawn on the left-hand side. It's joining the first and the last phase of a standard simplex. And then, this turns out that in the linear setup, you can fill it by decomposing this into necklaces and as an alternative. Into necklaces as an alternating sum. So it's just a picture. What we really mean is, of course, that we're going to take alternating sums of natural transformations, taking values on such drawings, right? And then the last step of going from wedges to horns, it's similar. So now some results. If we If we to make now the link with DG categories, because this is really the kind of the end of the story so far, to link with DG categories, we can restrict to Frobenius templatial objects, so where you have not only this Z maps, but they are actually associated. And then somehow on a And then, so somehow one of our main results so far is that we can construct a linear DG nerve functor. So we can build a functor from DG cat to quasi-categories in mod k, so if you like linear quasi-categories. And this actually gives rise to an equivalence of categories between DG categories negatively graded in cohomological degree. In cohomological degrees, if you like, on the one hand, and on the other hand, this category of Frobenius templicial modules. So you really obtain an alternative incarnation on the nose for these negatively graded DG categories. And this construction enhances the classical DG nerve. So the classical DG nerve, which I had. So the classical DG nerve, which I had in the beginning of the story, which turns a DG category into a quasi-category. This is on the bottom triangle. So the DG nerve that's on the right hand side of the triangle. And our linear DG nerve, it's the upper arrow of the bottom triangle there, it enhances. It enhances it in the sense that we build a linear quasi-category for which the underlying simplicial set is the quasi-category in the classical construction. And then in the upper triangle, you have some compatibilities also with the homotopy functor, which I didn't say much about, but there's this underlying homotopy category. And if you then take this And if you then take this for the nerve, for the linear nerve of a DG category, you're simply taking H0. H0 is, of course, the obvious way to build an ordinary K-linear category out of a DG category. So there are some compatibilities. And then I'm almost done really with this part of the story. I want to say just a few words about where this is. A few words about where this is heading. So, the goal is to extend this to a theory where you have a homotopic theory. Yes. So, as I said in the beginning, the goal is that these quasi-categories in V should be seen as infinity categories, weakly reached in SV. But to make these kind of statements, you need model categories in the background. And so, this is something. In the background, and so this is something still under construction. So, if you look at the classical setup, now I should be able to, oops, yeah, same problem. Yeah, I just exit the full screen for a second. If you look at Seconds. If you look at to go to the end of the slides, if possible. Yes. So this is the last the last slide. So if you look at the first line here, then this is the classical situation where you have all these different models for infinity categories. And there are quillon equivalences in the background. So between the Seagull 3 categories, between Pre-categories between the model category, the Joyal model category for quasi-categories between and the model category on simplicial categories, there are quilen equivalences. And so showing somehow that you are building an equivalent theory, but now it's with weak with weakened objects, if you like. And so the second line is what we are hoping to do. Hoping to do to build, I mean, well, the only model category that is already established is on the right-hand side. So, categories enriched in simplicial V objects. We want to build a model category in the middle here. And we also want a model category on the left-hand side. So, for the Seagull SV categories, here, as in our case, As in our case, actually, the objects exist, but the model structure has not been established yet. So, this is kind of our ongoing work. So, thank you for listening. Okay, are there any questions first in person? Any questions? Any questions on memory? I have a question. So I see that for BS algebras played a role in your last sphere on a linear DG nerve. Do you expect AS algebras to play a role in your picture sphere? Yeah, that's a very good question. So we're actually, it's at this point, I think it's I think it's the Frobenius structures, we use them kind of as an aid, but at this point, they do not really play a role yet in trying to establish these model categories. But you can ask the question: what is the more fundamental object here? I mean, somehow the Frobenius, I mean, the non-associative Frobenius. Uh, the non-associative for Benius structures, um, or the non-associative, the naf templitial objects, if you like, um, they could be more useful than the linear or the V-enriched quasi-categories. I mean, that's not clear at this point, especially since we haven't established the model structures yet. So, of course, we're looking now, we're looking at the model structure where the fibrant objects hopefully should be these quasi-categories. Should be these quasi-categories. I mean, in parallel with the classical case, but maybe something would work better if we focused more on nav templish logics. I mean, it's not known yet. Well, thank you for the nice talk. Any other questions? Okay, let's thank Wendy again. Thanks for the invitation. Thanks for the invitation, Chelsea and Jason. I forgot to mention at the beginning, I think, so let's mention it now. Thanks very much for presenting this at your great workshop. Thank you.
