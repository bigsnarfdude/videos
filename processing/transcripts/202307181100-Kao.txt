Okay, so first thank you for the invitation and the opportunity to have me speaking here. And the second thing is I need to apologize that I'm very channeled right now. Right now it's like 2 a.m. difficult time. So my plan might not work very well. So forgive me if I'm not able to answer your question well. Okay. So anyways, the goal of my talk today is trying to give you some like some view of application of solid fall. Of application of solid formulas in the applications in like deformation spaces. It sounds fancy, but it is really kind of application built on a lot of the works of many people in here. So even though the title sounds like exotic, but the topic we receive is not that special. Okay. And the outline, the goal of my today's talk is like this. So in the So, in the beginning, I will tell you what is the setup, what is the information space that we care about. Okay. And especially, I was really focused and spent quite a bit of time on the classical right now. It's called the classical technical space. I mean, it's not really classical. Technical space is technical space. The classical is compared to something we call fancier, the higher technical space. That is something we will discuss as well. So that's the first part. And the second part on that, this is the first part. This is the second part. And the third part will be some newer examples. So by newer examples, I'm really clear about is higher technology basis. Okay, I mean, I really, really care about one kind of basis inside here, which is called teaching component, and we will discuss that in a minute. Okay. And the third one, okay. The third is some generalization. So we So we will start. The classical one will start from the first surface, it's closed. Okay? And rank one. And the newer one is still the surface is closed by in higher rank. The third one is when the surface has punctures. Or really, I really care about cusps, okay, with respect to some kind of. Tasks, okay, with respect to some hyperphotic structures. Okay, so that's the non-compact case. And in the last part, I will provide some open questions, some questions that I have no idea, but it's very geometrically interesting questions. Okay, so that's master plan for today's talk. All right, so. Today's talk. All right. So, the first thing is what is deformation spaces? Okay, so set up. Ours, S is a topological surface. Right now, I did not put any structure on S, but just some topological space with the genus BO equal to 2, which may make it has a negative error Euler characteristic. Okay, so that's the only requirement. Characteristic. Okay, so that's the only requirement I have right now. Okay, so my first thing is: what is a GX structure on a surface on S. Okay, so I mean, since I was saying like deformation spaces of geometry structures, so I have to introduce these notations, but don't be afraid of these notations, they will lead to. Notations they will lead to us to something very precise and concrete. Okay, so what is that? It's like I have a space, I have a surface S in here, okay? And there's another, so we should interpret X in this. S is something like model space. Model space. Or maybe I use another color. So X is a model space, carries some structure that we are interested in. That we are interested in. Okay. So it's a model space. Okay. Carry some structures with some structure with certain structure. And G is a group acting on X. Okay, and everything will be. Okay, and everything will be more precise once we see some example. Okay, so it works in this way. So I have this will be my model space X. And if I, the way to look at this is like I look at the atlas on this surface S. Okay. And I look like two coordinate charts that with some intersections. Is it big enough? I mean, and this Cori chart will evaluate in the model space with two different open sets over here. Okay. And the intersections will be mapped to like two sets in this. Two spaces, these two open sets. So one is in here, one is in here. So, what is this G play in here? The G play the role like it connects these two open, this is the intersection is translated by this group, some group element inside my group G. Okay, that the easiest, so this is a coordinate chart. So, this is the coordinate map. Coordinate map. Okay, I think this should ran a bell: like some structure that we learned back in the early age of our graduate school, which or maybe undergrad for some people, which is a differential structure. Okay, if you have a differential structure, then what is differential structure in here? No differentiable structure. Our service S is really exactly looking at this kind of open like Code charts such that the model space X is really just because I'm looking at a surface. So model space is R2. Okay. And the group is really just a diffimorphism group over R2. Okay. And this endows a differential structure on this surface S. Okay. So the structure that we are clear. The structure that we are clear about, or we want to study, is very similar things like this. But the thing we really care is: like, I really want the quotient and our data surface. Okay, so what does that make a difference? When you look at some like some path, some with some like base point, and you look at a path over here, okay? So you will get something related with the holonomy. Something related with the holonomy. So you will get something called a holonomy map, which will map from the pi 1 of s, okay, into this group related with my structure. Okay, so one thing I really care about is, in fact, I'm care about when the when the surface, the universal Surface, the universal covering of my surface is like homeomorphic to this model space X. Okay. And to get a nice structure so that I can take the quotient, I really need to take look some group such that this group lives nice in this space, model space, my model space G, this group G. Okay, so for example, Okay, so for example, what is a hyperbolic structure on surface S. Okay, so we are thinking about the model space to be the upper half plane or the hyperbolic space. Okay, and the group G in here, which give me the hyperbolic space. Which give me the hyperbolic, the isomorphism. In this case, it's PSL2R. PSO2R. Okay, and I really, really, what I really want is after the closure, I will get a space which is homeomorphic to my original surface S. That means. S. That means I really need to keep, I need to really need to take a quotient such that it will recover. So I really need to look at the holonomic map will map into my group G. Right now it is PSO2R. Okay, so in other words, to look at hyperbolic structure on my surface S, that is exactly looking That is exactly looking at this kind of nice quotient inside my group G PSO2R. So in other words, what we can define is the different deformation space with respect to this GX structure in this GSL2R. Of the surface S is really some homomorphism groups from pi one marked by PSO2. Because when you change in this kind of homo, like a homomorphism group, a holonomic group. Homomorphism group, a holomic group, then you sort of like make look at a different way of putting different structures on your hyperbolic surface S. Okay, so end up this options of putting two different groups into my isometry groups in the upper half plan give a rise to different hyperbolic structures. Okay, and this quotient, even though. Even though it looks very exotic, but it is exactly the tech mirror space of this hyperbolic surface, of this surface S. Okay? And it wasn't really, you don't see a right-a-way relation of this deformation space defined this way as a character variety. But this This is really given rise by three. So it's Frick's model. So somebody preferred to call this space Frick space instead of tech mirror space because in this perspective, we don't really use in any like the classical way of defining as the isotopic classes of the conformal structures on the surface S. Okay. But because of this uniformization theorem, you can identify. Uniformization theorem, you can identify them in this manner. And why I want to introduce this in this format is because this format is the way that we can sort of generalize this classical deformation space into other or newer examples. Just by hoping things will work well by replacing this. By replacing this PSL2R with this PSLNR. So it will be a higher rank representation right now. Okay. And that's how what people call the higher tech theory. This higher is higher rank. Okay. And one other, one another example you can relate with if you put PSL3R in here. Put PSL3R in here, okay? It has some relation with a very well-understood structure on the surface, which is something we call the convex projective structure. So in that case, you can define, in that case, your model space will be the RP2. And the group of isometry, RP2, you can think of SS2. So in that case, the isometry with respect to the Huber metric. Respect to the Huber metric will be SL SPSL3R. So, in that case, it has relation with this kind of deformation spaces. But in general, we are not really expecting you can always get geometric structures in this way. Or like, I'm not saying every deformation spaces can have a nice geometric interpretation. Like, you can find a universal covering. Like you can find a universal covering such that there's a nice metric living in that universal covering, give your rise to this kind of nice structure. But the game is like, if I have this kind of like representation, okay, it will create some dense function. And how are we able to using our diagnosomism tools to play with that kind of structures? Okay, so in general, like as a dynamicist, we don't really care about. We don't really care about that much of the structures of this Kaggle variety. What I care about is how can we using the zone of vanguard formulation tools to interpret or to at least describe animals living in here? For example, what I want to understand, like if I right now I have two different representations live in this deformation space, okay? This deformation space, okay. So, what I want to do is the first thing I want, I want to quantify. So, I have two representations, I want to know how far they are, or I need to study the further study from the questions like, can I tell the difference of two representations? Okay, if I can tell the difference, then can I quantify the difference? Okay, and hopefully, the way to quantify the difference is like if I can construct some metric on this space, that would be wonderful. That would be a nice. That would be a nice, uh, nice measure to tell me the difference of the two representations. Okay, and the goal of my project is try to utilize the multi-agon formulas and to create this kind of quantifiers to tell the difference of two representations. So, there are a lot of things might relate with this kind of project, things like entropy rigidity, mainly rigidity. Many rigidities. Rigidity theorem tells you like when these two representations are exactly the same, when you can tell they are different. Okay. And once you get rigidity, that's the first step. Then you move on to like, if once I get rigidity, can I utilize this rigidity quantifiers to tell the difference? In our case, you will see the minute in this setup, we can define something. The derivative of these qualities provides some metrics in these bases. Okay, so let me tell you: like, what are the things that I'm interested and hope to understand in these projects? Okay. The first thing, oops, working fast. Just double-sided. Okay. So the first thing I want to do is. Thing I want to do is uh, so right now I'm still living in this technique space. Okay, if you don't like this definition, you can just use in the classical definition of technology spaces, like the isotopic classes of hyperbolic metrics, okay? So, in other words, you will get some hyperbolic metrics associated to these surfaces, okay? So, right now, the game is like you give me two hyperbolic metrics on these surfaces, how to tell they are different, okay? So, the first thing I want to introduce is called third-stern. I want to introduce this core Thurston's intersection number. It can also be understood as the Judicious Trash or APA Okay, so this name after was created, I think, first used by Caniber. So that's the same thing, but through these stretches, we mostly using for the surface with variable curvature. Okay, for the constant curvature, people, especially in the geometry round, they prefer to using a third-stance intersection number, but they are the same numbers. So what is this? So, what is this? So, it's a fancy average. So, row one and row two are two representations in here. So, in this case, it's also called function representation. Okay, because it's the function group gives a rise to hyperbolic groups, hyperbolic surfaces. Okay, so it's called a function representation. So if I have two function representations, so I'm care about this number. I mean, a priori, you don't see why the limit might exist, but uh it exists. I put rule one, rule one.  Maybe, maybe I just write this. Okay, this is this average. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm about to tell you. So, R of row one t is the elements in your fundamental group such that the length. The length row one using row one to count as length small or equal to t. So as you might see, this sum or this average might not be a symmetry after your. It really depends on your row one because you are counting this ratio with respect to row one. Oh, thank you. Yeah, so it's the number of, so this normalization should be taken as the average of the number of the elements inside the group, inside this set. Okay, so this is first, this intersection number. And this number has a very nice result, rigidly attached with it. The first intersection under Okay, so it's this number is always equal equal to one, okay, and the equality only holds if and only if rule one and the rule two they are. Rule one and the rule two, they are conjugate in PaCO2R. So, in other words, that they give a rise to exactly the same hyperbolic surfaces, unless like when this number equals one. So, this is something help us to determine if two hyperbarometric are the same or not in my technical space. Okay, you just put into the You just put into the computation and see what the intersection number is. So that's a good quantifier for us to see the relation between two representations. Okay, so that's the first number. I mean, the way Durston created this has nothing to do with dynamics. Okay, so the goal is try to tell you we have a very powerful tool. Uh, we have a very powerful toolbox can sort of interpret this thing in our language, okay? And this uh will be really uh will be like crystal clear with our construction, okay? So the next thing, uh, one thing to see this to see the Thurston's intersection number is through. So that's uh, this theory is proof by Thurston. Theory is proved by Durston in one of his notes in 98. Minimal stretch from the table. Okay. It has a lot of things. Whatever we're going to discuss today has many relations with that paper from Durston. Okay. So next thing I want to discuss, which relates with this Durston's intersection number. Durst the intersection number is called Manadena. Okay, so it's a curve given right from these two representations. Okay, so how does this thing define? It's sort of like generalized. Sorry? Yes. Yes, in here, my surface is closed. Here, in here, my surface is closed. Thank you. Cold surface closed. Okay, so this is the classical part. So we are now moving to the newer part. Okay, so everything is closed without boundary. So it's not, it's coherent packs that even come as cohort-packed. So my entropy is always equal to one. Okay, so make my life easier. If entropy is not equal to one, everything still works, but you need to do some normalization by the entropy. So you'll make. By the entropy, so you'll make the computation a little bit more complicated. Okay, generalize records bond. Okay, now why do I say this? You will see right away when you see the definition. So, this is the set, or it's the boundary of the set. It's the boundary of the set. Of the set such that this sum is finite row one. I mean, sometimes I might forgot to write row one. I just write one, but I mean the same thing. Maybe I need to put a negative sign here. Okay, so if you know what the critical response is, that is really you just block. You don't have two representations, you don't look at one. Don't have two representations, you look at one representation and see what is the critical exponent such that this thing is in between infinity and in the in the infinity and the finite. Okay, so the behavior is sort of like why now we just put another lens function and consider them together. Okay, so the result we have, I will put the quietest right away, but let me show you this. This curve, this is indeed a curve. This is indeed a curve, and it looks like this, and it will go asymptotics, it will go all the way infinity. So, this is the A axis, this is the B axis. Okay, so in here, so when your AB is big, then it is finite, and in here it's infinite. Okay, so this is the boundary, and these two intersections with the axis is one, zero, and then zero, one. 01 okay, it has something to do with the entropy of this L1 and L2. I think some of the experts might already see this as something to do with the Bowen's formula. But anyway, that's one thing. So what are the facts about this Manhattan curve proof? But I will put the credits all together. Okay, so I will say this stuff from Berger's discussion. Star from Berger's discussion of this Manhattan curve in 93, which was inspired by some discussion from Conniper's very early work. And after Berger in 93, then I know Shark and the Swaste is also 93, but it's really followed from this paper using a lot of using another perspective. Uh, you're using another perspective to interpret uh Berger's result, okay? Sharp and the sharp. It's really sharp result, really sharp. Yes, so many things about this, okay. Uh, so what do we know? The first thing is this is analytic is an analytic. For these facts. So row one, row two, row one, row two in here are always two function representations. Okay, and this this curve is really leaving the R2 because this is really a subset of. Because this is really a subset of R2. Okay, so yeah, yeah, yeah. In surface, we start from here. And you will see right away, like, I don't have the intelligence to do something to complicate it. We really take this idea and generalize to a higher rate. Okay, so it's really the same setup, just like twisting here, twisting there, and try to make things work. Okay. So that's the first. The first result is: I know this curve is a really nice curve. It's analytic, okay? And the second thing is this guy is 3D convex. It's 3D convex. Okay, and unless row one and row two, they are conjugate. They are conjugate. Okay, if they are conjugate, then it is a straight line. Okay, so unless in this case, in this case, it's a straight line. Maybe I just write one more. That's a straight line. Okay, so right here, you don't see any relation with that intersection number at all. You just know, obviously, some object carries some special structure. Okay? Then indeed, here's the relation. Maybe I can. Yeah. So invertence true. Burger is true. Was he aware of the thermodynamic conflict? No, no, he was using pattern solvent. And what you can get, that's a good point. Yeah, good, good, good, good, good, good point to make a comment. Okay, what did Berger did and the shop swatch and the shop's result? Okay. So what Berger proved is this curve is C1 curve. Okay. As you might expect it, thermal diagnosis. Thermodynamic is my race, the regularity from C1 to higher. But if you're using pattern-solvable method, C1 might be the most thing we might see from this method. Okay. So elasticity is really, really C1 by Burger. Okay, but string complexity is already known by Berger. It's already known by previous proof using pattern. That's good enough. Palace already is good enough to do that. Okay? And he also knows two things I'm going to wrote in here. The first thing is this. Maybe I should actually write here because that's an important observation. And the other thing is that we're going to be able to do that. And athleticity is really what sharp and the swastika paper tells us. Okay, the third part is also known by Berger. It's the first thing at the slope at the slope of the normal of the normal by x one zero. One zero is this number. Indeed, the slope of this number at this point is exactly this intersection number. Rho one, row two, even over there. Okay, so that's the second thing is asymptotic. Oh, maybe asymptotic. Asymptotic, but the normal of the asymptotic. The normal the slope of the normal. I already care about the slope of the normal at a sympotic. For this side, what is the better way to say when A is large. What do I mean by this? It's really, I'm not. What do I mean by this? It's really, I'm look. So, when A is going, is increasing, this curve has some asymptotic, okay? And then the normal of the asymptotic, okay, is indeed something we call the dilation of row one, row two. And I'll give you a definition. And there's a reason why I want to introduce this dilation because it has something to do with something we call the to do with something we call the uh we call the soup yeah we call it durstance asymmetric metric okay i hope you see the the the definition it's as the soup of the ratio Of the ratio between the two lens functions. Okay, so it's really look at the maximum ratio you can get in this setup. Okay, so these two things are things proven by Berger. Okay, and as I said, there's an interesting metric also defined by Durston using this number. Okay, we'll see in a minute. And the third part, the last part I want to say. The third part, the last part I want to say about this magical Manhattan curve, it also carries another interesting quantity from here. It's some point in here. So I look at a point such that the normal, the normal, the slope of normal line is exactly one. So what? Okay, so it's like I find I try to find a point because this is a convex curve. You can only find one point, which will be equal to one. Okay, for that specific point, it has two coordinates. Okay, and the sum of these two coordinates is this number I call h row one row two. Okay, and that is something we call the Okay, and that is something we call the correlation number of length spectrums. So this was given by Shock idea paper. Okay, so that's this number, row one, row two, oh, is defined as the growth rate of this. The growth rate number, a log of the number. So it's really go back to a similar question like Mark discussed yesterday, all these kinds of counting problems. So I'm looking at the last, oh, four. oh for for for people who was who does not like who does not know not manager armatur as i do as as i uh why i only care about uh why i look at the uh elements in my fundamental group is really because in my setup every uh contradictory class in my fundamental group corresponds to a unique judiciary on my hyperbolic surface On my hyperbolic surface. Okay. So counting this contiguous class is exactly the same as counting the number of costs of disease on my surface. Okay. So that's why, I mean, because right now I have two different metrics are playing around with each other. So it's easier to write things by counting the conjugacy classes. Okay? Anyways, so this is counting this number, L1. Can this number L1? So when I'm using, I'm asking the growth rate of these elements. Oh, in this case, I can write in this format. It's even easier. Gamma. Both of them are growth in the same speed. Oh, I think this is now. Maybe it's three over two. Okay, so it's counting the growth rate of this. What Sharp did is it gave a precise counting result for this. Indeed, it's actually really state-up version. It's like nice number. Number A's number, exactly. This depends on these two representations. So I'm looking at, so A and B tells me how to define this. It's critical exponents. So they are the numbers such that I can define, I'm hoping to know how to describe points on this. You will see I'll give you a thermodynamic. You need a thermodynamic description of this curve. Okay, they indeed satisfy some pressure equation. Okay, but a curve in here giving me some a special point in here. So this A and B is a special point. So it's a special point given by the point such as who has a normal is equal to negative, equal to one. Okay, so Sharp's result is this counting result like this. So this, maybe we can. Like this. So, this, maybe we can call I row one, row two, and the T Maybe, if you like, you can put the apps on the arrow turn. The arrow turn does not really matter in this case. Okay, so this number, it grows in this way. So it grows. Oh, maybe you're not able to see. Yeah, this is error term, it's a positive number in here. Some positive error term. Okay, so it's really it has this very specific growth rate some count times e to the three e. Oh, you don't know I was wrong. HST. Sorry about that. Okay, so this number is only dependent on rule one, row two. Okay. So that's the specific growth rate was proven by Sean. But more interestingly, this number is exactly the sum of these two numbers in here. Of these two numbers in here. So, this rich curve tells so many information about this, like some statistical numbers between these two representations. Again, we care about them because it sort of helps us to categorize the relations between two representations. I like to introduce or maybe tell you an interesting result. Interesting redoubt of one of my friends. Let's good to shout out friends. Okay, so it's Dai and the Matone. Okay, so they indeed found some interesting applications of these correlation numbers, okay? Because in shops, people read the Paper raised the questions: like, is this intersection number, is this correlation number always bigger than equal to bigger or equal to zero? Okay, but in Diane Matonas, their result, it tells you there exists some path inside my technique space such that this intersection number intersection number of these two sequences of representation. I will tell you what does that mean in geometry converges to zero as t goes to as t goes to infinity. Okay, so what are these two representations? Okay, so if I'm thinking I have a surface. Okay, so this two pathways, two ways of creating different Of creating differential, a different like hyperbody metrics correspond to first is I pinching this like belt in my surface S okay, to very narrow so you'll get something like something like this and for t e go to infinity so there's this very very tiny you'll be more or less like you attach to like cuspid. Like you attach two like cusp surfaces together. Okay, so that's what you get. And the other one is: I'm looking at the same, so I'm looking even in the same type of technical space. So I'm really trying to pinch another direction. Maybe I should draw something a little bit more complicated. So the other one corresponds to pinching the other direction, the other part. Okay, so it was, it will be something like. So it was it will be something like era goes to infinity it will be something like you pinch in the other direction in the other the other paths and the pinch that didn't go to very uh very very narrow okay and that proof for Okay, and they prove for this kind of pension path the correlation number eventually goes to zero. It sort of tells you, in general, these two representations kind of irrelevant in the boundary of my technical space. When you go to the boundary, they sort of go to different rounds. And that's sort of indicate that this, I mean, another fact is in this kind of two different punch, like pinching path, they are going to the. Like pinching path. They are going to do two different points on the completion of my technical space. Okay. So if you know something called an augmented technical space, then they are living in different strata at infinity. Sort of tells you if they are going to different parts of the infinity, their correlation number can decay. So it's sort of what we wanted to do in the future is sort of like, maybe this is something can help us to determine if Help us to determine if two representations they are staying the same, they are coming from the same strata or not. Okay, because you can see if this limit is bigger than zero, you are hoping they will converge to the same strata at a very, but that's not something they prove. They just prove this could happen, okay? Yeah, so if you take the go key and the ether key and you plug it into your Manhattan curve, yeah, the curve. Yeah, it goes to zero, right? Yeah, that's what I'm doing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you know how to call performance or? That's a good question we want to know. That's what a bummer. That's one of my open questions I want to ask in the end. Okay. That's a natural question, right? But you see, this kind of a symbolic behavior, then you're asking. Of asymptotic behavior, then you're asking how that thing might really converge to what happens, okay? And then you will see right away, like our technique does not really help us to see that because we sort of it's like spoiled. So we sort of doing we're doing this in two different ways for compact surface. That's along the before you reach the limit, everything is confirmed subshield by type. But after you got pinched, then You got pinched, then we sort of using countable alphabet. Then, you know, I don't, I don't really see how to do that from that perspective, but there might be another way to do that. Yeah, you really jump terms and you push both of them, uh, h goes to zero, or is it very specific about this? It's it's very expected about this example. It's not a general general path, just general, yes. It to be general, general that it will be in both two, yeah. As long as they go to different next strata at a very, then you are hoping that always go to zero. That sort of tells you they're living in the different strata in these pension curves. Yeah, so that's that's that's why this is somehow interesting number to look at. This correlation number is somehow very interesting. It's there's more story about this. I mean, one more. Yeah, yeah, three halves. Yeah, that's right. Did you say anything about two halves? I don't have anything really intelligent to say that's what it should show up when you do the harmonic analysis. Yeah. But maybe, Mark, you have anything smart to say? Anything to say? Smart to say. Anything to say? Everything you say is what I mean. The belt was state larger. Right, right. So it's basically a local limit there, and they tend to have different hands in. And also, the co-op for the sharp is Schwartz with a W in it somewhere. Oh, yeah. So people might not realize. The W you might not. It has the W in my note, but I will put that on my GLA. Do you want to characterize the applicant since the crashing is also due to long? I thought that's that's functional. I'll just mess it as well. My CS digital layer. Okay, so that's one interesting, cute result for this Mianica video or more. Anyway, it's gone away. Okay. So another thing I can tell from the, or Durston tells us from this durst, it is for that intersection number. But that intersection number is this. So there's the oh, this one is not good. Remanio metric. On this technical space. It tells you, in fact, you take twice the derivative. Okay, so like you're thinking about, so let me let me write rho t as a path, a parameter path inside my technical space. I don't need a higher order term. Let's read the term. Order term. It's really the term. It's a path inside my technical space. Okay, so it tells us this. There's a way to measure this tangent vector. I mean, I write P for another reason. I will tell you in a minute. Okay. It's really taking twice the T diff. It's really taking twice the data of the intersection number when you fix according to this path. Okay, it's a Riemannian metric rather than just a Finsler metric. So it has some inner product that really come from here. And it wasn't really easy to see from this definition, but you will see when I give you the thermodynamic setup. Setup. Okay, so that's this Riemannia metric. Okay, and interesting enough, a result by Orica and a shock. In, oh, I should make some remark, but anyway, I will make a remark after this. 15, I remember. No, the 15 is. thing is um this if you consider the same path in the in a technical space this riemannian metric in fact you can recover by taking derivative of this correlation number okay so that's uh that's something really cool uh where is it yeah because there's a concept Yeah, because there's a constant, I want to make sure I put that constant correct. Okay, so you take the derivative of this. You take the derivative of this correlation number, then you can recover this pressure metric out of Dustin's Riemannian metric. Okay, the remark I want to make in here follows from this. So first, Dirth's approach to this is really using his intersection number and it according to according to According to maybe a dictionary, uh, Thursday was very happy though, he like contracted a new Riemannian metric and technical space. And Whooper, in fact, sure, showed that, and in 95, showed that this Riemannian metric Thurston construct is exactly, here's the number, three, two. The number three two minus one times the classical value is a metric. Let me make sure I gotta remember why it's somewhere there reply reply Oh go away Okay, so indeed, this metric we defined here recovers the classical Melbourne design. Yes. In Wolper's name, do you want to interchange your ERT? Better? Okay, good. So that's the first remark. And this Melfin symmetric is coming from the sympathetic structure on a technique space. So it's catered and it has so many geometry structures, Riemannian structures attached with respect to this metric. For example, the technique space is negative, it's non-positive curved with respect to this metric, and it is incomplete. And it is incomplete, okay? And it's unpinched. So it can go to zero and it can go to negative infinity in different parts of the surface of the manifold. So it's kind of interesting Riemannian metric living on this deformation space. Okay, so that's Wolpert tells us. And somehow this very dynamical defined number, metric has something. Metric has something to do with this very geometrical object. Okay, so that's Wolpert tells us. And what else I want to say? Okay, and this, why this thing I wrote P, it's because this is in Mac mode. In his paper, he really using some diagnosomalism to recreate. To recreate this metric and recover this result, Wolper's result. So it sort of defined this reminder metric in a slightly different way. It maybe you will remote relate with the way I'm going to define it in a minute. Using someone that's an approach and recover this. So that's, and he called this metric pressure metric. Okay. And one. And one important reason people care about this metric is the definition is pure thermodynamic conformalism. And it does not redirect any sympathetic structure of this technical space or this deformation space at all. And that is something we need to generalize to like other deformation spaces. Okay, because at the Because at the moment, we don't have any synthetic structures on this Kegger variety. But we still have all this stone dynamic formalism set up. Okay, so that was done by again of people. So it's Bridgeman. Oh, I will say Bridgeman has some ideas. We did with something, something called this. Uh, what a divorce something is related with this intersection number. You try to take twice the derivative of that, and yes, sorry, just the polycottion sharp results from 2011. Yeah, left-hand side is going to depend on t, the right hand side doesn't, equal zero. Yeah, t oh. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, yes. Is that better? Now that should depend on T okay. So Richmond has a real result than really with this construction, but he is not able to prove this form is not degenerate. And he asked the question to Mac Mullen, and Mac Mullen has an insight that diagnosis can help us to deal with this. Can help us to deal with this degeneracy issue. So that's maybe his 606 result. Then they these four people of Richmond, Canary La Burie and Sambarino in In 15, generalize to higher rank, to higher rank, but we're still in the compact setting to higher rank. And I realized it was just too slow. So I'm still in the classical round. And now I'm just posting all this thing, still really coming all of this thing can really come in from here. And a result by By Mark and Richard, was they are very because when you vary the representation, you are varying this mariatan curve. So they are looking at how this mariatan curve are changing according to the perturbation and then look into the derivative of that. That's how they recover this pressure metric setup. So that's that's also something very cool and relate everything together. Okay, so uh I'm going to skip some I'm going to skip some part of the thirst asymmetry metric, but going to the part of the film diagram formal is an explanation because I'm way behind my sketches. Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet. You'll see, right? Because I'm not giving you the total diagonal formula setup at all. I'm just giving you a lot of things. So, this eventually, this number will. This eventually, this number will relate with the derivative of pressure. Okay, and that's that's somehow we want to see in a minute with the eraser. Okay, so in here, I just posted a lot of geometry, like everything in here, you don't need to, you don't need to like a formalism. It's really pure geometrical. You just look at the representation and look at the averages, and you get all these fancy numbers. Okay, but the goal is to try to really use in throwing formalism to use. Those like a formalism to relate everything together. Okay, so I will be a little bit sloppy in the first part, but hopefully you all can fill out the gaps. Okay, so the so this is the second part. So that's uh uh interpretation. Okay, so what do we do? As a dynamicist, we first want to do is try to turn this problem into a dynamics problem, okay? And thankfully, we are young enough that all the tools were built up by our assessors, okay? So, first thing. So, first thing, if I have a representation, I have a fixed hyperbolic surface. So if I have a hyperbolic surface, then it gives a right to a geodesic flow. Okay, on this surface, maybe it's called S-ro. Okay, rule means the hypotenetic. I know it's unconventional, but Conventional, but bear with me. Okay, so you take your bundle. Okay, so in this case, especially when we are living in the hyperbolic surface case, the Jodisic flow can be modeled by can be modeled or we do something even easier. Okay. The limit set. I bet all of you know what limit set is right now because we Right now, because we have defined yesterday. So let me say. So it's in this case. So let me drew the simplest example using Shaki groups. So for example, if I have two Shaki group generate, it's a free group generated by these two elements. So it will create a cantor set-like. A cantor set-like limit set on my boundary. And indeed, there exists a coding for these limit sets. So I can call this, I can find a sub-geophine type. In this case, it's just a full shift given by G1, G2 into the limit set. Law, there's no one. Lo there's no one or pi F S. Okay, so every element. So this is stuff you'll find type. Okay, so you give me a sequence, then I can find I can find, now we'll call this, it's a point on the boundary of the of my hyperbolic surface. Okay, once you have this, and this can be done by. In general, it can be done by Owen series. Owen series coding. And what is the importance of this coding is like this coding is using the generators of my group. So it's using topological information to code the limit set. So in other words, when I fix the topology of my surface sets, On my surface S. So I will say I have the same coding. Okay. So when I change in the remote, when I change the hyperbolic metric, what I get is I will get different lens functions to measure the lens on my different hyperbolic surfaces. Okay. So what does that mean? It means like I need to use different lens functions to prescribe the lens of microcheuristics. Okay. So in other words, in this case, every representation will correspond to all hyperbolic will correspond to To or hyperbolometric will correspond to some root function. This is a hurdle continuous function living in my shift space. Okay, such that this new function has a very nice property that you satisfy this R the ergodic sum. So if I have some points, a fixed point, I have some fixed points. I have some fixed point in my limit set. This guy will correspond to some close judiciary, which is close-judicious, which is which is some, okay, or it is i.e., a cross-juristic. It will correspond to some cross-judicial and the ergonomic sum of this. This rule function are evaluate this point, this fixed point. Okay, will be exactly the length of this, the length of this, the length of this element, this corrosionistic with respect to this hyperbolometric. Okay, so that is really the most important part we wanna use in this symbolic model. Symbolic model, okay? Because mainly we care about is really the growth rate of cross-strophics, okay? Even from starting from the intersection number or the Manhattan curve, all of them really coming from this part. So that is the construction that we want to do. So when we have a thermal diagram, when I have a symbolic setup for my even hyperbolic surface, then we get all these numbers. Like I get this shift space. like i get this shift space and i get a different uh i get a different loop function okay maybe i want to i'm to be a little bit more precise this loop function depends on my representation or my hyperbolic metric so i put a subscript or a row in here okay so then what what can we do with this uh functions The displacement of the yes, yes, the the the the this the displace distance, yes, yes, exactly. Okay, so once we got this, uh what we can do is we can sort of write everything in here in terms of the holism. So, first one, third term, so this intersection number, okay. So, oh, so let me let me first one. So, if I have a path. One. So if I have a path in this tech mirror space, okay, so it will correspond to, it will create a sequence of loop functions, okay, living in the hurdle continuous function space. And all these hurdle continuous functions has one important property I forget to state. That is something we call the Bowman's formula. These new functions, they satisfy this Bowman's formula. Okay, so the general form is with respect to this shield space, so it should be something like the topological entropy of the of just row equal to zero. Okay, so this. Okay, so this in our case, this number is equal to one. Okay, so what this is is really the topological entropy of the suspension flow given by this roof function Rho with the base space sigma. Okay, and that because this setup, we know this models the geodesic flow on the universal boundary on the unitangium bundle of this surface with respect to the given. Of this surface with respect to the given representation. Okay, so that's equal to one in our case. So indeed, it's really this. It's this formula. So all these representations who like sort of like this does not really answer the question Bau raised yesterday, but there are some relations we might see, like not all of the loop functions. Not all of the root functions coming from hyperbolic manifolds, okay. In this case, they need to satisfy this kind of equation, okay? So, it might give you some like hypersurface, but it's still still very large, very big space. Okay, so anyway, what I want to say is like if I perturb this representation and the representation I get in here, if I perturb this thing analytically, then I will get a analytic path in my whole. Path in my whole decontinuous space, all of them satisfy this equation. So, sort of, I get this equation with respect to this perturbation. Okay, so that's something important. And what we want to do is we're going to take derivative of this equation with respect to t. So, I have big fixed shift space. I'm changing my loop function according to t. Okay, and that t that give arise from the arise from the the the the the the path in my my uh technical space okay so that's that's what we get in here okay and to uh to uh a lemma or or some uh recall some formula for a derivative so we know the first thing dt if i have a path look like this If I have a path look like this, okay, so this negative sign is a little bit annoying. So I'm just thinking like I have a function whose pressure is always equal to zero. Then I want to take a derivative and see what's going on. So the derivative I get from this path is t equal to zero. I mean, definitely this thing is equal to zero. But this tells me this: the derivative. Okay, so this so this is a path in my Hurdle continuous function space. So I'm taking derivative at zero of this this function. So that will give me this integration. So that's the tangent vector of my perturbation. And the mu m zero is the equivalent state correspond to the phi zero function. Okay, so that's the into the first derivative. So that's the first derivative result. And you can do again, taking a twice derivative, what you get in this case was very slightly. You take another derivative. What you get is the variance. You get a variance with respect to this path. The first is the tangent vector with respect to the equilibrium state of phi zero, okay? Plus, the integration of the second term, the second order term, integrate with respect to the m0. Okay, so that follows from you can you can you can You can find this computation on McMurray's paper, or it follows from a periphery gas computation for the derivative of the pressure. Okay, so then we see some hope to relate things together. Okay, so for example, okay. So what what is this what is this Thurston's intersection number? This Thurston's intersection number. So the first one, it's not really. It's just really something you can recover by this at zero. So it's coming from this equidistribution result of this. I mean, in this form, you might not see this right away because when I look at the shift space, but if you think about the suspension flow, even arise by R naught, which is the fixed representation, this thing will give me a flow on the suspension space. So it really tells you. Really tells you this result coming from the equidistribution of this measure and evaluate something look like Rt over R naught. Okay, but you need to put this thing in the right in a suspension space. Okay, so that's some equal distribution result. You can recover indeed this guy, this number, this intersection number, as the average of the ratio of two different loop functions. Different loop functions. The best given by two loop functions can be recovered by this. Okay? And once you can get this, then you can take the derivative with respect to t. And there's only one term depending on t, which is this guy. Okay, everything is independent with t. So that means this the twice derivative is exactly the twice derivative. It's exactly the twice derivative of this guy. Evaluate zero. Okay, and according to our computation over here. Okay, so this. And don't forget, our phi is not exactly this R, it's negative R. So this is a negative sign. Play around. Negative sign does nothing to the variance because variance will eventually, you will square everything. Okay, so there's only one. Square everything. Okay, so there's only one term depend on the variant. But what I want to really say is: you do the computation, this is what you will get. This, the twice derivative of this intersection number can be recovered by this dynamical quantity. It's the variance of this tangent vector evaluating. Evaluating on this equilibrium state with respect to the fixed origin of my perturbation. Okay, so that's how we are able to see this is give a rise a Riemannian metric because variance is coming from the covariance and the covariance and the variance they satisfy this parallelogram formula. So that's why define interface the inner product. That's why we get a Riemannian metric. A remote metric instead, just a physical metric. Okay, another thing is to see the degeneracy. So it's sort of like this, as you really perturb this representation such that this thing is not equal, like congress to zero, then this number will not degenerate. We'll always be a positive number. Okay, so that's how we're able to put everything together with one perspective with. With one perspective, with the pressure metric. Another thing I want to say is maybe with respect to relation with the Mehaden curve. Mehaden curve in this case with the same setup. Mehaden curve can be realized by this number. Row one, row two. This number is. This number is exactly this. I should write it this way. So, the number living on my Mehaden curve, the point on the curve, row one, row two, is exactly given by this. If and only if they satisfy this. So, in other words, like this. So in other words, like this pressure equation categorize points on this curve. Okay. And it will be easier to see the relations in here by writing in a suspension flow model. So I just, there's not no way I can erase this. Erase this. Okay, so maybe I just write this in here. So before me had a curve. So in other words, I mean, in here is also good enough to see, like, I want to see why this give me a netic curve. Maybe then. Minus three times per sine. Okay, so I'm sort of like raised. This is the pressure for the base space. Okay, and I know I can raise this thing considered if I consider the suspension flow with this loop function R1. So then I will get an equation on my suspension flow. So they are exactly the same equation. So they are exactly the same equation, but this one is coming from suspension flow. And we're writing this is easier to see because it's easier for me to take derivative. In this case, B times Possi. Possibly is something called a, some nowadays people call a reparametrization function or time change function in the sense that when I integrate along this gamma, this function will give me the This gamma, this function will give me the length of the other representation. Okay, so in other words, you need to construct this kind of function, which give me this number, okay? But anyway, one work, one important result from Sharp and his watch is like they do construct this function, okay? But anyway, this extends to the entire thing. Yes, yes, the way they construct it. Yes, yes. The way they construct is from the entire space. Then give you this. So the construction is non-trivial over there. I think so. Yeah. Yeah, I think as far as I remember. But in general, there's another way of constructing this kind of function by using Bootsman functions. And that will be also work in this case. Okay. But anyway, using their construction, you can. Using their construction, you can get this equation. So, A, B are the points on my mechanic curve. So, then I can take the derivative with respect to A. And you can see this B is determined by A through the pressure. So, by the inverse function theorem, you know, B determined, it depends on A analytically. So, that's how they get the analyticity. And in fact, you can, once you get analyticity, you can sort of write my Manhattan curve as this. Curve as these two quantities. And then you can parametrize them by this. And then take a derivative. So you know what is the derivative look like in this case. I think it's this. So this, this, oh, maybe I need to write. Maybe I write mu t. Try to distinguish. Try to distinguish. So, m will be the measure on the shift space, and the mean will be the measured linear suspension flow. So, this will correspond to be negative q t s per psi. So the derivative, if you just compute, the derivative will give you, you will get number like this. Okay, and then you can also take the computer twice derivative. With you and let me see what is the type statement So many remarks I should make Variance is the same thing in the denominator. Oh, just a square. Variance psi and with the same measure. I'm just writing t. This means the same measure. Okay, so the quite derivative will be this number. Okay, so by taking this derivative, you know this thing is more than zero. Okay, and you know. Smaller than zero, okay. And you know, these things are bigger than zero, so you need to see the convexity. So, it's really the shape of this magnal curve can be coming from these derivatives. And then also for this proposition, there is some interpretation of this correlation number by entropy of some special with respect to some special measure over the suspension flow. And using that relation, you are able to recover this. To recover this relation. But I'm really lack of time doing that. I'm waiting for four minutes for the higher-rank generalization. So that's whatever we did for the classical version. And I mean, I'm not worried about this because this is really the core of the whole method. Again, the idea is really try to generalize this to other realms. Okay, so what is the other realm that we care about? Then the first thing is why we What I really care about is my job. But anyway, a way to do that is working with geometers. They really care about these kind of representations called a function representation. The hitching component. Okay. Hitching. Okay, so what is this? So I will give you a very, so there's a bad definite, not bad. For this H component, people write like so many Huber presentations. It's a subspace of a representation for pi one of S into PSLNR. Okay, so it's a special component such that there's a way to put PSL2R. So what we did is pi one, we mapped. So if this is a function representation, I made pi one into PSL2R. Okay, and then there's a standard way, a standard unique irreducible representation can insert PSL2R into. PSL2R into PSLNR. Okay, so in other words, if I compose these two representations, I'm able to really embed all my function representations in this space. Okay, and nothing we call a function, function locus. Okay, so what is a fiction representation? By definition, it is so in this character variety has so many different components. Variety, it has so many different components. Okay. And one component contains this function locus. And we call that Hitchin component. That is an interesting component, which Hitchin found through this Hitchin Higgs bundle method. And he can show the in topology, this space is isomorphic, diffeomorphic to R D square. Square some number. Sorry about that. Let me see. E square minus one. So in topology, it just RN. Okay. But people really interesting. So it carries, as you see, like the function space or the technical space is really sit inside this bigger space. Bigger space. So it has it carried many geometry from this particular space, but it's higher rank, so it's much bigger. So the geometers are interesting, like how many geometry you can recover, or what are the similarities between this and the difference between this hitching component and the bookchain locus. So that's the whole focus in there. Okay. And what our tool can do, okay? So basically, you have a higher. Classically, you have a higher rank representation. What you can get is you get more eigenvalues. If you think about the classical function, you can classical function representation, you get pretty much one eigenvalue, right? Because determinist one, one is the inverse of the other. The length of a function representation is really given by if this is function. This is function. The length of this representation, all you The length of this representation, or the code to this corresponding to this guy, is really given by this: the bigger eigenvalue. Okay, so it is only have one big, the eigenvalue give this number, okay? But in higher rank, you get more eigenvalues, so you get more options to create different length functions, okay? So, uh, one interesting or more geometrical length. Lens function you can create from this space is you are like the lens function is called a Hilbert length corresponding to the Hilbert metric on the on the convex projective structures. Okay, so that's the Hilbert metric on this guy is because I'm PSL3, so I have three eigenvalues, but indeed it's in the multiplication is equal to one. So I'm looking at the largest eigenvalue. So I'm looking at the largest eigenvalue, the log of the ratio of two eigenvalues, the largest and smallest one. Lambda one rho gamma lambda three. Oh, okay, to write. So one important, sorry for very slapping here. For the hitching component, there is an important result proved by Labrador in six. He tells us. In six. He tells us if a representation is to give you another kind of a categorization of the hitching component, rather than just a connected component, leaving contents of technical space. So this guy, whenever you have the, you have a representation, picture representation, then the eigenvalues will be real split. It means like it will be real diagonalizable. Diagonalizable with distinct eigenvalues. Therefore, I can calculate the eigenvalues. So, the lambda one here is I take a module of the eigenvalues. Okay. So, I know I'm out of time. So I'm just be super super quick. Sorry about that. So, I can use different eigenvalues to define different length functions. Different lens functions with respect to the same elements for my fundamental group. Okay, like in here, this one is a Hilbert metric. This is what we call a spectral length using the largest eigenvalue. Okay, so we can define all these lens functions by different eigenvalues. To do this symbolic setup, it sort of follows the same idea. Like I have the same shift space because that coming from the topology. Okay, right now I have different transparency. Okay, right now I have different lens functions. The thing I need to do is I need to find a good lens function, blue functions, such that I can categorize the lens of cross-shoot distance. Okay, so that's really the main game we need to play to utilize this symbolic setup for the contact case. Okay, and this thing by hand waving, this thing can be done because as I tell you, this thing is coming from the you can construct this loose function by. You can construct this loose function by using Bootsman functions or Boostman co-cycles. And this kind of thing still exists in this huge component realm. You can still define this kind of thing. Okay, so the same tricks still help you to see, to define root functions correspond to different eigen coming from different eigenvalues. Then the whole game you can play continuously. Again, there's another approach. another approach used by polycarn shop they were using a result of dryer to also construct the y rule function give us the the length of the closed geodesics okay and it was also like other way uh given by some daruino which generalized to much more generality somebody called the pk analys of representations so that it's still always like that's that is the task you need to do if you want to do everything like Do if you want to do everything symbiotically, okay. You need to find a roof drive function, categorize your length. Okay, once you're able to do that, then the whole game you can click, then you can derive whatever we can do in the text in the space. Okay, so that is for the hyrect part, okay? For the non-compact part, this is getting crazier. You don't get a sub-geophanite type because in that case, your root function is not good. Case your loot function is not good enough to do any stone dying formulas, but you need to utilize a colorable alphabet. Once you're using colorable alphabet, then you need to look into the works of Bansky Car and a lot of people and Iomi and Verozo and all of you. They are work, they are work, really. Really, I'm just trying to make. I'm just trying to make credit to everybody. Really helped me to really see and understand this. Because in the countable case, your loop function is not very, you need to be really careful because the suspension flow is not as temp as it is in the compact case. So you need to worry a little, a lot of things. Okay. So like we need to end up in some conditions such that my pressure is good enough to take twice derivative. Something that we call the entropy gap at infinity. Entropy gap at infinity. That is really inspired by the other people's work. For example, like Shapira and Tapi, their approach of defining this number. Then, everything, once you have this criterion, then everything will work similarly in this format. Okay, so that's just my hand wave. So, sorry, very sorry for over time. I'm stopping here. I think it's
