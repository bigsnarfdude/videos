For organizing this meeting in this complicated situation. So, I would like to speak about the joint result with Miroslav Buricek, with Anzgar Yingl and Nikola Zamponi concerning stationary compressible fluid model for heat conducting and chemically reacting mixtures. So, we already heard. So, we already heard some talks about this subject, for example, yesterday's talk by Ansgar. But here, I would like really to join this model for mixtures also with the fluid equations. For, I mean, simplicity, because as you will see, the whole procedure of the proof is quite complex. We started with solving Solving a steady problem, even though our ultimate goal is indeed the evolutionary problem, but it requires much more technicalities and much more ideas to be done. So I hope we will continue soon with this. Okay, so our system of equations reads like this. It's a system of n plus three plus one equation. Plus one equations. So the first n equations corresponds to the balance of species. We consider that the mixture contains n species and we have no limitation on the number capital N, where this rho i is the partial or is the density of each constituent, V is the velocity. In our model, we assume that the mixture can be modelled. The mixture can be modelled by one so-called barycentric velocity, which is a certain limitation, but okay, in some situations it's a reasonable assumption. Capital JI are partial fluxes, and this Ri on the right-hand side is a source term which corresponds to the chemical reactions. So then we couple this equation or this system of equations with the Or, this system of equations with the balances coming from the fluid. So, the first is the balance of the momentum. So, this rho is the total density and it is sum of these partial densities. S is the stress tensor, P is the pressure, which is a given function, and B given function of temperature and densities, and B is the force. B is the force, so this is a given, really given a function. And finally, we have to somehow combine this with also the balance of energy because we would like to speak about heat conducting mixtures. However, the situation with the good description of the balance of energy is not so easy. I will come to this a little bit later. Come to this a little bit later. Anyway, for me, the correct formulation is the balance of the total energy as written here. So capital E is the specific total energy, Q is the heat flux, and the rest of the quantities was already introduced. We combine this system of equations with the boundary conditions. equations with the boundary conditions. So we assume that ji dot nu nu is the autonomal to the boundary of omega is equal to zero. We assume that the heat flux satisfies this kind of boundary condition and in fact some kind of similar boundary condition is needed because we cannot have insulated totally insulated Insulated totally insulated system because then the steady solutions are usually if they exist quite trivial. So we have to allow some exchange of energy which is here expressed by the fact that the heat flux is proportional to the difference of the energy inside, which is the theta, and outside, which is theta naught. So theta naught is a strictly positive function, it's the external temperature. Is the external temperature and we will need some mild assumption on this theta node, but in general, in order to have interesting solutions, we assume that it is not a constant. And finally, concerning the velocity, so now we can choose between basically Dirichlet boundary condition, v is equal to zero, or the Navier type. To zero, or the Navier-type boundary condition, which is used here. So there is a partial slip. Alpha 1 corresponds to this. If alpha 1 is equal to 0, we have total slip. If alpha 1 approaches infinity, we get in the limit the Drichle boundary conditions. Finally, we have to prescribe the total mass of the mixture. Anyway, as I mentioned, it's not so easy to It's not so easy to really choose correctly the equations for the energy because the previous equations have some problems when the regularity of the solution is not good enough. And we can replace it by some balance of entropy. I will come to this later. So, formally, the balance of entropy has this form where this This form where this script j is the entropy flux and the capital xi is the entropy production rate. So we have now to specify the constitutive relations. So the entropy flux has three parts: one which corresponds to the convection, second one which corresponds to this. Corresponds to these partial fluxes, μi are chemical potentials, and the last one which corresponds to the heat flux. And the form of the entropy production, which corresponds to our model, is written here. So there are four terms. And the second law of thermodynamics dictates that this sum should be non-negative. We will guarantee this. We will guarantee this by taking the sum of the first two terms non-negative and then the third and the fourth term separately non-negative. So to this we choose the stress tensor in the form of Newtonian fluid. So we get this form where this d is the symmetric part of the velocity gradient and lambda one and lambda two 1 and lambda 2 are shear and bulk viscosity coefficients, which will be assumed to depend on the temperature. In general, they should also depend on the densities, but this we don't know how to treat such a problem in general. The heat flux has two parts. The first part which corresponds to the Fourier law, and the second part, which is connected with interaction between Interaction between the species. Kappa will be again temperature-dependent thermal conductivity. So the diffusion flux will have two parts. The first one about which also Ansgar spoke in his talk yesterday, the diffusion coefficients, which should be by Ansager's principle symmetric. Zagreb's principle symmetric and the second part which corresponds to the heat. And we return back a little bit to the equations and we look at the first equation. So if we sum up these equations, we expect that we should get in the sum the balance of mass, of total mass. So it means rho i sum up to rho i. means rho i sum up to rho so it means that the divergence of ji's must sum up to the sum of ri and our assumption will be that they each separately sum to zero which means that we have also for this j i some condition which we will choose to be in this form so separately m i j So separately, mij will be summed over i to zero, and this m i will be in the sum equal to zero. Moreover, we will assume some kind of condition for this m i j, some kind of positive semi-definiteness, because of this condition, indeed we cannot expect more. And unlike in the Ansgar's talk, we have here just a constant, we don't. Have here just a constant, we don't expect any degeneracy when the density goes to zero for the source time. We will have a similar assumption on the sum and okay, some growth condition which is just a technical assumption in order to get all terms integrable later. Concerning thermodynamics, we will assume that. We will assume that all the thermodynamics will be given by Helmholtz free energy. And the Helmholtz free energy then defines all other quantities. It means the chemical potentials, the pressure, the internal energy, and specific internal energy and specific entropy. And somehow what will be a very important issue will be convexity of the Convexity of the Helmholtz free energy with respect to the densities. So we will use the notation that somehow, in some cases, it will be useful to use temperature as some kind of parameter and to assume this Hermann's free energy only as a function of the densities. And we will assume that we have well-defined Legendre transform H, which depends on μ. And I will come back to this. And I will come back to this because I will formulate later on some conditions, but somehow the convexity will be a crucial assumption. We will assume that our okay in what follows, somehow I will come to this a bit later. The pressure will have somehow the cold pressure path. Cold pressure part, which will behave like the total density to some power gamma. And we will assume that gamma is larger than 3 over 2. And I will also, in the hypothesis below, work with some improvement of the density estimates. I will come to this later. So basic assumptions are that the domain is a bounded C2 domain, which is not actually symmetric. Why C2? This is basically only due to for the construction. Only due to for the construction, so it can be relaxed to Lipschitz domain, but it would complicate technically everything. And this assumption that the domain is not axially symmetric is again some simplification because we want to use certain form of coins inequality, which requires this. Again, can be removed, but again, there will be some technicalities. So, we will assume, in order to make it as simple as possible, alpha one is equal to zero, so we have total. Equal to zero, so we have total slip. While alpha two, which is connected with the exchange of the heat through the boundary, must be positive. Some assumption on the right-hand side. We will assume that the viscosities behave like one plus temperature, while the shear viscosity must be strictly positive. The bulk viscosity can be zero. And again, here the assumption on And again, here the assumption on the linear growth is connected with rather mathematics. It gives us the best result. It can be also sublinear growth, but then everything again complicates. And we will assume that the heat conductivity behaves like temperature to some power beta. We will have some assumption on the growth of the Mij and Mi's, which I don't. Which I don't want to comment much. The reaction term must sum up to zero in order to keep the masses to have the mass conservation. And now the free energy. I mean, I would have to write two pages here of assumptions on the free energy, but the main assumption is that it is strictly convex with respect to rho, with some growth conditions and some behaviour near zero for the function first and second gradient. Function first and second gradient. And this will allow us to use these very nice properties of the Legendre transform. And finally, we have some assumption on the behavior of the second derivative, which gives us some behavior of the pressure. And this is our really main assumption. And indeed, the question can be: does there exist a reasonable choice of the free energy? Choice of the free energy which fulfills all the conditions above, and the answer is yes, we have this choice. So, I will come to some mathematics. So, weak formulation of the problem. So, we have the weak formulation of the species balance, we have weak formulation of the momentum balance and of the total energy. There is nothing deep in this, it's just multiplication by suitable functions. Here and here, there is no assumption on the boundary. Here, the normal trace is equal to zero. We have also a weak formulation of the entropy inequality. I will explain this in a moment. And I will also need total energy equality, which is nothing but taking the weak formulation of the total energy balance with the test function equal to one. The reason for this is basically that in the total energy, there is a term. energy there is a term which is V squared and altogether the worst term is something like rho times V cubed and sometimes this term is not integrable so it it is useful to replace the total energy balance by the entropy inequality. Why inequality? Mathematically, because we have to use V global semi continuity. Physically also entropy inequality makes good sense. Entropy inequality makes good sense, but we have to keep something coming from the balance of the energy, and this is this equality, which is the weak formulation of the total energy balance with constant test function. Finally, if we sum up the weak formulation for the mass balances, we get the weak formulation of the total mass balance, and we will work. And we will work with the renormalized form of this equation because this is a standardly used tool to prove strong convergence of the densities, which is important to get existence of the solution. So I will work with two types of solutions, weak solutions, which fulfill the species equations, the momentum equation, the total energy balance, and the total density together with the velocity. Total density together with the velocity is a renormalized solution to the continuity equation. And variational entropy solutions, which are solutions which instead of the total energy balance, fulfill entropy inequality and the total energy equality. So this was the total energy balance with test function one. And again, we require that the total density is a renormalized solution to the continuity equation. And our main result reads. And our main result reads that under some assumptions on gamma and beta, we know that there exists a renormalized variational entropy solution to our problem. And moreover, if we restrict a little bit more these parameters, we get a renormalized weak solution. So, some comments which are also connected to why we really studied this problem. So, we wanted to remove some assumptions. Some assumptions which were contained in some of the previous results on this, on some models concerning chemically reacting mixtures. Those models were based on the model of Van San Giovanni from his book. And there is a joint work with Vencin and with Evelina, or joint work with Tomasz Piasecki, where we studied study. Steady solutions, but there was really an assumption that all the molar masses are the same, which was not a very good assumption. It limited really the models to very specific situations. So we looked for a better model. The better model was developed in a series of preprints by Dreyer, Drier, Gragaevsky and Gurke. Gaeevsky and Gurke. And the important role in their model was the convexity of the Hermold's free energy. But in that paper, you will find only situations when the temperature is constant. So we wanted to extend it to also non-constant temperatures. However, as a first step, we used only steady solutions to understand the whole machinery. Okay, and one of the developments of this problem is actually a modified proof of the strong convergence of the total density, which doesn't use precisely the form of oscillation defect measure estimates as it is used, for example, in the results concerning steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system. And as a consequence, it removes some restrictions on these parameters gamma and B. On these parameters, gamma and beta. So I will very briefly, okay, I'm almost out of time, so maybe I just briefly sketch main idea. So main ideas is we need some a priori estimates, so there are present here, and we need to get strong convergence of the density because all other quantities are good, except for chemical potentials. We have only projection of the chemical potentials, but we can live with. The chemical potentials, but we can live with this. So we have effective viscose flux identity for those who know the theory for compressible Navier-Stokes or Navier-Stokes Fourier system. This is a well-known tool. And now there is a series of lemmas which exploits the convexity of the free energy and we get some nice results for this quantity Wk. So some monotonicity, some S. Monotonicity, some estimate, this is here and here, and finally, some properties of these two quantities, so QK and OK. And having them, this replaces the previous idea of using oscillation defect measure estimates to get re-normalized continuity equation. We can do it directly with this tool, and we get. And we get that even for gamma, which is close to 3 over 2, when we lose the fact that the solution rho v, the limit, solves automatically the randomized solution of the continuity equation. We can prove it as the consequence that rho delta V delta solves it in the renormalized sense. And as soon as we have this, the rest of the proof is standard. The strong convergence of densities is really. Strong convergence of densities is really standard. What is a little bit less standard is that we have to deduce from the strong convergence of the total density and strong convergence of the projection of the chemical potentials, also strong convergence of partial densities. That's all. I'm sorry for being a little bit longer. Thank you very much for your attention. Well, thank you very much.
