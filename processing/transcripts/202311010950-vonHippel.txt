Okay, thanks everybody. Can you hear me okay? Awesome. So this is aimed maybe a little more at the statisticians than the astronomers, but I hope the astronomers will appreciate some parts of this. My list of collaborators, current collaborators is here. I'm including two in the room, the two Davids. As background, although most of you probably know this as statisticians, one of the most famous diagrams in astronomy is the Hertzprung-Russell diagram. Is the Hertzprung-Russell diagram, where we have on the horizontal axis a temperature plotted backwards for historical reasons and luminosity, which is the power or energy per unit time for the surfaces of stars. And when stars are plotted in this diagram, the vast majority fall upon something that's diagonally through the diagram, the main sequence. It turns out all those stars are converting hydrogen to helium in their core. Stars like the Stars like the Sun will eventually deplete their helium, sorry, hydrogen in the core, and then the helium, and then they will become a red giant in this state of properties. They'll move to the upper right. They'll do some other things, and they will, if they're less than eight solar masses, become a white dwarf. Now, I had to extend this diagram from the textbook because it didn't go faint enough. Most of the white dwarfs we study follow off the bottom of this diagram. There was Diagram. There was a classical realization that is now 70 years old by Alan Sandage that if you look at different clusters of stars in the sky, something called M67, Messiah67, or NCC 2362, that the main sequence you can see in all these clusters, but then they have different stars that are no longer main sequence or sub-giant or giant. Longer mean sequence or sub-giant or giant branch stars, and the location of that can be modeled, and it's mass-dependent. And from that, you can get the age of the cluster. Now, for the astronomers, you may find it amazing that this session where Alan Sandig presented this was chaired by Oort and Bada Hoyle, Morgan, Saul Peter, Schwarzfield, Spitzer, and Stronggren were all in the room. Okay, why is this not moving? The okay, why is this not moving? There we go. If you look in the lower left-hand corner of the HR diagram, you get the white dwarfs. Now, this is again a proxy for temperature, surface temperature of the star. This is a proxy for how bright the star is corrected for distance. And each one of these points represents a single star. And with age, with time, they will move to the lower right in this diagram. Their mass doesn't change, but depends. Their mass doesn't change, but depending on the mass, they will be along this position. And if they have hydrogen or helium in their atmosphere, their colors will change in this proxy. And so they'll follow this or that. And so from this, again, you can get their age if you can read off how far down they are here. And the goal for my work and for many of us is learning more about cellular evolution and learning. Is learning more about stellar evolution and learning more about ages. So, starting quite a while ago, 17 years ago, a few of us published an article on using Bayesian analysis for stellar evolution. It's been extended and extended, but basically we have a bunch of models for how stars behave, whether they're main sequence stars or other types of stars. These create simulated stars in Stars, individual simulated stars, or aggregated into clusters of stars. And we can add background field contamination. And then we have a Bayesian algorithm in here, a combination of Markov, chain, Monte Carlo, and numerical integration, which David Van Dyck and David Stenning led in our team to develop. And these will get compared with actual observations. Right now, where our work is going is we're trying to derive ages for individual stars, not entire clusters, but individual stars, because then, in principle, we can get the age for any star out there, whether it's interesting as a host for an exoplanet or to work out the structure of age throughout the galaxy. So, this is a simulation I did recently. Again, this is the proxy for the HR diagram, a proxy for temperature, a proxy for brightness. Proxy for brightness, and every one of these points represents a simulated individual star with the masses of the star indicated. So, two solar masses would be up here, a little less than solar down here. And these are so-called isochrones. If you had a whole cluster of stars, you'd see them following this because they would have a similar age. And in this simulation, when we use currently available data quality, this particular survey for Survey for the photometry, the Gaia survey, which gives us the astrometry, the distances, a bunch of models, a certain understanding of error, understanding of some priors that are outside this immediate data set. We're able to recover the ages. And the degree to which we recover the ages is indicated by this color here. So down here, we're only able to recover the age to sigma as a. To signal noise of 10 or 10 percent. But up here for these stars, we can recover the age to very high fidelity to just a few percent uncertainty in the age. So these are main sequence stars, and that might even be a surprise to some of the astronomers in the room. For individual main sequence stars, we can recover their ages, assuming we can measure very good trigonometric parallaxes to the star, which we now can do with Gaia. There's a similar story for white. There's a similar story for white dwarfs, but they have a very interesting distribution. So, on this diagram, I've plotted the implied age for a single white dwarf on the horizontal axis and the implied mass or the possible mass for the white dwarf on the vertical axis. And if the white dwarf has this distance unknown, mass and distance are related parametrically, then it could be anywhere in here. Then it could be anywhere in here. And what I like to point out to my students is: this distribution of points, this is what MCMC yielded of all possible solutions, is in no way Gaussian. And in fact, if you found the mean of this data set, it doesn't fit anywhere that overlaps with the results themselves. However, if we can get the distances to these objects, which we Objects, which we can from Gaia, then if the distance is this value, say, or this value, it isolates this axis as I've drawn it, and we can get the age to just a few percent. So in conclusion, and I've got a bar coming across the top. We have excellent data quality that we're now able to work with, particularly from Gaia, which gives us distances and allows us to work with individual stars. We're getting single. We're getting single-star age precisions to 5% or 10%, and we have hopes of doing better than that. We have ongoing work that brings in priors in other areas like the metallicity of the star or the absorption along the line of sight, which can help us improve the ages. And we're open to collaborations and independent users of our software suite, which we call Base 9. We've had 17 published papers so far, three are in press right now. Far, three are in press right now, and there's three that I wasn't aware of that are outside our group that have recently been published. So with that, I will stop and take any questions. All right, are there questions in the room from someone who hasn't asked a question yet? Okay, I'm going to say this is French always. All right, go ahead. All right, Gwen. Hi, Texas. Gwen Edie from UT. Great talk. I was just wondering if we baseline estimate the ages of all the way down to M dwarves quite well as well. Below about 0.7 solar masses, you're not going to get much age information. In principle, you might be able to get it by another technique like gyrochronology or something, although I don't think that works too well for M stars either. Okay. Okay. I'll use the chair's prerogative, and I'll ask my own question. I'm assuming that all this work has basically been done for isolated stars. Have you got any thoughts about seeing what you might be able to do with stars in systems where they've actually had some interactions? This could be incredible for things like a common envelope phase understanding. Yeah, thank you. That's a timely question. This works for individual stars. It works for binaries which haven't had mass transfer. It works for open. Haven't had mass transfer. It works for open clusters, it works for Globber clusters. Next summer, I'm going to spend hopefully about a month with Chris Tout in Cambridge and try to get David to come up from Imperial College and visit us, Cambridge, England, and look at exactly this question. Chris Taud and his group are experts on mass transfer, mass loss, and binaries, but to date, we haven't done anything like that. All right, excellent. Are there any other questions? All right, excellent. Are there any other questions on the room or online? All right, not thinking, not seeing anything, let's thank all our speakers for this morning's recording.
