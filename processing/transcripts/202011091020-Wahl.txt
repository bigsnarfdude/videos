I have so many questions for Trevor, but I think I'm not allowed to go to breakout room one, which is too bad. The talk I'm going to give you here is kind of a tiny piece of the puzzle I would see that we're all puzzling with in the big picture here. I mean, this work could also feed into Trevor's modeled view of the world, but at the tiny scale. View of the world, but at the tiny scale of a single infection. I'm kind of trying to figure out mathematically if we can shed some light on just what our null hypothesis would be. The probability I see that a new mutation arises during a single infection and gets passed on. So I'd like to know a neutral mutation in a viral infection in a single host, what's the probability that it comes up and then gets passed on? Comes up and then gets passed on. So, how different would the flu be that you pass on from that that you received? The way that we tackled this was a deterministic within-host model. And then there are rare mutations that can affect the life history traits of the virus. We treat mutant lineages with a stochastic description so that we can track one, two, three, five virions. And then we have the within-host infection and the transmission bottleneck to one. Transmission bottleneck to one recipient, and look at what happens. So, the within-host ODE model, I won't spend much time on. I think everyone will be aware of these kinds of infectious disease models. There's uninfected target cells, they interact with free virus, they can produce then an infected cell, which is initially in the eclipse phase for flu and then transforms into a budding cell. Into a budding cell. These cells bud virus. The infected cells and the budding cells have a constant death rate. This is a gross simplification of the innate immune response, which of course wouldn't be constant over the course of an infection. And likewise, the free virus is cleared. This could also be the innate immune response as well as just denaturing, loss of infectivity, whatever might happen to that virus. Into that virus, I will neglect the adaptive immune response for reasons that I'll explain in a moment due to timing. So that's the picture. Here the set of ODEs, very simple. It's a five-parameter model. We chose to use flu for this project because for flu, we have some really good estimates of some of these in-host parameters. Some very good, careful work has been done. Good, careful work has been done on influenza A virus. And I feel like the data can support five parameters. I don't feel like the data can support 20 parameters. And some people would even take issue with five, but I have some confidence in this in-host model. Yeah, I think there's not much else to say about this. And here's a snapshot of what the in-host model gives us. We have the target cells starting. We have the target cells starting out at very high levels over time, crashing down, cells in the eclipse phase, cells in the budding phase, and the virus. And we're going to just look at one transmission to a new host. So for lack of a better time, we just said let's look at a transmission that happens to happen at the peak viral load. So that's at time tau. When my students first brought me this snapshot, I said, I don't like And I don't like this target cell limitation. The target cells go basically to zero in 48 hours. And I didn't believe that this was how flu worked, that we ran out of cells in the, you know, epithelial cells in the upper respiratory tract. But Catherine Beauchamin, who's done a lot of this careful parameter estimation that I discussed, referred me to this picture, which just blew me away. So even though it's not that relevant, I'm going to show you because I think it's one of the most interesting things about my talk. Things about my talk, someone else's work. This is someone else's work from 1979. Remfel, 1979. This is an electron micrograph of the healthy ciliated cells of the murine upper respiratory tract. So in a mouse, they look like this in cross-section. This is the mouse respiratory tract, and this is a mouse respiratory tract three days after infection with murine influenza. And this is the single. Murine influenza. And this is the single surviving cell. There's some cellular debris, but basically all the ciliated cells are dead and gone. And we've reduced the cell population down to the basal layer, which would be down here. So this is why your throat hurts so much when you get flu. You actually may lose an entire layer, all the ciliated cells. So we have a target cell limited infection. And our approach in Our approach in cartoon, we have the wild type described by the deterministic model. So there are infected cells in the eclipse phase, budding cells, free virus. And at some point, a mutant may arise, a mutant-free virus may be released, and then there are eclipse phase and budding cells in the mutant lineage described by the stochastic model. Then there's the transmission bottleneck, and what we care about is whether any mutant. care about is whether any mutants get transmitted to the recipient. That's the research question. And the coupling between the deterministic and stochastic model comes in two places. Here we have the target cell. So if we imagine a single virus, the rate at which it finds a target cell to infect and infects it is given by alpha times Yt. So we take alpha. So we take alpha times yt from the deterministic model and feed it into the stochastic model as the attachment rate for the mutant virus. And we assume that the mutant virus lineages are small enough that they don't meaningfully affect the target cell dynamics. So the target cell dynamics from the OD deterministic model in the wild type feed in to give us how many target cells are available for the mutants at various times. And mutants arise at various times depending. At various times, depending on the budding rate of the wild-type infected cells. So that's the coupling between the deterministic and the stochastic model. And so all the fun part, which I'm not going to have time to describe, comes in to the probability generating function, g, which describes the dynamics of the mutant lineages. And this is our counting trick such that we're able to look at. Such that we're able to look at exactly how many furions there will be in the mutant lineage at the time of the bottleneck, and then we can determine whether any of those mutants make it across to the recipient. I'll show you just one mathematical slide of our stochastic model. So, as I said, G is the fun bit. It has three dummy variables, one for the free virus in the mutant lineage. In the mutant lineage, infected cells in the eclipse phase, budding cells. And we do a sort of first principles approach looking at all the different events that can happen and their probabilities. And it collapses down to this quite lovely PDE. And the PDE describes the time evolution of the probability generating function. And that PDE allows us to determine whether any mutants get into the recipient. Get into the recipient. And as I said before, the attachment rate depends on target cell availability. So this is the deterministic model feeding in. So this we have to evaluate numerically. But again, I have some faith in the parameter estimates, so I have some faith in the results. And the results look a little bit like this. So one of the things we want to determine is the probability that at least one copy. Probability that at least one copy of a given mutation occurs de novo during this one infection in one individual and is transmitted to the recipient. And here I've got that probability plotted versus the selective advantage of the mutant. So we looked at two things. We looked at phenotypically neutral mutations, which would be at this point on the axis, and mutations that confer some kind of benefit. For example, they might evade the host immune. They might evade the host immune system, innate immunity better. Oh, sorry, I forgot to tell you about the timing as I promised. Way back here, this peak viral load happens at about 48 hours. No, more than 48 hours, 50 hours. And so this is why we believe the adaptive immune response hasn't ramped up yet. And so that is really helpful, actually, for this modeling effort because those. This modeling effort because those parameter values are not well understood. So, if we had to add the adaptive immune response to this model, it would get considerably more complicated. So, we're looking at phenotypically neutral mutations and mutations that might confer some slight benefit in host to the virus. And we argue that because there's this absolutely tremendous purifying selection. Purifying selection during an in-host infection because a handful of virions grow to 10 to the 9th virions. There's 25 population doublings. We don't think that deleterious mutations have much chance of making it through the bottleneck. So the take-home messages here, I have the beneficial mutations can affect any of the life history traits. So this mutant attaches. So, this mutant attaches a little faster than the wild type, this mutant buds a little faster, this mutant moves on from the eclipse phase, so the cells mature faster, or clearance of the cell of the free virus or clearance of the infected cells could be reduced. Those would be beneficial mutations. So, another question I often get is: why do these lines stop? And they're truncated. Stop and they're truncated because, for instance, once the attachment rate becomes effectively instantaneous, it's no longer a rate-limiting step at all in the model, and further increases to the attachment rate don't confer any growth benefit. Likewise, once you're budding fast enough, you run out of target cells too quickly, and budding any faster doesn't help. And obviously, clearance and death can only be reduced to zero. So, there are sort of practical So, there are sort of practical limits on the selective advantage that can be achieved by different life history traits. We don't see big differences in the probability of occurrence of mutations affecting different traits. In other systems, we have seen huge differences. So, this was a bit of a surprise. I note that the clearance of all the mutations, clearance mutations seem to be favored. So, for a given selective advantage, For a given selective advantage, if you're able to, if the virus is able to not be cleared by the innate immune response, it would have an advantage. So this maybe is, you know, it's consistent anyway with antigenic drift. And... Wendy, could you just tell us what the units of selective advantage are? Is that a relative selective advantage or an absolute quantity? What is that? Yeah, it's like an S in population genetics. Yeah, it's like an S in population genetics. So if a doubling rate of the wild type is W, the doubling rate of the mutant would be W times 1 plus S. Is that clear? Got it, thanks. And so, but I'm actually going to ignore S right now and focus on these neutral mutations to sort of develop our null hypothesis. Sort of develop our null hypothesis a tiny bit further. So, how often, also, yeah, I would point out that within a decent range of the selective advantage, these curves are fairly flat. So, for mutations of moderate selective advantage or neutral mutations, they all have about the same probability that they might occur and get transmitted. This also is not surprising if the bottleneck's quite small, so let's talk a bit about that. The probability of occurrence and transmission, same results, but now on the x-axis, I have the number of virions in the transmission bottleneck. And you can see this just grows linearly, pretty much exactly linearly with the transmission bottleneck size. And at the time that we wrote this paper, the transmission bottleneck size was pretty controversial. There were estimates as high as 300 for flu and as low as 1. Is one, and so we put a figure in saying here are the results. When we figure out what the transmission bottle next size is, we'll be able to read off the right number. And there's been a little bit more consensus in the field now. So our back-of-the-envelope predictions are that if the transmission bottleneck is 100 virions, every time the flu gets transmitted, 10 to 20 sites might be mutated. And again, there were these controversial estimates. There were these controversial estimates in the literature, but I think the field has pretty much coalesced to thinking that the transmission size, at least in temperate seasonal influenza, is very small. One or two viral genomes. And so if there are only one or two viral genomes being transmitted, then a de novo mutation would only occur every five to ten transmissions. So again, of course, we have to address this with phylogenetic. To address this with phylodynamics, with donor-recipient pairs sequencing, but this is the null hypothesis from what we know of in-host dynamics. And there's a really neat suggestion recently that transmission bottlenecks might be larger in tropical regions and only smaller in seasonal influenza in temperate zones, which would also kind of tie in nicely with Eddie Holmes' Rambo et al. source sync hypothesis for flu, where in the tropics we have. Where in the tropics we have endemic influenza sort of spawning seasonal epidemics, and if we only have rare de novo mutations, there would be poor adaptation in the seasonal epidemics. And then there might be multiple substitutions per transmission event and very diverse backgrounds within each host in the tropics. But we haven't looked at that yet. And in my remaining 30 seconds, so I've recently been. So, I've recently been asked. I don't know. I joined a collaboration with four Canadian universities and the NRC and the Public Health Agency to try to do some in-host modeling of SARS-CoV-2. This is being led by Jane Heffernan from York University and James Wee at the NRC. And they're hoping to get me to apply this to make a null hypothesis for SARS-CoV-2. But I remain pretty skeptical because we don't have. Skeptical because we don't have the right kind of data yet to do a detailed, careful, and quantitatively accurate in-host model of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. But I guess we will. We will shortly, and then we can see what happens. Of course, the mutation rate is much lower. So I'll just acknowledge Jennifer and Daniel did the bulk of this work, and David helped us with some transmission bottlenecks. Transmission bottlenecks, Western and NCERC. And I think that's it. Okay, thank you very much for this talk. Lindy, do we have any questions? And again, feel free to just unmute yourself and ask the question directly. Or feel free to put it in the chat as well. I was actually wondering about the coupling between the deterministic and Between the deterministic and the stochastic model, when you basically take one time-evolving parameter from the deterministic model into your PDE, does that mean that you expect the scales at which they change to be substantially different? Or is it simply a matter of the stochasticity matters a lot more in the case of a mutant than it does in the case of a Than it does in the case of a wild type? Yes, the latter. They're working on exactly the same time scale. So the wild type is bubbling along, eating up the target cells, spewing out mutations periodically. But we can't use a deterministic model for those mutations. So a deterministic model, for instance, would say that every single one of those mutations that has an S value greater than zero would just grow, but the vast majority are lost. Majority are lost just through genetic drift. Okay, makes sense. We also have a question from Toby, which is: Do you have data about how the ODE parameters change over time with the evolution? And could this data help to confirm your results? Hmm. So I believe that the ODE parameters, so we're only talking about within one infection. Within one infection, so a single in-host. So the OD parameters, hmm, I'm assuming they're all constant within the host for those 50 hours of the infection. I know that's not true for the parameters D and C that reflect the immune response. So they would actually be ramping up, we expect, over this time, even though it's the innate immune response. The other parameters. The other parameters could change if you had an early, very successful mutant strain, such that the mutant lineage starts to take over the infection. And we haven't looked at that. We've assumed that that possibility is negligible, but it could happen. Great. Okay, thanks very much. We're going to take our tea break now, a virtual tea break. So please be back at 10 minutes before the hour. Minutes before the hour, whatever time zone you're in, it should still be 10 minutes before the hour, so nine minutes from now.
