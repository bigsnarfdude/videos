The outside and inert fluid on the inside and outside, which forced tangential anchoring of the pneumatic out the pneumatic shell that we have. And then they put it through cross-polarizers, and then they saw the defects. And what they saw were a collection of patterns, but in the predominant number of cases, when they thought they were in a low energy state, this is the cartoon that they saw. They saw a pattern. They saw a pattern like on a baseball. That is, so you're going to have four defects. And this is the structure that they had. If gravity came into play and the pneumatic layer got thinner in spots, you got some pinning effects. There are other effects that came on where they saw some degree one defects, but those were local minimizers. They were anomalies. And they did this, and in the papers that they wrote, they were. The papers that they wrote, they were looking at pneumatic shells and they were saying they could make predictions as to what happens when they had nematics where K1 and K3 were different. And that got us very interested. So that is going to be the spirit of this talk. So we're looking at nematics where it's not the one constant approximation. And now since the sphere has the Euler characteristic 2. It has the Euler characteristic 2 from Poincar√© that has the same effect as my boundary conditions in my very first slide. So, since that's 2, there should be, if you couldn't have half defects, you should have four of them. That's what adds up, and that's where the image comes from for the baseball. Okay, so tensors. We don't work with line fields, we're going to work with tensors. We're going to describe liquid. Work with hensors. We're going to describe liquid crystal patterns like most of us here with second moments, the first approximation through Q. And that comes through a density and comes through a Meyer-Salpe microscopic theory. So the idea is that we've heard before is if you have liquid crystal molecules with one long axis and pretty symmetric otherwise, and you look at a picture of what you see, they tend to align. See, they tend to align. There may be some tilting, but overall, when you look at the pattern, what's happening in the tilts, it is pretty much the same type of tilt or canceling tilt that you would see in all directions except for the one. And so the idea is if you've got second moments and you had a density function, you'd get a picture, hopefully, something like this. And you can see the support of the density, and you can think of this as a picture that you. A picture that you would get for a possible density, and we're seeing it is the support has spread just a little bit on top and a little bit on bottom. And what's happening in the horizontal directions is tilt. There may be some tilt, but there's no preferred direction of the tilt. So you have rather symmetric pattern. That's what a second moment should give you. And this is the picture of it, and this is the cue that would come along with that picture. Q that would come along with that picture. And what you see is that one long axis, it gives a preferred direction. And so this particular matrix Q, our Q tensor, has one distinguished vector in this case, E3 minus E3 vector, or that line. And you can write out our energy in this fashion, or not our energy, excuse me, get Q in this fashion. And when you do this, you get a coefficient S in front. And what S. In front, and what S stands for here, or what it is image, what it imagines to be, in my mind, it is a sense of how much spread you get with the density that you have in this picture. S runs between minus one and a half and one. Let me talk about s being positive. If you took s and you pushed it up to one and you looked at the picture, this would be the density that would produce it through that through that. Through that second order tensor, through that second moment, excuse me. And that would be the ideal idea that the density became a drop. You had the molecule only lying in this direction, and the molecules in the pattern near your position would all be coalined along E3. If you took S to be 0, the matrix was 0, it doesn't have any preferred eigenvectors, and you'd have an isotropic state. Vectors, and you'd have an isotropic statement. And s running between 0 and 1 would be an extrapolation of what's going on with the type of tilts you get. So back to math. What we want to look at, or what we're going to do, is we're going to do an energy problem. Here, epsilon is a small elasticity constant, and we're going to have our Q tensor, and we have its derivative, QHAK. And the elastic energy. Elastic energy that I'm going to look at is the one that Dan put up at the first talk, and that is this four-constant elastic energy that you see. And I believe it comes, I saw it first in Longa's paper, but I don't know where it originally came. I know the reason that it was motivated, it was motivated by it had all three invariants, and that was the structure that you get, and the reason we had the fourth term. The reason we had the fourth term is because they were looking for something that had polynomial coefficients at worst, but they wanted O3 invariance with the energy. And so that gave the fourth term. Many people have worked on the first three term or the first term by itself, but you need the fourth term if you want to talk about k1 not equal to k3. Whatever that is, will be coming to that part of the story. All right. If we look at this, then I'm going to look at a problem. This, then I'm going to look at a problem x, y, and there's no third component. So, even though this is a problem that describes something in three variables, my third derivative will always be zero, and that will show up. So, this is going to be my elastic energy. One thing that, oh, excuse me, so the energy that I have when I talk about this final term here is called the Balmu-Shandar energy. And again, Dan put that up on his slide. On this slide. So, one thing that hasn't been talked about or shown is coercivity conditions. What type of conditions do you need to actually make estimates? And these came from Longvist paper. That is, under this type of condition that I have here, if you define L1 prime to be L1 minus 1/2 L4 and L1 plus L4, this didn't come from Longest Paper, this comes from us. And these conditions, and it is. And these conditions, and it is not at all apparent what's going, what that means, or it's not obvious, but what does happen for the energy is you get it's convex. It's a quadratic, so it's positive definite. And that's something you can work out from these conditions. That is the first type of coercivity condition. And that's kind of what you expect if you want to talk about minimal energy. Because bounding the energy or elastic energy, anyway, with a term like this, you control the energy. You control the energy if you know that the energy that you're measuring is going to be finite. And that doesn't happen so often. So that's a problem. So we're going to ask for a second type of coercivity. That is, I'm going to ask for the second equation. The second equation involves derivatives. So this is the derivative of F sub E with respect to the derivative variable. And this is F sub E derivative with respect to the Q. Q. This comes from what? Well, it comes from the Euler-Lagrange equation. If you can't use the energy and you can write down the equilibrium equation, one cheap trick that you can do is to multiply by the unknown Q, integrate by parts, and that's what you get here. And if you're lucky, it will be positive definite. And if it is, that gives you an angle to work from. If it isn't, you probably are in trouble. At least, that's what you have. At least that's what you have. So we're going to need this condition for one place, and that is the reason why I have this type of condition here. And I'll talk about the original conditions from along this paper towards the end. I haven't told you exactly where my coefficients live, but they're going to live in a bounded set, and D is the derivatives of those types of Q. All right. All right, now if we look at the Q's that I'm interested in, if you go back to the formula that I had, the second moment, that Q was symmetric and traceless. So the linear space that we're going to be interested in for the target is, at first it's going to be S. It's a set of symmetric matrices with trace zero. But that is not the end of the story. The Q's that I'm into. Of the story. The cues that I'm interested in are going to be much more restricted because of that formula that we wrote down that is that we wrote down for second moments. That formula forces the cues that we're interested in to have eigenvalues trapped between minus 1 third and 2 thirds. So the target or the space that I'm going to be interested in will be those Q, those Q and S, that will be an M. Now what M. Will be an M. Now, what M is, if you look at that among traceless matrices, is the following thing. It is an open, bounded, and convex subset of S. So I'm looking at a problem where, at the very outset, I'm saying my target, that is, my possible Q's, have to be bounded. Q is going to represent the statistics, well, we'll see this in a second, but Q is going to represent the statistically attainable second moments. Attainable second moments. What I mean by that is if you gave me an L1 density row and put it into that formula, the only type of Q's you could get out will be in M. And if you took a Q that was outside of M, it's not going to appear. On the boundary, it's not going to appear because it has to be a drop mass, a singular mass. And I'm interested in L1 functions by densities. All right? And what And where else are we going? I'm going to have a bulk potential. That was the second term. And now I'm going to describe that. It's going to depend on Q that is in M, and it's going to depend upon a material temperature. Again, this is something that Dan put up. And this is going to be its form. Now, the form, now, it has a certain structure. It is going to be a term that is times t, and that is going to be smooth function on m. Smooth function on M. It is going to be convex, but the price that we pay when we see how we construct this F sub D is it blows up as Q goes to the boundary of M. So I'm going to have a singular potential as part of my energy. C is just the number that we're going to add. Remember, the thing can blow up, but it's smooth, so it has a minimum, so we're going to adjust the minimum. So I have the zero for its lowest. For its lowest possible value. So I call F M sub S Biosulpe potential. That is really not what Biosulpe is. Biosulpe is this integral that I have here, this microscopic term with the density in it. But aside from that, I'm going to look at the densities to begin with, just to talk about things. Functions that are in L1, densities, math. Densities, mass one, and I want my formula for my traceless second moments to appear here. So what we're going to do is I'm going to take B sub Q to be that class of densities, all densities that have these second moments. And I want to find a row that will minimize, or let's say backs, this is the entropy I want to, I want to minus the entropy, excuse me. Want to minus the entropy, excuse me. I want to minimize this. And this concept of a way of getting a macroscopic problem from a microscopic problem, what I mean by that is instead of just starting out with density function and saying that is what my physics is, if I coarse grade it a bit and I put in a dent, I pick out an optimal density and take the Q that's associated with it, that is a macroscopic. With it, that is a macroscopic problem. If you can do that, you're going to have a macroscopic problem. And in the 80s, these physicists, Petrell et Cetra, they have this idea and they put the non-zotz for it. And 10, 11 years ago, Baal and Bujamdar, they worked on this problem. I don't think they knew about Cottrell's work, and they did some of the analytic work, in particular. Analytic work. In particular, what Paul Bashamdar did is they showed what row hat was, that it's unique, and some qualitative features of what I call F subs. Set B sub Q is not empty for Q and S if and only if Q is an M. As such, Q and M are called physical states. They're the ones that you can possibly get. But I'm done with it. The densities be secured, the possible admissible. B secure the possible admissible statistics for the local orientations of the molecules with second moments Q. F sub B of Q gives you a mean field energy to consider. And at this point, I'm done with density function theory. I'm back to Q tensors. Next thing that I have to talk about is the structure of this bulk energy F sub D. And in order to do And in order to do it, I'm going to talk about another set of tensors. Those are the uniaxial tensors. One of my first examples was a uniaxial tensor. And those are the set of Q that come from this form with some n in the unit sphere. It is an expression that has one distinguished axis, that it's going to have one simple eigenvalue, and the n minus n that goes along with n minus n that goes along with it is the eigenspace for the directive. That's called lambda sub s. Each q and s can be diagonalized and the eigenvalues add up to zero. If q is called uniaxial axial, if and only if just one eigenvalue is simple, that's what we just said. And in this case, q is in lambda s for some s non-zero. So that's uniaxial space. Axial space. So I need two properties for F sub B that have been proven in the last 10 years. The first one is that the F sub B that I wrote down from either Cottrell or from Baal Mujamdar has the feature that for finite positive temperature, T less than some T0, there is an S that sits between 0 and 1, where lambda sub S is Lambda sub S is the uniaxial ground state for that F sub B. That tells you the characterization of what F sub B looks like. So F sub B of Q is going to equal 0 if and only if Q is uniaxial of this structure with that constant S as the first coefficient, the notion that I talked about spread. The next thing as an analyst that I need is I need a non-degenerate S sub V. So what I'm going to need next is that near Q. is that near q near the near the ground state lambda of s q will grow away in a non-trivial quadratic fashion so i have a non-degenerate minimum so these types of properties were proven in these three papers uh fatkulin svostikov and lu zhang and zhang they were the ones that did the first They were the ones that did the first piece of information here. And Li Wang and Zhang, they were able to show, or they explicitly showed, this quadratic structure. So those are the mathematical or analytical tools that we'll need from F sub B. Next thing that I want to describe is that we're trying to set up this calculus of variations problem for our energy. For our energy, and I need boundary values. This is going to have Diracle boundary conditions. I want boundary conditions Q0 to be living in the uniaxial well that we have right here for that is where the ground state is. For the type of problem I'm looking for, that's the natural thing. The vector n0 is a vector field defined in the boundary of length 1, and I'm going to ask that it be planar. That is, it'd be living in the x, y. That is, living in the xy plane. Now, Q0, this form of the uniaxial expression, as people have said, it satisfies n and minus n. So what I can have for n0 is it has winding numbers I go around, either one half or the integer multiple of one half. And so we're going to have fractional degrees. And what I'm going to do is I'm going to assume that the degree of the n-naught that I have is of the form d bar over 2. d bar is going to be an n. d bar is going to be an integer. And for me to have a non-trivial problem and something interesting to talk about, my d bar will be non-zero. So once again, d bar over 2 is the winding number of the n0 that makes up this expression, bilateral boundary conditions. Next thing, I'm still talking about the structure that I need for this energy. Well first off, I need a space of functions to work in, and my space is functioning. To work in, and my space of functions will be w1, 2 are those differentiable functions valued at m bar, such that they take on these boundary values. I'm going to be more restrictive than that. I'm going to then say for my target, my linear space S, I'm going to look at only those matrices in S where four of the coefficients are zero: the Q1, 3 and the Q2, 3. Q23 and the symmetric counterparts, they should be zero. And the actual space of functions that we're looking at will be functions in W12, but valued in this target. So for Q and S dot, the eigenvectors are of the form M, M perp, and E3 or minus E3, where M is going to be a unit vector, if I want it to be, of this form, living in the plane. form living in the plate. Minimizing my energy over A naught is going to model having a thin film that occupies a rather thin space or a thin thickness and its top and bottom faces are treated so that E3 is always a principal axis or an eigenvector. And the other two principal axes are going to be living in the XY plane just as Q0. So that is going to be the setting for my problem. I have an energy. I have an energy, and now I have a space to minimize it in. And I have boundary conditions. Okay, let me talk about our, let me explain or describe the theorems first in terms of Q, and then I'll spend some time talking about what we have when we try to prove it or how we construct it. So let's take epsilon small and let Q sub epsilon be a minimizer for F sub epsilon. If you remember, there was an epsilon. If you remember, there was an epsilon, maybe I didn't mention it, but I had an energy, and my energy, I can come back to it, has a small parameter in it. That is this epsilon here, small elasticity constant. And what we're going to do is we're going to first minimize the problem for each epsilon, and then we're going to let epsilon go to zero and see what happens to the sequence of minimizers and see how they can coalesce. And in a nutshell, what we're going to do is that we're going to And in a nutshell, what we're going to do is we're going to capture a uniaxial limit, and we're going to find out where the disclinations or defects are in this problem. So our first theorem goes as follows. I'm going to minimize f sub epsilon. Even though it has an energy that blows up outside of m. Outside of M, the energy is essentially convex. It is convex plus a quadratic. That's not going to bother us at all because all of the competing functions are bounded. So what we prove first is there's a compact set in M, so that means a set, essentially, its quality, is going to be a positive distance away from the boundary of M where things go bad. So that the targets that are all minimizers that I'm interested in. Minimizers that I'm interested in have their values taken in Q. So all of my minimizers are going to stay a positive distance away from the boundary. Because that's true and I can do calculus of variations, my solution is going to be smooth. It's not going to be constrained at the top or constrained at the boundary. And it's going to satisfy an Euler-Lagrange equation. And so this is one way of writing the Euler-Lagrange equation. The Euler-Lagrange equation for that system. The term that I have here is a way of saying that you have Lagrange multipliers because Q is overdetermined. Q epsilon should have nine components. These are nine equations. But there's only going to be five independent variables. So I'm projecting on the spectrum trace as part of a 3x3 matrix. So that is the best I can do for a Lagrange equation. A Lagrange equation. Second thing that we have is there are two numbers, a minus one and a plus one. And they're going to be the leading order coefficient that I'm going to get for the energy. So this is going to be the first order term that I'm going to have in the energy. Because I have non-trivial boundary conditions in the plane, what I'm going to be forced to have is I'm going to have topological obstruction. Topological obstructions. That is, defects are going to form, or there's going to be places where the Q sub epsilon will concentrate as epsilon gets small. And that is going to essentially force a logarithmic growth in the energy. In deleting order, this is exactly what it is. So there's a constant C, that's so that for any Q sub epsilon, I mean minimizer Q sub epsilon, the energy that we have minus this term is going to be. Minus this term is going to be bounded. The second theorem is going to be something about the structure of the q sub epsilon. So I take those q sub epsilon and I claim that for any minimizing sequence with epsilon going to zero, a sub sequence will exist and distinct collection of points a1 through absolute value d bar. If you remember my n naught. N naught on the boundary had winding number d bar over 2 and I'm going to have d bar points, absolute value. Away from those d-bar, absolute value, d-bar points, I am going to converge quite nicely. So if I take a little neighborhood about each of those points, I'm going to have strong convergence. If I look at the energy, I say, what's happening to the energy if I look at a, if I sit on a set, If I sit on a set, positive distance from those points, what happens to the energy is the energy actually goes to the elastic energy of the limit, differentiable function. The energy that I have that's even of the ground of the bulk term vanishes. So consequently, what's going to happen is the Q bar is going to be planar. It's going to be living in my lambda sub s for the problem. For the problem. And the Q-bar is going to be of this form, is going to be uniaxial, and there'll be a field n of x that is planar that will describe it away from those points. And if I look at what's happening about each of those defects, the degree of my director field, limiting director field n, is going to be plus or minus one-half, depending on the side of the bar. And that will happen the same way for each of the points. The points. If we stick with this and we look at the energy, what happens with my energy, which looks quite complicated if you look at the elastic term, but if you evaluate it in the ground state, that's exactly what Q-bar is doing, and its gradients are going to be tangential derivatives in the ground state, because Q-bar lives in the ground state. What will happen is the energy collapses to a Frank energy, and that's what we have. Energy and that's what we have. So, in particular, Q bar, F sub E is just going to be the two constant, the two constant Frank energy, where Ks and Kd are the Frank splay and Ben constants. If I stick with this and I look at the minimizer and the Frank energy, what I can do is I can say, let me stay on a ball far away from or a positive distance from my defects. For my defects, and I look at my energy, and what happens is n, my planar limit, is going to be a minimizer on that ball subject to the boundary conditions of n. So among all m such that m is planar and m equals n on the boundary, it'll minimize the phrenic energy. So this is the structure what I want for this type of problem, limiting all. And so this is what we get. This is the pattern that we get, and we have more information. And we have more information. We can say something about the distance between the limiting defect cores and the distance between it and the bottom. Okay? And so we get these positionings. Related investigations. Well, lots of people here work on Q-tensor models. Let me restrict myself to a little bit of just going passing from Q of X to unaxial by letting epsilon go to 0 for these. Epsilon mode is zero for these types of problems. So many of the people that work on this are here, and I've listed some of them here. I've listed them. Yeah. Just from the previous question and how this one and two notes, what can you say about saying given the points can be plus? What happens is you have a sequence of minimizers and a sub-sequence. You can find a sub-sequence that will determine those D points. The points can't be independently described. Right. But so the other problem of giving the points in the place? That's not what we do. That's not what you do. No. What we're looking for, and these points are sort of singled out because we're looking for minimal energy, and there's a configuration that would correspond to. Configuration that would correspond to a sequence of minimizers. So, to study the problem, I'm not going to describe it in terms of Q. I'm going to describe it like Patty did in terms of a parameterization. Her problem was three-dimensional, and it had five unknowns: P1, P2, G, H1, and H2. For my problem, what I'm describing here, this is planar, so H1 and H2, So h1 and h2, that is what's standing in these two places, would be zero. So I have a problem with three independent variables. And so it's Q of PG. What I'm interested in is, let's go back and talk about the problem. One part of the problem earlier, there was a rather abstract notion of what the bounded set M, what the target looked like. Well, the target here is a lot easier to imagine or picture. What was the notion of M? What was the notion of F? M's notion was that the three eigenvalues of the matrix Q had to live between minus one-third and two-thirds. Well, the eigenvalues in this particular case are this expression minus 2g over square root of 6, this term, and this term here. So, what I'm demanding or requiring for this set, capital M naught, is simply that these Is simply that these three inequalities hold. The first one is a statement about a slab, that's a slab in the g variable, and the other two statements are simply statements about cones. So my m0 is truly a convex set. It's the intersection of two colons and a slab. And this is a picture of what that looks like. That's my m0. And the energy that I'm going to look at is going to be defined on, its target will be on the interior of M0. And as you get close to the boundary, And as you get close to the boundary of it, the bulk energy will blow up. Now, I have boundary values, and let's say let's start with lambda of S intersection S naught. Well, what happens in this particular case is that the only uniaxial element, excuse me, yeah, uniaxial elements that I'm interested in is one where E3 is going to be the director, and that's going to consist of one point, lambda one. Consists of one point, lambda one. That's sort of an extraneous part of my problem. That's sitting there. And the other one is going to be a circle. This red circle here, that is going to be the circle with the radius s over 2. That is going to be the target for the boundary values. So what do I anticipate for a solution? I expect solutions will have the target something that by and large, when epsilon gets small, will all be living close to the red circle. Close to the red circle, in particular, they're far away from the boundary. That's what we expect. The boundary data, like I just described, is living on that circle that I gave you. And it's going to have a prescribed D. Now, the P0 that I have here is going to double the degree of the field N. That's what happens in this problem. So the degree of the boundary, the first two coordinates of my Coordinates of my unknown p will have degree d bar on the boundary. G0 will be s over 6 in the boundary. This is exactly what I'm describing here. That's what the target looks like. So this is going to be the type of boundary values that I'll have. And my A0 then is getting a little bit more, let's say it is getting a little bit more less abstract. It is looking at PG values. Looking at Pg valued in this target that I showed you with these boundary conditions. My energy is just going to come from the energy we had before. It's going to have an elastic term and it's going to have a bulk term. And the elastic term is simply my energy evaluated at Q of Pg. And my bulk term is simply F sub B evaluated at these three unknowns, Pg. And so we write everything. And so we write everything out exactly in this form. And this is my bulk energy. It's going to be, it's not, I don't have an algebraic formula like you do for Landau Degens, but I have a specific formula with qualitative features. And like I said, one of the problems that's going on here is the bulk energy or the bulk potential blows up. So that's going to be part of the issue. The good thing for this problem, as far as we're As far as we're concerned, in terms of PDE, is whatever we're going to get will be a bounded function because it's going to be living in M0. And that makes a big deal if you really want to make some progress on the problem. This is, it doesn't look pretty, but this is the elastic energy when you plug P and G into those formulas. And if you look at them, it is purely a quadratic in terms of gradients. And definitely, there are coefficients here that depend upon. Coefficients here that depend upon the unknown P and G. So it is a quasilinear elliptic energy. What we're going to do is we're going to carry out a Ginsburg-Lando type analysis for sequences and minimizers for that problem. It has a rather complicated first term, and the second term is embalmed. And what we are going to prove is that for a sequence, the P epsilon, G epsilon will go to a P bar, G bar. Go to a p bar, g bar. Like we said, the p bar is going to be planar and it is going to have constant length. This length is going to be s over root 2, so p star is equal to 1. g bar is going to be this constant. So this guy, away from these points, is living on that red circle. The degree of p star is going to be 1 or minus 1, depending upon the sine of d bar. And if I want to get back to my direct. And if I want to get back to my director problem, what we do is we equate this limiting form. I plugged in the p-star here, and I plugged in the information about the uniacal expression. And if you equate coefficients, you get this, if you want to use complex terminology. It says that P, this complex element here, is going to have a square root, N1 plus IN2. And if I take N1 and IN2 away from the singularity and put a cut into it. From a singularity and put a cut into it, I am going to have my directive field. And this n, if I go around a ball above one simple point, it's going to have degree plus or minus one half. So this is giving me my plus or minus one half defects. So as Patty was talking about, we use Struve's approach. There are a lot of approaches to analyze Ginsburg-Landmell problems. One by Girard, the early years, one. Gerard, the earliest one by BBH, one by Eton Sandier, and there was Struve who did work very early on. It's a compliment to say that his approach is rather stripped down and simple, in a sense, so that if you have something that is more complicated than gradient squared for your Dirichlet energy, or you have complications with the number of degrees that you're going to have, it is something that you have. Degrees that you're going to have, it is something you can work with. So, and that's what we appreciate in it, and that's why we use it. What we prove is the following thing for the sequence. So this is just a restatement of what we did for Q's. The P sub epsilon, G sub epsilon, these U sub epsilon, are going to be going to be valued in the open set M0. More than that, what it means, of course, is they're going to be a positive distance away from. Positive distance away from m0. And we proved that they are continuous for each epsilon. So, what this implies for this type of problem, if you take such a quasilinear energy and you have bounded continuous solutions that are minimizers for the energy, and especially since now that the target is staying away from the boundary, this is a rather nice term, they're going to be smooth. It goes back to Maury. And we get an Euler-Lagrange equation. We get an Euler-Lagrange equation. This time we get a full Euler-Lagrange equation because it's just three equations. There's no more redundancy in the coefficients like there was for the Q tensor. So the information about staying away from the boundary and being continuous was some of our work in 2016 and 2022. So, for this type of energy, we proved these types of qualitative properties that come from this and the smoothness. And the smoothness. But what we prove is for the problem epsilon equaling 1. And epsilon equals 1 just gives you qualitative features. Here in this paper, one of our first steps is to quantify the information. That is, what happens when you put an epsilon here and what happens to this qualitative information in a quantitative way? And what we get is: these are the first two lines again: there are constants. Lines again. There are constants C1 and C2 that are independent of epsilon. So that if epsilon is sufficiently small, the first line tells me that I'm staying a uniform distance away from M0. So the bulk energy, at least as far as these solutions are concerned, is well behaved. And this is an optimal growth estimate for the Ginsburg-Landau. That is the type of gradient dog one would expect if you're going to do a Ginsburg-Landau problem. So these two. Landout problem. So these two pieces of information together tell us, in our terminology, you've got a well-behaved problem for a Ginsburg Landau type analysis. These are not going to give you trouble, and you have the right gradient bottoms. The next step for Scuba's approach is to find a collection of annuli. And that is a very elegant thing. And what you can do for each epsilon is to find a family. A family of anguli that will be disjoint. They make up k such that in some way that we want to express and exploit most of the mass of this integral, this integral just blows up. It blows up like log epsilon. You can start off with that type of idea. Most of its mass is going to be supported on K, that is on the union of D sets. And more importantly, the number of The number of elements, the number of annuli that I have to worry about will have an upper bound. Card k will be bounded uniformly in epsilon. So the first piece of information that we're picking up from this, because these are disjoint, is the energy, remember all my terms are non-negative for this particular function, is bounded by the energy on the annuli because they're disjoint. That's the first thing. The next thing that comes from this construction is From this construction, is that on these annuli, there's more than just this information. On the annuli, my functions p sub epsilon and g sub epsilon are going to live relatively close to the ground state. So the p sub epsilon in modulus is going to be close to s over 2, and the g sub epsilon is going to be close to s over 6. So what I'm saying is I don't know where they're living on the little torus. A little torus around the red circle where the boundary values are for the most part, but they're going to be close. And now that's that's, since that's true, that tells me that if I look at the vector p1, p2, that is the first term, because of this condition, it's going to have a well-defined degree on each annuli. And that degree will be d sub kl. So for every radius between arsenal and lower. Lower bar and upper bar, piece of epsilon will have a given winding number or degree. It'll be the same on there. Next step. Our next step is, since we're doing an estimate, we have to figure this out. We have to get a good estimate of this term. And in order to do that, I'm going to first move to a slightly simpler problem. I'm going to take this piece of epsilon, which is very close to s over root 2 in length, and I'm going to write it. 2 in length. I'm going to write it as m times a constant. So I'm going to have m times s over root 2 is almost equal to p sub epsilon, and g sub epsilon is almost equal to s over root 6. So instead of looking at this close problem, I'm looking at this particular problem for m, and it's going to be living in the ground state. And that, once we just talked about that earlier, that energy on the annulus. That energy on the annulus is the Frank energy that we were talking about earlier. Here, N is going to have degree dK L over 2 for each R. Whereas M has degree dKL. The next thing we're going to do is we're going to take this energy and I am going to look at a minimizer, let me put a qualification. Now let me put a qualification among all functions of the form e to the i q theta. Remember, these n were planar unit vector fields on my annulum. I'm going to look at ones that are independent of r. I'm going to ask that they minimize the Frank energy amongst functions just functions of theta such that they're going to have degree d over 2. So I'm looking at those that have degree d over 2. And so once again, if you want to think about what... And so once again, if you want to think about what's going on here, is I'm taking my annulus, I'm putting a cut along the positive, let's say, X1 axis, and that's how I'm evaluating this energy. Now, if I take that type of function, it is a unit vector, a unit length function, and I plug it into this energy, you're not going to get an answer in terms of theta, you're going to get an answer, there's going to be a 1 over r coming in there. So consequently, if I do this evaluation, I'm going to get some number. I'm going to get some number a sub d, that's the d here, times log of r upper bar over r lower bar. And that a sub d is going to be the coefficient that you saw earlier, okay, when d was 1. d for me, if you're in liquid crystals, d is called the Frankie index. It's twice the winding number. So we get so for us, we get the following piece of information. The following piece of information. We take a general n, that is a planar n, unit length vector field, so that for each r, the winding number in theta is going to be d over 2. So we get that expression, and we evaluate our energy, and what we prove is it is bigger than or equal to that minimal number that came from theta times log upper bar over lower bar for that angulus. It can always be bigger than or equal that term because this function of theta that I talked about, n tilde, is not a minimizer for the whole annular problem. It doesn't have the right boundary conditions on the inner and outer radii of the annuli. So what we do is we show that it's equal to this minus a constant. Now anything's true up to a constant, but our constant here is independent of n. Independent of n and it is going to be independent of our bar and our lower bar. So it's a good constant for our purposes and our estimates. The next thing that we do is we come along and say, since we were so close to the uniaxial state, I can actually do the same type of thing up to a different constant. Okay? I'm going to get an estimate that will work for my p sub epsilon, g sub epsilon, on my n. Epsilon, G sub epsilon on my annual. What's more, we can look at the A sub D, and it isn't at all obvious why this is true, but we get a closed form to some degree for this formula A sub D. Even though it was terms evaluated through a function that's a minimizer, we have a formula for it. And that formula has properties. And one of those properties is described right here. It says a sub d for any d bigger than 1. A sub d for any d bigger than 1 is bigger than the value, let's say at 1 times d. If you want to know where this comes from or want something to fall back on, what happens when Ks equals Kb? Well, this is just gradient N squared. And for Ginsburg-Landell, this is just the function A sub B is going to be D squared times a particular constant, I guess. D squared over pi. No, pi D squared. And pi D squared is really going to satisfy this formula. Okay. Next thing we're going to do is we're going to say, well, we've got centers of these annuli. What we want to do is I want to find a sub-sequence of problems, and I want to find a set of limit points for my centers. So what that means is I want to be able to say that I can find a sub-sequence so that I look at these points. Remember, there was a Remember, there was a cardinality number of angularized, so a number of points like this. That's finite. And I can do like a diagonal argument. Now I get it so that these each converge to some point. And then I look at the points as being distinct. And all I ask for is that you give me an eta. I put an eta ball around each of these m limiting points. And they're all going to be living in there when epsilon is large enough. And every point far enough out is going to be living in some ball of radius A. So that's what I mean by limit points. Next thing, let me take these points, and like I said, they may not be unique when I went through this, but I'm going to relabel them as being unique, and I look at the distance between them. And our third step is trying to say some more information about that energy. So we take sigma less than sigma naught, and we assume epsilon is small. And we assume epsilon is small, and we can truncate the annuli so that they're going to be living in the balls B sigma of Aj. Remember, the centers here are all getting close to some Aj, depending on which one you're at. And we're going to go back to our disjoint property estimate. So we're going to have the energy on these balls is less than or equal to the energy over the annuli, and that is going to be remote. And that is going to be. Remember, we had a statement about how the a sub dkl behaved. It was just a of plus or minus one times the length of dkl. And we're going to get this type of estimate for the coefficient. The other term I sweep under the rug, it is because you have enough annuli relative to the logarithm. So that if you sum up these lengths and you take their log, you're going to get almost sigma over x. Over epsilon. Now, if you have such an estimate, what you can do is you can cook up in a pretty easy fashion a test function that I can plug in, and it's going to get the same leading order term as an upper bound. If we compare this statement with this statement here, this has got more to it than that does. And in fact, what happens is it says that if I look at the energy, minus what's going to Energy minus what's happening on the balls, that's what I've got an estimate here, that is going to be bounded by this expression here. Now, the right-hand side, there's no more epsilons. So that's just a constant. So you give me the sigma, I can bound the energy away from the balls in this fashion. And with the way the energy is built, that is going to give you, of course, a bow. And so the right hand side is independent of epsilon. hand size independent of epsilon. And we can show that the P epsilon, G epsilon are going to converge in W12. And from here we can analyze further. I was going to say one more. Go ahead, go ahead. Okay. These are coercivity conditions. And what they gave were these two conditions. So sometimes Conditions. So sometimes what you want to think about the most is what you can't prove. So what we were thinking about is the classical coercivity conditions. So these are what you'll find along this paper. So before we had one half and one, and now we've gotten one third and two thirds. So our problem is more restrictive. But what these conditions give is it gives you just the classic estimate on the On the quadratic growth of the energy, not the Euler-Lagrange equation. So that is what you have. And what you can do with this particular energy, since the fourth term is just linear in Q, you can do some very sharp estimates. And let me just write something on the board for attainable Ks and Kb. So what you can do is for our problem, we can get 1 seventh less than 7. Get 1/7 less than Ks over Kb less than 8. Whereas for the classical problem, which is here, that is going to say that Ks and Kb to be attainable is the whole thing. What I mean by attainable is you give me a ratio. Can I find a set of L to satisfy muspective conditions that capture this? Okay. I'm sure this would be quick question So how important is the polymer potential? I mean you do it with a polynomial potential? No it's to get the idea it's bound I guess if you you wait okay let me qualify that guys Guys in the back there, they took Landau Degenes and they came up with a different energy, which also will capture constants. And it is not going to degenerate in this case, and they can probably minimize this. But I believe their energy. So the issue is really with the L4. That's right. If you have no L4, you can't do anything potential. Yes, but you'll end up with an energy with. But you'll end up with an energy with unbounded coefficients. Can you do quasi-linear PBE with unbounded coefficients? Yeah, but I mean, if you have no L4, if you don't have L4, you don't have KSKBR equal. Oh. That you need the L4. So if I understand correctly, please correct me. Please connect me on wrong. We have now some free time, and there is no payment for junior participants right now, but there will be one at half past seven to nine, half 13 minutes, right? And everybody is invited to attend to that, to participate to that. Is that correct? I think that Carmen was thinking to do a panel now? No, whenever you want, yes, that's fine. No, no, no, I mean I'm just saying. Well, I will start at seven thirty. So I have to work with that. I'm not sure if then you can do it now if you want. No, no, no, no, 7:30 is perfect. But there will be fun at the 7:30. And those just do all the business at that point. So, fantastic. So, that's time for a speaker again, Rose.
