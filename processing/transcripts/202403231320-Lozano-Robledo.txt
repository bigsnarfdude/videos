Thank you. Thank you very much so much for the invitation to be here. It's really a great pleasure. I was telling the organizers that this was one of my bucket item, one of the bucket list items that I wanted to come to up on. It's so great to meet a lot of people that I haven't met before. I haven't met before, so it's great to be here. You might think that maybe I was invited because UConn sounds like Canadian territory. But I actually have known Felix for a couple years, but online, and I was hoping to get to meet him today, but unfortunately or fortunately for him, he's on his way to another great opportunity, so I'll catch him somewhere else. And so I wanted to start with this quote. Quote: How many of you know what this quote is from? Maybe if I sang it, so this quote is from King George III from the musical Hamilton. And I really like it, because I think it goes very well with the theme of this talk, because there have been a lot of advances in just like my lifetime. My lifetime, maybe a little bit more than my lifetime, there's been a huge amount of progress in the theory of color representations. And every time that something happens, I'm just perplexed that somebody was actually able to do that. And the other theme is that every time there's one of these theorems that comes up, there are theorems that open up more questions that they answer. That is immediately. Immediately, there's more math to be done once you start doing looking at those theorems. I understand this is a very wide or broad audience in number theory, so I'm going to try to also try to motivate what I'm talking about. Why are we interested in the representations? Why are we interested? At the end of the day, the talk is about torsion, point-analikic curves. So, let me start with some. So, let me start with some statement that is actually fairly silly, but it sort of motivates how I'm going to talk about everything else. So, the torsion subgroup of the complex numbers, complex numbers under addition, there's just no torsion under addition. And in fact, even if you restrict to Q, so I'll talk more about what I mean by that. What I mean by that, I'm thinking now of the complex number sort of as a P1 over the complex. It really has a model over the rational numbers. And if you look at the rationals, there is nothing interesting there. Zero. Now, if you start talking about Cross and the complex numbers under multiplication, now all of a sudden number theory has been working on this for ages. This is for ages. This is the theory of subatomic units or roots of unity. And there is just so much number theory, at the rig number theory, that one can say about that. But let me state just this sort of very trivial thing. That if you now look at what roots of unity, so torsion is always going to be the elements of finite order in my groups, what elements of finite order are in Q, then we know the answer. R in Q, then we know the answer to that is just plus or minus 1, and that is just isomorphic to Z mod 2. So that is sort of like a baby classification theorem of a torsion subgroup. And then the other one I'm going to tell you is what happens if I look at this one. So if I look at the torsion in this group and I look at the groups, In this group, and I look at well, I can restrict to Q here too. That is just Q mod Z. So there's a lot of torsion in there. But why I'm talking about these is that the elliptic curves actually fit in this pattern in that the complex numbers and the complex numbers modulus z are two out of three examples of parabolic related. Of parabolic women's surfaces. So all the parabolic women's surfaces come in three types. They are either the complex numbers or the complex numbers modulo C or the complex numbers modulo a lattice. And a lattice here, we've heard about lattices today already. So it's something generated, let's say, over the integers to z plus tau z, where tau is some complex, imaginary, quadratic, imaginary, some complex summary in that we have to plan for now. So now the question is, then what is What is the torsion in here? But I'm actually interested in this sort of like rationality question. So, what is the rational torsion in there? And what does this even mean to begin with? I'm going to try to formalize that using what the analogy I said there, that I think of the complex numbers as P1 of Q. So, this I'm going to think about it as a curve, this Green surface. Grimm surface. And but we know actually some one of the main theorems of the theory of elliptic curves, one of the first theorems that came up, the theory of elliptic curves, which is the uniformization theorem, is that these do have models over, so I can write an algebraic model for my elliptic. An algebraic model for my elliptic curve, and I can, even since I'm over the complex numbers, I can write it as a model like this. And then if there is, they are classified up to isomorphism by the J invariant. So if the J invariant of the elliptic curve is rational, then there is a model over Q. Over Q, and then this, I'm going to interpret it as in the cases when the J of, say, the lattice here is a rational number, what I would like to know is what are the possibilities for the torsion there. And that's the very first step. The year I was born was one of the Was one of the first surprises in the theory of elliptic curves, one of these theorems that was not quite expected to be proved right away. And it was a conjecture of Levi, it was sort of forgotten, the Levi conjectured it, and then Odd conjectured this and made it really popular. And Maser proved that if you have an elliptic curve over Q, Then the torsion subgroup is one of several possibilities. So it's either cyclic for n1 up to 10 or 12, escapes 11, or is bicyclic like this with Like this with M1, 2, 3, or 4. So now we have a lot more structure than sort of like what happens here. And the torsion on an elliptic curve is really, I think, a question that is sort of like a two-dimensional version of this question and may sort of prove what possibilities we have for the torsion subgroup. But of course, if you recognize that the elliptic If you recognize that the elliptic curve, or even over the complex numbers, has this shape, we know that over the algebraic closure, any, so this is the n torsion subgroup. Over the algebraic closure, we have the full torsion and the Torsion and the full torsion has that structure. So the reason why I actually got interested into this problem is to understand that part, understand like, well, I'm really just fascinated by the pictures of elliptic curves and addition and torsion points on points on torsion points on actual graphs of elliptic curves, sort of like the geometric combinations of how we have a point of. Of how maybe we have a point of order to 12, what does that look like? By the way, if you want to get anything out of this talk, is that I have very nice pictures of all torsion subgroups. So if you ever need that graph of an elliptic curve that has a point of order 12, I have very neat pictures that, you know, if you try at random, it's going to be like very thin. It's not going to fit in the page or something. So I found very nice pictures. So if you ever need one for some reason, let me know. I can give you one. You want this. In any case, I was interested to see: well, there is somewhere in the algebraic closure of any elliptic curve, in the algebraic closure, there is a point of order 11. So I wanted to see those. And then the question is, how far do I have to go? What's the smallest degree of a number field? So I get to see, starting from any elliptic curve I want, or choose an elliptic curve appropriately, so that I see a point of order 11 or order 3. I see a point of order 11 or order 13 in a small extension. If you were interested, like me, in graphs and actually seeing it, you might want a totally real field or something, a quadratic field that is real so you can actually plot it and it all shows up in the real plot of an elliptic curve. But in any case, that question led me down a rabbit hole of like how like with 15 years of working on best. 18 years of working on this or something. But so, what I want you know is the following question. So, question: What is the smallest degree D such that there is a number field? A number field of degree D and an elliptic curve over F such that the F torsion, so that the points over F over the elliptic curve, say for a prime, so let L be fixed for now. For now, and it's a prime. This is not just zero, or that or you can want, maybe you want to see all the L torsion defined over a field. Or you might want to see point of L square torsion or any combination of L power torsion. Let me give you. Let me give you some before I give you an example of that. I'm just going to go back to this example here and tell you that that question is actually sort of like the heart of algebraic number theory from this point of view, complex numbers, because if you want to now see cross torsion. Fortion L, well, that is what we call mu L, the roots of unity. And then I know that sort of like the field of definition, so if I write Q C cross torsion L, because I don't need the torsion anymore, by that I mean the smallest field of definition of that, I'm also going to call it Q of mu L. We're going to call it Q of Î¼L. And that's just a cyclotomic field. And we know that I'll take a log group of that sync atomic field. I know exactly what it is. And in particular, it's abelian. So very similar questions we want to study about that. I want to know what fields do I get, when are they galois like this one? What's the degree of such a field when I join one altosh. Field when I joined one altorship employee, is it abelian? We like abelian extensions, in particular, of course, like this is also related to the beginning of class field theory and just to prove the Kroniker-Weber theorem, that every abelian extension of Q is one of this type. So what extensions do we get when we adjoin this type of distortion instead of this type of distortion? What extensions do we get? Are they abelian? Are they not? If they are abillion, what kind, what extensions do we get? What extensions we get, or there's a lot of questions that you can sort of like use this as a roadmap to try to study what happens when it occurs. So, let me give you, I want to give you examples along the way that you can take home in your pockets. So, for example, if you want to see something new, so I just erased Maser's theory. Just erased Maser's theorem, but Maser's theorem tells me that there is no elliptic curve over Q that has full three torsion. Full three torsion would mean that the three torsion part is C mod 3 cross C mod 3. You can have a C mod 3, you can have a C mod 9, but you cannot have the full 3 torsion defined in refugee. So, what is the smallest degree where you would see the full 3 torsion? So, it happens here, for example, there's a very For example, with a very easy to remember elliptic curve, is that one where the free torsion of my elliptic curve, it turns out, is just Q of join the square root of minus 3. And it turns out, well, that is, that is what I just called Q of mu 3. It turns out that it's a cyclotomic field. So it is an abelian extension, it's a quadratic, and it's in fact abelian like the... And it's in fact a binion like the ones we were getting here. This, if you want to see it, the fleet version is generated by the point 04 and the point minus 4, 4 square root of minus 3, for example. Those are generators. If you want to see also over Q, you cannot have full 4 torsion. So where do you get something like that when you start from? When you start from this one, you get that the full fourth portion turns out to be. That's an interesting phenomenon already because it turns out that the theory of elliptic curves, the existence of what we call the vapor pairing, says that inside the full four-torn. Inside the full fortune, if the full fortion is going to be defined over this field, the fourth roots of unity have to be defined in that field. But here you actually get a head and it gets the eighth roots of unity. But in any case, it's a Willen extension, and it's actually just a pure zygotomic field. But you can actually do better than that one. Here's another example. Here, the four torsion, it turns out it's this Q adjoin I. So that is an interesting example because, as I said, the theory of elliptic work tells me that the smallest this could be is this, and it turns out it's realizing the smallest field it can possibly be. So that has to be the minimum field, the minimum degree of definition of an elliptic permereal Q, and having for torsion has to be this. In fact, even if Torsion has to be this. In fact, even if you start from a number field, if you start from a number field, you have full four torsion, you still have to have q adjoin i. So the smallest number field could be this q adjoin i, and you would have to have something like this as its shape. Okay, so those are some examples of what I'm trying to find. And okay, so Okay, so of course like the next huge step that happened in this question about like what kind of degrees am I going to need to find proportion points was another jaw-dropper of a result was Morel's theorem. So Morel Morel in 1996 proved what we call the uniform boundedness conjecture, and it says the following, that if you fix a degree, then the supremum of all the torsion subgroups, the size of the torsion subgroups, is actually bounded over all Over all the soup is over all fields of degree up to D, and all elliptic curves over one of those fields. And the bound only depends on D. So, what that means is that, for example, if I look at quadratic. If I look at quadratic fields, Maser's theorem tells me what torsion subgroups can appear over the rationals. If you go over a quadratic field, a priori, there could have been infinitely many possibilities for the torsion subgroup. And Merault tells you that no, that because D is 2 here, the largest size of a torsion subgroup of a quadratic field is bounded by something that only depends on the d equals 2. And then, of course, like I said, this is an amazing. Like I said, this is amazing that he was able to prove this, but it opens a can of warmth of what are the possibilities for the torsion subgroups over quadratic fields. Over any number field now, there's some sort of arrays to try to compute what are the possibilities for fields. And actually, we know the classification, we know Maeser's theorem now for Q, for quadratics, for QBX, and that's it. We actually we have partial information about the quartics, but we don't know the complete information yet. Know the complete information yet. P is equal to 1. What does this tell you? It tells you that over Q there is that there is only finitely many. What is B and T? Oh, so this was just he proved the existence of this pattern. Oh, I see. So it was not. That's that's a very good question because this was just very It exists the bound, yes, and 16, the largest 8 times 2. So it has to be that the largest subgroup is C mod 2 cross C mod C mod 8. So the largest portion of subgroup over Q would be 16. So we know some of the values that for 1 is 16, for 2 I don't remember exactly what. I don't remember exactly what it is. We may have it in some notes somewhere. But in any case, now this is, it tells you what, it already tells you something about, so we know V of 2, we know V of 3, but we don't know V of 4. And it's very nice, it tells you that there is going to be a finite list, but in There is going to be a finite list, but then it also tells you now: okay, so what about well, in other fields, but in particular, about my question: so if I have L PowerPoint, what degrees am I going to see an L power point? So sort of a refragment of that, so let L be a prime I can add an e-variable to my text, what is the smallest D such that there is an objective curve over a number field of a degree less than equal to d and a point. This I'm going to I'm going to write this for a point of exact order L to the N over here of exact order L to the N. And there are some bounds. So right away, actually from Morel's proof, Australia came up with some exponential bound, some exponential bound in D, and then Bound in D. And then Perin was also, so this was in 1996, and Perin and 1999, they came up with bounds, and they're both exponential. And there's a conjecture that there should be a polynomial bound for these. For this, can in fact evolve also for this. There's got to be some sort of a polynomial bound on L. I mean, no real bound on L. Okay, so in other words, also, I want to know, so if you fix L and N bigger equal to 1, what is the smallest degree of definition? Of a point of exact order L to DN over all. Well, this would be over all this is over all number fields up to a degree, but I'm also a much easier question is to start from an elliptic curve over Q and then see when I'm going to be able to go up, like in the examples that I hit here, start from an elliptic curve over Q and see how. Start from an elliptic curve over Q and see how high do you have to go before you see such a point. So, overall, elliptic curves now over Q and all points like that. And so, as I said, this I've been just working on that for just quite a few years, and the very first result. First result that I had about this, this was in 2013, is that for n equals 1 and L bigger or equal to 11, but not 13 and 37, I had separate bounds for those and for the police prime. So I'm just trying to, for the board. So it turns out that this degree is like these elements. Degree is a disease element of 1 over 2, and for some fraction, that's the best one can do. And in fact, I determined what, if n equals 1, this sort of degrees, so I determined conjecturally the degrees for n equals one. Like in here, conjecturally, because there is some conjecture I'll talk about later that we still don't know. The input here for that result is that we actually know, so this came about from the fact that we have a complete classification. In fact, in here, it is just the fact that we have a classification. The fact that we have a classification of the maximal subgroups of GL2FL. And why that matters is because of the Galois representations. So much of this information of like what is the field of definition of a torsion point or the entire torsion. Point or the entire torsion. It's better understood through the theory of log representations. So let me introduce those. So we do have that if you have an elliptic curve over Q and you have, say, an L to D and torsion, there's an action of that law. So, and you can write that instead as I'm going to write a As I'm going to write it like this, as a Gabois representation, this is the absolute Gabois group. So for every element of the Gabois group, what it gives me is an automorphism of the L torsion. And then this in turn, I said that is two copies of Z mod L. N, so this is isomorphic to Z mod, sorry, to G L. To G L. The automotive will be G L of Q mod Q Z modulo L to the N. And such that the image, the image, if you think what is the kernel, the kernel is going to be automorphisms that actually fix every single point. If you fix a point, it fix every x and y coordinate. So the image of representation that is isomorphic to. Representation that is isomorphic to the Galois group of the field of definition, which is what I want to get at. Just in the case of the bridge of unity, we know what this is. For the case of elliptic curves, these Galois representations, the images, tell me exactly what these Galois groups are. And knowing what the possible images are Possible images can be subgroups of GL2FFL, you can come up with bounds of that sort. There is more the water representations one can define. So we can also take what we call the TAGE module. It's a package, reverse limit of L to the N torsion. And we also have a natural gamma in there. Or we can do There, or we can do them more is just compute the entire tape module, which is the ideal tape module. So, if I do an inverse limit now over all n, say, like that, then that packages all the torsion. And the loai acts on those, and I have GQ gives me this is. gives me this is isomorphic to two copies of ZL. This will be isomorphic to two copies of C hat. If it wasn't a winter conference, I usually have a hat with me for this type of occasion, a hat that has a Z on it. It's my Z hat. But in any case, so it has two copies of Z hat. So this representation. So, this representation on the tape module gives me a representation to 2 into GLTOZ hat. If I restrict to the elatic component of Z hat, Z hat is a product of all eladics, then I get a map down to here. And it turns out that this one corresponds to the action of the Corresponds to the action of that law on the L T and torsion, oops, on the tape module. Okay. Let me never write. Nobody writes it like that. Yes. And then if I reduce modulo L to the N, then I get a map to Z mod L to the N Z, and this is the one. That I discussed here. So, if we understood any of these, it gives you information about the fields of definition of an L2D and torsion, if I know this, of the entire teeth module, the lydic teeth module, or of any torsion point at all. That's the goal, the ultimate goal is to understand those. But first, people started by understanding these. Understanding these. And it turns out that the analytics are such that you're better off understanding that one and that one, and then deduce information about this one that tries to understand this one directly. There's so little structure here, but once you put it here, all of a sudden you get so much. If we go back to the past, before I was born, that was, Sarah. In 1972 proved that if E does not have complex multiplication, that means that the endomorphism ring or Q bar endomorphism ring, the geometric endomorphism ring, that is just the integers. So there's no extra endomorphism. So there's no extra endomorphisms. Then this is what's called the open image theorem because it says that the image of Rhoe is open. There's a topology that you can put in there, and it's an open image. And in particular, that means it's a finite index image, so it's a very large image always. If it doesn't have a CM, Always, if it doesn't have the CM. And that also says that implies if this is finite index in here, then for all but finitely many L's, this one has to be surjective, which means that these ones are all surjective too, and those are some very large images, but I can easily translate that into automorphisms and check what is the general generically, what is the field of definition, or what's the degree of the. The field of definition, or what's the degree of the field of definition of one L-tube toshomp. But the problem is that that is not always the case. The index here is not one. In fact, SARE proves that the index is always two. So that there is some sort of entanglement between hellatic images. But the problem is that even though these ones are subjective. These ones are subjective for all but finitely many times L. We do not know what happens if they all go finitely many times. What are the possibilities in here? And we worked, you know, under some assumptions. Ser described what sort of images you can have in his paper. It's a huge, so that paper is so rich that you can keep going back to it and discover more things in that paper. But the next huge step. The next huge step, which was also like, this blew my mind away, was that in 2014, Jeremy Rouse and David Surik Rouse announced that they were able to compute all the possibilities for non-CM elliptic curves of the Of the two alleg elliptic curves. So they prove that there are exactly 1208 possibilities up to conjugation for the image of chiodic images for non-CM elliptic curves. The analytic curves. And that was published right as I was going into a sabbatical. So I actually, I was going to Spain for my sabbatical. I literally printed the paper and I showed up first day to, I was going to work with this collaborator in Spain, Enrique Valfaro Jimenez, and I gave him a copy of the paper. Like, this is just an amazing paper. It's going to be Paper, there's going to be a lot of consequences. This is something that my advisor, my mentor, also pushed Ravi Ramakrishna. He had this motto that if it is a great theorem, it's because it has to have great consequences. So I thought this was it. This is what I always refer to it as an annals paper that is not in the annals. I think this was fantastic. Not just because of the result, which is amazing, because they had the vision that this could be done. How do you know that an How do you know that an image happens or doesn't happen? There are these things that are called modular curves, and you have to find all the rational points on these modular curves for one image. For the truth that, what is the complete classification of all the images? You have to find all the rational points on all the sorts of modular curves. I thought it would be absolutely impossible. I would not even have dreamed to try to do this, but they did it. So I went to Spain, and right away we proved the To Spain, and right away we proved a whole bunch of things. So, for example, we proved that, so let N be the variable to 4 and E non-Chi-anoltic curve. Then, remember, I was trying to get at the field of definition. Field of definition of 2 to the n of L to the n torsion points for L equals to Q. If I know all the Qadic representations, I should be able to know everything about that. And what we showed is that there is a bound, and in fact, it's a divisibility bound. This is always divisible by that number, and it's that's possible. By the way, as I said, if it was a whole image, then you would have an upper bound. So, you also know that in this case, if the image was as large as it can be, this has to divide three times 2 to the 2n minus 2. So that's the largest it can be. The smallest it can be is exactly that. And they said it's best possible. Before you erase this, that L minus 1 over 2, I mean, is this a good bound or is this a close bound? Good bond, or is this a closed bound or a constant bound? It is a good bound for because for smaller primes, you actually need that bound. So when there is an isogeny, that bound is precise. And then as it grows, you expect that this share uniformity, you expect that there is no more, that everything is rejective, or L bigger than 37, modulo L. Modulo L, that you have the whole GL, and then that bound is not good anymore. But if, though, so that bound, if there were more images that are these normalizer carton images, then it wouldn't be so bad of a bound. Okay, so as I said, this is best possible, and it's best possible in the best possible way because all the best. Because all the best bounds happen in one elliptic curve. So if you take this elliptic curve, then for that elliptic curve and for each n bigger or equal to 4, there is a point of order 2 to the n on E such that the The field of definition has exactly Q to the Qn minus 7 as the degree. When did I start? You have exactly 10 minutes. 10 minutes. Okay, so that is one such example of what we can do. And in fact, I'm not going to go through all of it, but we can actually do the same kind of thing. Do the same kind of thing for any two primary components. So, if you tell me what is the smallest field of definition of a subgroup that is Z mod 2 plus Z mod 32, and I can tell you exactly what are the best bounds in that case also. But that was just for 2 because Zurich Brown, Zuri Muraus, gave us exactly what happens for L equals to Q. So, what happens? This again opens, it opens the door. It opened the door on Dura's box because now, first of all, they just did it for non-CM elliptic curves. So, right away, I thought, like, well, I gotta classify what happens for the 2adic images for CM elliptic curves, and also what happens for other L. I started in the CM, I started working right away in the CM case, they started working right away on the L case, and this is what happened is that. Happened is that I was able to classify. It turns out that once you, the theory of elliptic curves with complex multiplication is so rich that once you start trying to do L equals 2, everything follows. So I ended up proving a full classification of the ELATIC images. Images or CM elliptic curves over number fields, so not just over Q, I was able to classify all the possibilities for the images, for any number field, but not for any number field, for the minimal definition of an elliptic curve like that. So if the CM was By O, then those have a J in their end. So the minimal field definition is what we call Q adjoin J. So I was able to complete the classification there and then complete what we had here also in our own theorem. For Nazi elliptic curves, you can prove that. So this is more recent. More recent. So if B is Cm and N is at least 5, then it turns out that 2 to the n divides the field of definition of 2 to the n torsion point. And that is best. Point and that is best possible. This happens like for that elliptic curve, it happens for in the LM FDB label, it happens for 49A2. Okay, so we can do, we were able to do the two, but this is for any L, so we can give formulas like that for any L for the CMKs. And in fact, what I proved, this classification. What I proved, this classification is that there is, I can tell you exactly how many images, how many possibilities are there over Q for every L. So this classification, what it actually says, so this is the number of possible images up to conjugation, and it tells you that. And it tells you that so for two, it turns out there are 28 in addition to those. For three, there are 17. For seven, eleven, forty-three are 67. There are six of them, and I can tell you the rest, but that's just sorry to move on. And that was in 2000. 15 When I did that classification, then this is more recent work that went in. And then in 2021, again, Rouse, Zurich, Brown, with the help of Sutherland, they've actually completed. So now there is a theorem by Rouse, Zurich Brown, and Andrew Sutherland in 2021. In 2021, there is a classification of images of the analytic representations. And it tells you that, for example, so how many possibilities are there? For 2, we know there's 1208. For 3, there is 47. For 5, there is 25. For five, there is twenty-five, for seven, there is seventeen, for nine, there is eight, for thirteen, there is twelve, and so on. Except that there is an asterisk here in that they need to assume a conjecture, there's something called the elatic conjecture. So, there is, in addition, there are some like seven images that we don't know yet if they appear. So, there's possibly one more there. So there's possibly one more there, one more here, three more here, one more here. But it turns out that there was a plus one here. That was a paper in the annals that removed that plus one. That's a very well-known work now by Professor Dogra, Mueller, Twitman, and Wonk, where they proved what's called a What's called the curved modular curve has no rational points. So that is gone, and now there is a lot of work in trying to drop that plus one, that plus one. I know there's people working on this. Thank you. So what does that tell you about my original problem, sort of like very concretely, about fields of definition? It tells you, for example, that so if you have a non-CM elliptic curve. Have a non-CM elliptic curve. It tells you that the field of definition of points of order three, for example, is at least the degree of that field is at least 3 to the 2n minus 4, for example. So now you can go through those images and just compute exactly what are the fields of the field. Compute exactly what are the fields of definition of all such things. Now, if you remember the table I had here, or the graph I had here of images, the gold standard would be actually compute not just the eladic ones, but compute the idelic ones. And it turns out that now there is in 2022, David Zegwina At Cornell, Zwina in 2022 announced that there is a classification and an algorithm of idyllic images in the non-CM case. And that's uh that's a huge step. That's a huge step because now we can compute, even on an elliptic curve, we can compute what the idyllic image is. And that tells you not just what is the field of definition of a three-power point, but what's the field of definition of a six-torsian following, twelve torsion following, 48. You can now do a lot more like that. And of course, like, well, I have a graduate student and David Sewina posted that. And guess what I asked him to do for his PhD thesis? For his PhD thesis, do the CM case. So, one of my students, who will be in a job market near you next year, Bingham New York, has now proved an algorithm to compute the idyllic image. Of an elliptic curve with Cm. For now, when J is not 0, 17, 28, he has ideas of, or he can do most of the cases when J is 0, 17, 28, but those are proving to be quite a lot more difficult. And that has some huge applications. I was like, two weeks ago, I was at a conference, a workshop for the LMFDB, where there is going to be a new section. There is going to be a new section in the LMFDB for modular curves. And this algorithm has been very useful to compute what points on those modular curves come from J invariants that have complex multiplication, which is something tricky to do to compute any points on modular curves, but using that we can at least guarantee where are the CM points and exactly what twist of an elliptic curve has exactly that in its. Of an elliptic curve has exactly that information. I'll finish off, though, with one more thing, which is that another question that we answered using the original paper by Zeric Brown and Rouse, and they said one of the other consequences that Enrique and I proved in 2015 was that if you have an electric curve, Was that if you have an electric curve and the Galois group of the entire division field is abelian, then it turns out that n is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8. That question was open over any number field, and you surf a number field, and you try to prove when such things. When such a thing is abelian, that is open over a number of fields, we were able to prove it for elliptic curves over Q and parameterize the elliptic curves of this property. And another one of my students, using also all we know now about CM elliptic curves, if E is an elliptic curve over the field of definition of a J invariant with Cm, so a Cm elliptic curve. So a CM elliptic curve, Asimina Hamakiotes, who will also be in the market next year, has proved when do you have this extension. So you have to start from that field and then a joint end portion. And if you have that this extension is abelian, Is abelian, it turns out that n is 2, 3, or 4, and that's all. There's no other examples in the CN world of such phenomena. And it turns out that that has applications to classifications of Brower grooves and other things like that. But in any case, those are some of the things that are next is trying to. Trying to understand now that now that we have some sort of understanding of what the Delic image is for elliptic curves, we can answer a lot of questions about the structure of torsion points on elliptic curves. Okay, any questions from the panel?
