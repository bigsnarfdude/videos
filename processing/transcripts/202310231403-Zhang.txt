I don't know what you guys are thinking. So I'm going to tell you about a few things we're doing, two projects we're doing. One is a Moray continuum model, which is basically a two-dimensional electron gas, but with the Moray potential. And then the interacting feature sort of dominates model. And then also we have an ongoing effort to prove. Ongoing effort to parametrize a density functional for the two-dimensional system that knows about the gates, in particular in this case, two gates, so which could help with faster sort of scanning materials and so on. So most of these, the workforce behind it, the methods we use, is quantum monocolo of a couple different flavors, diffusion monocolo and auxiliary fuel quantum colour. Feel the fundamental colour. So, as we go along, we'll take a peek inside these two boxes and we'll just have a little feel, which I think would be useful for creating some synergy. So, the Moray systems obviously are tremendously exciting. They offer many possibilities. Essentially, the ability to dial up or down the electron interactions in a very controlled way, very clean environments. So, more accurate. So, more accurate, more predictive computations would be useful to create better energy with theory, with experiment, and hopefully accelerate progress. So, of course, people already mentioned, you know, we have many, many challenging sort of topics in condensed manner, and these systems offer the hope to sort of have a different angle to look at this problem. And this is the corporate, I think, famous or infamous corporate. Could create phase diagram key version of it. Even the simplest many-body models are very hard. For example, this is just the simplest square lattice Hubbert model, and it's sort of defined this for many, many years. Although I would say there is in progress, this is a paper advertising that put out on public model FaceTime rather than FaceTime. So the more So, the Moray experiments provide us the opportunity to realize some really clean models, which I think are within the reach of fairly accurate many-body simulations. Not exact, but I think many-body simulations that can really control insight. So, basically, we're dealing with a Hamiltonian that has a one-body term and a two-body term. That has a one-body term and a two-body term, right? These different engineering, these different pieces lead to novel phases. In these systems, the Bouret systems, the one-body Hamiltonian is challenging to model in characteristics, and we've seen quite a bit of discussions of exactly how to write down the one-body Hamiltonian, including these massive ab initial calculations. This is hard to determine, and it's tricky, and I think there's really a lot of opportunities to do this. A lot of opportunities to do this. But once you write this down, it's easy to handle. The two-body interaction, on the other hand, is easy to specify. Some models I'll look at, just cool them, and then maybe a screen, but they're challenging to treat. Quantum colour offers some opportunities for systematic computations, in particular, not perturbative concrete correlations. Contribute correlations. And these things scale very gracefully in system size. So you have the opportunity to try to approach thermodynamic limit, get rid of different size effects. I don't have a good feel for what this sort of effect is for the systems we're thinking about. But for example, in the Hubbard model, this is one of the major, very non-fashionable but major factors into trouble with the phase diagram, which is the size. We'll have to get into some of the things. So, by looking into the two boxes, just a little bit, taking a peek, I want to sort of give you a sense of the advances we've had for the method and limitations and understand which I think will help synergy I was talking about. So, in this sense, this connects to both the mathematics and the physics aspects of the workshop in the title, right? In the physics, we're hoping to use this as a tool to probe physics, but mathematics, because it's a kind of But mathematics, because it's a computational algorithm that, you know, I think useful mathematics input can help advance methods, both from an algorithm level and also from computational efficiency and so on. So I'm going to move on to the first part, which is a Moray continuum model that we're trying to look at. So this is basically the two-dimensional electron gas in a Moray potential. The potential looks like that, for example, when you have this degree, 26 degrees, as a triangular lattice. It's a triangular lattice. And so the Hamiltonian looks like that. You have effective mass, the electrons will holes. And then there's a potential whose strength, more rate potential, is controlled by Vm. And then the electron-electron interaction, we're looking at the bare electron interaction just with the epsilon control construct. And the Mohr potential looks like that. By changing these, you can sort of engineer different types of potentials. So this Hamilton. So, this Hamiltonian, you can write it in a reduced form like that, where you've taken an effective sort of atomic, if you want, a Hautri unit. And then lambda, which is Vm over the kinetic energy scale, W, sometimes referred to, Vm over W, in a plus, you can see that sometimes. But basically, this lambda controls is the effective parameter for the moment potential. And then electrons are going around. Electron-electron interaction. Rs is a length scale. Basically, sort of, you can think of it as the average spacing between two electrons. Each electron has a circle that it sets up. The radar is RS. So we have this archive paper. This is the only thing that's published in what I'm talking about. This is the paper fitting one for this particular letter. This is done by Kyle Postdock for the Kyle Pig. Or the colour large error. So, this Hamiltonian, first we take a step back. If we set lambda to zero, it's just the uniform two-dimensional gas. And that, many of you know well, has what we think, a simple phase diagram, as a ground state phase diagram, as a function of Rs, which again remember, think of as the average spacing between two electrons. So it's a paramagnetic fluid. So it's a paramagnetic fluid at up to surprisingly large Rs of 31. So this will be like in atomic unit 31 or so. It's a paramagnetic fluid. And then it turns into an anti-ferromagnetic crystal insulator. So the transition is about 30 here. And then when you make RS bigger, it goes ferromagnetic. And eventually these. Used to Japan. And that's the classical, strongly interacting language, but classical just how the word goes localized. So this is basically the simplest system computation with two terms, right? The kinetic energy and the interaction energy. The kinetic energy, the reason that counterintuitively, when the electrons are further apart, subtle, counterintuitively, it's a more strongly interacting system is because eventually a large RS, the Coulomb interaction, Large RS, the Coulomb interaction, which scales as one over distance, overtakes the quantum, the zero-point motion, which scales as one over distance squared. So it wins. This is the strong interaction limit. And that's for local detail. But even this system, I guess, there's a recent paper out of Park's group where the experiment, sorry, this is inverted for my phase diagram. So this plots density, but the top shows you. But the top shows you RS. So going this way, you're supposed to read that way. But you can see that's temperature, but the measured phase diagram sort of says, you know, up to about 30 or so, it goes into a lignum crystal. And so this part, it's not distinguishing these. So to the right, exterminally, it's agreeing with that. And far to the sort of here, it's also agreeing. So this says. Also in green, so this says below 17 or so. It's a Fermili. But Experimentali seems to be arguing there's some sort of a coexistence and possibly there's another phase of something. We did some calculations here. We don't know what the phase is. Basically, so even this, there's some interesting issues about whether there's an intermediate correlated face. I ask for that. Okay, so what's experiment, what's computation, and that. This is all experiment. That's all experiment. This is an experimental phase diagram. We were only sort of just checking to see that the computation is compatible with this data and back up this region. So I'm going to peek inside the first box, diffusion monicolo, before we go back to look at results of the one-ray electron gas in Mo-ray. Electron gas signal rate. So, diffusion monocolor, if you think about a time, this is a fake time, imaginary time evolution equation like that, that's your Hamiltonian you're interested in, then you can, I mean, partial differential equation, you can see that this is a solution. If you take some initial state, and it's e to the minus tau h. But for this solution, if you take tau to infinity, it'll drive to the ground state of the Hamiltonian, provided that this initial. Provided that this initial state is not orthogonal to the nuts. So that's the basic principle of diffusion Monica. This is the Hamiltonian we're dealing with. And you can, so if you look at this, so minus d dt is equal to h, h has this form, one half grad squared. If you didn't have anything else, that's a classical equation, diffusion equation. So you would imagine that the solution would just be particles diffusing around brand new motion. A brand new motion. So the kinetic energy term contributes to diffusion. But if you're dealing with electron configurations, then these things are easy. They're just diagonal. So their birth, any type of V, whether it's interaction or external potential, as long as it's a local external potential, it just causes a birth-death process. In other words, you could have a classical system which is evolving under this equation d dt. Now it lives in many dimensions, right? You have all the particles. You have all the particles, think of that as one classical particle. DDT, and then you have diffusion, and then it experiences some potential. The potential is going to cause it to grow, to have children, or to die. So this is basically diffusion monocolor. So here's, I'm too lazy to draw triangle lattice potential again, so I've just stole this from David Serber because he's plotting old. But anyway, think of every blob as a triangle. Of every blob as the triangle as the bottom of the potential, there's a particle electron there, mu is one, just for simplicity. So electron is sort of living at the bottom of the potential. And as you go through this process, imagine, so a classical particle would be the composite of all these particles. You take a picture of the whole system. And this whole thing is a multi-dimensional vector of positions. Under this, it'll diffuse, the particle will move a little. And under this, this entire snapshot, this This entire snapshot, this classical particle, could die. So imagine carrying out many, many copies of this quantum, many copies of this as a contribution to the wave function. Some of them, because these things, the configurations, electrons, for example, get too close, the repulsion is too strong, that configuration dies out. Some of them sit at the right position, they'll have chova. So eventually this converges to some representation of the gas state. So if you have a deep Moray potential, you can imagine the electrons and if this You can imagine the electrons with this sort of circle around at the bottom, which you can true. A metal might look something like this, right? The electrons will have to meet the first sort of values that go around, and you see a density spreads out. So I didn't, so I told this to you as a classical simulation. That sounds really fantastic to solve a quantum mechanical problem by a classical simulation. There's a problem. These are quantum mechanical, they do exchange. When exchange happens to the electrons, When exchange happens to the electrons of like spin, does this distribution has to be negative, that has to change sine. So that's commonly known as the sine problem. It's caused from exchange between particles. It's milder, this problem, for deep flory potential or very strong interaction because exchange is rare. You apply the fixed node approximation, which guesses how when the two configurations sort of exchange, make an exchange. Fixed change, make a fixed change. Now, it's not a local. Don't think about fixed node as drawing zeros in this configuration space. That's not what it does. It's a mini-dimensional space. It only tells, like, if I have two electrons, they're doing this. They're innocent, right? This can go to another Morray bottom. There's no problem. It's eventually when they exchange, I detect that that's violating my node condition in my style. So, in this limit, it's quite accurate. So, diffusion Monaco in this algorithm is very. In this algorithm, it is variational. In other words, one mode of using it is it can judge a wave function nonsense. So, for example, you think of an order that you think, write down a variational wave function. You can use that to do fixed node and ask, is the energy higher or lower than a different order? And that's an unbiased judge in that is variation. So, you know, you can, we, the calculations I'm about to show you have a fairly sophisticated variational functional form. Variational functional form and backflows and stuff to deal with the moments. But you can do more fancy things, machine learning functions, etc. Okay, so back to this system. This is sort of the result. As a function of lambda, this is the strength of the Moray potential stronger, zero. So this is the electron gas. And that's Rs. Rs goes, so this is that. Remember, the bigger crystal without the Moray potential, Vigner crystal without the Mori potential, the bigger crystal transition would be somewhere here, right at 30. So this is kind of that region. So the phase diagram is not super exciting. We have a paramagnetic metal and a 120-degree nail insulator. And the boundary is sort of mapped out by scan. So there is a metal to insulator transition. And if you're sitting here in the magnetic, in the metallic phase, this is sort of its density. This is sort of its density. Remember the triangular lattice, it sits there as a density. And these are some blind cuts. So this is a Moray potential. It goes like something like this, ABC, A or something. So this is the Moray potential. You can see where it traces on this line. And this is showing the charge density, and the purple line, this line, is that dot. Density varies. How do you decide if it's If it's an insulator or not. Yeah, so we compute gaps and stuff. Okay, for different particles. So, and this is the spin density, and it's zero. There's no spin here, parameter. So, this is that phase, the insulating phase, and you can see the spins now in two different directions, X and Y direction spins. You can see how they trace. Things you can see how they trace, so you have this 120-degree pattern. And the density, of course, is much more changing much more. So, this is the insulating phase, the red curve. So, the crystal structure, you're building it into the lambda function? I understand you're doing it. The crystal, yeah, it's in here. You're building it in there. Yeah, it's a Moray potential. If you tune the lambda to the so right now the potential we're dealing with corresponds to 26 degrees, it's a triangle. To 26 degrees, it's a triangle nice. Oh, the transition is abrupt in that if you do a if you zoom into the scan here, you can see that it goes, oh, sorry. So basically as you go up, s so the density is one pattern and suddenly it jumps to the other, right as you scan very closely this potential, increasing potential. Closely in this potential, increasing potential. Numerical way of trying to detect an order. The moment of distribution here is very similar to the electron gas, and you're going to see that here. So this is the paramagnetic, which corresponds to this. That dot corresponds to this purple line. And right behind it, there's a green line that says two-dimensional electron density. You can't see the difference. But the bottom line is that. Difference. But the bottom plots their difference, the paramagnetic momentum distribution minus the two-dimensional electron gas. You can see that there's some, it's a small difference. But there's a difference, and in particular, it knows about the underlying crystal structure, the changes different. And this is the insulating phase. Now you can see the structures there, the momentum distribution. And that's this, the insulating curve. Curve. Okay, so what about How Tree-Fock? So here's maybe one example of correlation effect. How Tree-Fock overestimates the order a lot. This is the same phase diagram plotted on the same scale, almost the same scale. You can see Hartree-Fock thinks there's a paramagnetic phase here, and then it goes into a stripe phase, which manybody calculations say loses narrowly to the 120-degree male order I showed you. We may order a show to you. And then it says it's fairly bad. And this is sort of, I think it's got that code. And the Hawthorne Fog calculation is done correctly. This is our result. And there's green dots here, which are from Al. And the two are right on top of each other, this biggest value. Exact diagonalization, which is not surprising, because of the bases, it's biased. So if you did exact diagonalization on small, this is, I think, also Alpin's data. This is, I think, also Alice data. That's these darker green dots. And at this limit, the basis is good enough. When you diagonalize it, it's quite accurate. And then as you go to larger, the most common acting you would need to take a local basis to get the answer correct. So it stops there. LDA is wrong. If you did LDA calculation, it predicts these two phases okay, but it tells you into the Phase is okay, but it tells you that there's an intermediate metallic AFM phase, which gets taken up by correlation. Interestingly, we hacked a chemist like this. I think for some of the physics audience, it doesn't mean anything. There's a hybrid functional, which is very, very popular in chemistry. If you hack a hybrid functional with 50% exchange, so the way there are typically hybrid functionals are done, is basically to say, well, how to talk overestimates. Overestimates order too much, and LDA sometimes doesn't know about exchange, so make a combination. And this mixing percentage is the magic sauce. In chemistry, it's typically 30-something percent. But it turns out, if you do a 50%, this is pretty accurate for this system. For what that's worth. The reason we're saying this ties to the third part, which is, of course, these many-byte calculations take a lot of human effort and time. Effort and time. The LDA calculations are built into many softwares push buttons. So if you can use that as an initial scan, you know, for interesting things, that's very useful. So here you have the things that I would compare too. But if you don't, how would you get that information? So that's why I'm saying you hope that this has some universality to it. It doesn't in chemistry. In chemistry, what people have done is, well, a certain class of materials, we know that. Well, certain class of materials will know this functional works pretty well. You should never trust that completely, right? But it can be a first scan. If you're scanning a lot of materials, it can tell you, well, these are probably promising, and then you can hit it with a bigger method. It's not elegant, but these many button calculations are expensive. The periodic potential is deep enough. I assume it's a the Hubbard model. So the Hubbard model will be at least yeah in some of these the Hubbert model I think will be so here it's not so this range some of these are quite the some of this the Hubbert model will be off we didn't do a detailed well actually this is kind of a reflection of the Hubbard model right it's a it's taken as a basis but you know there are limits where it won't be because there's a long range cooling here we're not even putting screening Cool. Here we're not even putting screening. So, tooling is one of our R. Oh, I see. So, the thing: the deviation from the upper model comes from the long-range coulomb catch, not from bands. It could also be from, so it depends on how deep the potential is, since we're scanning this range. I mean, this is electron gas, right? So, on this axis, the Hubble model certainly is off. So, as you go up, I think some of these, it'll be reasonable. That's the depth of the potential? That's the depth of the potential of the west. This is going deeper. But this continuum Mohray system, is there any non-trivial limit where the heart result is exact? There's no, well the limit you're talking about, you know, also the exact is when you go, keep going that way, to infinite RS, where it goes to a classical solo or an infinite degenerate set of classical solutions that localize the electron. But then the Hartree-Fog, according to But then the hard to file, according to the leftmost figure, would be completed. According to, right, so with the Moray potential, I think also with reasonably deep Moray potential, the Hartrofo, large RS could be right too. But since we're talking about only, this is not very large RS, it makes a mistake. We don't know, so the space diagram cuts off here. You can ask the question: if I go to 100, RS of 100, what is the state? I mean, these things might merge in there. I mean, these things might merge in them. I don't know. So, very large, you think the PM metal is both here again? No, no. Very large. Sorry. So, Hartree Fox says, so Hartree Fox says this is ferrocet here. But according to the QMC calculation, it should always be just. Oh, you don't know. We don't know, right? Because this line eventually can do. So we do know on this line at RS of 31, there's a duct. It goes into a crystal. But what goes wrong with the usual positive definite argument? So let's say I'm in the limit where I have well-isolated bands. And so I could write down the Hamilton project to that band as some Coulomb interaction with some form factors. Looks positive definite. The ferromagnetic state projected to that band is certainly a nigga state. And I can say it. Yes. But so I wonder what goes wrong with the... This is still correct, right? So you'll have a lot of different streams. Yeah. So Hartree Fox says it's ferromagnetic here, way too early. But if you went too large, it could still run. It's never on. So you will have a lot of. But s so you will have a lot of degenerate space. So if you take everything to zero and you take the upper limit, you have to get the manifold of you know you don't find anything special for integer fillings. This is only the this is one that can measure it. It's a simple. We've done all of the subjects. I'm confused, but the y-axis is carrier density. So you're changing carrier density, you're also changing the y-axis. Sorry. Also changing the y-axis, sorry, the y-axis on the y-axis. Right, RS. Right, so it's a scan of on the upper x-axis. That's this is just converting. So RS is the particle spacing. You can also convert it to a carrier. So you change the carriage density. So you change the carrier density, you change the MORED period at the same time. So this is fixed at mu equal one. So it's a model. It just can measure it. So as I change the carrier density, I have to make the more independent, you know, scale. You know, scale. So, okay, so this is a new, this is ongoing, but we do 60 degrees rule, which is a honeycomb on this, and Paul holding the same number of electrons. So, effectively, this is a half, V over half. This has a somewhat more interesting phase diagram, apparently. There's a paramagnetic metal here, but yeah, so this is the scale is a little bit longer, right? Flushing the bignum crystal. Vignal crystal limit, which will be given somewhere. Paramagnetic metal, and then there is a ferromagnetic battle. And these are absolute ground state, right? So this is, there's a transition. The claim is that it goes from balmagnetic or paramagnetic into ferromagnetic. And then there's a ferrometric and so on. And the density sort of looks like that, where you see this type, this rect. See this type, this recognized, so this has the honeycomb symmetry, but these the particles were half filled, so they take every other site to become a fill. Do you get the route point at mu equal one in this case without any interaction? So we haven't done the mu equal one many value calculations without any interaction. We just get a graph in this version in this case. I think that is correct, yeah. This is kind of honey graph. Correct, yeah. This is a honeycomb mass. So these two, so from the densities of what I'm plotting, it's electron density, right? This is paramagnetic and that's ferromagnetic. They look almost the same. They're not the same. This clearly is different to the insulator. They're not the same. If you look at the momentum distribution, this is a circular thing that looks like the electron gas. This knows about the symmetry much better. I have cuts. I have cuts, but the cuts will show you that these are metallic, there's a vermin surface, and this is not as solid for the time. Okay, so for this transition, recall that the question of the Hubbard model was the honeycomb lattice spillus fermia. So assuming that we know it's already, as you imagine, sort of going through like this, the potential. Like this, making the potential deeper, all going like this, making the interaction stronger. If we know it's already in a thermagnetic state, thermomagnetic model, then this model does the same thing, right? The Spielance fermion, if you imagine that you have Haniko-Watt, it's Hafen Spielance-Fermion model, then there's a semi-metal to charge density wave transition. And this looks like it's the same thing, realized. So in this regime, In this regime, it looks like the Hubbard model is a contribution. I'm confused about what is the filling in this case? So it's one half. It's the number of electrons is, you know, in this cell, there's one electron. Okay, so I'm going to switch gear, talk about the interacting BM model. I have like no time, right? Model, I have like no time. How how much time do I have? Eight minutes, something actually just technical note. It's not really a C D W, right? Because you're not breaking the translation symmetry of the original Honeycomb islands. It's a C D W. It's a correlated C D W. It's not a density wave, right? Because the unit cell has two sites, so you're just decorating one side versus the other. But the next unit cell is exactly the same. It's a correlated. It's a correlated. So, if you were, so I lied to you a little bit, the plot I made is biased. So, what you really should do in the many-body calculation is you measure a correlation. So, if you are with a chart, if you say, I measure G of R or two body density matrix, what does it look like? You're going to see this triangular structure that if I'm here, my near neighbor, there's one that's empty. The next one is, well, it's lower. The next one is occupied. But if you look at the total density, the density of all six would be uniform. Density, all six will be uniform, because it's a correlated many values. So I don't mean a static charge density move, and that's also the case in the GD honeycomb model, right? If you solve the thing with many methods, you're going to see that the density doesn't recognize a charge variation. It's not a sublex density. But the correlation will be in a correlated solution. Version symmetry not broken? It's not broken in that state. Well, the plot I showed you is broken because, well, there's some technical details, but the state of anybody solution should not. Okay, so I don't have much time, but I'll sketch quickly sort of what we did with the interacting VM model. Thanks to Din and Five. I don't, I mean, it's the same model we're looking at. We are having both valleys, and there's a correction made for the double content. Again, this correction is somewhat ad hoc, and it affects the answer. So, for example, this is kappa is the tunneling ratio thing definition. So, this is chiral, and that's 0.8. And you can see that, so this is the original VM model, the flat band. And after you add this correct. And after you add this correction, those are the things. And then if you solve this whole thing again, the interacting PM model by HATUFARC, you'll get a band structure. And similarly here, so the original bands had now the valid degree. So there's two sets of lines right there. So this is just the band structure so far. But the correction is done with the charge probability. Of the charge would probably be the, I guess, what was referred to as the output. So just to show that, you know, there's just to echo discussions when there's changes. You'll hear one of the subtraction schemes? Yes. Which one? So this is basically taking the NF equals four or Hauptree-Fock solution back density matrix. So we're going to study. So, we're going to study integer fittings for two brown state. And this is similar, very similar parameters to order. So, there's, for example, at least two groups, QMC, QMC studies, and also DMIG quantum chemistry, which is very important, and so on. Same parameters. The reason we're going to use AFQMC, actually, so we could do bigger systems. It doesn't have a, well, it controls the side problem, so we could go off to different things. We don't, we could go off to different fittings and as at the cost of having a fraction calculation. So I don't think I'm going to, so I'm going to fly through this other box, right, really a peak of the FGMC, which is related to basically field theory. It's a Hubberstrom transformation. You decouple a Fourier index, the Fourier interaction term, which I said was hard to treat. You decouple into tensor decomposition. Into tensor decomposition into Oz fields. So basically, then you treat this interaction by integrating over fields. So the idea is that we have this interacting system, which is this abstract thing of electrons living. The dots represent our bases, right? So this could be band, this could be different degrees of freedom. But you think of them as a lattice and then there's interactions. But the interactions can be replaced by external fields. Replaced by an external field, which is observable. When you integrate over the different field configurations, you will cover the many body interactions. So, this part is exact. It says any many-body propagator, two-body interactions, you can write it as a linear combination of independent particle propagators in external fields. You just need to integrate over the fields. The usual QMC doctrine tells you that, well, you could do that, but typically there's a sign problem. If there's no sign problem, it's exact. No sign problem, it's exact. And that's been, I think, for most people thinking about the Diem model or the LADIS models, that's what I think you've heard of, the QMC, that's the doctrine that you've heard of. And I want to say that you need to get rid of this doctrine. Basically, seeking sign problem-free models and optimize the sign is very, very useful when you can. If it's relative to the physics, wonderful, that's too bad. But it has limited applicability in many models, like the album development. You can't transform. You can't transform the sign problem. And if you want to do abolition computations, which is motivated to do that in quantum chemistry, then there's not only a sign but a phase problem you have to deal with. So the idea is you should deal with the sign problem, and you deal with that by understanding, sort of thinking about the right limits. Like, how does the sign problem come out? And if you had the exact wave function, you were an exact density matrix, can you reformulate the money colour so that it's exact? It's exact. And that's sort of these things can tell you. And then you implement this with a trial wave function with a density matrix. And then you self-consistently iterate. You compute something, and then you feed back into your constraint, and you self-consistently iterate. So this is no longer numerically exact, but it's a weak constraint. I can sort of go into details about that now of why it's a weak constraint. There's been lots of benchmarks. This assignment's collaboration in this regard has really been useful. In this regard, it has really been useful. It's done sort of eight years and almost a decade of benchmarking, different methods done. I've done a lot of it on this too. So, this reformulation, basically now we have a field theory, but in reformulated as branching method works in this space. So, that's how we're going to do this. In that formalism, you can see that it does not care what band structure you put in. Unlike the method I talked about before, it relies on this diffusion, so you have to have that sort of a kinetic energy. To have that sort of a kinetic energy to it. This, any one-body thing is easy to do because it's a divergent problem. The two-body requires you to decouple that. So this is the Hautree-Fock energy in a four-wheel chart of neutrality and half. And there's a symmetry in Hawt-tree-fock. It says these two are exactly the same. So it's a spin-polarized KRBC in FO2. And then it's a kind of chemistry job that's spin-polarized. Chemistry job that's been polarized, meaning it just dumped the other species there. The energy per site is the same, or per party is the same. But in QMC, so this is the correlation energy, similar to what Friedman showed. You can see that that's not true. QMC thinks, so when you have a 4, there's a lowering of the energy. So this is the energy lowering. And this little inset shows you the percentage of lowering. So not percentage. Yeah, percentage. Percentage. Yeah, percentage. So actually, by this standard, these things are not weakly correlated because you can't read this, but it says 0.3 or 0.2. So 20% of the energy is correlation. A typical molecule, that percent would be 5 or 2, so in that sense, it's not weakly correlated, but it just on the scale looks very, very small. So it's more correlated and small cataly well, it goes this curve, right? In the middle, it's more correlated. It's more covered. The charge gap, if you compute this, this is a finite system, and then when you extrapolate to a thermodynamic limit, we have 6, 6, and then 99 or something, it's zero in this region. This is consistent with early results. So there's a metal to insulator transition, which is in contradiction, a hot confunction solution. We have two now, there is a sign problem. The result looks very similar. Okay, I need to run. Okay, I need to wrap up. The order parameter vanishes, so this is consistent with how the graph measure this. And this is one. I'm happy to talk to you about the results I'm going to fly through. And just flash this. I told you before, so the Ro-Ray thing is done with the 1 over R, but now we're trying to redo Monte Carlo calculation under this potential. Imagine you have two pieces. So basically, this is. Basically, you know, this is correlation energy. This is how LDA, the thing that, you know, fed into all the density functions here, how that's done, as a function of RS over D, D is the screening size, and then Rs is the density. So you can calculate different RS and get a curve. It's boring work, but by the time you're done, you can fit a form, and then people doing brand structure calculations can use this. There are two limits that are well characterized. One is this RS over D going to infinity. This Rs over D going to infinity, which means it's infinitely strongly sweet. So that you could do perturbative effective field calculations very well. So this limit is tithe. That limit is the electron gas limit, the original two-dimensional electron gas. We also know it very well. And we're going to fit a curve. Basically, we fit these. The lines are a universal fit. They're it doesn't depend on its these parameters. Right now the fit is not very good. We need a better form to come come straight. To come up. Great. Okay, so let me just go here, leave this up there, and stop. Thank you.
