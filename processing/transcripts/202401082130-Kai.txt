Our second talk today is from Wataru Kai, who's going to tell us about linear patterns of prime elements in number fields. Thank you for introduction. And I feel honored to be invited here. I first visited India in 2016, TIFR. And since then, every time I come to India, I Since then, every time I come to India, I feel happy. So, I first explain how I got interested in this specific topic. So, I wanted to generalize the following results, result from the rationals to the case of number fields. The case of number fields number fields or robo got off  So, AX is a variety of a Q and geometrically connected smooth geo equipped with a morphism into P1 that is smooth. Highway geometrically connected. Little bit stronger, but in in practice being a map in  Geometrically connected component. I mean, by the assumption, almost all fibers are geometrically connected already. But those for not geometrically connected, I assume that except for finitely many rational fibers, and there is at least one geometrically connected. That one at least one geometrically connected. I mean, this is smooth. So, I mean, sorry? Yeah, I mean, I mean, let me see. Maybe. I mean, it's connected. It's it's it's smooth, so yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah. So you you can either talk about connected components. Talk about connected components or irreducible components. And those, sorry, and this, so each exceptional ones contains a component, say yi, such that if you take the algebraic closure of the base field inside Of the base field inside its function field, then it's abelian over Q. So that's the assumption and then so I consider So I consider the Adelic points, this is the Adels, and project it down to P1 and it intersects it with the rational points of P1. And this is the subset of a subset of the Brava money set, yeah. The Brava money set vertical. And this is dense. That's the statement. I mean, so everything is a subset of the idyllic points of P1 equipped with the product topology. And I And I define this thing in a minute, but whatever it is, it follows that so when the fibers of relevant fibers of pi satisfies the Hussey principle. Then, yes, supposing that the right-hand side is non-empty vertical. It implies that the left-hand side is non-empty, and that means there is some rational point such that its fiber. That its fiber has an adaptive point, and since I'm assuming that has the principle, it implies that the so that there is a rational point of x-rays. Not necessarily. Exit, not necessarily. Yes, and as was mentioned in Jan Louis's talk, there is another similar and somewhat nicer version of this theorem due to Hartpass and Wittenberg. But I But today I consider this thing, this theorem. I mean, in practice, when you are given a proper smooth thing and has a map into P1, you could do something by taking the smooth locus of the map, because X is not assumed proper. But you need that. Need that smooth work as subject on 2p1 to do anything useful. So the vertical raw group So it depends on X and Pi. So this is the intersection of Brauer group of X and the image of the Borough group of the function field. I mean, you could take the intersection inside the function field of. The function field of x, for example. And this is a smaller group than Brauer group itself. And the diadalic points also go now to the vertical Brawler group. I mean, this has been kind of mentioned already in this workshop, but let me repeat. Workshop, but let me repeat that it's a set of an set of a daily points such that for all brow pass inside the indicated group you could you can restrict it to your You can restrict it to your identity point. And then it's inside the Brawl group of local field. So it's usually isomorphic to Q over Z, and maybe not so for Archimedean. Places are invariant map. And I take the sum, and it should be zero. And it it contains rational points because if it it's a rational point, this is I mean this will be in the Borel group of two independent of the valuation. Of the valuation, and by the reciprocity of Bravo groups, it will be zero. So, that's the statement of the theorem I was interested in. And let me stage how prime elements might be relevant in its proof. So And you you you can you can wonder why this was limited to I mean yeah I mean I have to I have to explain why it was limited to Q. So By the way, it is a conjecture of Kolyotin and Sansuk that for every rationally connected variety of a number field, this implication holds. So, take any analytic point also gonna Also, gonna the Boraba group article and I want to and the form it so so that it lies in um that lies over a rational point. A rational point. I mean, that's the density statement. And they use the non-known structure of the vertical Grava group. Yeah. Maybe I would switch this. And the cake is a very good deal. Module brawl group of Q, this is finite. And we have some explicit description, so more concretely. So I ah, so that KKI, KKI is this. AI is this thing. So I've been an extension of two. So write it as a composite of finitely many cyclic extensions. And then I can consider the cyclic algebra construction associated to I mean, yeah, so to be precise, I choose a generator of the colour group also. And EIE still I EI is so I. So I assume that these things lie over these rational points. And by coordinate change, I can assume that they are not infinity. So this kind of thing defines a grav class on A1. A one minus the point e i I mean because this cyclic const for cyclic const as so this defines some some cyclic cover of what of whatever q scheme. And this thing is an invertible function. If you remove, I mean tt is the remove is the coordinate of A1. If you remove this, this defines an invertible function, so this defines a brows class on that space. So this is P1 schemes and bad fibers of EI so there Yeah, so and I choose a component, and this is over spec of J I and this is a Q point. So these things define well across on this open set, I mean P1 minus infinity minus these finitely many points. Finally, many points. And they pull back to here, open set, and by blah, blah, blah, classes, I mentioned. Mentioned they form some subgroup and this puts suppose back to x minus x1 x t and the five infinity. By the infinity and to make it injective, I take the image and it turns out that maybe, maybe almost by definition. Definition. So, my vertical Brava group is the intersection of these two subgroups. Not by definition, but maybe call call call this open subset U.  And that they use what's called Harari's formalma. So our our point I mean after after some some some root routine small deformation I mean we we can assume that it was in in the open subset U so this into So, this into a small smaller subset perpendicular to the subgroup B this thing has some extra orthogonality to browse elements. Now, so so concretely it says for all i and j if I take the sum of invariants of the blah blah class i j I mean according to the definition I pull back this I pull back this blob across to x and evaluate at it at the point, but alternatively, I can send the point down to p1 and evaluate there. So maybe for pi xv this is zero. Right. And I call it tau v this point, so here which is a point in P1 and I take a large enough set of places S. Yes. So, since there are only finitely many i and j, there is a finite set of places. There is a finite set of places that contains all non-trivial V with non-trivial contribution. And I will enlarge S a little bit later. I mean, I enlarge it is depending on a smooth model of X I mean which I don't make it make it explicit. So now I use the second of green to So now I use the theorem of green tau Ziegler in an adapted form Arepas Korobogat of Wittenberg, which says so there are So the integers there are integers lambda and mu and such that So, if I write tau for the ratio, so this is the rational number, this is arbitrarily close to That even a delic point at those finitely many designated places sorry? Yeah, yeah, sorry, so ta tau, tau, I mean tau. Yeah, thank you, thank you. Yeah, so Yeah, so image of X, which I which I now write how. So technically speaking, I have to specify how close I want this to be, but and so if I take this thing, this element, I mean, this. This element, I mean, this is a priori. Ah, so I enlarge S so that these rational numbers EI all become elements of this ring. And maybe the differences of any two of them are invertible in this ring. So by enlarging guess. But it's technical. So is prime in this ring. So E is prime in this ring. So that's the condition. So those are represented by a prime number prime to those in S. And then, I mean, a cool thing about this argument is that. This argument is that once you use Harare's lemma, so this part, this part, that doesn't depend on X per se. So no X anymore. So this part is written only in terms of numbers and algebraic extensions. So there is no X anymore. No x anymore, and then therefore we can use some abstract statement about numbers. But by class field class field theory computation implies that if this arbitrarily close is really arbitrary, so close, it implies that this prime p1 pi. P one P I split in K one K I yeah yeah yeah this is yeah this is the theorem the theorem continues until here. And by supplementary class field theory computation, it implies that I mean applied to this situation. And they they claim that over this tau we can find an adapt point. So want to show And that they form an idyllic point. So there are three cases. So V is in the finite set that I specified. In this case, I use the approximation. I use the approximation theorem. In I mean P so for any finitely many places I have the density of this inclusion called the So, but by deforming those points that we already have, we can get a point over our tau and the second case is the place of place Vi is I mean, actually, these these PIs I also claim that they are distinct. And the third case is nanogabug. I mean, excuse me, so we need to come. X is so I we took a model the model should have been sorry sorry pp1 p1 of this ring so sorry sorry sorry sorry the x was over p1 of 2 and this model has had to be pp1 p1 of this ring sorry sorry And so, so this is P one of Q and the T one of the the int integer ring looks like this. Like this, and our V is somewhere here, and there are finitely many pad points, and this is our tau. And so we can take closures of these points. And in the first, first, second case, I mean, since tau Since this P P I is lambda minus the one mu I'm up to up to some some it turns out that tau and EI in data closures And data closures intersect over P P I. This is a bad sign. And in the third case, this doesn't happen. So the X tau interacts with the bad, bad fiber. But in either case, the treatment is similar thanks to the fact here. And let me just say that in either. Say that in either case estimate this the fiber of the model, I mean, over this closure has a And if key points are not available I mean, whenever you have uh I mean, whenever you have a geometrically connected smooth scheme over a finite field, this Language estimate says if your field is large enough, so if P is large enough, then you have an FP point. And this can be applied in a straightforward way if this interaction doesn't happen. And if it happens, happens uh you you you use this the this information from this side and and you use the fact that this this this this person and splits so therefore you you have an fb point yes so something like that so what what did did i use which is um Did I use which is specific to the rationals? And that's that's Grita-Ziegler theorem here. So, in order to generalize the HACC principle theorem, we need the following, which I proved last year. So, this is the generalization of muscle sources now. So TK is a number field and you have f f finitely many I mean this this I I stated in in a similar way to the original statement of green table sigma. Statement of green tau silver rather than the adapted one. So some degree one polynomials and I assume that the linear parts, linear parts, pairwise Linearly independent, linearly in with the coefficients in k I can predict when they attain simultaneous prime values. I mean, IAA is a sufficient condition for I mean, I I fix uh basis so so I can I can So, so I can I can talk about the box of certain size inside here. So, vectors in this set such that all of them are prime values. Constant depending on the polynomials and error times a prime number theorem-like term. And where this constant we can show that it's positive if the following holds. So for all prime ideal p, there is a vector x in the residue field. Such that the values are all non-zero in the residue field such that they are all non-zero. Yeah, so that's the theorem. Sorry. No, but this pairwise linear independence is a strong condition. I mean, and also for this to be meaningful, so this last condition has to be satisfied. And I indicate what the different What are different from the proof by Green Tao Ziegler in one board? From From Green Powell Ziegler. And also, there is a simplification of this proof by Tau Ravainen. Which appeared one and a half years ago. About one and a half years ago. So, so I mean, so the details are close to their treatment, but the stage I give here is not so, but for that, it's not so relevant. So, the combinatorial results they used. For subsets in Z, these were not necessarily documented for the abelian group I'm interested in. But it turned out that it's only time consuming to establish these. Consuming to establish these corresponding results for this, this basically because the original results are powerful enough to be a And secondly, so whenever in Z, these two notions are almost the same. But so every time they talk about elements in Z, I mean positive numbers, we have to distinguish whether this role should be played by elements or by ideals. And somewhat miraculously, this separation works. And also, ideas A don't have canonical basis. This is a little problem because uh compilatorial results. Uh, combinatorial results for Zn are usually uh coordinate-dependent. So, if you if you change that coordinates, you you lose some multiplicative constant, you lose track of multiplicative constants, and that's not great. But fortunately, there is a uniform way of choosing bases using the basic geometry of numbers. Geometry of numbers and there is a computerial thing called pseudo-random measure, which enables us to apply those abstract combinatorial additive combinatorial results to prime numbers specifically. Basically, this is from our joint work with my Tohawk colleagues. So, me masa Yoshi no No. I mean, this is this was this was the green tau green tau green tau theorem about arithmetic progressions of prime numbers for four number fields. So those are the differences from they are proof. Proof. And as a corollary, so the theorem that I mentioned first holds for Aripaskorobokatovittenberg holds for the situation where the rationals are replaced by any number field. Hmm Yes, yes yes that that's I all I want to say. Thank you. Thank you very much. Good question. So is there any hope to also get results about values of linear forms represented by norms in this way? So, I mean, after the green tau tiegler theorem, there was the Auticular theorem: there was the work of Tim Browning and Lillian Matheson about values of linear forms represented by norms, which we then used to generalize these results about rational points by keeping the abelianness condition. And again, it was just over Q. So is there any hope to also get this over a number of fields? Yeah, yeah. So while I was working on it, I learned that there are such results. And yeah, I think it's a reasonable project. I think it's a reasonable project to work on. Other questions? Do these things generalize to function fields? Ah, let me see. Yeah, so it's also a reasonable thing. So I yeah, so one has to figure out. One has to figure out. I mean, this algebraic part, there is no problem, seemingly. So, the only thing is that you study the literature and figure out if the corresponding combinatorial results are available. And if not, you have to establish them.
